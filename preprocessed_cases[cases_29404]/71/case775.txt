the defendants in this class action suit have appealed from the district court certification of a plaintiff class.f.the suit,based on section a of the commodity exchange act,a,accuses the defendants,collectively pimco,of having violated section a of the act,a,by cornering a futures market.a corner is a form of monopolization.see united states patten.great western food distributors,brannan,cir peto howell,cir robert kolb james overdahl,understanding futures markets ed a successful effort by a trader or group of traders to influence the price of a futures contract by intentionally acquiring market power in the deliverable supply of the underlying good while simultaneously acquiring a large long futures position.
the class consists of persons who between may and june,bought a futures contract on the chicago board of trade in treasury notes.earlier they had sold such notes short,and the purchases they made between may and june were pursuant to contracts they had with other investors,including pimco,to deliver to a commodity clearinghouse,for those investors accounts,on june,a specified quantity of the notes at the price specified in the futures contracts.with rare exceptions,however,futures speculations are completed not by delivery of the underlying commodity such as milk,or pork bellies,or in this case treasury notes to the clearinghouse,though that is an option,but by the making of offsetting futures contracts,as described in kolb overdahl,supra,at mark powers mark castelino,inside the financial futures markets ed jeffrey williams,the economic function of futures markets james falvey andrew kleit,commodity exchanges and antitrust,berkeley bus,see also reehl,the mathematics of options trading.the following table illustrates the process.
in the example in the table,a short seller,ss,sells a specified quantity of pork bellies to b buyer at a price of for delivery in june hence a june contract.ss hopes the price will fall by then.but before the delivery date arrives the price rises to,and ss decides to cap his losses.the simplest way to do this,as in the table,is for ss to buy from b the same quantity of pork bellies as ss had sold to b,paying.ss now has offsetting contracts to sell and to buy the same number of pork bellies,and b now has offsetting contracts to buy and sell the same number of pork bellies,so neither has a delivery obligation.neither wants to have such an obligation,because both are speculators rather than farmers or meat packers.notice in the table that losses and gains are debited and credited to the traders accounts with the clearinghouse every day,to minimize the risk of loss to the clearinghouse,which guarantees the fulfillment of the futures contract.but this detail plays no role in this case.
changes in the demand for or the supply of the underlying commodity will make the price of a futures contract change over the period in which the contract is in force.if the price rises,the long the buyer benefits,as in our example,and if it falls the short the seller benefits.but a buyer may be able to force up the price by cornering the this case by buying so many june contracts for treasury notes that sellers can fulfill their contractual obligations only by dealing with that buyer.united states patten,supra,at.zimmerman chicago board of trade,cir board of trade sec,cir a person who owns a substantial portion of the long interest near the contract expiration date also obtains control over the supply that the shorts need to meet their obligations.then the long demands delivery,and the price of the commodity skyrockets.it takes time and money to bring additional supplies to the delivery point,and the long can exploit these costs to force the shorts to pay through the nose roberta romano,a thumbnail sketch of derivative securities and their regulation,united states commodity futures trading glossary,www.visited june.
board of trade sec,supra,at,remarks that since the possibility of manipulation comes from the potential imbalance between the deliverable supply and investors contract rights near the expiration date,f inancial futures contracts,which are settled in cash,have no deliverable supply there can never be a mismatch between demand and supply near the expiration,or at any other time.but while it is correct that most financial futures contracts are settled in cash,cftc zelener,cir kolb,supra,at,and that if a cash option exists there is no market to corner no one can corner the money supply,futures contracts traded on the chicago board of trade for treasury notes are an exception they are not cash settled.short sellers who make delivery must do so with approved treasury notes otherwise they must execute offsetting futures contracts.chicago board of trade rulebook,chapter treasury note futures to,www.cmegroup.com rulebook cbot v.pdf visited june,cme group,treasury futures delivery process,ed,w visited june.
the note approved for delivery in this case was the treasury note a treasury note that expires in february.the plaintiffs claim that pimco increased the percentage of these notes that it owned from to percent over a span,with the result that they would have had to pay a monopoly price to get enough notes to close out their contracts.so instead they made offsetting futures contracts,and they claim that as a result they lost more than million,the amount they would have saved had they been able to buy offsetting contracts at a competitive price.these are just allegations we do not vouch for their correctness.
the class certified by the district court consists,as we said,of all persons who between may and june,bought a june contract in order to close out a short position.pimco challenges the definition on the ground that it includes persons who lack standing to sue because they did not lose money in their speculation on the june contract.for example,some of the class members might have taken both short and long positions in order to is,to limit their potential losses and made more money in the long positions by virtue of pimco alleged cornering of the market than they lost in their short positions.the plaintiffs acknowledge this possibility but argue that its significance is best determined at the damages stage of the litigation.if pimco is found to have cornered the market in the june contract,then each member of the class will have to submit a claim for the damages it sustained as a result of the corner.carnegie household int l,cir charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure.some of the class members,discovering that they were not injured at all,will not submit a claim,and others will submit a claim that will be rejected because the claimant can not prove damages,having obtained profits from going long.
pimco argues that before certifying a class the district judge was required to determine which class members had suffered damages.but putting the cart before the horse in that way would vitiate the economies of class action procedure in effect the trial would precede the certification.it is true that injury is a prerequisite to standing.but as long as one member of a certified class has a plausible claim to have suffered damages,the requirement of standing is satisfied.united states parole commission geraghty,d wiesmueller kosobucki,cir.this is true even if the named plaintiff the class representative lacks standing,provided that he can be replaced by a class member who has standing.the named plaintiff who no longer has a stake may not be a suitable class representative,but that is not a matter of jurisdiction and would not disqualify him from continuing as class representative until a more suitable member of the class was found to replace him.id.at.
before a class is certified,it is true,the named plaintiff must have standing,because at that stage no one else has a legally protected interest in maintaining the suit.sosna iowa,d walters edgar,cir murray auslander,cir.and while ordinarily an unchallenged allegation of standing suffices,a colorable challenge requires the plaintiff to meet it rather than stand mute.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.pimco tried to show in the district court that two of t
