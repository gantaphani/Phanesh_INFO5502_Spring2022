introduction 
amdahl corporation amdahl a multinational business,sought a refund of in taxes arising from assessments by the franchise tax board ftb for the tax years,and.in the underlying tax refund action,amdahl alleged that the ftb improperly assessed taxes against it for these years based on its erroneous treatment of dividends distributed by amdahl and subsidiaries.specifically,amdahl claimed that the ftb incorrectly treated tax credit payments from amdahl united kingdom subsidiaries as nondividend income incorrectly computed the inclusion ratio used to determine how much of the income of amdahl foreign subsidiaries should be included in the combined income of the water edge group and incorrectly applied revenue and taxation code sections and to dividends received from amdahl foreign subsidiaries amdahl also alleged that the ftb erred in concluding that its tax refund action,as it relates to tax year,was not timely filed.finally,amdahl claimed that california water edge method of apportioning the combined income of a unitary business group for tax purposes improperly discriminates against foreign subsidiaries in favor of domestic subsidiaries,in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution,art.i.
after the state board of equalization the sbe rejected amdahl arguments,it filed the underlying action in the superior court.the matter was tried to the court largely on stipulated facts.amdahl prevailed on each issue except for its constitutional claim.
we now consider three consolidated appeals.in appeal no,the ftb appeals from the superior court judgment in the underlying action in appeal no,the ftb appeals from a post judgment order granting amdahl attorney fees and in appeal no,amdahl has the constitutional issue.we affirm in all respects.
facts and procedural history 
amdahl,headquartered in sunnyvale,california,is a delaware corporation engaged in the business of providing integrated computer solutions to meet the needs of many of the largest users of information technology in the world.amdahl operates extensively throughout the united states,europe,and asia,often through various subsidiaries and holding companies.
the ftb is the state agency empowered to determine the california tax liability of multistate or multinational corporations,such as amdahl.et the ftb has the authority to audit the operations of such corporations.franchise tax board firestone tire rubber d.
the issues in this case may be more easily understood if amdahl corporate structure and several rather esoteric tax terms are first explained.during through,the tax years at issue,amdahl and its subsidiaries,including amdahl international corporation aic amdahl amdahl international management services aims amdahl ireland,aocc amdahl lease bv and amdahl netherlands bv,were treated as engaged in a single unitary business.see,edison california stores mccolgan cal d.a unitary business has been judicially defined as one in which the following factors are present unity of ownership unity of operations,as evidenced by central accounting,purchasing,advertising,and management divisions and unity of use in a centralized executive force and general system of operation.dental ins.consultants,franchise tax bd.th,d butler brothers mccolgan cal d.a unitary business is one that receives income from or attributable to sources both within and without the state.if a unitary business exists,taxes are apportioned based on property,payroll,and sales to allocate to california for taxation its fair share of the taxable values of the taxpayer butler brothers mccolgan,supra,cal d at.
in,california passed legislation permitting taxpayers to make a water edge election.under the water edge method,qualified taxpayers determine their income derived from or attributable to california by including only a allocation of the income from california and united states based affiliated entities.essentially,california water edge method is an accepted accounting method using the united states as the jurisdictional boundary.thus,generally speaking,the effect of a water edge election is for the taxpayer to account only for the income and apportionment factors of affiliates incorporated in the united states,subject to a number of exceptions for certain types of income produced by foreign affiliates,one of which is at issue in this case.the relevant exception,section,subdivision a,adds to the water edge group a portion of the income and apportionment factors of affiliates that are controlled by foreign corporations cfc if all or part of their income is subpart f income.
subpart f income gets its name from subpart f of the internal revenue code,as defined in code internal revenue section.it includes certain forms of passive income earned by cfc for example,dividends,income from bank accounts,and stock investments.subpart f of the internal revenue code sections was enacted to deter taxpayers from using foreign subsidiary corporations to accumulate earnings in countries that impose no taxes on accumulated earnings.citations.dietz cir.thus,as discussed more fully in a later section of this opinion,under the water edge method of taxation,a portion of the income of cfc that have subpart f income that which is not taxed in the foreign countries in which it is earned is included in the water edge group combined income.
amdahl,as the parent company of its unitary group,made a water edge election effective for each of the tax years at issue,and signed an agreement consenting to taxation under the water edge regime.accordingly,amdahl filed a water edge combined income tax return for each of the relevant tax years that included the combined income of its unitary group members incorporated in the corporation and well as income of its controlled foreign subsidiaries that earned subpart f income.
amdahl objected to certain tax assessments by the ftb for the tax years,and.the ftb rejected those objections.in administrative proceedings,the sbe determined all issues in the ftb favor.having paid the taxes in question,amdahl filed the underlying tax refund action.the action was tried to the court largely on stipulated facts,supplemented by the testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence.
the trial court ruled in amdahl favor on all of the issues in this action,except amdahl constitutional challenge to california treatment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries.consequently,amdahl was awarded tax refunds in the following amounts million for tax year million for tax year and for tax year,for a total judgment of million.this appeal and followed.

as noted,in the earlier administrative proceedings,the sbe determined all issues in the ftb favor.the parties dispute the degree of judicial deference owed to the sbe decision in the underlying litigation between the ftb and amdahl.the legislature has delegated to the sbe the duty of hearing and determining appeals from actions of the ftb.it has been judicially recognized that the sbe has accumulated a body of experience and informed judgment in the administration of the business tax law to which the courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.citation.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.accordingly,the ftb claims we must accord great weight to the sbe interpretation of the statutes and regulations at issue in this litigation.id.at,d.
amdahl claims that the authoritative strength of the sbe decision in this litigation is severely weakened by the fact that in several key issues in this case,the sbe has subsequently reevaluated its position and changed its mind.we agree with amdahl on this point.

characterization of act refund for california tax purposes 
amdahl claims the ftb improperly assessed tax liability arising from refunds of a united kingdom tax called the advance corporation tax act.the ftb characterized the act refunds as nondividend gross income.amdahl position on this issue,which was accepted by trial court,was that the act refunds received by the parent of a subsidiary are dividends for california tax purposes,and are therefore subject to elimination under section or deduction under section,subdivision a.this issue concerns only the amdahl subsidiaries incorporated in the international management services aims and amdahl 
for the tax years relevant here,under tax law,a corporation that paid a dividend to its shareholders was required to pay the act to the taxing authority,inland revenue inland revenue.also under law,the act was deemed an advance payment in partial or full satisfaction of the paying corporation general corporate income tax,and the paying corporation used the act to reduce its corporate tax liability on its taxable profits.the act was also deemed a payment of tax if the recipient of the dividend was a resident.thus,the resident recipient of such a dividend received a tax credit from the taxing authority for the amount of the act payment made by the corporation that related to the dividend received by the resident.the tax credit was refundable to the dividend recipient if the recipient tax owed was less than the credit.
however,under domestic law,the tax credit attached to a dividend paid by a company is not generally available to a shareholder who is not a resident.thus,in the absence of an income tax treaty,a nonresident shareholder of a company receiving a dividend would suffer double in the at the corporate level the act payment,and once in his or her home country at the shareholder level.
effective in,the and the entered into a treaty commonly referred to as the income tax treaty between the united kingdom and the united states united kingdom income tax convention,as amended by an exchange of notes,signed on april,and protocols,signed on,march,and march,eff.april,the tax treaty,which imputes some of the benefits of the system to shareholders.under the tax treaty,the parent corporation will generally be entitled assuming it owns at least percent of the voting stock of the company to a payment from the inland revenue of a tax refund not a tax credit equal to the tax credit which would be received by a individual shareholder,less an amount not exceeding percent of the aggregate of the dividend and the tax credit.
inland revenue has allowed many corporations with shareholders to pay the additional tax refund directly to their shareholders,thereby avoiding the need for the shareholders to claim a refund from inland revenue.under this arrangement,the company also pays a correspondingly lesser amount of the act on the dividend to inland revenue the amount inland revenue would refund directly to the nonresident shareholder under the tax treaty,although the corporation is given credit for the full amount of the act.overall,through the mechanism of the tax treaty,a shareholder of a corporation gains some relief by receiving a tax refund either from inland revenue or the corporation directly for a portion of the act payable by the corporation to inland revenue.
as shown in documentary evidence submitted to the trial court,dividends declared and paid by amdahl subsidiaries,aims and amdahl,triggered an act liability,of which was refunded to aims sole shareholder,aic,a california corporation,pursuant to the terms of the tax treaty.for example,amdahl subsidiaries paid million in dividends to aic in.the act on the million in dividends was.pursuant to established procedures of inland revenue with respect to act refunds,aims actually paid only of the act,or,directly to inland revenue.the other of the act was paid directly by aims to aic,less the percent dividend withholding tax.
amdahl treated the act refund as a dividend from aims to aic on its federal tax returns for and,and the irs accepted such treatment.however,when amdahl treated this act refund as a further dividend from aims to aic in its california water edge combined returns,the ftb took the position that the refunded portion of the act received by aic was nondividend gross income of aic from the government.amdahl asserts that treating the act refund as additional income is inconsistent with the language and purpose of the tax treaty,which clearly mandates that act refunds are to be treated as dividends to the recipient.
the sbe rejected amdahl appeal of the ftb denial of its protest on the act refund issue in april appeal of amdahl,sbe,wl.nevertheless,in september,less than six months later,the sbe reconsidered the identical issue of the treatment of act refunds for california franchise tax purposes in conjunction with another taxpayer appeal and held that such refunds should be characterized as dividends appeal of thomas betts corporation,sbe,wl.this decision certainly represents a reversal by the sbe on this issue.
on balance,we find amdahl argument on this issue is more persuasive.treating the act credit refunds as dividends,as amdahl urges,will effect the purpose of the tax treaty.the salient tax treaty provision,as stipulated by the parties,reads the aggregate of the amount or value of the dividend and the act refund paid by the united kingdom to the united states corporation or other resident without reduction for the or percent deduction,as the case may be,by the united kingdom shall be treated as a dividend for united states tax credit purposes.tax treaty,a iii.as the italicized language indicates,the tax treaty envisions that the act part of the corporate tax would be refunded directly to the shareholder and,for tax purposes,be treated as an additional dividend distribution to be added to the shareholder dividend income.
the ftb emphasizes that california is not bound by the tax treaty pronouncements.see container franchise tax board,d t he tax treaties into which the united states has entered do not generally cover the taxing activities of subnational governmental units such as states.however,the tax treaty characterization of the act refund as additional dividend income to the taxpayer appears to be the result most supported by both the mechanics of the act refund system and california definition of dividend income,which tracks the federal definition.see former and current,both of which directly incorporate the federal definition of dividends from.
we reject the ftb argument that the act refund can not be a california dividend because the refund is a payment from the government and amdahl is not a shareholder in the government.this argument does not withstand close scrutiny because it ignores the government role as that of a or agent that is legally obligated to forward the payment to a third party.in fact,in this case,consistent with its role as an intermediary or agent,the government did not even go through the formality of collecting the full amount of the act from the company,but permitted the act refund payment to be made directly to the parent by the subsidiary.accordingly,we agree with the trial court that the act refunds must be treated as dividends for california tax purposes.
computation of the inclusion ratio 
to determine the includable portion of a cfc subpart f foreign source income in the water edge report,section,subdivision a sets out a computation formula,or what the trial court called the inclusion ratio.in the case of amdahl cfc amdahl ireland,anbv,and aims,the parties are in dispute as to whether or how dividends received by each of these subsidiaries from the corresponding subsidiary aocc,amdahl lease,and amdahl are taken into account in the determination of the inclusion ratio of the subsidiary.the trial court found that in its water edge combined report,amdahl could completely exclude from this ratio the dividends paid out of income already included in the combined income of the group the ftb challenges this conclusion on appeal.
as previously noted,the income of cfc in a water edge group that has subpart f income is potentially subject to california tax.the portion of the cfcs income to be included in the group combined income is determined by the inclusion ratio set forth in section,subdivision a.the inclusion ratio is defined as the following fraction 
cfc subpart f incomecfc earnings and profits 
section,subdivision a defines subpart f income as income defined in section of subpart f of the internal revenue code and earnings and profits as defined in section of the internal revenue code.the resulting fraction may not be less than zero nor more than one.the cfc subsidiary inclusion ratio is then multiplied by its net income to obtain the amount of the cfc income to be included in the water edge group combined income.as the trial court noted,this statutory formulation results in the inclusion of subpart f income,increased or decreased,as the case may be by a share of california adjustments.
the court went on to note that t he issue upon which the parties are in dispute is how to compute the inclusion ratio in the case of a cfc that receives dividends from an affiliate that is also a cfc a subsidiary.the court found that when a cfc receives a dividend that was paid by a cfc out of earnings that were wholly included in the combined income of the water edge group,such dividend is excluded and is not taken into account in applying the inclusion ratio of section,subdivision a to the recipient cfc.while we agree with the trial court result,we do not altogether adopt its reasoning.
as noted,with certain exceptions not relevant here,california incorporates the federal definition of subpart f income though section,subdivision a and california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision d f i.additionally,in determining whether a corporation has subpart f income for a given year,certain federal exclusions and special rules apply,tit,subd.d f iii.in the case of dividends that are received by foreign subsidiaries from lower tier foreign subsidiaries,internal revenue code section b excludes from gross income such dividends to the extent that they are,or have been included in the gross income of a shareholder under subpart under treasury regulations,subpart f income excludes distributions of previously taxed income under internal revenue code section b.cfr b i later renumbered b i.
significantly,both amdahl and the ftb agree that under the foregoing statutory and regulatory scheme,the dividends at issue here are excluded from subpart f income under the federal definition.nevertheless,the ftb argues that t he fact that the dividends would be excluded for federal purposes as a result of the operation of int.code b does not remove them from the subpart f income used to compute the inclusion ratio of the payee under the california revenue and taxation code.the trial court agreed with this portion of the ftb argument,finding that in using the federal definition of subpart f income in int.code,california did not adopt int.code or its principles,and the exclusion in that treasury regulation therefore has no application for california tax purposes.
we disagree with this conclusion.it is clear that california has chosen to measure subpart f income by incorporating the federal standard that implies california willingness to follow the federal lead.in defining subpart f income for purpose of calculating the inclusion ratio defined in section,subdivision a,absent clear language in the statute or in administrative regulations refusing to do so,we may assume california has adopted into its definition of subpart f income the federal exclusions,including distributions of previously taxed income under irc b.cfr b i later renumbered b i.
nevertheless,there is a separate and distinct reason why the dividends at issue here must not be included in the inclusion forbids it.section provided the following for the years at issue in this case in any case in which the tax of a corporation is or has been determined under this chapter with reference to the income and apportionment factors of another corporation with which it is doing or has done a unitary business,all dividends paid by one to another of such corporations shall,to the extent such dividends are paid out of such income of such unitary business,be eliminated from the income of the recipient and shall not be taken into account under section or in any other manner in determining the tax of any such corporation.italics added.
the legislature could hardly have chosen words with a clearer meaning.simply put,section ensures that amounts included in the combined income of a unitary group can be moved in the form of dividends among members of the unitary group without tax consequence.the reason for this is also clear.in a combined unitary group,the subsidiaries apportioned earnings are taxed as income of the unitary business.because the state has already taxed the earnings out of which dividends are paid,the dividends themselves are not subject to taxation.this prevents dividends from subsidiaries from being taxed as earnings of the issuing subsidiary,and once as separate income to the unitary business from receipt of the dividend.
the ftb acknowledges there is no regulation which squarely addresses the question of whether revenue and taxation code section applies in computing the inclusion ratio required by revenue and taxation code section a.nevertheless,by delving into the legislative history and purpose of section,the ftb argues that section was never intended to be applied to the computation of the inclusion ratio,which is merely a measure of how much income of the cfc is included subject to apportionment in the water edge return.in making its point,the ftb emphasizes that section was enacted in,when subpart f income and water edge tax reporting were unknown to the revenue and taxation code.
the ftb has not provided us with a compelling reason to disregard the clear statutory language of section.it is elementary that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.the first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and common sense meaning.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.if there is no ambiguity in the statutory language,a court must presume that the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d.because the language of section is clear and unambiguous,it would be improper for us to refer to extrinsic evidence in an attempt to create an ambiguity from which we could construe the statute to mean something other than what it says.see hartford fire ins.macri cal th,d,solberg superior court cal d,farnow superior court d.a court may not rewrite a law,supply an omission or give words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.
we must also presume that the legislature was well aware of the rules governing intercompany dividends,including section,when it enacted section,subdivision a.see fermino fedco,cal th,d,building industry city of livermore th,d bailey superior court cal d,legislature is presumed to have enacted legislation with existing law in mind.consequently,we assume that at the time it enacted section,subdivision a,the legislature was aware that section made intercompany dividends paid from unitary income nontaxable and provided such dividends shall not be taken into account in any manner in determining the tax of any member of the group.italics added.
for the foregoing reasons,we endorse the trial court conclusion that the legislative scheme contemplates that dividends paid out of unitary income of subsidiaries should be excluded from all the factors used in the computation of the amount included under revenue and taxation code section a that is,such dividends should be excluded from the numerator subpart f income,the denominator earnings and profits and the amount to which the inclusion ratio is applied the income of the controlled foreign corporation.like the trial court,we are persuaded that is the only conclusion possible from the plain and unambiguous language of section.
ordering of distributions 
a question remains,however,as to how dividends received by the unitary group from a cfc should be treated where part of the cfc income is subpart f income and thus included in the unitary group tax return,and some is not.amdahl argued,and the trial court adopted as correct,the view that such dividends should be deemed paid first out of included income.the ftb,on the other hand,claims that the dividend should be prorated between earnings that have been included in the combined income of the water edge group and excluded income.
the importance of this distinction stems from the fact that,generally speaking,section,subdivision a provides that percent of dividends received by the water edge group,and not eliminated by section,can be deductible for purposes of computing the taxable income for the combined report.the ordering determines whether the dividend elimination or dividend deduction provision applies,section percent deduction for earnings previously included in a california combined return or section a percent dividends received deduction.
the superior court decision directs that revenue and taxation code section should be applied to dividends from cfcs that are partially included in the water edge group under rtc a in a manner that deems dividends to be distributed first from income that has already been included in the unitary group,to the extent thereof,and then from the income.consequently,under the superior court ruling,such dividends would be deemed to have been paid first out of already taxed,unitary group income subject to elimination under section,and only after the section income had been exhausted would they be taxed at the percent rate remaining after application of section,subdivision a percent dividends received deduction 
the superior court reached its result in order to harmonize the statutes and avoid constitutional infirmities.the court came to the conclusion that the ftb pro rata ordering of such dividends might raise a constitutional concern about section,subdivision a because the burden on foreign commerce that amdahl alleges is lesser or greater depending on whether dividends are treated as coming first or last from income of the unitary group.
no statute,regulation or other administrative pronouncement provides clear guidance on this question.for and later years,regulations under section,subdivision a provided that dividends paid by partially included corporations would be treated as prorated between amounts eligible for section elimination and amounts eligible for partial deduction under section.however,commencing in,the ftb new unitary combined reporting intercompany transaction regulations seem to indicate that when a dividend is paid out of a mix of previously included and not previously included income,any earnings previously included in the unitary group are deemed to be distributed first,dollar for dollar,tit,f.
in the absence of any clear and controlling guidance on this question,our construction is to favor the taxpayer rather than the government.edison california stores mccolgan cal d.furthermore,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.and,wherever possible,we will interpret a statute as consistent with applicable constitutional provisions,seeking to harmonize constitution and statute.citation.people superior court zamudio cal th,d.
for the reasons indicated above,including those relied on by the trial court,we conclude that dividends paid by subsidiaries from current year earnings should be treated as paid first out of earnings eligible for elimination under section,with any excess paid out of earnings eligible for partial deduction under section.in the case of a cfc that is partially included in a unitary group,the cfc will be able to move amounts that have been included in the combined income of the unitary group without tax incident only by adopting the ordering rule described above.
discriminatory treatment of foreign dividends 
turning to amdahl,appeal no,amdahl argues that section,subdivision a deduction limitation for foreign source dividends unconstitutionally discriminates against foreign commerce in violation of the united states constitution foreign commerce clause.as seen,section,subdivision a provides that dividends received by the water edge group from a foreign subsidiary,to the extent not eliminated by some other provision such as section,are only percent deductible.in its,amdahl claims that similar dividends received from a subsidiary are,through various provisions,percent eliminated or deductible.thus,amdahl alleges that section,subdivision a,to the extent that it taxes foreign subsidiary dividends more heavily than domestic subsidiary dividends,discriminates against foreign commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution.
the trial court rejected amdahl constitutional challenge.among other things,the court pointed out that section,acting in conjunction with section,posits its different treatment of dividends not on whether the dividends are paid from a foreign or domestic subsidiary,but on whether or not the income from which the dividends are paid has been included in the water edge combined report.thus,if a subsidiary dividend has been fully included in the combined report,it is eliminated pursuant to section,whether the subsidiary is foreign or domestic.if the subsidiary dividends are paid out of earnings and profits that have not been included on the combined report,it is nevertheless eligible for the percent dividends received deduction found in section,subdivision a.
consequently,the trial court found that california water edge system actually favors foreign commerce,rather than discriminating against it,because it subjects less of foreign subsidiaries income to tax when compared to domestic subsidiaries.the court reasoned under california law,percent of the income of domestic unitary subsidiaries is included in the combined report,and is subject to interstate and intercorporate apportionment.thus,while the domestic dividends are eliminated by section,the income from which they are paid is included percent on the combined report,which renders that income subject to apportionment and taxation.similarly,foreign source dividends paid from income included on the combined report are eliminated in exactly the same manner as domestic dividends.it is only when the income of a foreign subsidiary has been excluded from the combined report by amdahl water edge election under revenue and taxation code section that dividends paid by a foreign subsidiary are not eliminated by revenue and taxation code section.
the trial court went on to explain,for those dividends not eliminated by,california provides a dividends received deduction under revenue and taxation code section.consequently,the trial court found that california water edge system actually subjected less of a foreign subsidiary income to taxation when compared to that of domestic subsidiaries,which is percent included on the combined report.relying on this reasoning,the ftb argues that section does not discriminate against foreign commerce.we agree.
the united states constitution foreign commerce clause provides that congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,art.i,cl.the term commerce includes the flow of dividends from a foreign subsidiary to its parent company.kraft foods,iowa of revenue and finance,d kraft.
the foreign commerce clause not only grants congress the authority to regulate commerce between the united states and foreign nations,it also directly limits the power of the states to discriminate against foreign commerce.wardair canada florida of revenue,d.this is commonly referred to as the dormant or negative aspect of the foreign commerce clause.the dormant aspect of the foreign commerce clause serves two related purposes.first,it prevents states from promulgating protectionist policies.second,it restrains the states from excessive interference in foreign affairs,which are the domain of the federal government.japan line,county of los angeles,d national foreign trade council natsios.because matters of concern to the entire nation are implicated,the constitutional prohibition against state taxation of foreign commerce is broader than the protection afforded to interstate commerce kraft,supra,at.
the united states supreme court applied these principles in kraft,a case relied upon by amdahl.in kraft,iowa allowed a deduction from base taxable income for dividends paid to a parent company by a domestic subsidiary not doing business in iowa,while it did not allow a deduction from base income for dividends paid to a parent company by a foreign subsidiary not doing business in iowa.the supreme court held that the fact that dividends received from a unitary business foreign subsidiaries were always treated less favorably than dividends received from its domestic subsidiaries constituted an unconstitutional discrimination under the foreign commerce clause.
kraft involved a separate entity tax return of a parent company the court pointed out that iowa was not applying unitary combination.the court wrote an important footnote,as follows if one were to compare the aggregate tax imposed by iowa on a unitary business which included a subsidiary doing business throughout the united states including iowa with the aggregate tax imposed by iowa on a unitary business which included a foreign subsidiary doing business abroad,it would be difficult to say that iowa discriminates against the business with the foreign subsidiary.iowa would tax an apportioned share of the domestic subsidiary entire earnings,but would tax only the amount of the foreign subsidiary earnings paid as a dividend to the parent kraft,supra,at,fn.
relying on this rationale,the ftb argues that the reporting system involved in kraft raises constitutional concerns that are not present under california combined water edge method of apportioning the combined income of a unitary business group for tax purposes.the ftb claims kraft should have no application within a combined unitary group,because each member income and apportionment factors are included in the return equally,regardless of place of incorporation or country of operation.the ftb argument finds substantial support in the case law.
since kraft was issued,several other courts have been asked to determine whether a given state tax system discriminates against foreign commerce in a manner prohibited by kraft.in in re morton thiokol,thiokol,the court limited the holding in kraft to states that do not use a combined water edge or domestic combination reporting method.the thiokol court reasoned that a combined reporting state,water edge does not discriminate against foreign subsidiaries.while the foreign subsidiary dividend payments to the unitary business are taxed,its total income is not included in the unitary business overall income.conversely,while a domestic subsidiary dividend payments to the unitary business is not taxed,its total income is included in the unitary business overall income.thus,no discrimination against foreign commerce occurs.
following the lead of thiokol,the supreme court of maine in du pont de nemours state tax assessor me du pont,held that combined water edge reporting saved the maine income tax statute from the fate of the iowa statute in kraft.the du pont court reasoned far from discriminating against foreign commerce,maine water edge combined reporting method provides a type of taxing symmetry that is not present under the single entity system because the income of the unitary domestic affiliates is included,apportioned,and ultimately directly taxed by maine as part of the parent company income,the inclusion of dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries does not constitute the kind of facial discrimination against foreign commerce that caused the supreme court to invalidate iowa tax scheme in kraft.id.at.
other courts have found the rationale of the thiokol and du pont courts to be persuasive and have determined that the taxation of income is not invalid under kraft where the consolidated or combined methodology is used.see caterpillar,commissioner of revenue interest and royalty payments by foreign subsidiary caterpillar,of admin,interest and royalty payments by foreign subsidiary see also emerson tracy ohio,caterpillar financial services whitley d,dart industries,clark.
we find the rationale of these courts to be persuasive,and hold that california water edge method of apportionment of income does not facially discriminate against foreign commerce.as explained by the trial court,like du pont,in the case of california water edge reporting method,foreign subsidiaries dividends are partially included,while the entirety of domestic subsidiaries income is included,in the water edge combined report in addition,california gives those included foreign subsidiary dividends a dividends received deduction from the water edge group combined income pursuant to revenue and taxation code section.thus,the same kind of taxing symmetry present in du pont is present here.therefore,the holding in kraft does not apply to these facts.we affirm the trial court ruling that california water edge reporting method does not unconstitutionally discriminate against foreign commerce on this basis 
timeliness of action with respect to tax year 
the ftb claims the trial court erred in finding amdahl action seeking a refund for the tax year was timely filed.the statute of limitations applicable to tax refund suits is section,which provides the action shall be filed within four years from the last date prescribed for filing the return or within one year from the date the tax was paid,or within days after a notice of action by the franchise tax board upon any claim for refund,or b final notice of action by the state board of equalization on an appeal from the action of the franchise tax board on a claim for refund,whichever period expires later.relying on section,the ftb argues s ince this action was not filed within days of the sbe april,denial of amdahl appeal,as it relates to taxes,this action is time barred.
in rebuttal,amdahl argues that its claim for refund did not ripen until july,when the ftb formally notified amdahl how it would apply various payments and credits for various tax years to the tax liability.having paid the tax,amdahl filed its administrative claims for refund in a timely manner in two parts on august.
in the administrative proceedings below,the ftb rejected amdahl claim for refund of the tax year based on the assertion that amdahl earlier protest had been converted to a claim for refund three years earlier.the ftb took the position that because the ea
