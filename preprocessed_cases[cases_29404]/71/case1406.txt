the underwriter of an initial public offering of a corporation brought this action for damages against the corporation accounting firm,alleging the firm prepared false and misleading financial and audit reports knowing and intending the underwriter would rely on these reports in agreeing to underwrite the offering.the trial court applied a bily club to the action and sustained the accounting firm demurrer without leave to amend.we reverse.
facts and proceedings below 
the complaint alleges in relevant part 
plaintiff nutmeg securities,nutmeg is in the business of providing financial advice and underwriting for companies going public with their stock through an initial public offering ipo defendant mcgladrey pullen mcgladrey is a firm of certified public accountants which performed accounting and auditing services for american diversified holdings,amdiv in connection with amdiv ipo 
in the fall of mcgladrey and amdiv devised a scheme by which amdiv could launch its ipo based on false information contained in its financial reports at the heart of this scheme was amdiv representation it possessed million in assets derived from the sale of a bearer note mcgladrey participated in this scheme by assisting amdiv to prepare a financial statement showing million in proceeds from the sale of the bearer note without ever properly confirming whether such funds actually existed.later,conducting an independent audit of the very financial records it had participated in preparing,mcgladrey affirmed the existence of the proceeds from the bearer note this affirmation by mcgladrey was false and known by it to be false because mcgladrey had never verified the existence of the bearer note or its proceeds 
mcgladrey also assisted amdiv in preparing and filing other reports with the securities and exchange commission which contained materially false information concerning amdiv financial strength,the state of the company development and its ability to execute its business plan 
in november nutmeg agreed to provide underwriting services to amdiv in connection with amdiv ipo.nutmeg entered into this agreement with amdiv based on the false or misleading financial records and other documents prepared and audited by mcgladrey the false and misleading statements in these documents were material to nutmeg decision to undertake the ipo and were made by mcgladrey with the knowledge and intent nutmeg would rely on them in making its decision.nutmeg did in fact rely on these false and misleading statements in agreeing to assist in amdiv ipo 
while proceeding with the steps necessary for the ipo,nutmeg raised questions about amdiv accounting practices.in response to nutmeg concerns,mcgladrey assisted amdiv in the preparation of a letter assuring nutmeg the statements set forth in the registration statement with the sec that are not legal in nature are true and correct and that there are no omissions or misrepresentations of any material facts contained therein,nor are there any omissions of fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the registration statement not misleading.these statements were untrue and mcgladrey was aware these untrue statements would be communicated to nutmeg,and intended nutmeg to rely upon them 
amdiv subsequently terminated nutmeg services and refused to pay the fees due nutmeg in the sum of approximately this action followed against amdiv,mcgladrey and amdiv attorneys 
mcgladrey demurred to the complaint on the ground nutmeg claim is barred under the decision in bily because nutmeg did not and can not allege it was mcgladrey client,it had any direct contact with mcgladrey concerning any of the matters alleged in the complaint,or that it was an intended recipient of mcgladrey audit reports relating to the financial statements of amdiv.
the trial court sustained mcgladrey demurrer without leave to amend and subsequently entered judgment for mcgladrey.nutmeg filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we note at the outset a rule.when a demurrer to a complaint is sustained without leave to amend the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether,liberally construed,it states a cause of action under any conceivable theory,or could be amended to do so as we shall explain below,the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to nutmeg complaint for three independent reasons.first,nutmeg complaint falls outside bily intended reliance limitation on liability for independent audits because it alleges mcgladrey was more than an independent auditor.in essence,the complaint alleges mcgladrey knowingly assisted amdiv in preparing false or misleading financial reports and then,in an audit of the reports it had prepared,certified those reports as fairly representing the company financial position.second,even under the intended reliance rule in bily,we conclude the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.third,the complaint falls outside the intended reliance rule because it alleges intentional misrepresentation on the part of mcgladrey.intentional misrepresentation is not subject to the intended reliance rule applicable to negligent misrepresentation 
ii.bily limitation on liability for negligent misrepresentation only applies to those conducting independent audits it does not apply to those who prepared the underlying financial reports 
the supreme court began its opinion in bily by stating the issue we granted review to consider whether and to what extent an accountant duty of care in the preparation of an independent audit of a client financial statements extends to persons other than the client.the court explained an audit,for purposes of its opinion is a verification of the financial statements of an entity through an examination of the underlying accounting records and supporting evidence.in an audit,an accountant reviews financial statements prepared by a client and issues an opinion stating whether such statements fairly represent the financial status of the audited entity.an auditor,the court observed,is a watchdog,not a bloodhound as a matter of commercial reality,audits are performed in a environment.the client typically prepares its own financial statements it has direct control over and assumes primary responsibility for their contents because the auditor can not in the time available become an expert in the client business and systems,the client necessarily furnishes the information base for the audit.
given the limited secondary role of the auditor in the financial reporting process the supreme court concluded the auditor liability to third parties also must be limited.otherwise,the auditor would be subjected to professional liability that is distinctly out of proportion to the fault of the auditor and the connection between the auditor conduct and the third party injury accordingly,the court held an auditor liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit of its client financial statements is confined to the client.the court further held an auditor liability to third parties for negligent misrepresentation is confined to those representations made with the intent to induce plaintiff,or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs,to act in reliance upon the representation in a specific transaction,or a specific type of transaction,that the auditor intended to influence.
the limitations bily imposed on auditor liability are not applicable to the present case.here,according to the allegations in the complaint,mcgladrey did not simply conduct an independent audit of amdiv financial statements.rather,mcgladrey participated in the creation of these financial statements 
specifically,the complaint alleges mcgladrey manipulated american diversified financial information as to include as an asset in financials for american diversified for the year end august,the purported proceeds of the sale of the bearer note in an amount in excess of million even though neither mcgladrey nor amdiv attorneys had ever properly verified whether the note existed or whether the proceeds had been received by american diversified.emphasis added.mcgladrey,it is alleged,included the million as an asset of american diversified only after demanding the information and documents,and being threatened with losing the opportunity to remain as american diversified accountants the complaint further alleges mcgladrey assisted amdiv in filing the reports necessary to publicly sell stock in amdiv,which reports included materially false information concerning the financial strength of amdiv 
taking the allegations of the complaint to be true,as we must nutmeg alleges mcgladrey participated in the preparation of amdiv most significant financial records and then conducted a purported independent audit of the records it prepared.under these circumstances mcgladrey is not entitled to the protection from liability to third parties which the supreme court,in bily,extended to independent auditors.mcgladrey role was not secondary,but primary it did not simply review financial statements prepared by a client it prepared the financial statements it reviewed.indeed,under the facts alleged it would be difficult for mcgladrey to claim it conducted an independent audit as the supreme court used that term in bily or to draw a meaningful distinction between mcgladrey audit and its preparation of the financial records 
accordingly,we hold where an outside or independent accountant prepares as well as audits a corporation financial records it is liable for negligent misrepresentation to those third parties who reasonably and foreseeably relied on the financial records,the audit,or both here,nutmeg alleged it relied on both the audit and the underlying financial records 
iii.the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation under the intended reliance rule 
the principal holding in bily is that a third party seeking to recover damages from an independent auditor based on negligent misrepresentations in the audit must plead and prove t he representation was made with the intent to induce plaintiff,or a particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs,to act in reliance upon the representation in a specific transaction,or a specific type of transaction,that defendant intended to influence.under this intended reliance rule,a defendant is deemed to have intended to influence its client transaction with plaintiff whenever defendant knows with substantial certainty that plaintiff,or the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs,will rely on the representation in the course of the transaction.
nutmeg complaint alleges mcgladrey knew and intended nutmeg would rely on mcgladrey audit and other statements regarding amdiv financial condition in agreeing to act as underwriter for amdiv ipo.nutmeg did in fact rely on the audit and other statements by mcgladrey in taking on the amdiv ipo.
these allegations are sufficient under bily to establish a duty of care to nutmeg on the part of mcgladrey.indeed,an auditor liability for negligent misrepresentation does not require proof the audit was intended to influence the particular plaintiff.rather,a complaint for negligent misrepresentation is sufficient if it alleges the audit was intended to influence the particular class of persons to which plaintiff belongs.ipo underwriters are a sufficiently narrow and circumscribed class of persons for purposes of an auditor duty of care under bily.furthermore,mcgladrey is a large and experienced accounting firm and it undoubtedly knew one purpose of its audit was to attract a prestigious investment banker to underwrite amdiv ipo mcgladrey also could reasonably foresee an underwriter would rely upon the representations in its audit report.given the complex nature of the audit function u nderwriters are generally entitled to rely on the auditor expertise.
contrary to mcgladrey argument on appeal,nutmeg was not required to allege amdiv instructed mcgladrey to prepare an audit report specifically for nutmeg,or nutmeg asked mcgladrey to conduct an audit on nutmeg behalf,or nutmeg directly asked mcgladrey about mcgladrey ability to pay nutmeg underwriting fees.all nutmeg needed to allege was mcgladrey knew and intended nutmeg,or the class of ipo underwriters,to rely on its audit report nutmeg complaint made this allegation 
mcgladrey next argues it owed no duty to avoid making negligent misrepresentations to nutmeg because nutmeg is precisely the kind of sophisticated consumer identified in bily as being able to protect itself through private ordering.mcgladrey draws this argument from the supreme court explanation why an auditor is not liable to third parties for general negligence.the court contrasted the powerless consumer in product liability cases to investors,creditors and others who read and rely on audit reports and financial statements and concluded the latter often possess considerable sophistication in analyzing financial information and can privately order the risk of inaccurate financial reporting by contractual agreements with the client or the client auditor or commission its own auditor or investigator the court did not hold or even suggest a plaintiff ability to engage in private ordering precluded it from recovering for negligent misrepresentation if it fell within the limited class of persons to whom an auditor owed a duty of care,those persons whom the auditor knew would rely on its representations in transacting business with its client.rather,the court said no unfairness results to those who are excluded from this limited class because they have other methods of protecting their interests through private ordering.
finally,mcgladrey contends an auditor owes a duty of care only to such third persons as are specifically intended beneficiaries of the audit report who are known to the auditor and for whose benefit it renders the audit report.nutmeg can not recover for negligent misrepresentation,mcgladrey maintains,because the facts pled in the complaint show,as a matter of law,nutmeg was not the specifically intended beneficiary of the audit report nor was the audit report intended to influence nutmeg agreement to underwrite amdiv ipo.nutmeg admits in its complaint amdiv submitted the audit report to the sec as part of amdiv registration requirement under the securities act.the act purpose is to protect investors,not underwriters therefore,mcgladrey concludes,the audit report was intended to benefit or influence investors in their decision whether to purchase shares of amdiv in the ipo,not to benefit or influence an underwriter such as nutmeg in its decision whether to underwrite amdiv ipo.
mcgladrey reads bily too narrowly.it assumes an audit report only can have one intended beneficiary and only can influence one type of transaction.we find nothing in bily to support these assumptions.
as previously noted,the supreme court principal concerns in bily were to avoid limitless liability out of all proportion to the degree of the auditor negligence while holding the auditor liable in situations where it clearly intended to undertake the responsibility of influencing particular business transactions involving third persons.to address these concerns,the court adopted the intended reliance rule from the restatement second of torts.in the court view,the advantage of the restatement rule over a rule of general foreseeability is that the restatement rule gives the commercial supplier of information,an auditor,information as to the nature and scope of the client transactions that may expand the supplier exposure liability.this information is critically important,the court said,because the risk of liability to which the supplier subjects himself by undertaking to give the information is vitally affected by the number and character of the persons,and particularly the nature and the extent of the proposed transaction.if,for example,the client informs the auditor the audit will be used to obtain a bank loan the auditor may be held liable to the lending bank even though the client did not name that specific bank to the auditor and may have submitted the audit to numerous banks in negotiating for a loan if,on the other hand,an accounting firm customarily performs an annual audit of a corporation for no particular purpose but knows the corporation may employ the audit for a wide variety of aims and the audit may be relied upon by a wide variety of persons,the auditor is not liable to a bank which relies on the audit to make a loan to the corporation 
thus,under the restatement rule,as interpreted in bily,liability for an auditor negligent misrepresentation in an audit report is limited to those situations in which the supplier undertakes to supply information to a third party whom it knows is likely to rely on it in a transaction that has sufficiently specific economic parameters to permit the supplier to assess the risk of moving forward.under this test for liability it is immaterial how many classes of persons will be exposed to the audit and how many classes of transactions will be influenced by it,so long as these classes have sufficiently specific parameters to allow the auditor to assess the scope of its liability when it undertakes the audit and thus engage in its own private ordering to manage the risk.
in the present case,the complaint alleges mcgladrey knew it was preparing financial statements and an audit to be used in connection with an ipo and knew nutmeg would be relying on these documents in determining whether to act as underwriter for the offering.bily does not require nutmeg to allege amdiv told mcgladrey the name of the underwriter who would be relying on its reports or allege amdiv specifically told mcgladrey an underwriter would be involved in the ipo.bily only requires mcgladrey knew with substantial certainty nutmeg or the particular class of persons to which nutmeg belongs,underwriters,would rely on the reports in the course of preparing the ipo as previously noted,it can be inferred mcgladrey knew there would be an underwriter for the ipo based on the customary manner in which ipo are generated and mcgladrey experience as a public accounting firm.the fact mcgladrey knew the sec would also rely on the audit report in deciding whether to authorize the ipo does not cancel out mcgladrey liability to nutmeg.
iv.the complaint alleges a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.
the supreme court,in bily,recognized even an independent auditor is not shielded by the intended reliance rule in cases of intentional misrepresentation t he liability of auditors to third parties presents different policy considerations when intentional fraud is involved by joining with its client in an intentional deceit,the auditor thrusts itself into a primary and nefarious role in the transaction.thus,the court held,an independent auditor is subject to liability for representations made with the intent to defraud plaintiff,or a particular class of persons to which the plaintiff belongs,whom defendant intended or reasonably should have foreseen would rely upon the representation.
a complaint for intentional misrepresentation may allege either the auditor actual knowledge of the false or baseless character of its opinion or the auditor had no belief in the truth of the statement,and made it recklessly,without knowing whether it is true or false nutmeg complaint alleges both actual knowledge of falsity and reckless disregard for the truth.
the complaint alleges mcgladrey prepared an audit report for submission as part of amdiv required registration statement with the sec in which mcgladrey stated it had audited the balance sheets of american diversified and its subsidiaries and in our opinion,the consolidated financial statements referred to present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of american diversified and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period indicated in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.this statement was false the audit and the underlying financial reports contained numerous material misstatements and did not fairly represent the financial position of amdiv.among other things,mcgladrey confirmed amdiv assets included million from the proceeds of the sale of a bearer note without ever verifying whether such a bearer note existed or whether amdiv had actually received the proceeds.a t all relevant times,the complaint alleges,mcgladrey was aware that american diversified had no real value or functionality as a company,that any stock of american diversified would be essentially worthless,and that an american diversified ipo could not take place legitimately.
nutmeg further alleges the material misrepresentations and omissions set forth in the complaint were made intentionally recklessly and without reasonable grounds for believing such statements to be true in support of this allegation,nutmeg alleges mcgladrey,in return for the promise of substantial future business from amdiv,agreed to ignore its professional obligations and,without any reasonable basis for doing so,confirmed that the proceeds from the bearer note of approximately million had been correctly stated by american diversified,and that investors and others could have confidence that this asset could and would be available to capitalize the business activities of american diversified.mcgladrey also intentionally manipulated american diversified financial information to include as an asset in financials for american diversified the purported proceeds of the bearer note in an amount in excess of million mcgladrey did so,not in the exercise of its professional responsibilities,but after being threatened with losing the opportunity to remain as american diversified accountants 
the complaint alleges mcgladrey false and misleading statements were made with the intent that nutmeg rely upon them and nutmeg did in fact rely upon the representations of mcgladrey and proceeded to act as american diversified financial advisor,incurring fees and expenses in the process.
after nutmeg agreed to act as underwriter for amdiv ipo it raised questions regarding some of amdiv accounting practices.in response to these inquiries and to thwart the discovery of their scheme and misrepresentations defendants,including mcgladrey,assisted american diversified in preparing a modification to its contract with nutmeg which represented and warranted that the statements set forth in the registration statement filed with the sec that are not legal in nature are true and correct 
the complaint alleges a cause of action for intentional misrepresentation.mcgladrey represented amdiv financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and confirmed the existence of million in assets representing the proceeds from the sale of a bearer note.the first statement was false because mcgladrey did not follow generally accepted accounting principles in confirming the existence of the million.as a result the second statement could not have been made with a good faith belief in its truth but rather was made recklessly without knowing whether it was true or false it is alleged mcgladrey made the representations with the specific intent to defraud nutmeg and nutmeg relied on those representations.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.appellant is awarded its costs on appeal.
see bily arthur young cal th,d,hereafter bily.in bily,our supreme court held an accounting firm could never be liable to third parties for simple negligence in preparing an independent audit of a client financial statements.id.at,d.the court did agree,however,an accounting firm may be held liable for negligent misrepresentations in an audit report to those persons who act in reliance upon those misrepresentations in a transaction which the auditor intended to influence.ibid.later in this opinion,we will refer to this as the intended reliance rule.the court also held an accounting firm may be held liable to reasonably foreseeable third persons for intentional fraud in the preparation and dissemination of an audit report.ibid.
