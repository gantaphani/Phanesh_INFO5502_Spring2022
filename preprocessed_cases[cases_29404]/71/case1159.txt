the sec filed a complaint against val southwick and a variety of companies he controlled vescor capital vescor capital,vescorp capital,llc,vescorp capital,llc vescorp capital,llc together vescor,alleging that southwick operated a massive ponzi scheme that defrauded several hundred investors of approximately million.soon thereafter,the sec sought and obtained the appointment of a receiver to manage and control all assets as well as any other entity directly or indirectly controlled by southwick.a group of investors,which included heritage capital management,llc covenant bancorp,covenant capital,llc heritage orcas partners,lp heritage orcas vl partners,lp and boundary bay capital,llc collectively,the covenant group had advanced over million to various entities,and were caught within the receiver wide net.the district court granted a stay of all actions related to property in the receivership estate.
contending that it held liens on property within the receivership estate,covenant group requested the district court lift the stay and allow covenant group to foreclose on its property and certain unrelated state tort litigation to proceed.the district court denied the lifting of the stay as to the covenant group property and allowed the modification as to the state tort litigation.the covenant group appeals the district court refusal to lift the stay.having jurisdiction under a,we affirm the district court ruling and hold that the district court acted well within its equitable powers and discretion in denying the covenant group motion to lift the stay.
background 
on february,the sec issued an enforcement action alleging that southwick,through vescor,violated federal securities laws by selling unregistered notes and other securities to finance various real estate projects.on may,the district court,pursuant to.and its general equitable jurisdiction,appointed robert wing as vescor receiver.the order empowered the receiver to take control of vescor funds,assets and property wherever situated.aplts app.vol.i,at.
long before the creation of this receivership,from,the covenant group loaned over million to entities related to vescor.the loans related to nine separate real properties in nevada the nevada properties,located near las vegas.the covenant group maintains that it is one of the secured lenders in these nevada properties.according to the covenant group,each loan was fully secured by collateral through an assignment of a fractional share in a recorded deed of trust.id.at.covenant group serves as the loan manager,managing the loan for the fractional interest holders.after the loans on the nevada properties went into default,the covenant group,as loan manager,instituted proceedings to foreclose on the liens.these proceedings were stayed upon the district court may,appointment of wing as receiver.
on july,after receiving notification of the inclusion of the nevada properties in the receivership,the covenant group filed its motion to clarify the scope of the stay,and,if necessary,to lift the stay,with respect to litigation ensuing in nevada and the nevada properties.in the motion to lift the stay,the covenant group argued that the nevada properties are not sufficiently related to the vescor proceedings to justify their inclusion in the corpus of the receivership,and in turn,that the receivership should not preclude the covenant group foreclosure proceedings.id.at.because the receiver can not make a defensible claim of any value to the completely encumbered real property subject to foreclosures,staying those proceedings is an unduly broad application for the receivership order.id.
in response,the receiver pointed out that his focus,which tracks the district court purpose in the appointment of a receiver,is to marshal and safeguard the disputed assets,ensure the proper administration of that property,and achieve a final equitable distribution of the assets if necessary.id.at.the receiver had recently taken possession of extensive records and files,issued many subpoenas,and was reviewing,gathering and evaluating the multitude of transactions underlying the vescor properties.
after an october,hearing,the district court issued an order that concluded the receiver 
is authorized to market any real property held by the estate,subject to the obligations under,which allow,among other things,for interested parties to make an objection to any proposed sale.if any sale is approved by the court,all of the liens on the real property shall attach to the proceeds of the sale.the validity and priority of these liens will be determined at a later time by the court.
id.vol.ii,at order,filed.the district court denied the motion to lift the stay 
ii.discussion 
on appeal,covenant group raises two arguments.first,it argues that the district court exceeded its equitable powers when it put the stay in place.second,it maintains that the receiver showed no compelling justification to maintain the stay with respect to its secured liens in the nevada properties.we reject both arguments.
a.the district court did not exceed its equitable powers when it ordered the stay.
the jurisdictional limits to the district court power in equity receivership proceedings are issues of law,reviewed de novo.am.capital,cir,abrogated on other grounds by steel citizens for a better env t,d.covenant group first argues that the district court,while endowed with considerable equitable powers in administering a federal receivership,has ignored the general rules governing receiverships,and the property laws underlying them.aplts br.at.specifically,it argues that,as the holder of valid liens and as a secured creditor,it is entitled to different and more favorable treatment,than that given to unsecured creditors.second,covenant group contends that as a policy matter,punish ing those with recorded security interests will inhibit future lending secured by real property.id.at.covenant group argues that the receiver arguments are inconsistent,as the receiver moved to relinquish two properties held by another secured creditor,and that this further undermines any policy decision.
a brief history of the development of the district court equitable powers in this area will help set the scene.under the judiciary act of,congress gave the lower federal courts original jurisdiction of all suits in equity,where the other jurisdictional requisites are satisfied.from the beginning,the phrase suits in equity has been understood to refer to suits in which relief is sought according to the principles applied by the english court of chancery before,as they have been developed in the federal courts.gordon washington.as justice scalia has noted,however,the equitable powers conferred by the judiciary act of did not include the power to create remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence.grupo mexicano de desarrollo alliance bond,d.
given this backdrop,we look to the federal rules of civil procedure,which gives the district court summary jurisdiction over all the receivership proceedings 
these rules govern an action in which the appointment of a receiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued.but the practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar officer must accord with the historical practice in federal courts or with a local rule.an action in which a receiver has been appointed may be dismissed only by court order.
rule does not provide specific instructions to receivers on how to administer or manage the receivership estate.rather,rule instructs receivers to follow traditional equity practice or local rules where they exist for administrative matters like the procedure for disposing of or distributing assets.by statute,congress has instructed federal receivers to manage receivership property according to the law of the state where the property is located.b receiver must manage and operate the property in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do under applicable state law.
it is generally recognized that the district court has broad powers and wide discretion to determine relief in an equity receivership.sec safety fin,cir quoting sec lincoln thrift ass n,cir.this d
