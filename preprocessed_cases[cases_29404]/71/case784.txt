jack katz proposes to represent a class of persons who contributed real property or interests in real property to the archstone real estate investment trust,in exchange for interests called units.in archstone merged into partnership.holders of units were offered a choice of cash or series o preferred units in the entity formed by the merger.katz contends that the merger violated the terms of the units,because neither cash nor the series o preferred units offered investors the same tax benefits as units.after a majority of investors approved the merger,however,katz took the cash and filed this suit in a state court against archstone,lehman brothers,tishman speyer development,and their managers.
defendant removed this suit to federal court under the class action fairness act of.it comes within federal jurisdiction not only because the complaint rests on a federal statute but also because katz has citizenship different from some of the defendants,the proposed class contains more than members,and the stakes exceed million.d.the district court remanded it to state court after concluding that removal is forbidden by a of the securities act of,a.see wl,dist.lexis.one might suppose that a statute enacted in supersedes a statute enacted in,but the district court held that a controls because it is more specific than the a deals only with securities litigation,while the act covers class actions in many substantive fields.defendants have applied under c for permission to appeal.see also spivey vertrue,cir.we grant that application and proceed immediately to decision,because the papers filed at the motion stage address the merits too.
only purchasers of securities may pursue actions under the act,see gustafson alloyd,d,yet katz and other members of his class sold their securities for cash.the securities exchange act of permits suits by sellers as well as buyers,but it lacks a provision equivalent to a.katz depicts himself as a buyer by characterizing the supposed failure to honor the terms of the units as if he had sold those securities and bought what katz calls new units,which he then sold for cash.a purchase of new units would have been involuntary,but an involuntary purchase is still a purchase.see sec national securities,d.
what katz calls the fundamental change doctrine that turns a sale into a purchase is word play designed to overcome the actual text of the securities laws,and this circuit follows the statutes rather than trying to evade them with legal fictions.see sec jakubowski,cir isquith caremark international,cir.katz sold his units for cash he did not buy any new security.the new units are figments of a lawyer imagination.using legally fictitious and factually nonexistent new units to nullify a legislative decision that only buyers have rights under the act would be wholly unjustified.
substantive objections to the terms of corporate mergers arise under state law both contract law and corporate law rather than federal securities law.santa fe industries,green,d.and although any material falsehoods or omissions in the registration statement or prospectus for the series o preferred units could give rise to a claim under federal law,that claim would belong to the sec,or the buyers of the units,rather than someone such as katz who did not purchase them.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.
the district court acknowledged some of these problems but thought them irrelevant to the propriety of removal.it is enough,in the district court view,that the complaint filed in state court invokes the securities act of.that alone forecloses removal if katz lacks a securities claim,he will lose on the merits in state court,the district judge concluded.
it is hard to distinguish between a claim artfully designed to defeat federal jurisdiction and one that is properly pleaded but unsuccessful on the merits,but it can not be right to say that a pleader choice of language always defeats removal.if it did,then katz could have pleaded a breach of contract,or a violation of duties under corporate law,and added this is a workers compensation suit that can not be removed as a result of c.a pleader can not block removal by specifying inapplicable legal as,for example,an assertion that a pension claim arises under state contract or trust law rather than erisa.see bartholet reishauer z√ºrich,cir.a complaint pleads grievances rather than law a federal court must decide for itself the claim legal classification.this is true whether the pleader tries to get into federal court by insisting that a claim really arises under federal law,or to stay out by declaring that a claim arising under federal law really depends on state law alone.
katz citation to the act is not quite as bald a maneuver as a contention that his grievance is a workers compensation claim,or the assertion in bartholet that an effort to obtain benefits from a pension or welfare trust was nothing but a contract claim.the merger led to the registration and issuance of series o preferred units,so federal securities law has some role to we know from decisions such as merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,d,that it is possible for a private party to suffer an injury covered by the securities laws even though there is no private right of action to vindicate the investor entitlements.so we think it best to assume that katz complaint is not just artful pleading,and to ask whether a insulates all claims under the act from removal under the act.
section a provides in part except as provided in section c of this title,no case arising under this subchapter and brought in any state court of competent jurisdiction shall be removed to any court of the united states.section c,c,which was added by the securities litigation uniform standards act of,permits the removal of many securities class actions dabit describes the scope of the act.in the district court katz argued that his suit is not a covered class action within the scope of the act and therefore may not be removed.defendants replied that the act applies to all civil actions,with a few defined exceptions,and that as katz suit is not among the exceptions it must be removable.
section a and the act are incompatible one or the other must yield.usually the older law yields to the newer.luther countrywide home loans servicing lp,cir,holds that things are otherwise for a,however,because radzanower touche ross,d,says that an older law maintains its vitality when it is more specific than a newer one.section a covers only securities suits and thus is more specific than the act,which applies to all civil actions,the ninth circuit believed.the district court in this suit agreed.
the canon favoring preservation of specific statutes arguably affected by newer,but more general,statutes works when one statute is a subset of the other.for example,if the act dealt with all civil suits,then a law applicable only to civil securities actions would be more specific.but a of the act is not a subset of the act.section a covers only securities actions,but it includes all securities suits as well as class actions,small class actions as well as large ones.the act,by contrast,covers only large,class actions.is the act more specific because it deals only with securities law,or is the act more specific because it deals only with nationwide class actions there is no answer to such a question,which means that the canon favoring the specific law over the general one wo solve our problem.california public employees retirement system worldcom,cir holding,for this reason among others,that the specificity canon does not prevent the provision,from superseding a of the act to the extent of any inconsistency.
the language of the act,rather than a canon,tells us how the new removal rule applies to corporate and securities actions.section b allows removal of any class action brought within federal jurisdiction by d,and d adds 
d this section shall not apply to any class action that solely involves 
a claim concerning a covered security as defined under section f of the securities act of f and section f e of the securities exchange act of f e 
a claim that relates to the internal affairs or governance
