in,emergency room physicians biren,kenneth corre,emanuel gordon,david kalmanson,and michael vitullo formed equality emergency group,to provide emergency room services to hospitals under contract.each physician owned percent of the corporation shares,was a member of the board of directors,and served as a corporate officer.in,biren became the chief financial officer and later assumed responsibility for oversight of patient billing.in,the physicians formed,to segregate accounting and billing for simi valley hospital from other hospitals that equality serviced.the shareholder physicians treated the two corporations as one business.
on november,the five physicians entered into a written agreement detailing their relationship and governing management of equality.paragraph of the agreement provided the following corporate actions shall require the prior written consent of shareholders holding a majority of shares entitled to vote on matters affecting the corporation ii entry into contracts for the provision of the following services to the corporation billing.
shortly thereafter,the shareholders amended paragraph to delete the formality of a writing.the amendment conformed to the shareholders practice of voting orally on important matters,including engaging a billing company.although paragraph of the agreement required amendments to be in writing,the shareholders did not execute a written amendment.
in,equality transferred its patient and insurance billing to gottlieb financial services gottlieb in florida.timely and accurate billing of equality physician services was vital to the cash flow and profitability of the business,which employed other physicians and office personnel.at trial,expert witness daryl favale testified that huge and not insignificant differences exist among billing companies and that performances can be off percent,percent.
in early,biren learned that gottlieb had fallen significantly behind in billing for equality.biren and equality office manager,liz lopez,met with gottlieb,randy wilson,to discuss the problem.wilson assured them that gottlieb was going to turn the backlog around by adding employees to service the equality account and by opening an office on the west coast.
nevertheless,the billing situation did not improve and in june biren ceased sending patient charts to gottlieb because it was so far behind.lopez investigated other billing companies to brainstorm a resolution to the billing standstill.
in,biren and lopez learned that gottlieb completely stopped billing for equality.lopez telephoned gottlieb employees david imler and sharon sing and learned that gottlieb had reassigned employees to other accounts.moreover,due to management problems,there occurred a mass exodus of gottlieb employees.lopez again investigated other billing companies but was unable to locate one that could immediately process equality billing.
biren and lopez also consulted michael weitz,a santa monica physician,who was experiencing similar billing problems with gottlieb.weitz stated that he was pretty sure that he would transfer his billing matters to physician and hospital support services,phss,a company created by former gottlieb employee sharon sing.weitz informed lopez that he had checked references regarding sing and received a solid recommendation.lopez also contacted gottlieb wilson and obtained a positive reference concerning sing.
on august,biren terminated gottlieb and orally authorized phss to process equality billing.she stated to lopez that it was an emergency crisis situation and as cfo it was her fiduciary responsibility to maintain the financial stability of the business and make a quick and emergency decision.biren did not obtain prior shareholder approval for terminating gottlieb and contracting with phss she stated that she acted alone because the other directors were either on vacation or otherwise unavailable.
sing represented to biren that phss was employing former gottlieb employees and that it would process equality billing within five days of receipt of patient charts.
biren promptly notified gordon and kalmanson of the change of billing companies.to her,they expressed no opposition and therefore she believed they had no objection to her actions.she mistakenly believed that she had the authority to contract on behalf of equality.on february,without consulting the other shareholders,biren executed a written contract with phss.
in time,phss performance suffered,in part due to disagreements with equality regarding documentation and insurance billing coding.equality soon suffered cash flow problems and in november it dismissed phss as its billing company.
on november,a majority of equality directors and shareholders voted to remove biren as an officer and director and to redeem her shares for contracting with phss without prior shareholder approval,among other things.the directors relied upon paragraph of the agreement regarding the necessity for shareholder consent to billing contracts and paragraph regarding a shareholder material breach of the agreement.
biren demanded that equality purchase her corporate shares at fair market value.equality refused and offered to redeem the shares at book value as described in paragraph of the agreement.
biren then brought an action against equality and its shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and declaratory relief,among other causes of action.equality for damages for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence and declaratory relief.a court trial followed after biren rejected equality offer to compromise.
at trial,equality expert witness daryl favale opined that phss billing inefficiencies caused equality more than million in lost profits.billing deficiencies included undercoding patient services and lack of collection efforts.favale could not allocate the portion of the million loss that resulted from undercoding services.when the court asked favale what portion of the million loss was caused by phss undercoding,he said he lacked the ability to answer that question.
biren also did not pay contributions to equality pension plan when due.as a result,equality paid interest and late fees totaling.accounting expert barbara roller testified that biren received months notice of the amount of contributions due.she opined that biren could have divided the amount by and then saved enough cash each month to meet the obligation.

discussion 
equality appealbiren breach of the agreement and the business judgment rule 
equality contends the trial court findings establish that biren breached the agreement and her fiduciary duties as a director and officer of equality.it argues that she violated her fiduciary duties by unilaterally dismissing gottlieb and contracting with phss,and not notifying the equality shareholders and directors of the phss contracts and gottlieb performance.
the court finding that biren reasonably relied on information she believed to be correct was tantamount to a finding she acted in good faith.biren learned that gottlieb had stopped billing,which in turn affected equality cash flow and payroll.lopez told biren that she learned of a mass exodus of gottlieb employees and that gottlieb would not commit to catch up on months of delayed billings.she learned from weitz that his office was experiencing similar billing problems with gottlieb.from this evidence,the court could find that biren reasonably believed gottlieb could not service the accounts.moreover,because weitz advised her that sing had strong references the court could find that biren reasonably believed that phss could service them.
a director is not liable for a mistake in business judgment which is made in good faith and in what he or she believes to be the best interests of the corporation barnes state farm mut.automobile ins.th,d.the business judgment rule sets up a presumption that directors decisions are made in good faith lee interinsurance exchange th,d,italics omitted.
equality argues that assuming biren good faith,the business judgment rule does not protect her because she did not obtain board approval prior to engaging phss.but the business judgment rule protect s directors who are misinformed,misguided,and honestly mistaken.castetter cir.her breach of the agreement resulted from her mistaken belief that as a director and officer she had the authority to act on behalf of equality.she stated to office assistant lopez that it was an emergency crisis situation and as cfo it was her fiduciary responsibility to maintain the financial stability of the business and make a quick and emergency decision.that biren violated the agreement by not obtaining prior board approval for the billing contract did not by itself make the business judgment rule inapplicable.benson,alleged that directors allowed officers to make improper loans without obtaining the required board approval.but directors were protected by the business judgment rule unless they knew their acts were illegal or they knowingly committed acts outside the scope of their authority fletcher,cyc.perm.ed supp.at.
larger corporations often have formal board committees to recommend the approval of a variety of contracts.but small corporations like equality conduct much of their official business informally.see friedman,cal.practice guide corporations the rutter group,subd.e.i t is well known that corporations which include only a few shareholders do not often act with as much formality as larger companies.this is especially so where the members of the board personally conduct the business of the corporation.fletcher,cyc.perm.ed,fn.omitted.the practice of allowing officers to approve contracts is so prevalent in some close corporations,for example,that they bind the entity even though the officer should have obtained board approval.fletcher,cyc,supra.
equality was a small corporation run informally by physicians who themselves worked shifts in hospital emergency rooms.the agreement states equality was a close corporation,although it did not comply with the requirements to establish a close corporation.it delegated most of the billing responsibility to biren,who relied upon equality office personnel.unlike larger corporations,there were no distinct lines between management levels.biren was given a large responsibility and equality did not prove she intentionally usurped her authority.benson,supra.at.the court could reasonably infer that biren remained within the protection of the business judgment rule because equality did not prove her actions were anything more than an honest mistake.lee interinsurance exchange,supra,th at,d.
citing castetter,supra,at page,equality states the business judgment rule does not protect a director where there is a conflict of interest,fraud,oppression,or corruption.true,but no such evidence exists here.
although biren should have brought the matter to the directors for approval,this does not mean she acted in bad faith.biren testified the other directors were either unavailable or on vacation.months earlier,when gottlieb wilson invited equality directors to discuss billing problems,only biren attended.she was the director responsible for billing matters.she believed it was her duty to promptly change billing companies to protect the corporation.the trial court could reasonably infer that she mistakenly believed it was in the best interest of the corporation that she act with alacrity because the other directors could not.
relying on gaillard natomas d,equality contends the business judgment rule does not protect biren,as she abdicated her corporate responsibilities.in gaillard,directors were not immune where they approved golden parachutes for executives.the evidence supported an inference that they approved excessive compensation,violated tax laws,and ignored evidence of.the court reference to abdication described directors who close their eyes to the conduct of the business of the corporation id.at.
but biren eyes were wide open to a financial crisis she tried to resolve.moreover,she did not receive personal financial benefit by dismissing gottlieb and contracting with phss.there was no evidence of,illegality,or abdication.application of the standards of fairness and good faith required of a fiduciary is a factual question for the trier of fact not subject to independent review.tenzer superscope,cal d.
