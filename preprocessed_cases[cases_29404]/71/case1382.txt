employee shareholders of a corporation transferred ownership of the shares of a former employee to themselves just before a merger that significantly increased the value of the corporate shares.the acquiring shareholders claimed they purchased the shares pursuant to an employee shareholder agreement entitling them to acquisition at book value.a jury found that any right to purchase shares at book value pursuant to the agreement was either held by the corporation alone,not the shareholders,or had elapsed before the alleged right was exercised.
the jury awarded the former employee million in compensatory damages upon concluding that no contractual right to purchase the shares had existed,and that the transfer of shares occurred with nondisclosure of the pending merger.the jury returned a verdict finding breach of contract,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,conversion,and violations of the california corporations code.additionally,a bench trial following the jury verdict determined that the corporation management breached their fiduciary duty by withholding information from the former employee,who had remained a corporate shareholder.in addition to the compensatory damages award,the court awarded the former employee over million in costs and attorney fees.
this appeal followed,along with a by the prevailing former employee who challenges an adverse summary adjudication of his punitive damages claim and seeks remand for trial on punitive damages alone.we reject most of the contentions on both the appeal and,and affirm the judgment except for modifications in the cost award and one statutory claim.
factsa.corporate formation.
defendant semiconductor systems,ssi built and sold equipment used in manufacturing computer semiconductor chips.ssi was formed in as an,corporation.plaintiff eric hsu was a founder,officer,director,and the largest shareholder of ssi,eventually holding percent ownership defendants michael parodi,gerald masterson,and douglas amis were also founders,officers,directors,and major shareholders collectively,management defendants hsu was ssi of sales and marketing parodi was initially of engineering and succeeded to the post of president and chairman of the board of directors masterson was of finance,chief financial officer cfo,and secretary to the board and amis was vice president of human resources.
ssi was formed through a management buyout of an existing corporation.management borrowed the purchase money and,in conjunction with that loan,hsu pledged his ssi stock as security for repayment and delivered his share certificate to the lender.the security pledge agreement was also accompanied by a blank form assignment of all ssi shares hsu might acquire,to be used by the lender if ssi defaulted on its loan.the pledge agreement provided that it would terminate upon repayment of the loan,and promised that the share certificate and stock assignment would then be returned to hsu.the loan was repaid in less than two years,and the lender delivered the share certificates and stock assignments to ssi.however,ssi did not forward those share certificates to hsu or the other shareholders,but retained them.
employee stock purchase and shareholder agreement.
meanwhile,each of the shareholders had signed an employee stock purchase and shareholder agreement agreement upon formation of ssi that restricted disposition of shares a shareholder could not sell his or her shares without first giving ssi an opportunity to purchase the shares itself or,failing such an election,giving the other shareholders an opportunity to purchase the shares.there is also a purchase right if the leaves the company,although whether that right inures to the benefit of ssi alone,or to shareholders as well,is a point of contention.it is clear,however,that any right to purchase shares of a departing employee is a right,not an obligation.if the purchase right under the agreement is not exercised,the departing employee may keep the shares.
the right to purchase is also strictly limited in time and commences upon the cessation of the share purchaser employment.the corporation right to purchase a departing employee shares must be exercised within days of cessation of employment or within days after the corporation receipt of the departing shareholder written notice of cessation of employment,whichever is later.assuming the shareholders have a right to purchase a departing employee shares if the corporation does not opt to purchase,then the corporation has seven days after termination of its option to buy to notify the shareholders of the availability of the shares and the shareholders have seven days from their receipt of notice to elect a purchase.shares purchased from a departing employee are bought at book value the portion of undistributed corporate profits.
hsu departure from ssi.
hsu left ssi in the summer of.the exact date of hsu cessation of employment,which triggered the right to buy hsu shares,is disputed.defendants maintain that hsu cessation of employment coincided with his august,notice of resignation.plaintiff hsu maintains that his cessation of employment occurred when he left the company on july,for a leave of absence that was,in reality,a termination.
at trial,hsu testified that he was offered an executive position at kla instruments corporation kla in taiwan,and advised parodi and amis,ssi president and of human resources,of his decision to accept the position over lunch on june.hsu told the ssi executives that he would like to take a leave of absence,rather than to resign immediately,to blunt the impact of his departure for the company benefit.hsu also wanted leisure time with his family before relocating to taiwan.however,hsu testified at trial that he clearly told the ssi executives that he would not return to ssi after his leave of absence.amis journal entry for june,is corroborative,though more equivocal than hsu testimony.amis wrote that hsu informed ssi that hsu wants to take a and probably will not return to the company.parodi conceded at trial that ssi management expectation was that hsu would not return from the leave of absence.
the testimony of hsu and parodi is consistent in establishing that parodi asked hsu not to announce his leave of absence until after an important industry conference in.hsu agreed to limit his announcement to a few people,and told only cfo masterson,certain ssi sales personnel,and a couple of customer contacts before the july conference.one of those ssi sales personnel,defendant fey,corroborated the fact that hsu announced to some members of the ssi sales staff before the july conference that hsu was leaving the company.fey understood that hsu would not be returning as an employee.
hsu testified that he made a general announcement to his sales and marketing department on july,the last day of the industry conference,that he was taking a leave of absence,at the completion of which he would not return to ssi but would instead work at kla.hsu completed a form request for leave of absence covering the period from july,to september,using dates hsu said ssi amis told him to use.hsu testified that he told ssi human resources department,when completing the form,that he was taking a month leave of absence and then would start work at kla.hsu salary and medical insurance were terminated at the start of his leave of absence.
hsu physically left ssi on friday,july.hsu testified that he packed and removed his personal belongings and returned his security badge.hsu had planned to start work at kla in september,after time off from work,but instead started at kla on the following monday,july.hsu initially worked for kla in the san francisco bay area,and then split time between california and taiwan.
the journal entries of ssi management following hsu physical departure indicate that management understood that eric hsu was not returning.amis,the vice president of human resources,may have begun efforts to replace hsu as of sales and marketing.amis journal entry on his task list for august,states search of vp sales.on that same day,cfo masterson task list includes the notation get eric off records.
on august,hsu faxed notice of resignation to ssi management,parodi,masterson,and amis.hsu wrote this memo is to inform you regarding my resignation,from the position of vice president of sales and marketing at semiconductor systems start this date.hsu testified that he sent the letter because he had told ssi that he was taking a month leave of absence beginning july,and was writing about a month later to have closure.ssi replied to hsu on august,accepting his resignation effective this date.
failed negotiations to purchase hsu ssi corporate shares.
when hsu provided his notice of resignation on august,he also wrote to ssi management saying that he wanted to sell his ssi stock back to the company and requesting corporate financial documents to assess any purchase proposal.hsu was not aware of any purchase rights under the agreement.hsu testified that ssi had previously purchased shares of departing at what hsu believed were freely negotiated prices.hsu intended to keep his shares if he and ssi could not agree on a price.
ssi initially expressed no interest in purchasing hsu stock,and told him he should keep his shares.however,ssi agreed to get back to hsu with a proposal,and did so on september.ssi proposal did not invoke the agreement,and offered a price below the agreement formula book value.ssi represented the book value of hsu shares at million,and offered a maximum of based on a liquidation value.as of this time,ssi had not made any mention of the agreement,or its provisions for purchasing a departing stock.
in october,hsu told ssi cfo masterson that hsu could not accept the proposal without supporting financial documentation as to the value of the shares,which masterson agreed to provide.hsu also told masterson that hsu intended to seek outside advice on valuing his shares.shortly after hsu conversation with masterson,ssi increased its offer to million on october.in ssi written offer,masterson said he calculated the figure under the agreement purchase price formula,but the amount would have to be paid over four years and payment was subject to approval by ssi bank.this was ssi first mention of the agreement since hsu departure from the company.
hsu and masterson both testified that ssi was not attempting to invoke its rights under the agreement at this time and that the parties were continuing their negotiations outside the agreement.in fact,masterson conceded at trial that any right that ssi had to purchase hsu shares under the agreement had lapsed.ssi right under the agreement to buy hsu shares expired by october,at the latest,even assuming that hsu ceased employment upon his written resignation on august,and not the earlier date of the designated leave of absence.hsu did not accept ssi october,offer,and continued to insist on reviewing the company financial documents.
ssi negotiates a merger with another company.
meanwhile,ssi was exploring various financing alternatives to sustain growth.in late september,fsi international,fsi,expressed interest in the possibility of a financial transaction with ssi.on october,ssi hired an investment banking firm to evaluate its financing alternatives.fsi executives toured ssi facilities,and ssi and fsi signed a nondisclosure agreement for sharing corporate information,on november.ssi management parodi,masterson,and amis toured fsi facilities on november and,as discussions continued.the possibility of a merger was under consideration by november.draft merger agreements were circulated between ssi and fsi beginning in,and ssi approved the merger on february.the merger agreement was signed february,and the transaction closed in april.ssi shareholders realized a multimillion dollar profit.
ssi shareholders acquire hsu shares.
parodi,masterson,and amis of ssi did not disclose to hsu their discussions with fsi leading to the merger.in late october,after fsi expressed an interest in discussing financial arrangements with ssi,ssi took a different approach in dealing with hsu.previously,ssi had proposed purchasing hsu shares outside the agreement,at negotiated terms.
ssi now tried for a shareholder purchase under the agreement.on october,ssi notified its shareholders except hsu that limitations imposed by the company bank could restrict ssi from purchasing hsu shares,and offered the shareholders an opportunity to buy hsu shares at book value.parodi and masterson informed the shareholders that ssi was investigating financial partnerships,and that investment representatives valued the company higher than its book value.in fact,written materials provided to the shareholders went so far as to say that the market value of hsu shares far exceeds the book value,and that a merger or other event leading to at least partial liquidity could occur in the next months.
the shareholders were asked to make their purchase elections by november.the shareholders returned elections to purchase hsu shares dated between october and november.assuming the shareholders had a right to purchase a departing employee shares a disputed point,elections through november,would be timely only if hsu ceased employment upon his written resignation on august,and not the earlier date of the designated leave of absence.
masterson of ssi wrote to hsu on november,stating that the shareholders were exercising their purported right under the agreement to purchase hsu shares at book value,which masterson said was same price offered by masterson in his october,letter.masterson asked hsu to specify his payment instructions,and indicated a desire to close the transaction by november.hsu telephoned masterson on november,and again the next day,and advised masterson that hsu was still awaiting financial documentation supporting masterson proposal.masterson did not mention his recent invocation of the agreement,and hsu believed discussions were still open as to the sale of his shares.masterson and hsu agreed to discuss the matter further by telephone on november.instead of a telephone call continuing discussions,masterson sent a letter to hsu on november,stating that ssi shareholders were exercising their right to purchase hsu shares under the agreement,and enclosing an ssi company check for.the letter was delivered on the same day that ssi delivered a term sheet to fsi proposing a merger valued at million.
hsu did not believe that there was any difference between ssi october,offer and the shareholders november stated elections to buy.hsu thought he was still negotiating with the company through masterson.before receiving ssi latest letter and check,hsu replied to ssi on november,that he was agreeable to ssi october proposal to use book value in valuing the stock but said he wanted an audit to ascertain that value.upon receiving ssi check,hsu immediately objected that no agreement had been reached to sell his shares.hsu said that masterson letter and check were invalid.hsu did not cash the check.
after tendering the check to hsu,ssi transferred ownership of hsu shares to the remaining shareholders over hsu prior objection without his knowledge.under the agreement,any transfer between shareholders was supposed to be accomplished by the departing employee voluntary acceptance of the formula purchase price and delivery of his or her share certificates.rather than obtaining hsu endorsement of his stock certificate as required by the agreement,ssi used a blank form stock assignment signed by hsu in a previous,unrelated transaction.as noted earlier,hsu had pledged his ssi stock as security for repayment of a loan at the time of ssi corporate formation.the security pledge agreement was accompanied by a blank form assignment of all ssi shares hsu might acquire,to be used by the lender if ssi defaulted on its loan.the pledge agreement terminated years earlier upon repayment of the loan,and the stock assignment should have been returned to hsu but was retained by ssi.it was that stock assignment document,executed by hsu for the distinct purpose of securing a loan,that ssi used to transfer ownership of hsu shares to the remaining shareholders.
ssi never told hsu that it had transferred ownership of his shares to the other shareholders.on december,ssi wrote to hsu agreeing to an a
