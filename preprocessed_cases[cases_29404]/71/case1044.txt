shareholders brought a action against an investment bank for misleading them in connection with the sale of their closely held corporation to a publicly traded acquiring corporation.the suit was removed to federal district court under the securities litigation uniform standards act of,stat.slusa,which allows for the removal and preclusion of private covered class actions alleging untruth or manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.kircher putnam funds trust,d quoting b the district court held that the suit was properly removed and precluded under slusa.we conclude that the district court erred by applying the wrong legal standard to determine whether madden suit was preserved by slusa savings clause known as the delaware,and we remand to the district court so that it can apply the correct standard.
charles madden,along with other individuals and entities collectively,madden,brought a action in state court against cowen company,sg cowen securities corporation,and cowen and company,llc collectively,cowen.madden and his fellow plaintiffs,most of whom are physicians,owned a majority interest in joseph medical corporation,which in turn owned a controlling share in orange coast managed care services.both joseph and orange coast were closely held corporations.joseph was incorporated in california,and orange coast in delaware.the following facts are taken from the allegations in madden complaint 
in,the management of joseph and orange coast sought a buyer for the two companies and formed a special committee for that purpose.the special committee,which included members of the boards of directors of joseph and orange coast,retained cowen,an investment bank,to look for prospective buyers,give advice regarding the structure of any potential sale,and render a fairness opinion regarding any proposed transaction.cowen contract provided that it would receive a retainer fee plus of any sale price,payable in cash.
cowen found four possible buyers,two of which are relevant here.joseph hospital of orange county,already a of orange coast,offered million million in cash and a million note.fpa medical management,a publicly traded corporation,offered shares of its stock valued at million.cowen recommended fpa as the buyer,and joseph and orange coast began exclusive negotiations with fpa.in january,these discussions resulted in an agreement on the terms of a merger.under the merger agreement,fpa would acquire all outstanding shares of joseph and orange coast.in exchange,fpa would issue shares of its stock valued at million to joseph and orange coast shareholders.cowen concluded that this transaction would be financially fair to the shareholders of orange coast and joseph.
on january,the boards of directors of orange coast and joseph approved the merger agreement.a week later,the agreement was executed by the boards of directors of joseph and orange coast,although it had not yet been approved by joseph and orange coast shareholders.on february,cowen issued a letter memorializing its fairness opinion.fpa then filed a registration statement for the new stock that it would issue to madden under the terms of the merger agreement the registration statement,which included cowen fairness letter and cowen consent to the inclusion of the letter in the registration statement,was approved by the securities and exchange commission sec on february.after receiving a copy of the registration statement and fairness letter,madden voted in favor of the merger agreement.the merger became effective on march.
a few months later,on may,fpa issued a calamitous report for earnings per share were cents below expectation,and fpa share price tumbled in the next two trading days.two months later fpa declared bankruptcy,with a share price that was approximately of its value at the time of the merger agreement.madden agreed with cowen to toll the statute of limitations so that madden could first sue fpa management,auditor,and financial advisor in california court.those defendants removed the action to federal district court fpa management settled,and the district court entered judgment in the remaining defendants favor.we upheld the grant of summary judgment on appeal.madden deloitte touche,llp,cir.madden then brought the present action against cowen in california court,alleging that cowen committed negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence under california law.cowen removed the action to federal district court.applying slusa,the district court denied madden motion to remand to state court and granted cowen motion to dismiss.madden timely appealed.
slusa is part of a recent congressional attempt to rein in private securities litigation.section b of the securities and exchange act of act,b,and rule of the sec regulations,broadly prohibit deception,misrepresentation,and fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of any security,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,d internal quotation marks omitted the supreme court has long recognized an implied private right of action under these provisions.see id.at.citing superintendent of ins.of bankers life cas,d.
in,congress adopted legislation targeted at perceived abuses of the vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded securities.dabit,at.the private securities litigation reform act of reform act,stat.codified at and,was intended to deter or at least quickly dispose of abusive class actions,particularly those alleging violations of section b,by limiting the potential liability of defendants and by requiring plaintiffs who bring private securities fraud actions in federal court to surmount a number of procedural hurdles.see dabit,at.however,rather than face the obstacles set in their path by the reform act,plaintiffs and their representatives began bringing class actions under state law,often in state court.id.at.in response to this unintended consequence of the reform act,congress enacted slusa to stem this shift from federal to state courts and prevent certain state private securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud from being used to frustrate the objectives of the reform act.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
slusa sought to achieve these goals by generally precluding covered class actions alleging fraud or misrepresentation under state law in connection with covered securities.slusa preclusion provision states 
no covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state or subdivision thereof may be maintained in any state or federal court by any private party alleging 
an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security or 
that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.
the breadth of this preclusion provision is limited in several respects.it applies only to a covered class action,which,as relevant here,is defined as an action in which damages are sought on behalf of more than persons.id.f a i.the preclusion provision is also limited to actions involving a covered security,which is defined as a security traded nationally and listed on a regulated national exchange,dabit,at,at the time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation,omission,or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred.id.f the statutory definition of covered security in b.
additionally,slusa contains a savings clause that preserves certain types of claims that would otherwise be subject to its preclusion provision.relevant here is the delaware,d,which provides that a private party may bring a covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of the state in which the issuer is incorporated in the case of a corporation or organized in the case of any other entity,id.d a,if the action involves 
i the purchase or sale of securities by the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer exclusively from or to holders of equity securities of the issuer or 
ii any recommendation,position,or other communication with respect to the sale of securities of the issuer that 
i is made by or on behalf of the issuer or an affiliate of the issuer to holders of equity securities of the issuer and 
ii concerns decisions of those equity holders with respect to voting their securities,acting in response to a tender or exchange offer,or exercising dissenters or appraisal rights.
to prevent actions precluded by slusa from being litigated in state court,slusa authorizes defendants to remove such actions to federal court,effectively ensuring that federal courts will have the opportunity to determine whether a state action is precluded as the supreme court has explained,any suit removable under slusa removal provision,c,is precluded under slusa preclusion provision,b,and any suit not precluded is not removable.see kircher,at.see also spielman merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir newman,concurring noting that slusa removal and preclusion provisions are opposite sides of the same coin.if a federal court determines that an action is not precluded,it has no jurisdiction to touch the case on the merits,and the proper course is to remand to the state court that can deal with it.kircher,at.likewise,if a federal court determines that the action may be maintained in state court pursuant to the delaware,the federal court shall remand such action to such state court.d.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion to remand a removed case.see patenaude equitable life assur.soc y of the united states,cir.
the question presented in this case is whether madden complaint,which alleged claims and was filed in state court,is a covered class action that is both precluded by b of slusa and not saved from preclusion by the delaware,d.
madden action will fall within slusa preclusion provision if the action is a covered class action based upon the statutory or common law of any state being maintained by any private party,and if the action alleges either an untrue statement or omission of material fact or that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.b.
madden does not dispute that his suit is a covered class action,id.f,that his suit is based upon state law,or that the plaintiffs are private parties.it is also undisputed that madden suit alleges cowen fairness opinion contained misrepresentations and therefore qualifies as an action alleging either an untrue statement or omission of material fact or a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance for purposes of b.thus the questions before us are whether cowen alleged misrepresentations were in connection with the purchase or sale of the fpa securities,and whether those fpa securities were covered securities within the meaning of slusa.
we begin by considering whether cowen alleged misrepresentations were in connection with the purchase or sale of the fpa securities.we construe the phrase in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in slusa the same way we construe it in the section b context.see dabit,at.under our section b cases,a misrepresentation is in connection with the purchase or sale of securities if there is a relationship in which the fraud and the stock sale coincide or are more than tangentially related.falkowski imation,cir accord dabit,at.noting the broad construction adopted by both this court and the sec of in connection with.we construe the phrase purchase or sale of securities to include a merger.see sec,d.
madden complaint alleges that cowen made misrepresentations to the shareholders of joseph and orange coast to secure their approval of the merger with fpa.specifically,the complaint alleges that madden relied on cowen representations because they caused plaintiffs to vote to approve the merger transaction and to consent to receive fpa stock in place of their existing orange coast and joseph stock.the complaint further alleges that madden would not have done so absent defendants fairness opinion,distributed to plaintiffs with cowen express consent,that the transaction was fair,from a financial point of view,to plaintiffs as shareholders of orange coast and joseph.as a result of approving the merger agreement,the plaintiffs suffered damage in the full amount of the promised value of the fpa shares they received,approximately million.finally,the complaint alleges cowen could have prevented the damage to plaintiffs if it had correctly carried out its duties,by obtaining and disclosing the information available to it that raised grave questions about fpa financial condition,and by urging serious consideration of the cash bid by joseph hospital of orange.but cowen failed to do so.
because the complaint alleges that cowen made misrepresentations to the shareholders of joseph and orange coast to secure their approval of the merger with fpa,we conclude that the misrepresentations and omissions alleged in the complaint are more than tangentially related to madden purchase of the fpa securities.falkowski,at.cowen alleged misrepresentations were therefore in connection with the purchase or sale of the fpa securities.
citing falkowski and green ameritrade,cir,madden argues that such a conclusion is erroneous because his complaint made a tort claim not related to the purchase and sale of covered securities.in falkowski,we considered a complaint bringing two different sets of claims based on distinct factual allegations.first,the complaint made fraud claims based on allegations that the defendant employer had made misrepresentations to the employees regarding the value of the company stock and the employees stock options.second,the complaint made claims based on allegations that the employer had breached the employees contract by treating the employees options as forfeited when the employees were transferred to another company.see at.we held that the fraud claims were precluded by slusa because they involve d a misrepresentation about the value of the options,but that the employees could proceed with their claims,which did not.id.at.similarly,in green,the eighth circuit held that slusa did not preclude a class action brought by an ameritrade subscriber who alleged that he did not receive the type of information from ameritrade for which he believed he had contracted and paid twenty dollars monthly.at.in both falkowski and green,the plaintiffs made distinct claims that did not allege misrepresentations in connection with the purchase and sale of securities,and therefore such claims were not precluded by slusa.
according to madden,his complaint similarly alleges a distinct claim that cowen committed malpractice by failing to give good advice during the period when madden was considering the cash offer from joseph hospital of orange county.to the extent cowen alleged bad advice did not relate to a transaction involving a covered fpa security,madden argues,cowen professional negligence was not in connection with madden later acceptance of fpa securities,and therefore this claim is not precluded by slusa.
we disagree,because madden complaint can not be read as making a distinct claim that cowen committed professional negligence by failing to advise madden to take the cash offer.rather,the complaint references the offer from joseph hospital of orange county only to highlight cowen error in promoting the fpa offer as a better alternative.indeed,the complaint claims damages measured by the full amount of the promised value of the fpa shares rather than by the lost value of the cash offer or the fees paid cowen.because madden complaint does not allege a professional negligence claim distinct from madden central allegation that cowen misrepresentations resulted in madden purchase of the fpa securities,we reject madden argument that we must construe all or part of his complaint as raising a distinct claim not precluded by slusa.
having determined that madden action meets the requirement that it allege a misrepresentation in connection with the purchase and sale of the fpa securities,we must next address whether the fpa securities were covered securit ies as defined in f.section f defines a covered security as one that satisfies the standards for a covered security at the time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation,omission,or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred.f.the first prong of this definition is explained in b a any security listed,or authorized for listing,on the nasdaq stock market satisfies the standards for a covered security.id.b a.in order to interpret the second prong correctly,we must read the definition of covered security in f in light of slusa preclusion provision in b.specifically,we must determine whether the complaint alleges an untrue statement or omission of material fact or a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,id.b,where that security satisfies the standards for a covered security at the time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation,omission,or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred,id.f.
the parties agree that the fpa securities satisf y the standards for a covered security as of february.the parties do not dispute that on that date the fpa securities were registered with the sec and authorized for listing on the nasdaq stock market.we therefore turn to the temporal element of the definition of covered security,whether the securities were registered at the time the alleged misrepresentation occurred.because the verb,occurred,is not defined in the statute,we look to the word plain meaning.see.health care cost containment mcclellan,cir.the dictionary defines occur to mean,among other things,to present itself,come to pass,or take place.webster third new int l dictionary.accordingly,the fpa securities will meet the temporal element of covered securit ies under slusa if madden complaint alleges that cowen misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of those securities took place at a time during which the securities were authorized for listing on the nasdaq stock market.
we conclude that the fpa securities satisfy this definition.madden complaint alleges that cowen wrote a misleading fairness opinion that was then included in the registration statement for the fpa securities.the complaint further alleges that this registration statement was circulated to joseph and orange coast shareholders after the fpa securities were registered with the sec on february.madden does not dispute that the publication of cowen allegedly misleading fairness opinion in the fpa securities registration statement constituted an alleged misrepresentation.madden complaint therefore alleges that a misrepresentation,the publication of cowen allegedly misleading fairness opinion in the registration statement took place after the fpa securities were registered.also,for the reasons explained above,this misrepresentation was in connection with madden purchase of the fpa securities after they became registered.because madden complaint alleges that cowen misrepresentation occurred during a period when the fpa securities satisfied the standards for covered securit ies under b a,we conclude that the fpa securities were covered securit ies under slusa.
madden,however,argues that no misrepresentation occurred for purposes of f,because cowen is not liable for the publication of its fairness opinion in the fpa securities registration statement.according to madden,cowen can not incur liability for this misrepresentation because publication in the registration statement constituted repetition by orange coast and joseph of misrepresentations that cowen had made before that time.madden relies on the doctrine of indirect deception to support this theory,citing shapiro sutherland,th,d.under shapiro,a person who makes a misrepresentation to a party who then repeats it to a third party is not liable to the third party unless the maker intends or has reason to expect that its terms will be repeated or its substance communicated to the other,and that it will influence his conduct in the transaction or type of transaction involved.id.quoting restatement second torts.
we disagree.to begin with,madden complaint alleges that cowen expressly consented to the inclusion of its fairness opinion in the fpa registration statement,and the fairness opinion squarely recommended that the proposed merger was fair to madden as a shareholder of joseph and orange coast.if shapiro doctrine of indirect deception applies to federal securities law then cowen could be held liable if the complaint allegations are true,because cowen would have reason to expect that the terms of the fairness opinion would be repeated to madden and that they would influence madden conduct in the merger.moreover,madden offers no support for his assumption that a misrepresentation occurs under f only if the defendant can be held liable for the misrepresentation.nothing in the definition of covered security in f involves a liability determination or requires a court to evaluate the merits of a plaintiff claim that a defendant is liable for the misrepresentation.under the plain language of f,a security may meet the definition of covered security so long as the security was listed on the nasdaq at the time the defendant alleged misrepresentation occurred,regardless of the merits of the plaintiff claim based on that misrepresentation.
we have already explained why the publication of cowen allegedly misleading fairness opinion in the fpa securities registration statement was a misrepresentation in connection with madden purchase of the fpa securities.b.whether or not cowen is liable for this misrepresentation,it is undisputed that this alleged misrepresentation took place after the fpa securities satisfie d the standards for a covered security specified in b.we therefore conclude that the fpa securities were covered securit ies under slusa,id.f,and that cowen action is precluded under slusa unless the delaware applies.in light of this conclusion,we need not address cowen alternative argument that madden is collaterally estopped from arguing that the fpa securities were not covered securities by our memorandum disposition in madden deloitte touche,llp.cir.
madden alternatively argues that his suit survives slusa preclusion provision,b,because it falls within a subsection of the delaware,d b ii.for madden suit to qualify under this subsection,it must involve a communication with respect to the sale of the issuer securities and be based on the law of the state in which the issuer is incorporated the communication also must have been made by or on behalf of the issuer or its affiliate to the shareholders of the issuer concern ing specified shareholder decisions,including a response to a tender or exchange offer.d a,b ii.
madden asserts that cowen allegedly misleading fairness opinion is a communication with respect to the sale of joseph and orange coast securities.according to madden,joseph and orange coast are issuer s under d b ii because they were the issuers of the securities that were sold to fpa in response to fpa exchange offer.madden further argues that because he brought his negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence claims under the law of california,the state of incorporation of joseph,and because such claims are also recognized in delaware,the state of incorporation of orange coast,his suit is based on the law of the states in which both joseph and orange coast are incorporated.finally,madden argues that cowen fairness opinion was a communication made by or on behalf of joseph and orange coast to their shareholders concerning the shareholders response to fpa exchange offer,because cowen was retained by joseph and orange coast management to make such a communication.
cowen disputes madden arguments as follows first,cowen argues that neither joseph and orange coast are issuers within the meaning of the delaware.second,cowen argues that madden action is not based on the law of delaware,the state in which orange coast is incorporated.third,cowen argues that it was not acting on behalf of either orange coast or joseph when it provided its fairness opinion.we consider each of these issues in turn.
cowen first argues that neither joseph nor orange coast is the issuer for purposes of the delaware because neither was the issuer of the covered security in this case.according to cowen,only fpa can be the issuer for purposes of the delaware.cowen reasons that the delaware,d,refers to the issuer rather than an issuer,and contends that the issuer must refer to the issuer of the covered security referred to in slusa preclusion provision,b.otherwise,cowen argues,the definite article in the issuer would have no antecedent.
cowen also notes that in dabit the supreme court described the delaware as applying to class actions based on the law of the state in which the issuer of the covered security is incorporated.at.emphasis added.under cowen interpretation of d,the delaware would apply only to fpa and not to joseph,which as a closely held corporation was not an issuer of covered securities.in this case,cowen argues,the delaware would preserve only suits involving communications to fpa shareholders concerning their decisions in voting their fpa securities.because madden action does not involve communications to fpa shareholders,cowen argues that the delaware is inapplicable to madden suit.
we disagree.as noted above,we start with the plain language of the statute.see.health care,at.the delaware does not use the phrase issuer of the covered securities.rather,the delaware refers only to securities or equity securities.d b.slusa does not define the word issuer to mean issuer of the covered securities,nor does slusa preclusion provision,b,refer to an issuer of covered securities or any similar phrase.thus,contrary to cowen argument,there is no clear antecedent to the phrase the issuer in the delaware.moreover,the significance of the word the before issuer in the version of the delaware added to the act is questionable,given that slusa nearly identical delaware in the act refers to both the issuer and an issuer.see f a ii ii providing that the delaware applies to a covered class action that involves any recommendation,position,or other communication with respect to the sale of securities of an issuer that meets certain criteria emphasis added.if the choice of the word the instead of an had substantive meaning,we would expect that the word the would have been used consistently in two otherwise identical amendments.kircher,at.noting that slusa amends the act and act in substantially identical ways.accordingly,we conclude that the plain language of d allows a shareholder to bring a covered class action under state law against any issuer that has made certain communications regarding the sale of its securities,and that these securities need not be the covered securit ies referred to in b.also,though we do not rely on legislative history in construing this unambiguous statutory language,see lamie trustee,d,we note our disagreement with cowen argument that slusa legislative history suggests a congressional intent to limit the delaware to suits against issuers of covered securities.the public debate surrounding congress addition of the delaware weighs against cowen interpretation.the testimony before congress when it inserted the delaware into slusa suggests that the purpose of d was to preserve actions brought by shareholders against their own corporations in connection with extraordinary corporate transactions requiring shareholder approval,such as mergers and tender offers,regardless whether the corporations issued nationally traded securities 
nor does the supreme court passing reference in dabit to one type of class action covered by the delaware require us to adopt a different reading.see at.noting that the delaware applies to class actions based on the law of the state in which the issuer of the covered security is incorporated.in context,the court reference to the delaware in dabit is simply part of the court explanation that the tailored exceptions to slusa command demonstrate that congress did not by any means act cavalierly in displacing state law.id.dabit did not purport to limit the scope of the delaware to covered securities it neither considered nor addressed whether the delaware preserves shareholder class actions against issuers of securities that are not nationally traded.
finally,interpreting the delaware as cowen suggests would have illogical results.under cowen narrow interpretation of the issuer,the delaware would not preserve shareholders remedies against their own corporation for misrepresentations in connection with a merger if the shareholders corporation exchanged its securities for covered securities.the delaware would,however,potentially apply in other types of mergers,if the corporation exchanged covered for covered securities or covered for securities,and slusa preclusion provision would not apply at all if the corporation exchanged for securities.this result is unreasonable and inconsistent with the delaware purpose.given that the plain language of the statute leads to a rational,result.state bd.for charter schools of,cir,and one consistent with the statute purpose,we read the term the issuer in the delaware to refer to the corporation that is the issuer of the securities described in the delaware,rather than being limited to an issuer of a covered security defined in f.accordingly,both orange coast and joseph could potentially be the issuer on whose behalf cowen made its alleged misstatements.
alternatively,cowen argues that even if joseph could be the relevant issuer for purposes of the delaware,orange coast can not.cowen argues that because madden suit was brought in california and based on california law,it can not be based upon the statutory or common law of delaware,the state in which orange coast is incorporated.id.d a.but madden claims that his action against cowen is based upon the statutory or common law of delaware.id.according to madden,he may meet this requirement merely by establishing that delaware allows shareholders of acquired companies to bring negligent misrepresentation and professional negligence actions against the responsible parties.in short,madden argues that,for purposes of slusa,an action is based upon the law of any state in which the action claims would be cognizable.
we reject madden argument as inconsistent with slusa statutory language.madden complaint is not based on the statutory or common law of delaware merely because madden could have brought a similar complaint in delaware.madden complaint alleges only violations of california law,and does not refer to delaware law or contain any claims for violations of delaware law.nor does madden suggest that a california court should apply delaware law to its action.a plaintiff suing in a california court bears the burden of invok ing the law of a jurisdiction other than california,zinser accufix research,cir,amended by cir,and madden did not invoke delaware law in his complaint.
because claims are not based on the law of a state when they do not refer to or rely on that state common or statutory law,the delaware does not preserve den action to the extent it involves misrepresentations made solely on behalf of orange coast we therefore must address whether cowen alleged misstatements to joseph shareholders were made on behalf of joseph,a california corporation.
cowen argues that even if joseph is deemed to be the issuer for purposes of the delaware,cowen did not make any statement on behalf of joseph.because the delaware applies to misleading communications made by or on behalf of an issuer to its shareholders,cowen asserts that madden complaint does not fall within the delaware.see d b ii i.
the district court agreed,holding that a defendant makes a statement on behalf of an issuer for purposes of the delaware only if the defendant was an officer,director,o
