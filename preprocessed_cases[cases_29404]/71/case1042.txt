we here explore the treacherous path which corporate counsel must tread under the privilege when conducting an internal investigation to advise a publicly traded company on its financial disclosure obligations.william ruehle is the former chief financial officer cfo of broadcom corporation,a,publicly traded semiconductor supplier that came under intense scrutiny for its suspected backdating of company stock options.following a government investigation,ruehle was criminally indicted for his involvement in an alleged backdating scheme that ultimately resulted in broadcom restatement of its earnings to account for approximately billion in additional compensation expenses.the district court held an evidentiary hearing and,after evaluating the extensive briefing and evidence presented,issued an order suppressing all evidence reflecting ruehle statements to attorneys from irell manella llp irell,broadcom outside counsel,regarding the stock option granting practices at broadcom.the court found that at the initial stages of the inquiry by irell called the equity review an relationship also existed with the cfo individually,and not just with broadcom,and that the lawyers breached their ethical duties to their client ruehle in disclosing what he had told them in a preliminary interview.
the government filed an interlocutory appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
in march,the wall street journal published the first of a series of articles called the perfect payday,which suggested that a number of public companies were backdating stock options granted to their employees shortly thereafter,in,an investor rights group publicly identified broadcom as one of the corporations that appeared to have engaged in backdating.as a result of the media attention and in anticipation of an inquiry from the securities and exchange commission sec,broadcom board of directors and company management decided to bring in outside counsel to commence an internal review of the company current and past stock option granting practices.ruehle,as broadcom cfo,was among those intimately involved in that decision from the outset.on may,broadcom audit committee engaged irell,a private law firm with which it had longstanding ties,to conduct the equity review by investigating the propriety of the measurement dates utilized by broadcom in its option granting process and identifying those grants which failed to meet the measurement date requirements of generally accepted accounting principles irell immediately commenced its review,which entailed collecting corporate documents and records and conducting interviews with past and current broadcom employees.
broadcom representatives,including ruehle,met with irell lawyers on may and,to discuss the scope of the equity review.it was agreed that irell would report the results of its inquiries to the audit committee.it was also decided that the board would not appoint a panel of independent,outside directors to oversee the equity review.on may,a formal meeting of the audit committee was convened.ruehle and other senior broadcom executives,several members of the board,and irell lawyers were among those present.during the meeting,irell partner david siegel explained the nature of typical backdating investigations and discussed the status of irell internal review,including the necessary involvement of broadcom outside independent auditors,ernst young llp,who would have to review and opine on the accuracy of the company audited financial statements and regulatory filings.siegel also cautioned that irell can handle issues related to the proper accounting for option grants but that if an issue of or management or board integrity arose,a special committee of independent directors would need to be appointed and special independent counsel engaged to conduct that inquiry.the audit committee and other representatives of broadcom made clear that the intent was to turn over the information obtained through the equity review to the auditors,to fully cooperate with government regulators,and,if necessary,to any problems with broadcom financial statements.
as many within broadcom had anticipated,civil lawsuits soon followed the media reports about the company of stock options.on may,a shareholder derivative suit captioned murphy mcgregor was filed in california federal court.the following day,on may,the plaintiffs in the ongoing securities class action in california state superior court,jin broadcom,filed an amended complaint.both the murphy action and the jin amended class action now alleged wrongdoing in relation to broadcom stock option granting practices both suits named broadcom and also personally named ruehle,among other broadcom officers and directors,as an individual defendant.
on may,broadcom general counsel david dull sent an to various broadcom employees,including ruehle,notifying them of the murphy action and of the amended complaint filed in the jin securities class action.dull invited anyone with concerns to contact either him or irell attorneys siegel,kenneth heitz,or dan lefler.shortly after receiving dull message,ruehle received a separate from heitz,one of the irell partners with whom ruehle had already conferred as part of the equity review.heitz updated ruehle concerning the scheduling of interviews of three current or former broadcom employees and,finally,inquired,if you have open time on thursday dan lefler and i would like to spend an hour or so with you 
as arranged,heitz and lefler met with ruehle in his office on thursday,june,to discuss broadcom stock option granting practices and his role as the company cfo ruehle had subsequent,brief discussions with the irell lawyers as the equity review continued and the lawyers reported back to the cfo their progress in unearthing the facts.at no point did the topic of the civil securities lawsuits arise as it might relate to ruehle personally.nor did ruehle ever indicate to the lawyers that he was seeking legal advice in his individual capacity.it is the substance of these june interactions that lies at the center of the present dispute.
in late june,irell advised ruehle to secure independent counsel with respect to the investigations and the pending civil suits.ruehle retained the law firm wilson sonsini goodrich rosati to represent him individually.nevertheless,ruehle remained heavily involved in the company internal review and he was privy to irell reports to the audit committee of its findings and ultimately the disclosures of the information gathered by irell to ernst young.
in august,at broadcom direction,irell fully disclosed the information obtained from the equity review to the ernst young auditors.irell had a series of meetings with ernst young in which the lawyers reported what they had found,which necessarily included the substance of ruehle june,interview with heitz and lefler.ruehle was present for at least some of these meetings between irell and the ernst young auditors.there is no dispute that the irell lawyers regularly updated ruehle and others in senior management about the progress of the equity review and their meetings and contacts with the auditors.
the equity review revealed several accounting irregularities with respect to certain stock option grants.in january,on the advice of its outside counsel and auditors,broadcom restated its earnings as reported in its financial disclosure statements to include a total of billion in previously undisclosed compensation expenses.
the sec and the united states attorney office commenced formal enforcement and grand jury investigations of several company executives in relation to broadcom stock option granting practices.in may and june,with broadcom authorization,government investigators interviewed irell attorneys heitz and lefler by telephone regarding their conversations with ruehle in june.the information they provided was summarized in fbi form reports of investigation,which are part of the sealed record.when he learned that the government intended to use this information against him in connection with possible criminal charges,ruehle objected and claimed that any statements to the irell attorneys were protected by his privilege.ruehle also insisted,after the fact,that whatever he said to irell could not be disclosed without his prior written consent.
on june,a grand jury in the central district of california indicted ruehle and henry nicholas founder,and former president and chief executive charges of conspiracy,securities and wire fraud,and various other violations of title of the united states code.the indictment alleges that beginning in or around and continuing until at least in or around,nicholas and ruehle,among others,engaged in a fraudulent scheme and conspiracy to disguise,conceal,understate,and mischaracterize compensation expenses broadcom was required to recognize in connection with granting its stock options to various employees.among the allegations of wrongdoing,the indictment claims that as part of the backdating scheme the defendants paid a former employee who threatened to expose the scheme,concealed the payoff from broadcom board and its independent auditors,and took various steps to create plausible deniability as to broadcom option backdating practices.
on january,the government moved ex parte for a hearing to resolve whether the statements ruehle made to irell lawyers in june were privileged communications.ruehle argued that he had an individual relationship with irell arising from the securities lawsuits,in which he was a named defendant.beginning on february,the district court held a evidentiary hearing at which ruehle and irell attorneys heitz and lefler testified.at ruehle request,a substantial portion of the testimony and evidence was received in camera outside the presence of the federal prosecutors.both irell attorneys insisted that irell individual representation of ruehle in relation to the civil securities lawsuits did not commence until after the june,interview among other things,the attorneys testified that they began the june meeting with a upjohn or corporate miranda warning,which included notice that the irell attorneys were acting as representatives of,the audit that the privilege therefore rested only with the company.ruehle,however,denied any recollection of receiving such cautionary warnings at the june,interview.ruehle testified that at the time he spoke with heitz and lefler he believed irell represented everyone named in the civil suits,including him,and that heitz and lefler were acting at least in part as his personal attorneys during the interview.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the district court rendered its oral ruling which strongly condemned the irell attorneys behavior with respect to the firm handling of the equity review.the court then found that ruehle had a reasonable belief that irell and manella were his lawyers prior to the june,interrogation by irell,and that he never gave informed written consent,either to the dual representation by irell or the disclosure of privileged information to third parties,including ernst young and the government.based on this reasoning,the court ordered suppression.the district court subsequently issued a written order,which included an additional finding that ruehle intended his statements to heitz and lefler to be confidential.the order stated that all evidence reflecting ruehle statements to irell regarding the stock option granting practices at broadcom is suppressed.the court also referred irell to the california state bar for possible discipline in light of numerous perceived violations of state rules of professional conduct.
the government interlocutorily appealed the district court suppression order and we consider it on an expedited basis 
the district court conclusion that statements are protected by an individual privilege is a mixed question of law and fact which this court reviews independently and without deference to the district court.united states bauer,cir quoting united states gray,cir.that is,whether the party has met the requirements to establish the existence of the privilege is reviewed de novo.id.we also review de novo the district court rulings on the scope of the privilege.id.factual findings are reviewed for clear error.see islamic found.bush,cir.a district court credibility determinations are given special deference.united states craighead,cir citing united states nelson,cir.
the government raises several arguments challenging the district court order excluding ruehle statements to irell attorneys.we begin with some basic premises.first,there is no dispute that broadcom had an existing relationship with irell and,by electing to reveal the information gathered to ernst young and later to various agencies of the united states,deliberately waived any corporate privilege it held with respect to all matters at issue.second,the equity review and the civil securities suits,to which ruehle was a party,both concerned the same general subject matter as of june,the stock option granting practices of broadcom.finally,the district court concluded as a fact that ruehle reasonably believed that irell represented him individually with respect to the ongoing civil lawsuits when the june,meeting took place.because this factual finding is not clearly erroneous,we approach the parties arguments from the perspective that irell had relationships with both broadcom and ruehle individually.
we,however,must inquire further.after all,a party asserting the privilege has the burden of establishing the relationship and the privileged nature of the communication.bauer,at citing ralls united states,cir emphasis added accord in re grand jury subpoenas,cir in certain circumstances,reasonable belief may be enough to create an relationship,but it is not sufficient here to create a personal privilege.we must determine whether ruehle communications to the irell attorneys regarding broadcom stock option granting practices are protected by a personal privilege belonging to ruehle.
the privilege protects confidential disclosures made by a client to an attorney in order to obtain legal advice,as well as an attorney advice in response to such disclosures.bauer,at quoting united states chen,cir emphasis omitted.the fact that a person is a lawyer does not make all communications with that person privileged.united states martin,cir citing chen,at.because it impedes full and free discovery of the truth,the privilege is strictly construed.id.quoting weil inv.indicators,research,cir accord united states plache,cir.t he privilege stands in derogation of the public right to every man evidence and as an obstacle to the investigation of the truth,and thus,i t ought to be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle.in re horowitz,cir citations omitted.typically,an test determines whether information is covered by the privilege 
where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such,the communications relating to that purpose,made in confidence by the client,are at his instance permanently protected from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser,unless the protection be waived.
in re grand jury investigation,cir quoting united states margolis in re fischel,cir the party asserting the privilege bears the burden of proving each essential element.united states munoz,cir.
at the outset we note a fundamental flaw in the district court analysis.issues concerning application of the privilege in the adjudication of federal law are governed by federal common law.bauer,at quoting clarke am.commerce nat.bank,cir see also united states blackman,cir s ince the adoption of the federal rules of evidence,courts have uniformly held that federal common law of privilege,not state law applies.citations omitted.the district court,however,applied a reasonable belief standard without ever referencing the test.rather,in reaching its holding,the court relied almost exclusively upon california state law to define both the relationship and the privilege.most significantly,the court cited california evidence code section a for the proposition that all communications made in the course of an relationship are presumed confidential.
this legal error is critical in this case.the district court applied a liberal view of the privilege that conflicts with the strict view applied under federal common law,which governs here.see martin,at.by approaching the exclusion question with a presumption that the privilege attached,the district court inverted the burden of proof,improperly placing the onus on the government to show what information was not privileged.see gordon superior court of county,th,d,c ommunications between a lawyer and his client are presumed confidential,with the burden on the party seeking disclosure to show otherwise.citations omitted.
as the party asserting the privilege,ruehle was obliged by federal law to establish the privileged nature of the communications and,if necessary,to segregate the privileged information from the information.see bauer,at see also jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence,b joseph mclaughlin,matthew bender ed discussing rule that blanket claims of privilege are generally disfavored.with respect to the latter obligation,ruehle has made no effort to identify with particularity which of his communications to the irell attorneys are within his claim of privilege,in either his public or sealed filings before us.under federal law,the privilege is strictly construed.ruehle failure to define the scope of his claim of privilege weighs in favor of disclosure in any event,his claim can not support the overly broad,blanket suppression order entered here.
with the burden properly on ruehle,and after carefully reviewing and evaluating the record,we hold that ruehle fails the fourth element of the traditional privilege test.ruehle statements to the irell attorneys were not made in confidence but rather for the purpose of disclosure to the outside auditors.that he might regret those statements after later learning of the subsequent corporate disclosure to law enforcement officials is not material to the privilege determination as of june.
the district court reached the contrary conclusion ruehle intended his statements to be confidential,and he had no reason to suspect that his conversations with the irell lawyers would be disclosed to third parties.we are unable to square this factual finding,which forms the linchpin of the suppression order,with the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing.the notion that ruehle spoke with irell attorneys heitz and lefler with the reasonable belief that his statements were confidential is unsupported by the record.of particular significance is what was said in the meetings he attended prior to june,with irell attorneys,company management,and the audit committee,as acknowledged in ruehle own testimony.he frankly admitted that he understood the fruits of irell searching inquiries would be disclosed to ernst young in order to convince the independent auditors of the integrity of broadcom financial statements to the public,or to take appropriate accounting measures to rectify any misleading reports.we reject the district court contrary finding that an expectation of confidentiality was established because,upon review of the record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed and thus we determine that this factual finding was clearly erroneous.united states overton,cir quoting easley cromartie,d.
ruehle was no ordinary broadcom employee.he served as the public company senior corporate executive charged with primary responsibility for broadcom financial affairs.this was a sophisticated corporate enterprise with billions of dollars in sales worldwide,aided by accountants,lawyers,and advisors entrusted with meeting a multitude of regulatory obligations.the duties undertaken by ruehle broadly encompassed not only accurately and completely reporting the company historical and current stock option granting practices,but also broadcom strict compliance with reporting and record keeping requirements imposed through the securities exchange act of and the act of,among many other federal and state rules and regulations.see,a.as the head of finance,ruehle can not now credibly claim ignorance of the general disclosure requirements imposed on a publicly traded company with respect to its outside auditors or the need to truthfully report corporate information to the sec.
ruehle was also intimately involved in all aspects of the equity review,including the planning,investigatory,and disclosure stages.ruehle was a full participant in the initial may meetings with the irell attorneys where the scope of representation and the details of the equity review were decided and agreed upon,even before convening the formal audit committee meeting.from the outset,it was settled and made widely known to senior management that broadcom intended to fully cooperate with the sec and the auditors.ruehle,as the primary contact with ernst young over the years,personally introduced the irell attorneys to the team of outside auditors.thereafter,he repeatedly met with the audit committee,senior management,the irell attorneys,and the auditors,and remained fully apprised throughout the summer of of the status of irell investigation and the flow of information.
in his testimony at the evidentiary hearing,ruehle acknowledged the broad nature of the planned disclosure,noting that irell was directed,to his knowledge,to freely share all factual information gleaned through the equity good,bad,or ugly.as he explained,at the time of the june,interview,he understood that nothing would be withheld from ernst young 
q did you think it was appropriate for broadcom,represented by irell,to withhold information from the auditors in connection with their work in early june of 
a we were not withholding information from the auditors.
q they were not withholding information from the auditors is that correct 
a that correct.
q and you understood that to be the case at the time correct 
a that correct.
indeed,ruehle confirmed over and over again his awareness that the substance of his june interviews with the irell lawyers was not to be held in confidence 
q you understood that irell was going to be sharing the factual information they gathered to third parties 
a that correct.
q and fair to say you understood that irell was there,among other things,to gather facts correct 
to dispel any doubt,ruehle also confirmed that the information he provided to heitz and lefler was largely factual in type of information he understood would be disclosed to third parties.
q to be clear,the information you provided to irell was factual information correct 
a it was a combination of factual information and some assumptions and some recollections.
q and you understood that ernst young was going to be looking to you,among other people,to help them understand what had happened as part of broadcom historical options review correct 
a that correct.
as ruehle anticipated when he met with the irell attorneys in june,the information obtained through the equity review,including his input,was passed on to ernst young.he never raised any anxiety about the possible disclosure over what he now claims was intended to be confidential and thus privileged information.ruehle had ample opportunity to raise any concern he might have harbored.ruehle not only attended meetings where the audit committee directed irell to disclose to ernst young the fruits of the equity review,he was also present at meetings where disclosures to the auditors actually occurred.he did not object.even after engaging independent counsel to apprise him of his legal rights,ruehle never claimed that he thought his statements to irell during the equity review,later shared with the auditors,were the specter of criminal liability arose in.
on appeal,ruehle tries to minimize the damning evidence confirming his awareness that his interactions with irell would not be held in confidence.he places much weight on the assertion that he only learned of the details of irell disclosures to ernst young and the government in and that he was shocked.ruehle contends that,notwithstanding his obligation to fully cooperate in broadcom internal review,he would not have provided information as part of the equity review had he known it could be used in support of a criminal investigation or an sec enforcement action.the district court seems to have agreed with ruehle analysis,noting 
the government argues that ruehle knew that irell would make some disclosure to ernst young in connection with its investigation,and therefore ruehle knew that his statements were not confidential.this argument is unpersuasive.ruehle never understood that irell might disclose statements adverse to ruehle interests to the government for use in a criminal case against him.
this analysis misses the mark.the salient point from a privilege perspective is that ruehle readily admits his understanding that all factual information would be communicated to third parties,which undermines his claim of confidentiality to support invoking the privilege.ruehle subjective shock and surprise about the subsequent usage of the information he knew would be disclosed to,information subsequently shared with securities regulators and the justice department now used to support a criminal investigation and his frankly of no consequence here.
in support of his case for invocation of the privilege,ruehle also repeatedly points to attorney heitz testimony that he could not split his mind so as to distinguish between facts relevant to the equity review and those relevant to the defense of ruehle in the pending civil securities litigation,because they both had at their core broadcom stock option granting practices.but his efforts to make gold from lead are met with failure.the implicit concession on ruehle the information underlying the equity review and the lawsuits was largely inseparable,if not one and the detrimental,not helpful,to his case.his admitted awareness that anything relating to the former would not be held in confidence but rather shared with at least one third party destroys the confidentiality essential to establishing the privilege as to both.
ruehle attempts to raise an exception to the full disclosure of all factual information,insisting that he anticipated the disclosure of only factual information that was not otherwise privileged information.in other words,ruehle now asserts an expectation of confidentiality only over statements that he claims were really given in confidence.he does not distinguish what those statements might be in his blanket invocation of the privilege.this circular reasoning is,analytically speaking,unpersuasive and can not overcome the concrete evidence in the record before us.even supposing he subjectively believed that some of the information he conveyed to the irell lawyers was confidential,upon asserting the privilege ruehle was obliged to distinguish which particular statements should be afforded the privilege.he made no effort to do so before the district court and fares no better on appeal.his testimony at the evidentiary hearing,despite being held in camera at his request,due ostensibly to the sensitive subject matter to be discussed,did not delve into the details of his substantive contributions to the equity review and,frankly,entailed largely matters.we are left guessing as to what particular facts ruehle purportedly believed were disclosed in breach of confidence.
ruehle position is,at bottom,that some nebulous portion of his communications with heitz and lefler was intended to be confidential as to him personally and therefore everything said or not said to the attorneys should be protected by his individual privilege.that is not the law nor,in our view,should it be.having failed to better articulate his expectations regarding the scope of disclosure to ernst young,he has failed to carry his burden with respect to any and all factual information arising from the equity review.
moreover,ruehle argument runs squarely into the settled rule that any voluntary disclosure of information to a third party waives the privilege,regardless of whether such disclosure later turns out to be harmful.see weinstein berger,supra.ruehle freely and voluntarily disclosed the information in june and did not mention an individualized privilege until nearly two years later,after having sat in on the very meetings where his information was disclosed.ruehle assertion about his subjective intent in can not sustain his privilege claim when he has freely admitted that the disclosure to ernst young was planned.see weil,at holding subjective intent not dispositive and privilege waived.
in sum,the overwhelming evidence demonstrates that ruehle statements to heitz and lefler were not made in confidence but rather for the purpose of outside disclosure.accordingly,we hold that ruehle has failed to meet his burden of establishing the existence of an individual privilege with respect to the information provided to the irell attorneys in the june time frame.
a considerable portion of the district court suppression order was dedicated to recounting perceived violations of the california rules of professional conduct committed by irell attorneys.this portion of the order,which relates to possible disciplinary action by the state bar,is not before us on appeal.ruehle,however,asserts that clear breaches of professional duties warrant suppression in a criminal prosecution.we disagree and reject this novel argument,which stands apart from the privilege determination 
a state rule of professional conduct can not provide an adequate basis for a federal court to suppress evidence that is otherwise admissible.united states lowery,cir accord united states keen,cir e vidence obtained in violation of neither the constitution nor federal law is admissible in federal courts,even though obtained in violation of state law.citations omitted.to be clear,in some cases,material protected by the privilege may come to light as a result of counsel breach of a duty of confidentiality.but it is the protected nature of the information that is material,not the ethical violation by counsel.see int l of teamsters,at holding that an individual could not assert individual privilege even though the law firm failed to clarify that it represented only his employer,in violation of state rules of professional responsibility.
contrary to ruehle contention,united states rogers,cir,provides him no support.as the government correctly distinguishes it,rogers involved government misconduct in acquiring evidence.id.at holding that a federal agent inducement of a violation of an ethical obligation of confidentiality does not warrant dismissal of an indictment where suppression is a possible remedy with respect to the improperly obtained evidence.read properly,that case supports the government position that the suppression order was in error.id.at the privilege is an evidentiary rule designed to prevent the forced disclosure in a judicial proceeding of certain confidential communications between a client and a lawyer.there has been no allegation that the government encouraged,was complicit in,or was even aware of,any breach of ethical obligations on irell part.it learned of the information only after broadcom made an intentional disclosure to the government in response to regulatory inquiries as evidence of the company good faith efforts to comply with its financial reporting obligations.irell allegedly unprofessional conduct in counseling broadcom to disclose,without obtaining written consent from ruehle,while troubling,provides no independent basis for suppression of statements he made in june.
the district court erred in forbidding the united states from calling irell attorneys to testify to the information they learned from ruehle in june.consistent with his admitted understanding that broadcom would fully disclose what irell learned as part of the equity review to ernst young,ruehle lacks an expectation of confidentiality to support a blanket invocation of his individual privilege over all factual information he provided 
the district court order suppressing the irell evidence is reversed and the matter is remanded for trial.
reversed and remanded.
