background 
a.the initial investment 
in april,kenneth weiss met robert horton.weiss expressed interest in investing in horton alternative fuels company,alchemix corporation.at the direction of his accountant,weiss set up strategic diversity,strategic to handle his investments.in strategic first venture,weiss sought to invest in alchemix and requested certain collateral to secure his investment.approximately two weeks later,the parties arrived at an agreement.
in a agreement signed on july,strategic agreed to invest in alchemix.the agreement incorporated the following a convertible promissory note note in the amount of security interests in alchemix patents and intellectual property rights and a warrant which included a provision that ensured capitalization of the company could not exceed million shares warrant.
the note was to be paid after five years at an interest rate of ten percent per year compounded monthly.under the terms of the note,weiss had the option of converting the note to shares of stock at a price of or such price as offered to other investors.alchemix had the ability to prepay the note after one year if three conditions were met alchemix had to give strategic days advance written notice alchemix had to pay a prepayment penalty of and during the day notice period,alchemix had to give strategic the option to convert the note into shares of alchemix stock at per share or any lower price offered to other investors.
while the agreement did not guarantee weiss a seat on the board,it stated that alchemix shall immediately undertake its best efforts to elect weiss and retain him in such board position at least until such time as the note has been satisfied or converted pursuant to the terms delineated therein.weiss obtained his seat on the board shortly after his investment was made.
as part of the loan,weiss also obtained secured interests in alchemix property in certain patents and protection in the form of provisions.
alchemix needs further investment 
in may,alchemix needed money.to that end,alchemix entered into negotiations with the alchemix funding group afg.afg was an investment group independent of alchemix,but the group included members of alchemix board.horton claims that weiss was a member of afg,but weiss denies this assertion.
throughout the month,afg and alchemix negotiated the terms of an agreement.afg would loan alchemix approximately million,but it required certain terms on its loan.those terms,however,conflicted with strategic rights.to get the loan from afg,alchemix and afg would need strategic to make concessions.weiss testified that his goal was to see that alchemix succeed,and he believed that securing this line of funding would help alchemix.weiss agreed to make certain concessions however,not surprisingly,he sought to be compensated for them.he negotiated with alchemix and afg to find an acceptable outcome for all.
the negotiations culminated in a june,letter from strategic to alchemix.in that letter,weiss,on behalf of strategic,wrote that he understood alchemix was seeking funding from afg in the amount of three million dollars.he indicated that he intended to be an investor in afg and that his agreement to waive strategic rights was contingent upon my investment in afg.weiss then noted that he would agree to waive strategic rights on certain terms.specifically,he stood ready to waive provisions,increase the amount of capitalized shares,and release his security interests in alchemix patents in exchange for a investment in alchemix shares at per share.
as part of the proposed afg loan agreement,afg was to initially supply million to alchemix.a portion of that money,was to be paid to strategic in order to remove strategic security interests in alchemix property.once collateral requirements were in order,afg would supply another million,bringing its total investment in alchemix to million.
western oil sands 
however,the afg alchemix transaction never took place because in the midst of those negotiations,horton received welcome news for alchemix.on june,a canadian company,western oil sands western,indicated its interest in a potentially larger investment in alchemix than afg was willing to offer.western sent a memorandum of understanding western memo to horton.according to the western memo,western was to make an initial investment of million and had the option to continue investment if certain conditions were met.the potential investment was up to million.
the next day,on june,horton canceled the negotiations with afg.he faxed a copy of the western memo to members of the alchemix board,including weiss who received the document.
sometime after the western proposal and the circulated western memo,weiss asserts that horton misrepresented the nature of the western investment.weiss testified that he and horton were on the phone fairly often and that bob horton told me that they western were investing million and that the various concessions that i made were,from my personal point of view,contingent on and related directly to that kind of investment.weiss also claims that he inquired as to whether there were any adverse facts or circumstances that would affect his decision and that horton did not offer any comments.
because weiss was busy with other matters,including travel outside the country,arthur hagopian,executive assistant to weiss and a corporate officer of strategic,handled the discussions with alchemix and horton representative.hagopian had one conversation with horton regarding weiss resignation from the board,but all other discussions were with richard armstrong,alchemix cfo.horton stated that armstrong would be the person shifting the paper on any such transaction.
hagopian describes his discussions with armstrong as a single transaction that would involve the replacement of strategic loan with an equity holding.armstrong,however,testified in his deposition that he did not recall the transaction.hagopian stated that armstrong had opened discussions by claiming that a number of concessions were needed to clear the way for a new investor.the new concessions for the western investment included the following prepayment of the note relinquishment of weiss board seat waiver of strategic rights and waiver of strategic right to make further loans to alchemix.hagopian stated that armstrong proposed that an equivalent investment in alchemix stock would be provided at a discounted price in exchange for these concessions.hagopian and armstrong negotiated the price of the stock,ultimately arriving at a discount price of per share.armstrong told hagopian that the shares would not originate from alchemix but rather from horton family holdings in medici associates.
in the midst of the weiss and horton negotiations,western made its first million investment in alchemix,pursuant to the terms in the western memo.
on june,strategic accepted prepayment of the note with interest and penalties totaling.in consideration of the prepayment,strategic waived the thirty day notice,waived strategic right to loan an additional to alchemix,and modified the warrant to allow capitalization of up to million shares.although the document accepting prepayment of the note itself makes no reference to the right to purchase alchemix shares at per share,weiss produced a sheet with wiring instructions for the payment that also includes the following statement please do not transfer this payment until you send a note stating,strategic diversity kenneth weiss shall have the right to purchase up to shares of alchemix at a share directly from robert horton.hagopian also wrote to armstrong that if there were issues with the arrangement,then the loan repayment should not be made because the documents were conceived and created as one package.
on july,alchemix sent a check to strategic in the amount of.concurrent with the payment of the note,horton sent a letter to weiss in which he agreed to sell up to shares of alchemix common stock on or before july,that is owned by medici or me for a sales price per share of.the next week,on july,weiss sent a check to medici in the amount of to purchase shares of alchemix common stock.on july,weiss,as part of the transaction,tendered his resignation as a member of the alchemix board.
horton views the facts differently.although horton and armstrong both testified that they can not recall the details of the transaction,they contend that it was two separate transactions the repayment of the note to strategic and weiss subsequent purchase of stock from medici.in horton view,the repayment of the note was made,and any subsequent offer of shares was strictly because weiss was part of afg negotiations,a point that weiss disputes.
by the end of july,western,pursuant to the western memo,had the option to invest another million in alchemix.however,it never did so.due to a fire at its facilities,the company was strapped for cash and decided not to continue its investment in alchemix.horton testified that the news of western forgoing its alchemix investment was a game changer.he notified members of the alchemix board,but he did not notify weiss.
on august,weiss released the security interests in certain alchemix patents.
weiss contends that since he left the alchemix board,he had not received any updates,legally required annual reports,or any communication regarding the status of alchemix technology,finances and development.it was only in december that weiss learned for the first time that western had never made an investment of million and that the alchemix board had resigned.
glenn litigation 
in the summer of,horton was an individual defendant in glenn horton,a securities fraud action in maricopa county superior court.the litigation involved securities fraud in connection with another project of horton called genesis coals.weiss claims that horton failed to inform him of this information and that this was material to his decision to invest in alchemix.
district court proceedings 
weiss filed his original complaint in federal district court on may,seeking rescission of the transaction.he amended his complaint on august,again seeking rescission and asserting causes of action for federal securities fraud count,state securities fraud count,common law fraud count,and negligent misrepresentation count.he also brought claims for mutual mistake count,failure of a condition precedent count,and unjust enrichment count.
on january,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims.the court held that weiss federal and state securities law claims were time barred.in the alternative,the court held that weiss federal and state securities claims,common law fraud,and negligent misrepresentation claims failed for a lack of showing of damages.the district court also granted summary judgment to the defendants on all remaining state law claims.the district court also awarded attorneys fees to horton in the approximate amount of.weiss filed appeals on the summary judgment ruling as well as the attorneys fee award.

iv.analysis 
limitations period on securities claims 
federal securities fraud claims may be brought not later than the earlier of years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.with regard to the state claims,the relevant provision of arizona law provides that no civil action shall be brought unless brought within two years after discovery of the fraudulent practice on which the liability is based,or after the discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.b.
the transaction that forms the basis of the complaint occurred on july.weiss claims that he did not actually discover the facts underlying his cause of action until december,when he spoke with horton,who told him that the alchemix board had quit and that the sizable western investment never materialized.with respect to the alleged omission regarding the glenn litigation,weiss claims that it was not until years after his tenure on the alchemix board that he learned that horton was a defendant in a state fraud suit.weiss filed his complaint on may.the parties agree that the suit was filed within the limitation.however,they disagree as to whether weiss should have known of the claims more than two years prior to filing his complaint.if the facts conclusively demonstrate that weiss should have discovered the facts of his claim prior to may,the claims are.
in merck,reynolds,the court held that discovery as used in encompasses not only those facts the plaintiff actually knew,but also those facts a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have known,d.however,the discovery of facts that put a plaintiff on inquiry notice does not automatically begin the running of the limitations period.id.at.t erms such as inquiry notice and storm warnings may be useful to the extent that they identify a time when the facts would have prompted a reasonably diligent plaintiff to begin investigating.id.emphasis added.the court rejected merck argument that the limitations period should run when the plaintiff fails to exercise diligence and undertake an investigation once on inquiry notice.id.at.the court held that the ultimate burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have discovered the facts constituting the violation.see id.at.
here,operating without the benefit of the supreme court ruling in merck,the district court found that the western memo put weiss on inquiry notice,and it marked the time of the commencement of the statute of limitations at the time of inquiry notice,june.accordingly,the district court found weiss federal and state securities claims.
however,under merck,horton has not met his burden of showing that the claims are time barred.even assuming that weiss was on inquiry notice in,horton does not demonstrate how a reasonably diligent plaintiff from that point forward would have discovered the violations.the limitations period does not begin to run until discovery,irrespective of whether the actual plaintiff undertook a reasonably diligent investigation.id.at.
because the district court did not have the benefit of recent supreme court authority,we vacate the ruling on these grounds and remand.see betz trainer wortham,cir noting the prudence of remand in light of recent supreme court authority.
federal securities fraud claim 
to state a claim under b,a plaintiff must allege a material misrepresentation or omission scienter a connection with the purchase or sale of a security reliance economic loss and loss causation.dura,broudo,d.
as a preliminary matter,we are not convinced that horton omission concerning his involvement in the glenn litigation was material to weiss investment decision.an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.platforms wireless int l,cir.the standard of materiality is an objective one.tsc,northway,d.an incomplete statement is not sufficient if the misrepresentation is not significant.see basic levinson,d.other than a conclusory allegation that horton omission was material,there is no reason to conclude that this affected the total mix of information available or that any reasonable investor would consider thi
