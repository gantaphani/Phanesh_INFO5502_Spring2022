the issue before us is whether the complaint in this securities fraud class action states a claim under the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,b.the district court held that it did not,and dismissed the complaint without leave to amend.the plaintiffs appeal,and we affirm.
this action is brought under b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and a,and rule of the securities exchange commission.the plaintiffs allege violations of the act and rule on behalf of a class of investors who bought vantive stock between april,and july,the class period.the defendants are the vantive corporation and certain of its officers and directors.we summarize the facts from the complaint,and assume these facts to be true for the purposes of our decision.
vantive sold and serviced customer relationship management software called software that enabled field personnel to deliver customer service across many channels,including the internet,a call center,or in person.vantive made its initial public offering in august at per share.enjoying rapid sales and earnings growth,vantive stock price increased to more than per share by late.in april the beginning of the class period,however,vantive stock price dropped to per share as two competitors announced disappointing results many believed that this particular software sector had peaked.
the plaintiffs allege that,beginning in april,the defendants made knowingly false and misleading statements about the competitive prospects of vantive products and the growth of vantive sales force,and falsely forecast increased revenues for and.the plaintiffs also allege that the individual defendants caused vantive to manipulate and falsify its publicly reported financial results by prematurely recognizing millions of dollars in revenues for software licensed to resellers even though the resellers were not obligated to pay for those licenses until they sublicensed the product to the end user.allegedly as a result of these misrepresentations,vantive stock rose to.during the class period,vantive allegedly acquired two other firms by issuing shares of its common stock and selling million in debt securities to raise capital.also during the class period,the individual defendants sold million shares of their vantive stock at prices as high as per share,for a total of roughly million in insider trading proceeds.
on july,vantive revealed that its results for the second quarter would be worse than earlier forecast,that vantive was appointing a new head of north american sales,and that it was going to reduce the size of its direct sales force.analysts slashed the revenue and earnings per share forecast for vantive.vantive stock fell to as low as per share and performed poorly thereafter.unable to compete successfully as an independent company,vantive was sold to the peoplesoft company in october.
on july,one year after the end of the alleged class period,shareholders filed three virtually identical complaints against vantive and the individual defendants.after these cases were consolidated,and the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under.b.the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra.the court denied the plaintiffs leave to amend.
discussion 
the pslra significantly altered pleading requirements in private securities fraud litigation by requiring that a complaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter.ronconi larkin,cir.the purpose of this heightened pleading requirement was generally to eliminate abusive securities litigation and particularly to put an end to the practice of pleading fraud by hindsight.in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.a securities fraud complaint must now specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.if the challenged statement is not false or misleading,it does not become actionable merely because it is incomplete.brody transitional hospitals,cir.further,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b emphasis added.thus the complaint must allege that the defendant made false or misleading statements either intentionally or with deliberate recklessness or,if the challenged representation is a forward looking statement,with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.c b i see ronconi,at silicon graphics,at.
in this case,the plaintiffs allege that,over the course of a week period,the defendants knowingly made false and misleading statements about vantive ability to sell its products,knowingly made false and misleading statements concerning the quality of its products,manipulated vantive financial results,and falsely forecast future revenues.in support of these allegations,the plaintiffs also allege that the individual defendants engaged in suspicious insider trading and corporate transactions.as we discuss below,these allegations do not meet the requirements of the pslra because they are not sufficiently particularized and do not raise a strong inference that misleading statements were made knowingly or with deliberate recklessness to investors.ronconi,at.
most of the complaint is premised upon vantive july press release announcing lower then expected earnings.starting from this announcement,the plaintiffs speculate in hindsight that earlier projections made throughout the prior fifteen months must have been false for failure to disclose adverse facts.the complaint does not allege contemporaneous facts in sufficient detail and in a manner that would create a strong inference that the alleged adverse facts were known at the time of the challenged statements.see ronconi,at.indeed,the bulk of the alleged adverse facts are generic,subjective,difficult to prove or refute,and could be alleged against almost any company that has experienced a drop in sales revenue.the page complaint rarely,if ever,sets forth a particularized basis to support the existence of these concealed facts.
sufficiency of the allegations of deception 
statements concerning vantive ability to sell its products 
the plaintiffs first allege that vantive deliberately misled investors with respect to its ability to sell its products.the complaint asserts that,throughout the class period the vantive defendants continually stated that the growth and performance of its direct sales force was on plan,when,in fact,vantive was unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified persons to grow its direct salesforce at the rate necessary to sustain the level of revenue growth being forecast was unable to adequately train its new direct sales persons and was plagued with very high salesforce turnover.consequently,the complaint alleges,the sales force was not adequately positioned to meet vantive projected sales goals.
the plaintiffs also allege that vantive misleadingly touted its extremely strong executive and sales management teams as being a key competitive advantage to its ability to sell and grow vantive business,when in fact,vantive was suffering serious problems with its management teams,who were distracted and unable to effectively manage because of continual disagreements and.the plaintiffs also label as a misrepresentation the defendants statement that vantive sales cycle was holding steady at months,because vantive sales cycles were actually lengthening substantially.finally,the plaintiffs allege,vantive misrepresented that it had very successful growth in its indirect distribution channels,because in reality vantive was not successfully expanding its indirect sales channels with new partnerships with hbo,learning international,eds or lucent,as each of these resellers were sic,in fact,encountering significant difficulties in vantive products,due to the lack of differentiation and the technological problems with those products.
we hardly need elaborate on the inadequacy of these generalized allegations under the heightened pleading standard of the pslra.see generally ronconi,at silicon graphics,at.their deficiency is that they fail to plead falsity or scienter with particularity.for example,although the complaint alleges that over the class period,vantive continually and deliberately misled investors by stating that its was holding steady at three to six months,much of the complaint fails to allege any facts to indicate why this statement would have been misleading at the several points at which it was alleged to have been made.even when the complaint eventually indicates that vantive sales cycles were lengthening substantially,the complaint gives no indication of what it means for a sales cycle to lengthen substantially,or what the actual length of the cycle was at the time of the statement.
along similar lines,the complaint leaves unclear what it would mean for vantive to adequately train an employee,what sufficient numbers of hirees would be,or what it means for a substantial percentage of people to quit.nor does the complaint indicate how these facts would necessarily show that vantive statement that its hiring was on plan was misleading and deliberately reckless at the time it was made the complaint also does not indicate what it means for a management team to be extremely strong,what the continual disagreements that supposedly plagued the managerial team consisted of,or why such disagreements would make it misleading for the company to have characterized its management as being strong.ronconi,at complaint inadequate for failing to state what alleged significant or difficult problems were,for failing to state what kind of inefficiencies existed,and for failing to identify an amount of cost excesses or lack of revenue growth or state how these inefficiencies showed that two companies were not consolidated.in the absence of greater particularity,we have no way of distinguishing the plaintiffs allegations from the countless fishing expeditions which the pslra was designed to deter.silicon graphics,at.
the other major problem with these allegations is that they do not adequately establish that the defendants had knowledge of the supposedly true but concealed circumstances concerning vantive problems in selling its products.the plaintiffs attempt to establish such knowledge by adverting to the defendants management style,their interaction with other corporate officers and employees,their attendance at management and board meetings,and reports generated on a weekly and monthly basis in the finance department under murphy.these reports included license revenue reports,service revenue reports,contract revenue reports,and reports that listed potential sales and the probability that the contract would be signed by the end of a given quarter,and financial reports comparing vantive actual financial results to projected results.
these allegations are insufficient in light of our decision in silicon graphics,at.there,we rejected a plaintiff attempt to establish that defendant insiders had knowledge of alleged production and sales problems through general allegations that the defendants had received internal reports,including daily reports,monthly financial reports,stop ship reports,and flash reports.id.at.we stated that,if a plaintiff is to rely on the existence of reports as a means of establishing knowledge,she must include adequate corroborating details,such as the sources of her information with respect to the reports,how she learned of the reports,who drafted them,which officers received them,and an adequate description of their contents.id.at.the reason for requiring such detail was that every sophisticated corporation uses some kind of internal reporting system reflecting earlier forecasts,and that allowing a plaintiff to go forward with a case based on general allegations of negative internal reports would expose all those companies to securities litigation whenever their stock prices dropped.id.at.
as in silicon graphics,the plaintiffs here have failed to include corroborating details of the internal reports.indeed,the plaintiffs have failed to cite to any specific report,to mention any dates or contents of reports,or to allege their sources of information about any reports.the allegations are similarly deficient,for the same reasons,with respect to the defendants attendance at meetings and their managerial style.
statements concerning the marketability of vantive products 
the plaintiffs allege that vantive deliberately misled investors with respect to the marketability of its products.these allegations suffer from many of the same deficiencies as those discussed above.the complaint asserts that,throughout the class period,the vantive defendants continually stated that vantive experienced good demand for its vantive product in the and that its products were differentiated from competitors products by their high quality and superior functionality.according to the complaint,these statements were misleading because vantive core products were not substantially differentiated from the products of its competitors and did not have superior functionality or technological features resulting in slow sales of these products.there are no further allegations to indicate what slow sales were,or what is meant by the statements that vantive products were not substantially differentiated or superior to those of a competitor.and there are no facts alleged to show why the defendants would know that their representations were false or misleading if they were so.
similar deficiencies inhere in the complaint allegations that the defendants lied when representing that vantive was successfully successfully introduced vantive sales version for release.there are simply no details in the allegations that would make these representations that vantive version was not well received by customers,was known to be a disaster inside the company,as several of its software modules did not work properly that deployment of the product resulted in serious problems for vantive sales operations,requiring the investment of significant management resources to cure these operational problems and that vantive was not commercially viable due to defects in the product.nor are any corroborating facts alleged,or sources stated,for the allegation that luongo secretly ordered that vantive not be sold and that it be used as a pilot product until vantive could be introduced.
equally indefinite are the allegations supposedly rendering false the representations of the vantive defendants that vantive was successfully competing in the salesforce automation market.according to the complaint,this statement was misleading because vantive salesforce automation products all suffered from technological and performance shortcomings compared to competitive products.vantive automation products used an sql remote interface that was much less architecturally flexible than the sql anywhere interface.this put vantive at a significant competitive disadvantage,especially to siebel in the salesforce automation market,and resulted in customers refusing to place large orders for these products after pilot programs and increasingly refusing to even accept these products on a test or pilot basis.it also meant that siebel beat vantive in virtually every major salesforce automation contract.the vagueness of these allegations needs no elaboration there are no facts alleged to show how the imprecise deficiencies asserted to hamper the product affected vantive competitive position,what a major contract was,or whether the result rendered vantive in fact.and,once again,there is a total absence of factual allegations that would permit a strong inference that the defendants knew that their representations were false or misleading when made,if they were so,or that the defendants acted in deliberately reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.without any corroborating facts,it is impossible to conclude that such allegations rest on more than speculation.silicon graphics,at.
vantive alleged accounting manipulations 
the plaintiffs further alleged that vantive engaged in accounting manipulations that allowed vantive to inflate its revenues artificially.these allegations also fail to meet the pleading standard under the pslra.
a.the eds contract 
the plaintiffs first allegation is that vantive misled investors in the second quarter of when it said that it had signed a million deal with would generate revenue for vantive through year end and likely millions in revenue after that.according to the complaint,this statement was misleading because vantive had no basis to represent that the contract would be worth million,since the statement of work section stated only,to be determined.the complaint further alleges that,a s part of the secret side deals made with eds in the quarter of,vantive knew that the revenues from the eds reseller contract would not total million but,in fact,the revenues would total materially less.
a number of problems cripple this allegation.first,the complaint fails to allege how much money vantive ultimately recognized on the eds contract without this allegation,it is difficult to find a strong inference that vantive deliberately misled investors,because it is fully possible that vantive eventually did recognize million on the contract.in fact,the complaint hints at this possibility by indicating that vantive had recognized million on the contract through the first quarter of.second,the allegation includes no facts showing why an incomplete statement of work would necessarily mean that vantive had no basis to say that the contract was worth million.ronconi,at rejecting an allegation that a statement was misleading at the time made when a certain fact was not necessarily inconsistent with the defendant statement.under the pslra,the plaintiffs bear the burden of specifying the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.finally,the complaint fails to allege when the secret agreement was entered or why it made the earlier statements knowingly false or deliberately reckless when made.
secret change in revenue recognition policy 
the plaintiffs next allege that vantive secretly changed its revenue recognition policies for its reseller arrangements sometime during its fiscal year.according to the complaint,vantive began to account for its revenues from indirect sales in a much more aggressive fashion than it previously had done,prematurely recognizing millions in revenues by recording revenue on software licenses to resellers even though the resellers were not obligated to pay for those licenses until they sublicensed the product to the ultimate consumer.the result,according to the complaint,was that vantive indirect sales figures were inflated,marked by a jump in indirect sales revenues from of total sales revenues in to by the third quarter of 
the plaintiffs conclusion rests upon a comparison of vantive description of its revenue recognition policy on reseller contracts and its later description of the policy on march.prior to march,vantive described its revenue recognition policy as follows sublicense fees are generally recognized as reported by the reseller in relicensing the company products to end users.in its form filed on march,vantive continued to describe its revenue recognition policy using language identical to that quoted above,although it added a description of how revenues were recognized when the general policy was not followed 
in certain circumstances,sublicense fees are recognized upon the initial sale if all products subject to sublicensing are shipped in the current period,no rights of return policy exits sic,collection is probable,payment is due within one year,and fee is fixed or determinable sic.if these conditions are not met,the company does not recognize sublicense fees until reported by the reseller in the company products to.
as the district court properly observed,a major problem with the plaintiffs allegation here is that the language did not necessarily represent a change in policy.the earlier language did not represent that vantive always recognized revenues upon relicensing,but rather that it generally did so.
even more significantly,the complaint fails to allege facts making the challenged practice fraudulent or misleading.the fact that a buyer ultimately may return some goods does not preclude all recognition of revenues from sales to that buyer at the time they are made.see malone microdyne,cir.although the complaint,in addition to the eds allegation,alleges that vantive induced its distributors hbo and licensing international to accept millions of dollars of excessive software licenses for resale by promising them that they did not have to pay for them unless resales occurred,it fails to allege specific contemporaneous conditions known to the defendants that would strongly suggest that the defendants understood that their recognition of revenues on millions of dollars of software was excessive,that such recognition would result in overstated revenues.malone,at.finally,there is no sufficient allegation of the amounts by which revenues were allegedly overstated.greebel ftp software,cir noting that a basic detail in an accounting fraud allegation is the approximate amount by which revenues and earnings were overstated.indeed,although the complaint alleges that revenues were improperly accelerated from to,the graph provided by the plaintiffs indicates that indirect sales revenues in exceeded those of,an unlikely outcome if revenues had been improperly accelerated.nor are the allegations of improper recognition of revenues aided by allegations that vantive secretly entered into meetings with various distributors,because these allegations contain no specifics or corroborating details of time,persons,places,and subjects.silicon graphics,at allegations that there were meetings at which directors entered into a conspiracy of silence insufficient without corroborating details.
because scienter has not been adequately alleged,we need not dwell on the question whether falsity has been pled with particularity here,although we are convinced that it has not.the plaintiffs rely on cooper pickett,cir,to support their allegations of fraud as sufficient.but cooper was decided under the law as it existed prior to the pslra,and applied only the particularity requirements of.b for the allegations of fraud see id.at.the pslra,however,imposes stricter pleading requirements.for example,prior to the pslra,scienter could be alleged generally.see in re glenfed.sec,cir ronconi,at.under the pslra,of course,the plaintiffs are required to allege in detail facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.silicon graphics,at.the stricter standard for pleading scienter naturally results in a stricter standard for pleading falsity,because falsity and scienter in private securities fraud cases are generally strongly inferred from the same set of facts,and the two requirements may be combined into a unitary inquiry under the pslra.ronconi,at.these stricter standards have not been met by the complaint allegations of financial manipulation.
vantive financial forecasts 
in addition to the alleged misrepresentations discussed above,the plaintiffs allege that vantive lied to investors when making financial forecasts throughout the class period.because these forecasts are unquestionably statements,the plaintiffs must have alleged facts that would create a strong inference that the defendants made the forecasts with actual knowledge that the statement s were false or misleading at the time made.c b i.
the basis for this allegation of the plaintiffs is that,because the defendants were aware of the problems discussed above,the defendants knew that their forecasts could not possibly be accurate.this allegation is deficient because,as we have just demonstrated,the alleged problems upon which this allegation relies have themselves not been pleaded successfully.there are no facts alleged to show that the defendants knew their forecasts were false when made.
ii.stock sales corporate transactions 
the plaintiffs next focus on the defendants stock sales and vantive corporate transactions as an alternative basis for showing that the plaintiffs deliberately misled investors when making the representations alleged above.insider stock sales are not inherently suspicious they become so only when the level of trading is dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.ronconi,at.among the relevant factors to consider in making this determination are the amount and percentage of shares sold by insiders the timing of the sales and whether the sales were consistent with the insider prior trading history.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.context is important,especially for assessing the weight to attach to the timing of the sales.see greebel,at.
defendants stock sales 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants collectively sold shares of stock totaling in proceeds over the class period,amounting to an aggregate sale of of the defendants holdings the district court determined that,although these figures represented a substantial amount of trading,the allegations failed to raise a strong inference of fraud.having examined the specific circumstances of each of the defendants stock sales alleged in the complaint,and the circumstances of the defendants stock sales overall,we agree with the district court.
before we examine the individual defendants sales,we point out some overarching considerations.first,the plaintiffs have selected an unusually long class period of weeks.silicon graphics,at alleging a class period of weeks ronconi,at alleging a class period of thirty weeks.it is obvious why they have done so it is not because the allegations found elsewhere in the complaint support an inference of fraud throughout the class period,but because lengthening the class period has allowed the plaintiffs to sweep as many stock sales into their totals as possible,thereby making the stock sales appear more suspicious than they would be with a shorter class period.the class period begins in april.as we have already pointed out,however,the allegations of misrepresentation in including allegations that revenues were accelerated into are woefully inadequate,and vantive met its earning projections for.if the class period had begun in december instead of april,the defendants aggregate stock sales would plummet from million to approximately million,and their stock sales would hardly be dramatically out of line with prior trading practices,ronconi,at the defendants aggregate sales in the preceding seven months would have exceeded the sales during the class period.
second,we have upheld dismissals of complaints that alleged stock sales considerably larger than those alleged here.in ronconi,for example,we affirmed the dismissal of a complaint that alleged that seven of eleven insider defendants had sold or more of their shares and options,and an eighth defendant had sold of her total shares,over a considerably shorter class period than the class period alleged here.id.at.similarly,in in re apple computer sec,cir,we upheld summary judgment to defendants where it was undisputed that the defendants had sold million in stock sales over a period.these cases reveal that,by themselves,large numbers do not necessarily create a strong inference of fraud.
third,we observe that the insufficient allegations of fraud elsewhere in the complaint have a spillover effect here.it is true that in our prior decisions we have severed our discussion of stock sales from other allegations in the relevant complaints.see ronconi,at silicon graphics,at.but stock sales are helpful only in demonstrating that certain statements were misleading and made with knowledge or deliberate recklessness when those sales are able to be related to the challenged statements.in this case,the class period alleged is so long,and the virtually identical allegations recycled throughout the complaint so many times,that it becomes difficult to see how particular stock sales would strengthen allegations that particular statements were uttered with deliberate recklessness at the times they were made.this fact operates to the detriment of the plaintiffs,because it is their burden under the pslra to provide a clear context from which we can find a strong inference of fraud.see silicon graphics,at.
we now turn to the individual defendants stock sales.
chairman roger sippl 
chairman roger sippl stock sales were the largest among the defendants,both in terms of percentage and amount.sippl sold of his holdings over the class period,for a total of approximately half of the defendants total of million in sales.while these sales were clearly suspicious in amount,they were not suspicious in timing and do not appear to have been calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.ronconi,at.
twelve million of sippl nineteen million dollars in sales occurred in the first month of the class period,starting late april,well over a year before the july press release upon which the plaintiffs largely base their lawsuit.during this first month,no defendant other than sippl sold a single share of stock,nor did any other defendant sell a single share for an additional two months after sippl had finished selling the million in stock.had sippl been selling these shares to dump what he knew was artificially inflated stock,other equally or more knowledgeable defendants presumably would have done the same thing.id.at one insider sales do not support the strong inference required by the statute where the rest of the equally knowledgeable insiders act in a way inconsistent with the inference that the favorable characterizations of the company affairs were known to be false when made.creating further doubt that sippl was operating on inside knowledge at this time is the fact that he sold the overwhelming majority of shares for between and per share,when the price of the stock continued to increase in the several months following these sales,and ultimately peaked at.id.at noting that there is no strong inference of scienter when insiders miss the boat by selling at share prices between and,when the share price ultimately rises to.
sippl remaining million in sales do not substantially support an inference of fraud either.because the complaint gives no reason to conclude that sippl sale of million in stock in may of was anything but valid,sippl million in sales over the course of the final fourteen months of the class period were not inconsistent with sippl prior trading history.see id.at.the overwhelming majority of sippl remaining sales occurred in november,when the price of stocks hovered at approximately per below a price at which sippl could be seen to have maximized the value of alleged inside knowledge.see id.three of the six other defendants did not sell any stock during the month of november,nor did they sell any during the two months before and after november finally,sippl is not alleged to have uttered a word,or have participated in preparing statements,during the entire class period.silicon graphics,at insider failure to utter any of the allegedly false statements helped dispel an inference of fraud that the plaintiffs asserted flowed from that insider stock sales.
there accordingly is no basis for finding circumstantial evidence of fraud in sippl stock sales.if his sales are excluded,the defendants aggregate sales drop considerably,from million to million.
chief executive officer john luongo 
chief executive officer john luongo sold only of his total number of shares and vested options over the course of a period.under our precedent,this figure is not suspicious,and does not support a strong inference of fraud.see ronconi,at holding that a defendant sale of of his shares and options over a period was not suspicious.indeed,rather than supporting an inference of fraud,luongo sales tend to negate such an inference.in his position as ceo and as the person most quoted in the complaint,luongo was presumably in the best position to know the true facts.yet his trading percentage belies any intent to rid himself of a substantial portion of his holdings.
executive vice president charles lochhead 
defendant charles lochhead,an executive vice
