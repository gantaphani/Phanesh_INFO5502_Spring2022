on this appeal we construe a complaint in a securities fraud case brought by stockholders against a book publisher and one of its officers.it is the book publisher practice to count as income the proceeds of any book it sells to a retailer or distributor,while at the same time granting to such buyers a full right of return.the number of returns is therefore critical to profitability in the publishing business because when returns occur the publisher not only has unsold inventory back on its hands,but,also,income it has previously declared never materializes.
plaintiffs allege that during the class period defendants knew returns had increased significantly,and that this negative corporate development later precipitated a large loss and a steep plunge in the company publicly traded stock.the company is said to track book returns on a monthly and weekly basis,and to have daily information available to it from other sources as well.but despite such data establishing an adverse trend,the company announced publicly that its return rates were running at normal levels.
defendants maintain,in effect,that there are no allegations in the complaint that would support proofs of either false statements or a fraudulent intent.to the contrary,we think plaintiffs sufficiently allege an unusual business model which,if proven,ignored alarmingly high returns that function as an obvious straw to show which way the wind was blowing in this book business.they may also be able to prove that the defendant officer,represented to stock analysts to be a key spokesperson,cashed in percent of his stock while disseminating information that the company was not experiencing financial difficulties.for a spokesperson to cash in his own stock can in appropriate circumstances be like a ship captain exiting into the safety of a lifeboat while assuring the passengers that all is well.a jury could find defendants liable for such behavior if its existence were supported by sufficient evidence.as such,plaintiffs in our view have survived the pleading stage of this securities fraud litigation.
background 
lawrence hollin,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,began the instant class action securities fraud suit against defendant scholastic corporation,a book publishing company,and its officer richard robinson in the united states district court for the southern district of new york keenan.the complaint asserted claims pursuant to b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b,rule promulgated thereunder,and a of the exchange act,a a consolidated amended complaint was filed august,and dismissed on december,following a rule b motion brought by defendants,see in re scholastic.sec,civ,wl,and the district court granted plaintiffs leave to amend.
on march,lead plaintiffs richard truncellito and the city of philadelphia filed a corrected second consolidated amended class action complaint.they named scholastic and raymond marchuk,who serves as scholastic vice president for finance and investor relations,as defendants.the plaintiff class includes those persons who purchased scholastic common stock during the class period and who sustained damages allegedly because defendants made materially false and misleading statements and concealed adverse facts regarding their publishing business,thereby causing plaintiffs to purchase the stock at artificially inflated prices.
defendants in response filed another motion to dismiss under rule b,arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a claim and failed to plead fraud with particularity,as required under federal rule of civil procedure b and the private securities litigation reform act securities reform act,stat.the district court granted the motion.see in re scholastic.sec.litig.scholastic,civ,wl.
on appeal,we examine the factual allegations set out in plaintiffs second amended complaint in some detail,assuming them,as we must,to be true.novak kasaks,cir,cert.denied,d.
scholastic business and its operations prior to the class period 
plaintiffs allegations reveal that scholastic is a leading publisher and distributor of children books,classroom and professional magazines,and other educational products,which it sells through retail distributors,book clubs,book fairs,classrooms and libraries.in the years leading up to,scholastic product was goosebumps,a series of scary children books.prior to december,defendants had expanded goosebumps distribution to mass merchandisers and other retailers.this change in strategy was presented to the public as a significant positive development.
what the public did not know was that scholastic shipped books to retailers and distributors with a full right of return.in so doing,scholastic could,under generally accepted accounting principles,record revenues upon shipment to the retailer so long as an adequate reserve provision existed for books that might be returned.in june,scholastic announced through a press release that it was adopting statement of accounting standard,which requires a more frequent evaluation of inventory and a when appropriate.
prior to its change in distribution strategy,scholastic boasted one of the lowest book return rates in the children book publishing industry.on september,merrill lynch issued a report on scholastic return rates that incorporated statements made at a meeting with senior scholastic officers that included defendant marchuk.these officers represented that the company return rate historically ran at to percent,as compared to percent rates at other book publishers,goosebumps books were being returned at even less than percent,and while the expansion into the mass retail market could cause the return rate to rise,it would rise only modestly.scholastic officials added that the issue of managing return exposure is one that gets considerable management attention.no one at scholastic corrected this report when it appeared.
first quarter results,ending august,recorded a loss worse than had been experienced in the same quarter the previous year.nevertheless,on september,merrill lynch issued another report derived from statements by company officials that scholastic return rates remain among the lowest in the industry at less than,which might suggest that goosebumps has been somewhat underdistributed.
b.what allegedly occurred during the class period 
the class period in this lawsuit begins on december,the day scholastic issued a press release announcing a net income for the second quarter of the fiscal year,which ended november.the income represented a percent increase over the comparable period for the prior year.the class period ends on february,when scholastic issued another press release announcing an expected third quarter loss of to cents per share.prior to this release,scholastic had expressed comfort with income estimates of to cents per share.scholastic news of an expected loss also contrasted with estimates by stock analysts that scholastic would realize a net income of approximately cents per share.the february press release stated further that scholastic would take a million special charge consisting of a reserve for anticipated additional book returns.the next day,scholastic stock fell percent or per share.another million special charge for book returns was taken in the following quarter.industry analysts thereafter questioned the credibility of scholastic management with respect to what officials knew and how long they had known it before scholastic made the third quarter announcement.
what happened between the december,and february,press releases forms the basis for plaintiffs lawsuit.defendants are alleged to have disseminated false information,withheld damaging truthful information and failed to update prior public statements that had become materially misleading.in addition,defendant marchuk is alleged to have sold a large percentage of his scholastic stock within a week time starting at the end of,and plaintiffs further claim that marchuk influenced scholastic decision to disseminate false and misleading statements in ways that would cause him to be liable as a controlling person as that term is defined in a of the exchange act.
discussion 
the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b is reviewed on appeal de novo.see rothman gregor,cir.accepting all of the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiffs,see press chem.inv.servs,cir,dismissal is proper only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations,hishon king spalding,d.to decide whether plaintiffs have sufficiently pled facts in support of their claims,we look to the elements of a securities fraud and a liability claim.
i section b securities fraud claim 
for a plaintiff to state a viable cause of action for securities fraud under b,b,and rule,b,the complaint must allege that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,defendant,acting with scienter,either made a false material representation or omitted to disclose material information so that in reliance either on defendant false representation or its failure to disclose material injury and damages.see rothman,at.the exchange act,as amended by the securities reform act also requires that the complaint shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b supp.v.
specificity is also required by the federal rules of civil procedure,which provide that i n all averments of fraud the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.b.the complaint must identify the statements plaintiff asserts were fraudulent and why,in plaintiff view,they were fraudulent,specifying who made them,and where and when they were made.mills polar molecular,cir.
false material representation or failure to disclose material information 
in their complaint,plaintiffs identify specific statements or sets of statements believed to be materially false and misleading.the first is the press release issued by scholastic on december,announcing its net income for the second quarter of the fiscal year.
the second set of statements arises out of a conference call with analysts the day after the press release was issued,in which defendant marchuk is alleged to have participated.merrill lynch issued a report on december stating that defendants emphasized that the front list of newer goosebumps titles demonstrated strong growth and that any flattening of trade revenues was due to older titles.although merrill lynch also reported defendants as saying the quarterly retail sales results were distorted and had suffered in comparison to the second quarter for the previous year,deutsche morgan grenfell reported on december,that defendants continued to maintain that a percent growth in goosebumps retail sales was reasonable.defendants received copies of these reports and made no corrections.
third,plaintiffs point to the prospectus supplement issued by scholastic on december,in connection with its sale of million in notes,in which the company reported second quarter results and stated that t rade sales remained constant from the prior year strong second quarter performance.profitable second quarter results were also reported in scholastic form filed on january.
merrill lynch issued another report on january,again based on discussions with senior scholastic officials including marchuk.these officials said no surge in book returns had occurred,which merrill lynch considered important since it viewed returns as a significant stock risk after scholastic initiated mass market distribution.merrill lynch raised its rating on scholastic stock from neutral to accumulate.that recommendation caused scholastic stock to rise by per share.
following this report,merrill lynch contacted scholastic in early february to inquire about return rates.defendant maintained that returns were at normal levels,previously represented to be between and percent.less than three weeks later,scholastic issued its february press release announcing expected losses for the third quarter.
trends adequately alleged 
pursuant to,promulgated by the securities and exchange commission,defendants were required to disclose on form any known trends that would have or were reasonably likely to have a material impact on revenues.the trial court found the complaint had inadequately pleaded the existence of such trends and therefore found it failed to identify false or misleading statements.scholastic,wl,at.we think plaintiffs were held to a more stringent standard than the law requires and that the trend in declining sales and increasing returns is adequately alleged.
decline in sales.the complaint specifically sets out the distributors through which goosebumps books were sold,and alleges declines in sales as of specific dates,some in terms of percentage and others in terms of quantity.such information covers over of scholastic trade business in goosebumps.
for example,according to the complaint,advanced marketing services incorporated ams represents percent of goosebumps sales.it was selling sets of goosebumps per week in june,but only sets per week in the fall of.it downloads data pos data into its computers on a daily basis and permits scholastic to download that same information.
ingram distribution group,which accounts for percent of the goosebumps trade,is said to have experienced a significant decrease in goosebumps sales in the fall of.its orders dropped from copies per title in september to per title in january and february.according to a senior manager at ingram,this decline in a series was the steepest he had seen in his years of experience in the book business.ingram transmitted this information to scholastic electronically and also collected pos data that was available to scholastic.
further,trade sales of goosebumps books through aramark corporation,a book distributor that sells to mass retailers target,walmart and kmart,allegedly dropped percent between september and the fall of.target tracked goosebumps sales on a weekly basis and sent its reports to the sales department at scholastic.
the complaint similarly states that caldor corporation sold to books per week in september,but only books per week in september.its retail sales dropped further to books per week in january.scholastic is said to have known of these trends both because caldor orders for goosebumps books decreased,and because caldor tracked daily sales figures and made them available to scholastic.
plaintiffs allege that scholastic not only had access to pos data,but also reviewed it.scholastic thus knew how a substantial percentage of its goosebumps books were selling in the trade market on at least a weekly basis,and also,therefore,the growing number of unsold goosebumps books distributors and retailers had in inventory that were subject to full return.
increase in returns.again,according to plaintiffs,the information on goosebumps books returned each day to scholastic warehouse in jefferson city,warehouse through which the company processes and fulfills most orders for trade entered into an computer at the warehouse.that information,in turn,is transferred each night to scholastic corporate offices.by christmas,greg wong,a scholastic employee responsible for evaluating inventory levels in scholastic new york office,allegedly told the inventory manager at the jefferson city warehouse that the situation for goosebumps had taken a turn for the worse and returns would continue to mount because many titles were overstocked and overbought.
plaintiffs further allege defendant marchuk monitored internal data.along with leslie lista,scholastic comptroller,he compiled and distributed a director book each month to all members of the board.the director book analyzed trade sales data and provided commentary on sales trends.moreover,trade sales figures were sent to the head of each scholastic division on a weekly basis,and the sales department received weekly trade book sales reports,title by title,from the company jefferson city warehouse.
with respect to outside information,toys r us returned an unusually high amount of goosebumps books in december,after advising scholastic earlier in the month that their increasingly scary content was resulting in a significant growth in returns.returns from distributor levy home entertainment began to rise to unprecedented levels in november and december.its returns in january equaled to percent of october and november sales.by january the amount of returned books consigned to the employee bookstore had grown to such an extent that little room existed to walk into the store.
the complaint asserts that ultimately,returns for january amounted to about or million,an increase of percent over january levels.the complaint also alleges that this information was known to defendants in early february,prior to the time when defendants allegedly assured merrill lynch that returns remained at normal levels.
pleadings sufficiently specific.the district court viewed certain allegations regarding december book returns as too vague.scholastic,wl,at.yet,a reasonable inference can be drawn that if goosebumps sales through ams and aramark declined throughout the fall of,and sales through ingram and caldor dropped by about percent from september through january,then a decline was also experienced through the month of december.
with respect to sales,the district court faulted plaintiffs for employing period information in their pleadings,and for not relying instead on sales data from the relevant period,that is,from december that it said would have shown that declining sales were made known to defendants.scholastic,wl,at.data is relevant in this case,however,to establish that at the start of the class period,defendants had a basis for knowing increased goosebumps sales were unlikely in the third quarter due to marked decreased sales experienced in the second quarter.just as our cases have relied on period data to confirm what a defendant should have known during the class period,see,rothman,at novak,at,so the same logic applies here.
any information that sheds light on whether class period statements were false or materially misleading is relevant.even with the heightened pleading standard under rule b and the securities reform act we do not require the pleading of detailed evidentiary matter in securities litigation.see ross robins,cir.moreover,the district court failed to take into account the alleged facts that scholastic reviewed pos data made available by ams and caldor on a daily basis,by target on a weekly basis and by ingram to learn returns would be on the rise.
plaintiffs also include allegations as to statistics.in san leandro emergency medical group profit sharing plan philip morris companies,cir,we held that an unsupported general claim of the existence of confidential company sales reports that revealed a larger decline in sales is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.we then cited cases from other circuits stating that a plaintiff needs to specify the internal reports,who prepared them and when,how firm the numbers were or which company officers reviewed them.id.at citing serabian amoskeag bank shares,cir specific identification of internal report held sufficient,superseded by statute on other grounds,see greebel ftp software,cir,and arazie mullane,cir failure to give specific identification held insufficient.plaintiffs have satisfied this standard by specifying who prepared internal company reports,how frequently the reports were prepared and who reviewed them.we further observe that the complaint gives additional indications as to the nature of the reports,because the allegations are immediately preceded and followed by figures from retailers to show sales were declining.in san leandro,we noted that plaintiffs had simply made an unsupported general claim that confidential company sales reports existed to contradict public statements.see at.plaintiffs here instead have gone beyond the bare pleadings found in san leandro,and have met the criteria identified in arazie and serabian.
moreover,always according to the amended complaint,scholastic engaged in aggressive sales practices during the second and third quarters of its fiscal year.this,if proven,would furnish additional support for the proposition that company officials were aware of declining sales and increasing returns.these aggressive tactics,allegedly,included offering excessive discounts beyond the company normal practices for the purchase of additional books altering its return policy to delay the return of goosebumps books encouraging distributors to keep unsold books rather than return them and assuring distributors that scholastic would extend its billing period for sometimes for as long as six months.scholastic gave distributors free advertising dollars,subsidized freight costs when books were finally returned,and repackaged goosebumps books and merchandise at no cost.in this way,plaintiffs claim,defendant staved off or delayed disclosure of the huge amount of book returns to its inventory and delayed having to set up adequate reserves for the income it had reported,but due to huge returns would never receive.
the million special charge taken by scholastic in february lends yet more support to the notion that defendants had knowledge of increasing returns.as stated earlier,period data may be relevant to determining what a defendant knew or should have known during the class period.see rothman,at novak,at.and an inference,from the size of the special charge,that trade business in goosebumps books declined throughout the third quarter,is not unreasonable.further,since january returns amounted to about or million,the claim that scholastic took a charge almost three times that amount would support proofs that returns did not pile up only in that month,but throughout the class period.
consequently,we conclude that plaintiffs pleaded with sufficient particularity facts necessary to show a downward trend with respect to goosebumps profitability.the facts alleged are sufficient to establish a trend even in the face of the admittedly cyclical nature of scholastic business.scholastic explained in the september press release that its first quarter loss was not uncommon because of higher expenses not offset by greater revenues in the summer months.but,with the second and third quarters covering months when revenues should have increased,plaintiffs have alleged enough to permit proofs that scholastic should have been alerted,by decreased sales and increased returns,to negative business results in the relevant time frame.
further throwing doubt on its retail sales being subject to the cyclical nature of the school calendar,scholastic ceo said in a press release that goosebumps books continued to sell well in trade even during the first quarter.if the books were selling well during typically slower summer months,and data began to show the books were not selling well during scholastic usually busier fall and winter months,plaintiffs could show defendants knew they had a problem that would affect the price of their stock and recklessly failed to acknowledge it at the time.
we conclude therefore that the facts alleged are sufficiently detailed to allow the plaintiffs to present proofs that the defendants knew,despite the fact that their business was cyclical,of a material downward secular trend.it may be that at summary judgment,or even at trial,the defendants demonstrate so profoundly cyclical a business and a strong enough link between normal cycles and the negative information available to them,that a reasonable jury could not find that they violated the securities laws.but any speculation to that effect is inappropriate at the pleadings stage.
the securities reform act imposes on plaintiffs the obligation to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b see also novak,at reaffirming that second circuit case law remains the standard after passage of the act.plaintiffs can plead scienter by a alleging facts demonstrating that defendants had both the motive and an opportunity to commit fraud or b otherwise alleging facts to show strong circumstantial evidence of defendants conscious misbehavior or recklessness.see novak,at.
