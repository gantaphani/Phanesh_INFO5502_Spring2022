the issue before us is whether the amended complaint in this securities fraud class action states a claim under the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,b.the district court held that it did not,and dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice.the plaintiffs appeal,and we affirm.
background 
this action is brought under sections b and of the securities exchange act of act,b and,and rule of the securities exchange commission,rule.the plaintiffs investors allege violations of the act and rule on behalf of a class of investors who bought navarre stock between november,and july,the class period.the defendants are the navarre corporation and certain of its officers and directors.for the purpose of a motion to dismiss,we assume that the facts alleged in the amended complaint are true.florida state bd.of admin.green tree financial,cir.
navarre is a major distributor of music,software and interactive and dvds.through its subsidiary,netradio corporation,navarre also owns and operates netradio network,a leading audio content provider on the internet.eric paulson has been the chairman of the board of directors and president and chief executive officer of navarre since.the other named defendants in this action are officers or members of the board of directors.on may,navarre purchased a fifty percent interest in netradio,and the following year navarre purchased the other half of netradio.the netradio purchase capped a successful five years during which navarre grew from million in sales in to million in.however,the netradio purchase drained navarre working capital,forcing officials to raise million through a private placement in may.
as early as july,navarre hoped to take advantage of the lucrative internet market by taking netradio public.according to the investors,navarre stood to benefit from such an ipo because netradio was valued by navarre as a zero asset on its books.in the months leading up to the class period,the defendants increased the number of public announcements about navarre and ultimately began making announcements about the netradio ipo.on july,netradio issued a press release stating that it intended to file a registration statement with the sec for an ipo of netradio common stock.however,a depressed market put netradio ipo plans on hold until october and november,the time at which the class period begins.
in the amended complaint,the investors allege several fraudulent schemes.first,the investors allege that navarre issued false and misleading statements that it was in the final stage of spinning off a subsidiary and taking the newly formed company public by the end of the year,which created heightened demand for navarre netradio hype.second,the investors allege that navarre participated in a ship and store scheme that artificially inflated navarre stock price.both of these schemes,according to the investors amended complaint,artificially inflated navarre stock price and allowed the individual defendants to sell navarre stock at a large profit.
a.the netradio hype 
the amended complaint sets forth many public statements made by navarre regarding the netradio ipo during the class period.the investors pinpoint the following statements and allege that the defendants,in each instance,knew or were reckless in not knowing that the statements were false 
in november,navarre began making public statements that it would complete the netradio ipo by the end of the year,which created heightened demand for navarre stock.investors also allege that paulson said the ipo would happen soon.
on november,after paulson allegedly confirmed efforts to sell netradio shares in a public offering,the price of navarre stock more than doubled to.
on november,a transcript from cnnfn states t he company has publicly admitted that it is working to bridge netradio out as an ipo before the end of the year.spoke with a company spokesmen sic who did confirm that the company is trying to bring the ipo out.the identity of the speaker was not disclosed by cnnfn.
on december,a navarre spokeswoman confirmed that navarre would spin off netradio,but said navarre had not yet registered a filing with the sec.
on december,paulson told a reporter with cnbc that in order to spin off netradio in an ipo,navarre would have to file documents with the sec and may need shareholder approval.additionally,paulson announced navarre had retained everen securities,to complete the ipo within days.
in december or january,rather than correcting the information,paulson held a conference saying he was reasonably comfortable that the netradio ipo would occur by early february.navarre stock traded above per share at that time.
on february,a story from the minneapolis star tribune stated that navarre was expected to file a registration statement with the sec early the following week.a spokesman for navarre declined to comment.navarre stock surged to at or above per share.
on february,navarre retreated from the previous announcement but still confirmed plans for an ipo within the next several weeks.
on march,netradio filed a registration statement but the investors allege that navarre stopped discussing the ipo altogether at that time and navarre stock began a downward trend beginning in late may.
by june,navarre stock traded at per share.navarre june,reported that there can be no assurance that netradio will successfully complete the offering.
on july,navarre disclosed that the netradio ipo would not occur before september and that navarre was interviewing new investment bankers to replace everen securities,which was in the midst of its own pending acquisition announced april.the investors allege that at that time everen securities had completed almost no work on the netradio ipo.
netradio ultimately completed its ipo on october.
b.the ship and store scheme 
in addition to the netradio hype scheme,the investors also allege that b y utilizing improper accounting practices,defendants reported revenues on products that had been shipped to warehouses,as opposed to purported customers of navarre even though defendants anticipated most of the products would be returned and had no expectations that navarre would be paid.this scheme,the investors state,contributed to the artificial inflation of navarre stock during the class period and allowed the individual defendants to sell large portions of their company stock,realizing great profits.
the investors allege that in order to compensate for revenue shortfalls between what navarre had publicly forecast and navarre actual sales,defendants implemented a scheme to meet or exceed projected sales.this was accomplished by increasing navarre product offerings,or label list,and inducing customers to sign ship and store agreements that allowed navarre to ship product offerings to a storage facility and invoice the customer as if the customer had received the products.further,it is alleged that navarre authorized its sales managers to offer the customer free shipping,allowed them to waive the order down payment and assure customers that they would not have to pay the invoice until the product was actually received.by doing this,defendants were able to report a growing volume of sales transactions and record them as revenue throughout the fiscal year.the investors allege that this scheme violated many generally accepted accounting principles gaap and ultimately unraveled when the stored products failed to yield revenue or the merchandise was returned to navarre possession.as a result,navarre reported a million loss in,which the investors attribute to anticipated sales returns.
insider sales 
according to the investors,the alleged wrongdoing resulted in an avalanche of insider trading as the individual defendants began to liquidate their stock holdings in the company.specifically,the individual defendants sold a total of shares of their combined stock ownership,or about twelve percent of their navarre stock,realizing million in proceeds.
the district court dismissed the appellant amended complaint,holding that investors failed to plead facts supporting the ship and store scheme with sufficient particularity because they failed to provide the who,when,where or how of the alleged fraud scheme,investors did not allege facts to support their assertion under the netradio hype theory that the statements attributable to defendants were false when made because the investors merely set forth blanket assertions that the statements were false without providing a supporting factual basis for same investors failed to plead entanglement by the defendants with any statements by reporters or analysts,investors failed to sufficiently plead any material misrepresentation by defendants,investors failed to plead facts creating a strong inference of scienter on the part of defendants as required by the pslra,and because investors failed to present an actionable claim under b or,the section a claim was necessarily dismissed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court order dismissing a complaint on the pleadings and accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint.novak kasaks,cir,cert.denied,d.whereas the court must accept as true all of the complaint factual allegations and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,kohl casson,cir,under the reform act,we disregard or blanket assertions that do not live up to the particularity requirements of the statute.florida state bd.of,at.
u nder the reform act,a securities fraud case can not survive unless its allegations collectively add up to a strong inference of the required state of mind.congress has effectively mandated a special standard for measuring whether allegations of scienter survive a motion to dismiss.while under rule b all inferences must be drawn in plaintiffs favor,inferences of scienter do not survive if they are merely reasonable rather,inferences of scienter survive a motion to dismiss only if they are both reasonable and strong inferences.

securities fraud pleading standard 
rule,promulgated by the securities and exchange commission under section b of the act,prohibits fraudulent conduct in the sale and purchase of securities.florida state bd.of,at in re nationsmart.sec,cir.section of the act extends liability under section b and rule to any controlling person.a.rule provides that it is unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
standing under b and rule requires a showing of misrepresentations or omissions of material fact or acts that operated as a fraud or deceit causation,often analyzed in terms of materiality and reliance damages and fraudulent activity occurring in connection with the purchase and sale of a security.alpern utilicorp united,cir.although not explicitly mentioned in the text of the rule,scienter is nevertheless an essential element of a rule claim.florida state bd.of,at.scienter means the intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.in re nationsmart.sec,at citation omitted.
to determine whether the facts pleaded in the amended complaint are adequate,we review them in light of the pleading standard the investors have to satisfy.complaints brought under rule and section b are governed by special pleading standards adopted by congress in the pslra.these pleading standards are unique to securities and were adopted in an attempt to curb abuses of securities fraud litigation.florida state bd.of,at.congress enacted two heightened pleading requirements for securities fraud cases.the first requires that the complaint specify each false statement or misleading omission and explain why the omission was misleading.b.the second requires that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the scienter required for the cause of action.b.id.
prior to the enactment of the pslra,pleadings were evaluated under federal rule of civil procedure b for particularity.parnes gateway,cir.contrary to the district court analysis,the investors technically do not need to meet the requirements of both federal rule of civil procedure b and the pslra,as the pslra supercedes reliance on b in securities fraud cases and embodies the standards of b.lipton pathogenesis,cir noting that the pslra changed the pleading requirements in private securities fraud litigation previously governed by b by requiring that a complaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter city of philadelphia fleming,cir the scienter pleading requirements of the pslra supercede the provisions of rule b in securities fraud cases.citation omitted greebel,at the effect of the pslra is to embody in the act itself at least the standards of rule b.specifically,the pslra requires that both falsity and scienter be pleaded with particularity.under b,m alice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person could be averred generally.b.with these standards in mind,we turn to the adequacy of the investors pleadings.
netradio hype 
direct statements 
the first heightened pleading requirement congress enacted for securities fraud cases under is that the complaint must specify each false statement or misleading omission and explain why the omission was misleading.b.the purpose of this heightened pleading requirement was generally to eliminate abusive securities litigation and particularly to put an end to the practice of pleading fraud by hindsight.in re vantive,at quoting in re silicon graphics.sec,cir.the investors fail to plead the existence of any facts or further particularities that,if true,demonstrate that the defendants had access to,or knowledge of,information contradicting their public statements when they were made.
mere allegations of fraud are insufficient,even under the pleading standard.see parnes,at.some of the direct statements alleged to be fraudulent by the investors are paulson november,statement that navarre had hired an undisclosed investment bank to take its netradio unit public soon statements attributed to defendants generally that navarre would complete the netradio ipo by the end of the year paulson december,statement to cnbc that navarre planned to file a registration statement within sixty days paulson january statement during a conference call that he was reasonably comfortable that the netradio ipo would occur by early february and the allegation that on february,the defendants retreated from a prior announcement but still confirmed plans for an ipo within the next several weeks.any remaining allegations concern statements made by analysts and news reporters,which the investors allege represent a direct statement or quotation by a navarre insider or an endorsement of or failure to correct widely disseminated reports.
the general allegations contained in the amended complaint are inadequate under the heightened pleading standard of the pslra.the amended complaint fails to indicate why these statements would have been false or misleading at the several points in time in which it is alleged they were made.see in re vantive,at.simply alleging that defendants made a particular statement at a given time,without providing further particulars about who made the statement or when,and then showing in hindsight that the statement is false misses the pslra pleading requirement.corporate officials need not be clairvoyant they are only responsible for revealing those material facts reasonable available to them.novak,at.for example,the investors allege in paragraph of the amended complaint that d efendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that it would be impossible to file even a registration statement until march,but give no particulars as to why this must be true.why would the defendants have known of this impossibility the failure to plead this why with particularity in this example is indicative of the failings of the investors amended complaint.in sum,the investors failure to plead their allegations of fraudulent misstatements and omissions with particularity is insufficient and fatal under the pslra.
navarre liability for statements by analysts 
the representations made by third parties that the investors attribute to navarre are also insufficient under the pslra pleading standard.generally,securities issuers are not liable for statements or forecasts disseminated by securities analysts or third parties unless they have sufficiently entangled themselves with the analysts forecasts so as to render those predictions attributable to the issuers.elkind liggett myers,cir.in order to attribute statements to the defendants,the investors must demonstrate that the statements were adopted by the defendants or attributable to the defendants in some way,such as when officials of a company have,by their activity,made an implied representation that the information they have reviewed is true or at least in accordance with the company views.id.the investors could also allege that the defendants used the analysts as a conduit,making false and misleading statements to securities analysts with the intent that the analysts communicate those statements to the market.cooper pickett,cir.
the investors allege in paragraph thirty of the amended complaint that defendants began making public statements that it would complete the netradio ipo by the end of the year,and attach exhibit c as substantiation of that representation.exhibit c is a transcript from a cnn financial news program,on which cnn correspondent bill tucker stated 
the company has publicly admitted that it is working to bridge netradio out as an ipo before the end of the year.spoke with a company spokesmen sic who did confirm that the company is trying to bring the ipo out.
the investors fail to allege any facts demonstrating why this statement was false when made,or how this report is in any way attributable to the defendants other than the article assertion that the company has publicly admitted this fact.
another example of the insufficiency appears in paragraph of the amended complaint where the investors allege that o n february,navarre announced that it expected to file a registration statement with the sec early the following week.to substantiate this claim,investors attach a related news article reporting this representation.however,the attached news article printed in the february,edition of the minneapolis star tribune states that a spokesman for navarre declined to comment on their story.so,it is not clear who made the alleged announcement,where it was made,what it entailed,when it was made,why it was false when made or how plaintiffs are able to substantiate the allegation other than through an independent news source story.this pattern of pleading,which is consistent throughout the investors amended complaint,is hardly the stuff of particularity.
d.the ship and store scheme 
the investors further allege in their amended complaint that the defendants engaged in a ship and store scheme in an attempt to complement the previously discussed netradio hype scheme.by reporting sales increases the market would respond favorably to the company stock price and,once the stock price was driven upward,the individual defendants had an opportunity to unload their shares at artificially inflated prices.
the investors argue that they need not plead the exact amounts of the overstatements the precise details of each specific transaction especially where the subject matter of the fraud is uniquely within the defendants knowledge or control.while true,the investors must still allege with particularity the alleged fraudulent revenue recognition scheme.in re vantive,at.
the investors rely on cooper to support their allegations that the defendants overstated navarre revenue,claiming the facts in cooper virtually identical.however,cooper was decided prior to the effective date of the pslra,and applied the particularity requirements of federal rule of civil procedure b for allegations of fraud.in re vantive,at.the stricter standard for pleading scienter naturally results in a stricter standard for pleading falsity,because falsity and scienter in private securities fraud cases are generally strongly inferred from the same set of facts,and the two requirements may be combined into a unitary inquiry under the pslra.id.quoting ronconi larkin,cir.as such,cooper is not apposite,but certainly provides guidance,because as stated previously,the heightened pleading requirements under the pslra embody the prior standards of federal rule of civil procedure b.
in this case,the investors fail under either the or pleading requirements.the plaintiffs in cooper,as the investors point out,alleged the who,what,when,where and how of the alleged revenue recognition fraud.the plaintiffs in cooper provided names of clients,listed the dollar amounts of overstatements of revenues,net income,and earnings per share during particular quarters.cooper,at.the investors in this case have not come close to reaching this level of particularity.the investors only allege in their amended complaint that the defendants ensured that navarre reported consistent revenue gains quarter after quarter by employing a scheme whereby navarre increased its product list and engaged in a ship and store marketing scheme,which the investors generally describe.these allegations are insufficient.it is true that the investors need not describe in detail a single specific transaction or shipment carried out under this alleged scheme,id.at,but the investors must plead with particularity the who,what,when,where and how of this alleged scheme.this amended complaint is devoid of any details regarding time,persons,places,and subjects.in re vantive,at.
indeed,the investors plead with particularity that this alleged scheme violates gaap,but this is not enough.allegations of gaap violations are insufficient,standing alone,to raise an inference of scienter.novak,at.only where these allegations are coupled with evidence of corresponding fraudulent intent might they be sufficient.id.
the pslra requires that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendants acted with the scienter required for the cause of action.b.there is disagreement among the circuits concerning the meaning of the pleading standard and what it means in terms of the level of particularity now required to sufficiently plead scienter under the pslra.see florida state bd.of,at dividing the circuits that have interpreted the reform act into at least three camps.
stated simply,we view the investors amended complaint to determine whether they set forth facts that give a strong reason to believe that there was reckless or intentional wrongdoing.see id.at.this standard is not satisfied by any one particular method,such as the formulation adopted by the second circuit,see novak,at,but rather through various criteria developed throughout the circuits that look for badges of fraud.see helwig vencor,cir setting forth nine factors usually relevant to scienter,cert.dismissed,d greebel,at same.the reform act itself adopted only the standard,without codifying the particular methods of satisfying the standard.florida state bd.of,at.certainly,the body of law is instructive and we look to this case law for guidance.see id.at setting forth the congressional history and recognizing that the codification of the pslra occurred as a result of a review of the body of law dealing with each circuit pleading requirements regarding scienter.
the investors contend that a strong inference of scienter can be pleaded by allegations of either conscious or reckless conduct,including motive and opportunity on the part of defendants to commit fraud or facts constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious behavior or recklessness.the defendants contend that the investors fail to meet both the particularity requirement and the strong inference requirement under the pslra because the investors merely make rote allegations that the defendants knowingly made false statements of material fact.
in the amended complaint,the investors s
