background 
this securities fraud case is a class action on behalf of investors who purchased dura pharmaceutical securities between april,and february,the class period.this appeal is drawn specifically to alleged misleading and untrue statements made by dura and its officials collectively dura about dura albuterol spiros delivery device for asthma and dura ceclor cd antibiotic.during the class period,dura issued several press indicating satisfactory development and testing of the albuterol spiros device and claiming rising sales of ceclor cd,both of which appellants allege were known to dura and the individual defendants to be untrue.the most relevant statements are the following 
april,press release commenting on first quarter results dura announced that revenues and net income for the first quarter more than doubled over the same period last year.this press release also quoted a dura official as stating that he was very pleased with the first quarter results and that we are happy with the strong progress made in selling our new respiratory antibiotic ceclor cd.the release further stated that patient dosing was completed for clinical trials needed for nda new drug application submission of spiros albuterol sac

october,press release,commenting on results dura today reported record earnings for both the third quarter and nine months of,compared to the same periods last year pharmaceutical sales growth is principally attributable to the impact of new product acquisitions and introductions,such as ceclor cd sac 
november,press release,announcing submission of nda dura today announced that it has submitted a new drug application nda with the fda for albuterol spiros.sac 
january,press release,commenting on results dura reported record revenues for the quarter and the full year during the past year we significantly strengthened both the pharmaceutical product marketing and the spiros development arms of our business we have continued to demonstrate our capabilities as a respiratory marketing force as shown by the growth of our ceclor cd market share from at the beginning of to by.sac 
in the class period,dura stock reached a high of per share.on the last day of the class period,february,dura revealed that it expected revenues and earnings per share eps due to,inter alia,sales of ceclor cd.dura stock then dropped from on february,to on february,a loss.throughout the remainder of,dura business declined.in an april,conference call with stock analysts,dura revealed that as early as december,wholesale channels had been clogged with many months of excess inventory and that actual sales of several products,including ceclor cd,had in fact been declining.later,in november,dura also revealed that the fda found the albuterol spiros device not approvable due to reliability issues and chemistry,manufacturing,and control concerns.
appellants filed several class actions alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities and exchange act and rule promulgated by the securities commission,which,in due course,were consolidated.the district court granted dura motion to dismiss the consolidated and amended complaint but dismissed it without prejudice.in doing so,the court instructed the appellants as follows 
the amended complaint shall comply with federal rule of civil procedure,and concisely set forth each allegedly false or misleading statement or omission,and follow each statement or omission with the specific reasons why the statements were false when made or why the defendants had a duty to disclose.in addition,the plaintiffs shall specify which defendants made the statements and knew the true facts that should have been disclosed.
in re dura pharmaceuticals.securities litigation,nls wl.appellants subsequently filed the sac which the district court also dismissed,this time,however,with prejudice.
with respect to the albuterol spiros device,the district court found that appellants had not properly pled the loss causation element of a b violation.specifically,the district court focused on the last day of the class,dura revelation that day which led to the large drop in stock price 
the sac does not contain any allegations that the fda of the albuterol spiros device had any relationship to the february price drop.accordingly,the sac does not explain how the alleged misrepresentations and omissions regarding albuterol spiros touched upon the reasons for the decline in dura stock price.rather,the decline in dura stock price was the result of an expected revenue shortfall.accordingly,the sac allegations regarding albuterol spiros are insufficient to state a claim.
in re dura,slip op.at.the district court reasoned further that because the february announcement did not mention the albuterol spiros device,any omissions or misleading statements about this device could not be said to have caused the decline in price.therefore,the district court ruled that the loss causation element was not met.
turning to dura statements regarding ceclor cd sales made during the class period,the district court found that appellants allegations in the sac were not sufficient to indicate that these statements were false and made with knowledge of their falsity.id.at.the district court therefore held that the allegations in the sac were not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss based on the scienter requirement for a b violation.id.
the district court then dismissed the complaint with prejudice b ecause the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to amend the complaint to meet the pleading requirements under the pslra and silicon graphics.id.at.this appeal followed,and we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
a complaint dismissal under frcp b is reviewed de novo.see howard everex,cir.and on review,the court must accept the complaint allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see in re silicon graphics sec,cir.a district court denial of leave to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see in re vantive.sec,cir.
in order for plaintiffs to properly allege a claim brought under b of the securities exchange act of,they must state the following defendants made a false statement or omission with regard to a material fact in connection with the purchase or the sale of a security with scienter upon which plaintiffs reasonably relied and that proximately caused the alleged loss.see binder gillespie,cir.
loss causation 
the causation requirement in rule securities fraud cases includes both transaction causation,that the violations in question caused the plaintiff to engage in the transaction,and loss causation,that the misrepresentations or omissions caused the harm.id.at quoting mcgonigle combs,cir.in this circuit,loss causation is satisfied where the plaintiff shows that the misrepresentation touches upon the reasons for the investment decline in value.id.at quoting mcgonigle,at accord provenz miller,cir binder,at cir.
