this is a securities fraud action.it arises out of a failed investment by plaintiff emergent capital investment management,llc emergent,plaintiff,or appellant,in the preferred stock of defendant net value holdings,presently known as stonepath group,netv.plaintiff alleges that during the negotiations leading up to its investment in defendant,netv officers,defendants andrew panzo and lee hansen,repeatedly misrepresented the size of netv largest asset,its investment in a company called,brightstreet.emergent further asserts that defendants unlawfully failed to disclose defendant panzo history of failed investment projects undertaken in collaboration with one howard appel,an individual barred from the securities industry by the national association of securities dealers nasd.it is plaintiff contention that appel effectively controlled defendant through affiliated individuals and entities,a fact defendants should have but failed to disclose to emergent.read in the light most favorable to emergent,the complaint suggests that panzo,appel and their affiliated entities artificially inflated the stock prices of the companies controlled by appel,including netv,sold their own stock in those companies at high profits,and thereafter allowed the stock prices to plummet,rendering worthless other shareholders investments.
plaintiff sued defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before judge robert sweet.defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff second amended complaint under.b was granted in a judgment entered april.the district court ruled that the content of the stock purchase agreement between the parties precluded plaintiff from establishing reasonable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations and omissions.it did find,however,that plaintiff allegations of loss causation were sufficient.
to the extent that plaintiff claims are premised on defendants representations regarding the brightstreet investment,we agree that it can not establish reasonable reliance.plaintiff failure to insist that these representations be reflected in the written stock purchase agreement leads us to conclude that a sophisticated investor like emergent could not have reasonably relied on them.hence,that dismissal must be affirmed.
we find no similar defect in plaintiff claims premised on alleged omissions regarding panzo investment history and appel control of netv.we think that the second amended complaint contains legally sufficient allegations of a causal connection between the subject matter of these omissions and the ultimate decline in netv stock value,that is,loss causation.accordingly,we vacate the dismissal of these claims.
background 
plaintiff emergent,a delaware limited liability company with its principal office in new york city,manages an investment fund.its two managing members,daniel yun and mark waldron,own percent of its stock.both had previously worked in prominent wall street firms,and both have substantial business and investment experience.at the time of the events giving rise to this litigation,emergent managed between and million in investments.
defendant netv,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in california,is a holding company specializing in businesses.defendant andrew panzo is the chairman of its board of directors and is its chief executive officer ceo,and defendant lee hansen is its director and president.hansen is also a former roommate and personal friend of emergent managing member mark waldron.
factual allegations of the second amended complaint 
the following facts are alleged in plaintiff second amended complaint and must be accepted as true for purposes of reviewing a complaint dismissed under rule b.
netv solicitation of emergent investment and the resulting stock purchase 
in january netv began soliciting investors for a private placement of its securities.as part of this solicitation effort,netv president hansen approached his former roommate and plaintiff managing member,mark waldron,and arranged for a meeting in new york between the principals of the two companies.on january,hansen and netv ceo panzo met with waldron and yun.
during their presentation on the benefits of investing in netv preferred stock,panzo and hansen told waldron and yun that netv had invested approximately million in seven companies,and that the largest of those investments was a million purchase of a percent equity interest in brightstreet.the two netv executives also gave waldron and yun a brochure detailing information regarding their company,which repeated their oral representations with respect to the size of the brightstreet investment.
as a result of defendants solicitation,plaintiff in march purchased shares of netv preferred stock at per share,making a total investment of million.in the stock purchase agreement executed by the parties,netv made extensive warranties and representations regarding its capital structure,indebtedness,involvement in litigation,ownership and leases of real and personal property,and other matters connected with its business.the stock purchase agreement,in addition,contained a standard merger clause,stating that the agreement,together with accompanying documents,contain ed the entire understanding and agreement among the parties and supersede d any prior understandings or agreements between or among any of them.
prior to emergent purchase of netv stock,the size of the brightstreet investment had not been publicly disclosed in netv regulatory filings.two months later,in may,netv filed its form with the securities and exchange commission,disclosing that its investment in brightstreet amounted to million,not the million that it had represented to plaintiff.
panzo and appel investment history and appel ties to netv 
neither in negotiations leading up to plaintiff investment in netv nor in the stock purchase agreement itself did defendants mention any connection between netv and howard appel,who since had been barred by the nasd for life from associating with any member of that organization in any capacity.disbarment of appel for life came about,in part,because of his sale of unregistered securities to customers.plaintiff later learned that defendant ceo panzo had had a long history of collaborating with appel in various investment schemes.further,through a series of affiliated entities and individuals appel played a significant role in netv founding,financing and particularly,in its control.
panzo business relationship with appel began in,when panzo worked as an executive vice president in an investment bank owned and controlled by appel.after leaving the bank,panzo collaborated with appel on a number of investment projects,and their collaboration followed the same general pattern.appel,through an affiliated company,would acquire control of a public shell corporation and exercise that control to install panzo as a director or a senior officer,because appel himself,on account of his past record,could not be a director of a public company.with panzo in a top management position,the company would transfer substantial quantities of stock or warrants to appel and panzo affiliates,either in a sale transaction,or in payment for purported consulting or investment banking services,or as a finder fee in anticipation of a merger.then the two extraordinarily complex corporate legal maneuvers,often by way of subsidiaries of the companies of which they were principals,such as reverse mergers,stock exchanges between public and private corporations,reverse stock splits,a bewildering list of corporate name changes,and other corporate end up with large amounts of stock or warrants to purchase stock.appel affiliates would then sell the securities at a relatively high price,generating large profits for appel and panzo.subsequently,these companies stock became virtually worthless.
netv itself was similarly created through a merger of a public shell corporation with a private company largely owned by persons who were affiliated with appel,and who also had participated as shareholders in eight other ventures.after the merger,these persons became netv shareholders,and additional quantities of netv stock were first transferred to and later sold by another appel affiliate.
procedural history 
between january and march,when emergent negotiated with and invested in netv,the price of netv common stock generally remained between and per share.that price later fell to below per share.in the summer of,as the netv stock price was declining,emergent demanded rescission of the stock purchase agreement.once this demand had been rejected,it commenced in october its first civil action against defendants.the complaint alleged primarily that defendants had misrepresented the overall size of the stock offering in which plaintiff had participated.defendants answered the complaint,and,after some discovery,moved for a summary judgment.
on may,during the briefing of the summary judgment motion in the first action,plaintiff commenced a second action against defendants,alleging the same misrepresentations about the brightstreet investment that are at issue in this appeal.shortly thereafter,plaintiff filed its first amended complaint in the second action,alleging additionally failure to disclose appel and panzo shared investment history and netv ties to appel.defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint under.b,and emergent moved to consolidate the two actions.
in october the district court granted defendants motions for summary judgment in the first action and for a dismissal of the first amended complaint in the second action.see emergent capital inv,llc stonepath group,d.in the first action,the court dismissed claims of misrepresentations about the size of the offering because emergent could not demonstrate either reasonable reliance or loss causation.id.at.in the second action,the court also found no adequate allegation of loss causation and,with respect to alleged misrepresentations about the brightstreet investment,no reasonable reliance.id.at.the two actions were consolidated and emergent was granted leave to replead its first amended complaint.id.at.
emergent then filed the second amended complaint,which is the subject of this appeal and the factual allegations of which are described above.defendants again moved to dismiss on the grounds of reasonable reliance and loss causation,and the district court again granted their motion.although the trial court now concluded that emergent had adequately alleged loss causation,it found the allegations of reasonable reliance insufficient and dismissed emergent claims without leave to replead.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a cause of action.see caiola citibank,cir.dismissal is proper if,accepting all the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiff favor,the complaint fails to allege any set of facts that would entitle plaintiff to relief.id.
discussion 
i reasonable reliance 
in the second amended complaint,appellant asserts three causes of action a violation of b of the securities exchange act of and rule promulgated thereunder,see b controlling person liability under of the securities exchange act against defendants hansen and panzo,see and common law fraud.both parties reliance on new york authorities indicates their agreement that the common law fraud cause of action should be decided under the law of new york,where the alleged misrepresentations occurred.
for plaintiff to prevail on any one of its three theories for recovery,it has to establish reasonable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations or omissions.see harsco segui,cir see also a providing for controlling person liability for controlled person violations of federal securities laws.in assessing the reasonableness of a plaintiff alleged reliance,we consider the entire context of the transaction,including factors such as its complexity and magnitude,the sophistication of the parties,and the content of any agreements between them.see lazard freres protective life ins,cir harsco,at.
for example,in harsco,a buyer and a seller of a company executed a written agreement stating to certain aspects of the sold company seller was not making any representations beyond those listed in the agreement.at.some of the alleged misrepresentations,however,pertained to the very aspects of the operations that were covered by that disclaimer.id.at.based on the disclaimer content as well as on the sophistication of the parties to the transaction,we rejected the buyer federal securities and common law fraud claims for lack of reasonable reliance.id.
even more instructive is lazard freres.that case involved an attempted sale of several million dollars worth of bank debt between two large and sophisticated bank debt traders.at.during negotiations,the seller representative made false statements with respect to the content of a certain report on the debtor financial condition.at.in the context of the negotiations,the buyer had to make an oral commitment to the purchase before it had an opportunity to review the report.id.assessing the reasonableness of the buyer reliance on the seller representations regarding the report content,we reasoned that,as a sophisticated participant in the bank debt market,the buyer should have,and easily could have,protected itself from misrepresentation by demanding that it see the report prior to a closing.as the new york appellate division explained in similar circumstances 
where a party has been put on notice of the existence of material facts which have not been documented and he nevertheless proceeds with a transaction without securing the available documentation or inserting appropriate language in the agreement for his protection,he may truly be said to have willingly assumed the business risk that the facts may not be as represented.succinctly put,a party will not be heard to complain that he has been defrauded when it is his own evident lack of due care which is responsible for his predicament.
rodas manitaras,dep t emphasis added.after quoting that language from the state court opinion,lazard freres went on to hold that unless the oral purchase agreement allowed the buyer to withdraw from the transaction on discovering inaccuracies in the seller representations,the buyer failure to insist that the oral agreement grant it an out under such circumstances rendered reliance on the seller representations unreasonable as a matter of law.lazard freres,at.
here,as in lazard freres,plaintiff was a sophisticated investor.indeed,in the stock purchase agreement emergent represented that it had knowledge and experience in financial and business matters and that it could readily evaluate the risks of the transaction.further,it secured from defendants extensive contractual representations concerning netv financial condition and operations.
consequently,having been told that netv largest investment was its million purchase of an equity interest in brightstreet,emergent should have protected itself by insisting that this representation be included in the stock purchase agreement.given netv extensive contractual representations about other matters,appellant sophistication,and the size of the transaction,emergent failure to do so precludes as a matter of law a finding of reasonable reliance upon defendants misrepresentations about brightstreet.
appellant attempts to distinguish this case from lazard freres are unpersuasive.given the sophistication of this financial transaction and of the parties,and absent any allegation of a fiduciary relationship,the personal friendship between waldron and hansen does not make appellant reliance on the alleged representations reasonable.in addition,although in lazard freres we were reviewing a grant of summary judgment rather than a dismissal at the pleadings stage,this distinction is without a difference in the case at hand,as our ruling is based solely on the allegations contained in the second amended complaint and the language of the stock purchase agreement.nor is our conclusion undermined by the fact that the alleged misrepresentations were made both orally and in writing,and not solely orally as in lazard freres.to the contrary,the written reference to brights
