irving picard the trustee,trustee for the liquidation of bernard madoff investment securities llc blmis and of the bankruptcy estate of bernard madoff,initiated adversary proceedings seeking to block the settlement of three lawsuits,none of which involved blmis or the madoff estate as a party.the suits in question were brought by and on behalf of investors in feeder funds funds that channeled investments to madoff ponzi scheme against the funds themselves and other persons and entities affiliated with them.the trustee asserts that the settlements in these cases would hinder his ability to recoup fraudulent transfers he alleges blmis made to the settling defendants.in two separate proceedings,which we review in tandem on appeal,the district court victor marrero and jed rakoff,judges dismissed the trustee claims for declaratory and injunctive relief.picard fairfield greenwich,victor marrero,picard schneiderman,jed rakoff.because we conclude that the trustee is not entitled to declaratory relief and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his requests for injunctive relief,we affirm.
background 
the facts of the infamous ponzi scheme orchestrated by bernard madoff have been set forth in detail elsewhere.see,sec.investor prot.bernard madoff inv.sec.llc in re bernard madoff inv.sec.llc.we repeat them here only insofar as we think necessary to explain our decision in this appeal.the scheme success depended in part on the efforts of independent investment managers who channeled billions of dollars through financial vehicles feeder funds that invested largely or exclusively in blmis.while the money flowed from blmis,feeder fund investors enjoyed strong albeit returns,and the funds managers collected substantial fees as a result.after the discovery of the fraud and madoff december arrest by federal authorities in connection with it,the funds collapsed,leaving their investors with the specter of huge losses and precipitating litigation against the funds and their managers,auditors,custodians,and others.while investors pursued causes of action for,among other things,fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,the trustee filed his own legal actions on behalf of the blmis estate,seeking to claw back,obtain the return of money madoff had paid out as returns to the funds.where,as in the cases here on appeal,feeder fund investors sought assets from the same entities or individuals as did the trustee,the risk arose that their claims might conflict.
the feeder fund litigation 
a.the anwar action 
in december,a group of investors including pasha anwar the anwar plaintiffs filed a class action on behalf of individuals and entities who invested in four feeder funds founded and operated by the fairfield greenwich group the anwar action.these funds had,in turn,invested most of the anwar plaintiffs money with blmis.in their second consolidated amended complaint,filed on september,the anwar plaintiffs alleged various federal securities law violations,as well as common law tort,breach of contract,and causes of action against the funds,fairfield greenwich group,and a number of affiliated individuals collectively,the fairfield defendants see second consolidated amended,anwar fairfield greenwich,cv vm filed,ecf.these defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which the district court denied in two separate opinions.see anwar fairfield greenwich,d,marrero,holding that new york martin act,bus.law,did not preempt common law causes of action anwar fairfield greenwich,d,marrero,concluding that the plaintiffs had standing to pursue individual,direct claims against the fairfield defendants on various legal theories.
sometime in,the plaintiffs and the defendants in the anwar action began settlement talks.these negotiations intensified in may while the parties proceeded with discovery,and culminated several months later with an agreement in principle among the parties.the parties then presented a proposed settlement agreement to the district court,which preliminarily approved it on november.the agreement contemplated a million payment to the anwar plaintiffs by the fairfield defendants,and a million escrow fund funded by the fairfield defendants to support any future settlement or judgment amounts the fairfield defendants might pay the trustee.
on november,the eve of the district court preliminary approval of the parties proposed agreement,the trustee instituted an adversary proceeding in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york seeking to block the settlement the anwar stay application.picard fairfield greenwich,pro.filed.the anwar stay application sought a declaration that the settlement and the anwar action itself violated the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and the securities investor protection act sipa,as well as one or more of the stay orders issued by the district court in connection with the madoff liquidation and that the anwar action was therefore void ab initio.id.the stay application also contained a request that the bankruptcy court exercise its powers under section a of the bankruptcy code,a to preliminarily enjoin the anwar action until the trustee had completed his efforts to recoup the proceeds of specified alleged fraudulent transfers from the fairfield defendants.anwar stay application.on february,the district court granted the anwar plaintiffs motion to withdraw the reference to the bankruptcy court in the stay action.picard fairfield greenwich,see d.
pursuing a parallel strategy,the trustee counsel wrote to the court seeking to intervene in the anwar action directly.on march,treating this letter as a motion to intervene,the court denied it.the court also denied the trustee subsequent request to supplement the record.
on march,the district court issued one of the two decisions now before us on appeal,denying the anwar stay application in its entirety and directing that the adversary proceeding be closed.see picard fairfield greenwich,marrero,the anwar stay ruling.shortly thereafter,the court issued a final judgment and order accepting the settlement of the anwar action and dismissing the claims against the fairfield defendants with prejudice.
people merkin and schwartz merkin 
in april,new york attorney general the nyag brought suit in new york state court claiming that ezra merkin and his investment company,gabriel capital together,the merkin defendants had violated new york martin act,its executive law,and its not for profit corporation law by making material misrepresentations and omissions to investors in several feeder funds.see,people merkin.filed.specifically,the nyag complaint alleged that merkin breached his fiduciary duties to investors by collecting management fees while turning all,or a substantial portion,of the investors funds over to madoff and others.id.the nyag also named the feeder funds themselves the merkin funds as relief defendants see am,people merkin.filed may.
in september,bart schwartz,the receiver for two of the merkin funds,ariel fund and gabriel capital,both relief defendants in the nyag suit,also filed suit against the merkin defendants in state court.see,schwartz merkin.filed.schwartz complaint alleged on behalf of fund investors that the merkin defendants had breached their fiduciary duties of candor and disclosure,fraudulently misrepresented the nature of the work performed by various investment managers,and collected exorbitant fees.id.
after several years of litigation,on june,the nyag and schwartz executed a joint settlement of their claims with the merkin defendants for million.several weeks later,the trustee instituted an adversary proceeding the nyag stay application substantially similar to the anwar stay application,seeking to enjoin and declare void the joint settlement and the underlying suits.see,picard schneiderman,pro.filed.as judge marrero had done with respect to the anwar stay application,judge rakoff withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court.see picard schneiderman,see d.on april,in the second of the judgments here on appeal,the court denied the nyag stay application in its entirety and directed that the adversary proceeding be dismissed with prejudice and the case closed.see picard schneiderman,b.rakoff,the nyag stay ruling.
the fraudulent conveyance litigation 
while the feeder fund litigation was in progress,the trustee instituted actions against the merkin defendants and merkin funds and against the fairfield defendants alleging that they had received fraudulent conveyances from blmis.see picard merkin,pro.filed may,picard fairfield sentry,pro.filed may.in merkin,the trustee sought million from the ariel and gabriel funds,and million from a third fund and the merkin defendants.although the merkin funds were net losers in madoff scheme,the trustee sought the entire value of the transfers they received within the applicable period on the theory that the merkin defendants knew of the fraud.the allegations against the fairfield defendants were similar,but the amount sought was some billion.both cases are pending.
the district court decisions 
the trustee made nearly identical arguments in both stay application proceedings.he asserted that the feeder fund litigation and the proposed settlements implicated property of blmis and the madoff estate within the meaning of the bankruptcy code automatic stay provisions,see a,the sipa,see b b,and two district court orders,and should therefore be declared void ab initio whether the feeder fund litigation implicated the automatic stay or not,a preliminary injunction under section a was appropriate and the securities investor protection act preempted the feeder fund litigation to the extent the actions interfered with the trustee ability to return funds to blmis customers.the district court,in each case,rejected all of the trustee arguments on the merits and ruled that the stay applications were barred in any event by laches.the trustee appeals.

standard of review 
the scope of the automatic stay is a question of law subject to de novo review.united states colasuonno,cir see also fed.deposit ins.hirsch in re colonial realty,cir.but because i t is an axiom of appellate procedure that we review questions of fact for clear error,we review the factual findings underlying a legal determination for clear error only.united states rajaratnam,cir accord guzzo cristofano,cir concluding that an essentially factual component of mixed question of fact and law is subject to review for clear error internal quotation marks omitted.

ii.denial of the trustee request for declaratory relief 
the trustee argues that the anwar and nyag actions are barred by the bankruptcy code automatic stay and by two orders issued by the district court at the outset of the madoff liquidation the stay orders.the automatic stay and the stay orders apply only to property of the madoff estate and to lawsuits directed against madoff or blmis.see a,order,iv,in re bernard madoff investment securities llc,civ,ecf see also partial judgment on consent,iv,ecf.the district court in both proceedings concluded that the actions involved neither estate property nor suits against the debtors,and that they were therefore not stayed.for the reasons explained below,we agree.
section the automatic stay protects bankruptcy estates by restraining any formal or informal action or legal proceeding that might dissipate estate assets or interfere with the trustee orderly administration of the estate.see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.s o central is the stay to an orderly bankruptcy process that actions taken in violation of the stay are void and without effect.colonial realty,at internal quotation marks omitted.the trustee in this case relies on provisions that stay 
the commencement or continuation,including the issuance or employment of process,of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title 
any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate 
any act to collect,assess,or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.
a.the stay orders do not,by their own terms,expand the scope of these provisions.see order,iv,in re bernard madoff investment securities llc,civ,ecf enjoining interference with any assets or property owned,controlled or in the possession of madoff or blmis partial judgment on consent,iv,ecf incorporating order on consent,ix,ecf enjoining interference with the control,possession,or management of the assets subject to the receivership.
the trustee asserts that the anwar and nyag actions run afoul of these provisions and orders in two ways.first,he argues that,regardless of their form,the actions are in substance claims to recover fraudulent conveyances,which are treated as claims against a debtor and stayed by section a.second,the trustee asserts that the actions are so intertwined with the estate own fraudulent conveyance claims that they constitute impermissible attempts to exercise control over property of the estate.see a.
whether the actions are intertwined with estate claims 
we address the trustee latter the actions are intertwined with estate.in the only case cited by the trustee on this point,steakhouse,rockefeller grp.in re steakhouse,cir,cert.denied,we upheld the stay of a lessor attempt to terminate a prime lease where the was a debtor in bankruptcy.a sublease held by a debtor is considered property of the estate.see a.and under new york law,the termination of a prime lease automatically terminates a sublease.steakhouse,at.we reasoned that i f action taken against a nonbankrupt party like a prime lessee would inevitably have an adverse impact on property of the bankrupt estate the sublease,then such action should be barred by the automatic stay.id.at emphasis added.but an adverse impact on a debtor that occurs by operation of law such as the termination of the prime lease in steakhouse is distinct from one which the trustee merely argues is,as a factual matter,likely to occur.see official comm.of unsecured creditors pss steamship in re prudential lines,cir applying steakhouse to bar an action that would have the legal effect of diminishing or eliminating property of the bankrupt estate emphasis added.we decline to extend our holding in steakhouse to automatically stay actions taken against third parties that are only factually likely,as opposed to legally certain,to impact estate property.
whether the actions plead fraudulent conveyance claims 
whether the actions are in fact efforts to plead around the stay is a question that merits more attention.if the actions are fraudulent conveyance claims in disguise,they fall within the scope of the automatic stay.see a marshall picard in re bernard madoff inv.sec.llc,cir a ppellants purported tort claims are,in essence,disguised fraudulent transfer actions,which belong exclusively to the trustee.the district court concluded that the anwar and nyag actions were distinct from the trustee fraudulent conveyance claims because they were based on duties owed directly by the defendants to the plaintiffs.see anwar stay ruling,at concluding that the anwar plaintiffs claims are in no way contingent on the defendants possible liability to the blmis estate nyag stay ruling,at concluding that the nyag and schwartz claims are independent claims based on separate facts,theories,and duties than the trustee fraudulent transfer claims against merkin.we agree.
a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer action seeks to recover or avoid transfers that wrongfully reduce the pool of assets available to creditors.see generally collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.under the code,a transfer may qualify as fraudulent either because it was made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor,see a a,or because the transfer was made in exchange for less than the reasonably equivalent value of the property transferred and other statutorily specified conditions obtained,see id.a b see also n.debt.cred.law defining actual and constructive fraudulent conveyances sharp int l state street bank trust in re sharp int l,cir applying new york fraudulent conveyance statute.
although an action for fraudulent conveyance is brought against the transferee,the fraud is the debtor.as we explained in colonial realty,a bsent a claim against the debtor,there is no independent basis for the action against the transferee.colonial realty,at quoting saunders,b.at.thus,a bankruptcy trustee may recover transferred property or its value from the person to whom it was originally conveyed without showing that the transferee was culpable in any fraud see a.this focus on the debtor explains why a action to recover fraudulently transferred property is properly regarded as undertaken to recover a claim against the debtor and subject to the automatic stay pursuant to a.colonial realty,at see also a.in order to qualify as disguised fraudulent transfer actions,therefore,the complaints against the fairfield and merkin defendants would have to be contingent on madoff or blmis wrongful transfer of the funds sought by the actions.they are not.
the anwar complaint alleges breaches of duty owed by and fraudulent misrepresentations made by the fairfield defendants not madoff.see second consolidated am,anwar fairfield greenwich,cv vm filed,ecf.the complaint alleges,among other things,that the fairfield defendants fraudulently induced the anwar plaintiffs to invest in the defendant funds,violated federal securities law,recklessly and negligently misrepresented the nature of their investment strategy and their diligence of madoff,and breached fiduciary and contractual duties.id.although the complaint includes factual allegations regarding madoff fraud,the legal bases for the claims leveled against the fairfield defendants are independent of any liability madoff or blmis may have to the anwar plaintiffs.nor do the allegations depend in substance on the fact that madoff may have wrongfully transferred funds to the fairfield defendants.
the distinction between the nyag complaint and a fraudulent conveyance action is even starker.see,people merkin.filed.the nyag alleges that ezra merkin fraudulently held himself out as an investing guru when he was in fact no more than a glorified mailbox,turning over virtually all of the assets in the merkin funds to madoff.id.according to the complaint,merkin not only fraudulently collected management fees for work he let madoff perform with virtually no supervision,but he also engaged in by steering organizations to which he owed fiduciary duties toward the feeder funds.id.the complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty,the making of fraudulent misrepresentations with respect to the sale of securities,and other violations of new york statutes and common law.see id.while madoff fraud may be a cause of the enormous losses suffered by merkin clients,none of the merkin defendants liability to the plaintiffs depends on the wrongfulness of madoff conduct,or on the fact that madoff or blmis may have transferred funds to the merkin defendants.the allegations in schwartz merkin are substantially similar.see,schwartz merkin.filed.the trustee claim that the anwar and nyag actions covertly seek the recovery of fraudulent conveyances thus finds no support in the allegations of the complaints,and the actions can not be characterized as against the debtor on that basis.
the trustee urges that the actions are indistinguishable from fraudulent transfer claims because they seek the return of management fees,which the defendants paid themselves out of funds transferred as returns from blmis,on the basis that the defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of madoff fraud.anwar action appellant br.at nyag action appellant br.at.this,he argues,is the same basis as the avoidance action brought by the trustee on behalf of all blmis creditors.anwar action appellant br.at nyag action appellant br.at.we disagree.
first,as we explained in cumberland oil thropp,cir,cert.denied,one complaint is not duplicative of another solely because it recites some or all of the same facts.the plaintiff in cumberland entered into an oil exploration contract with a company called benchmark based on the representations of its president,thropp.id.at.contrary to those representations,benchmark was not only in financial distress,but also soon began a series of transfers to thropp and his father which stripped it of the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the agreement.id.at.after benchmark filed for bankruptcy,cumberland brought suit against the thropps for fraud.the district court dismissed the complaint,reasoning that the allegations were substantially identical to fraudulent transfer claims.id.at.we disagreed,explaining that even if cumberland pled the same facts that would have been invoked in a fraudulent conveyance action,the company alleged that it was the victim of a fraud perpetrated by the thropps a distinct legal claim that was neither the property of benchmark bankruptcy estate nor was discharged by benchmark emergence from bankruptcy.id.at.
nor are the actions brought on the same basis as the trustee fraudulent conveyance claims.the defendants alleged knowledge of madoff fraud is relevant here only to their liability for breaches of duties they owed directly to the plaintiffs.these independent duties distinguish the actions from the trustee own claims and place them like the fraud claims in cumberland outside the scope of the automatic stay.see variable parameter fixture dev.morpheus lights,a stay clearly can not be extended to a where the liability rests upon his own breach of duty.internal quotation marks omitted citing robins piccinin,cir,cert.denied.
in the alternative,the trustee appeals to the background bankruptcy policy disfavoring individual litigation that allows one creditor to steal a march on the others.see martin trigona champion fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.he notes that the plaintiffs in both actions are creditors of the madoff estate.but the plaintiffs right to enforce duties owed to them is not qualified by the fact that they may also have claims against the madoff estate.
it is well settled that when creditors have a claim for injury that is particularized as to them,they are exclusively entitled to pursue that claim,and the bankruptcy trustee is precluded from doing so.hirsch arthur andersen,f d,cir see also caplin marine midland grace trust of,n owhere in the statutory scheme is there any suggestion that the trustee in reorganization is to assume the responsibility of suing third parties on behalf of creditors.the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs in both actions are alleged to have been caused directly by the defendants not by madoff or blmis.that renders them particularized and outside the trustee purview.marshall,at a n injury is said to be particularized when it can be directly traced to the third party conduct.brackets omitted quoting paul fire marine ins.pepsico,cir.the actions are therefore not voided by,and the settlements not subject to,the automatic stay.
iii.denial of the trustee claims for section injunctive relief 
in addition to a declaration that the actions are void,the trustee seeks an order preliminarily enjoining the settlements.whether or not the claims asserted in the actions are subject to the terms of the automatic stay,a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over any suit that might have any conceivable effect on the bankruptcy estate.pfizer law offices of peter angelos in re qui
