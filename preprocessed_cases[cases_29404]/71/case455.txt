opinion of the court 
defendant plaza management overseas appeals the district court order remanding this case to delaware chancery court pursuant to a forum selection clause in a contract between one of plaza affiliated companies and one of plaintiffs affiliated companies.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs are carlyle investment management,a large publicly traded investment management firm two affiliated entities,tc group,and tcg holdings,three founders and officers of carlyle,david rubinstein,daniel,and william conway,and three former directors of carlyle capital corporation ccc,james hance,john stomber,and michael zupon.defendants are louis reijtenbagh three entities he owns and controls,plaza,moonmouth company,and parbold overseas and an affiliated dutch company,stichting recovery ccc.the record indicates that plaza is the only corporate defendant that has not been dissolved.
ccc was an investment fund incorporated in in guernsey,a british crown dependency in the english channel.ccc invested primarily in residential securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac.in december,moonmouth purchased three million class b shares of ccc for million under a contract known as the subscription agreement.only moonmouth and ccc were parties to the subscription agreement.plaza,in its capacity as director of moonmouth,signed the subscription agreement on moonmouth behalf.plaza and moonmouth were owned and controlled by reijtenbagh.carlyle signed the subscription agreement on behalf of ccc as its investment manager.the subscription agreement contained the following forum selection clause,which is the subject of this litigation the courts of the state of delaware shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action,suit or proceeding with respect to this subscription agreement the subscription agreement also included a choice of law clause,specifying that delaware law was to govern.
in march,as the global financial crisis depleted ccc cash reserves,ccc entered liquidation.a court in guernsey appointed liquidators the ccc liquidators to oversee liquidation of the company.in july,the ccc liquidators sued carlyle and the other plaintiffs in guernsey for alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed to ccc.
in the fall of,reijtenbagh sought carlyle permission to sell to various third parties portions of investments in funds that he held through a different investment entity,bundora associates.these investments were subject to transfer restrictions,so reijtenbagh needed carlyle approval and assistance to execute the sales.the sales were accomplished through the execution of seven transfer agreements between bundora through plaza,its director,several carlyle affiliates,and the purchasers.each transfer agreement contained a broad and materially identical release under which bundora and its affiliates released all their claims against carlyle and its affiliates.one of the transfer agreements,the carlyle europe partners iii,cep iii transfer agreement,also included a forum selection clause requiring any litigation relating in any way to the agreement to be brought in either english courts,delaware state court,new york state court,or the u.district court for the southern district of new york.
in june,a dutch law firm representing moonmouth sent letters on behalf of moonmouth,plaza,parbold,and reijtenbagh to plaintiffs and former independent directors of ccc alleging that plaintiffs took irresponsible and unacceptable risks in connection with the investments that ccc managed and that they would hold plaintiffs liable for all damages that the investors sustained in connection with their investment in ccc.
in response,plaintiffs filed this action in the delaware court of chancery to enforce the subscription agreement forum selection clause as well as the releases from liability contained in the bundora transfer agreements.moonmouth,plaza,and parbold were served on november.moonmouth was dissolved a week later,apparently pursuant to the laws of the british virgin islands,where it was incorporated plaintiffs amended complaint added a claim alleging that defendants have been providing financial support for the ccc liquidators suit in guernsey against carlyle and its affiliates in breach of the releases in the bundora transfer agreements.
plaza removed the case to federal court on december.plaintiffs moved to remand on january.the district court granted the motion and remanded to state court on august.plaza appealed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
carlyle contends that we lack jurisdiction to hear plaza appeal.we disagree.generally,an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal d.we have recognized an exception to this rule when the remand is not based on the reasons set forth in c.see new jersey merrill lynch,cir citing foster chesapeake ins,cir.it is well established that a remand pursuant to a forum selection clause does not fall within the reasons for remand listed in c.see suter munich reinsurance,cir foster,at.thus,because the district court remanded due to the forum selection clause and not due to a c reason,we have jurisdiction over the appeal plaintiffs argue that the act of mailing the remand order divests a federal court of jurisdiction,citing agostini piper aircraft,cir,and trans penn wax mccandless,cir.these cases are easily distinguishable because they involve remands under c.a court of appeals,however,retains jurisdiction over appeals of remand orders that are not made pursuant to c.therefore,we have jurisdiction under.
standard of review 
the federal removal statute,is strictly construed,requiring remand if any doubt exists over whether removal was proper.abels state farm fire cas,cir.the party seeking removal carries the burden of proving that removal is proper.see samuel bassett kia motors,cir.that burden is particularly heavy when the party seeks to avoid a forum selection clause through use of removal.bremen zapata off shore,d.in addition,in matters of contract construction,we exercise plenary review.merrill lynch,at.
merits of the appeal 
whether the subscription agreement forum selection clause is binding 
the district court agreed with plaintiffs that plaza is bound by the forum selection clause despite not having been a signatory.delaware courts have set forth a test for determining whether a to an agreement should be bound by its forum selection clause is the forum selection clause valid,is the a beneficiary of the agreement or closely related to the agreement,and does the claim at hand arise from the status related to the agreement see baker impact holding,no.civa vcp,wl,at.may,citing capital grp.armour,no.civ.n,wl,at,weygandt weco,llc,vcs,wl,at.may.
for the first element,forum selection clauses are presumed to be valid.see ingres ca.the clause is considered valid unless the challenging party clearly show s that enforcement would be unreasonable and unjust,or that the clause is invalid for such reasons as fraud or overreaching.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.plaza challenges the validity of the clause,but it provides no argument that it is invalid for any of those reasons.plaza arguments are better characterized as arguments that the clause is inapplicable,rather than invalid.we will address those arguments later in the opinion.at this point,we will focus on whether the forum selection clause is valid.
with respect to the second element,even if defendants are not parties to the agreement or beneficiaries of it,they may be bound by the forum selection clause if they are closely related to the agreement in such a way that it would be foreseeable that they would be bound.see weygandt,wl,at.in determining whether a is closely related to a contract,courts consider the ownership of the signatory,its involvement in the negotiations,the relationship between the two parties and whether the received a direct benefit from the agreement.see id.at capital,wl,at.
the district court found that plaza was closely related to the subscription agreement.it did not err in doing so.plaza was moonmouth director and it executed the subscription agree
