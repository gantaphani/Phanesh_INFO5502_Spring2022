andrew roth brought this action on behalf of brocade communications systems under b of the securities exchange act of,b.he seeks to recover short swing profits,defined as profits earned within a six months period by the purchase and sale of securities,blau lehman,d,from four of brocade top officers gregory reyes,michael byrd,antonio canova,and jack cuthbert.because roth action is barred by b limitations period,we affirm the district court dismissal of his complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
section b was designed to prevent corporate insiders from profiteering through securities transactions on the basis of inside information,provident securities,d.it is a strict liability rule that requires the statutorily defined inside,trader to disgorge all profits realized on all purchases and sales within the specified time period,without proof of actual abuse of insider information,and without proof of intent to profit on the basis of such information.id.at.alteration omitted.as the supreme court explained 
the general purpose of congress in enacting b is well known.congress recognized that insiders may have access to information about their corporations not available to the rest of the investing public.by trading on this information,these persons could reap profits at the expense of less well informed investors.in b congress sought to curb the evils of insider trading by taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great.it accomplished this by defining directors,officers,and beneficial owners as those presumed to have access to inside information and enacting a flat rule that a corporation could recover the profits these insiders made on a pair of security transactions within six months.
id.at.citations,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.an action under b to recoup trading profits may be brought by the issuer whose stock was traded or by a stockholder in behalf of the issuer.b 
section b also contains certain express limitations.one such limitation provides that a b suit may not be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized.id.another is that b shall not be construed to cover any transaction or transactions which the securities and exchange commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection.id.pursuant to this authority,the sec has promulgated rule d,which exempts from b liability any transaction involving an acquisition from the issuer whether or not intended for a compensatory or other particular purpose,so long as the transaction is approved by the board of directors of the issuer,or a committee of the board of directors that is composed solely of two or more directors.d 
our cases have also interpreted b in light of its companion provision,a,a.see whittaker whittaker,cir.section a,as implemented by rule,requires certain corporate insiders to file statements disclosing their acquisitions and dispositions of company stock,as well annual statements of their holdings and transactions reading these sections together,we concluded that congress gave issuers only a short period in which to bring an action to recover insiders profits under b because congress required insiders to make prompt disclosure of their transactions under a.see whittaker,at.
roth bases his suit on brocade grant of call options in its stock,the right to buy brocade equity securities at a stated price to the four individual defendants roth alleges that the defendants were corporate insiders for purposes of b,that they received stock options dated november,november,april,and october,and that they sold shares of brocade equity securities within six months of these dates.roth seeks to recoup the defendants profits based on their sales of brocade stock within six months of acquiring the call options.according to the complaint,these transactions took place no later than 
roth brought suit on april,long after b limitations period for bringing such claims had passed.roth complaint alleges that this limitations period is tolled,however,because the defendants failed to disclose their options acquisitions accurately.according to roth,the defendants falsely reported that their options acquisitions were exempt from b under rule d.roth argues that this improper disclosure should toll the running of b limitations period.
the district court noted,but declined to address,whether b limitations period barred roth action.instead,the district court held that roth failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that brocade grants of call options were not exempt under rule d.the district court rejected roth theory that defendants transactions did not qualify for the rule d exemption because the call options were backdated,granted on dates prior to their actual grant dates with exercise prices equal to the market prices on such dates.such backdating,according to roth,renders the exemption in rule d inapplicable because it prevents the grants of stock options from being approved in advance of the transaction,which he argues is required by the sec interpretation of rule d.see securities act release,with respect to shareholder,board and director committee approval,rule d requires approval in advance of the transaction.emphasis added.the district court characterized roth argument as a claim that backdating makes the rule d exemption per se inapplicable to the backdated transactions,and rejected it along with roth other efforts to establish that his complaint adequately alleged the of rule d.the district court therefore dismissed the complaint,and roth timely appeals.
we doubt that roth had an obligation to affirmatively plead the inapplicability of any exemption to b.see rheem manufacturing rheem,cir holding that an insider claiming he was exempt from liability under b had the burden of bringing himself within the exemption see also sorrell sec,cir noting the rule that e xemptions are construed narrowly and the burden of proof is on the person claiming the exemption.we do not reach this issue,however,nor do we decide whether roth complaint adequately alleged the inapplicability of rule d,because we hold that roth suit is.section b provides that no suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized.b.because roth suit was brought more than two years after the defendants profits were realized,it is untimely under the plain language of b.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court on that basis.see vaught scottsdale healthcare.health plan,cir we may affirm the district court on any basis supported by the record.quoting moreno baca,cir.
roth argues that the time for filing his action must be tolled because the defendants filed inaccurate disclosures under a.roth notes that the forms filed by defendants claimed that the call options granted by brocade were covered by a rule exemption because this claim is false,roth argues,brocade and its shareholders were not put on notice that the defendants had made profits from transactions.accordingly,the limitations period should be tolled during the period in which the defendants failed to disclose their transactions accurately as required by a.see ins,cir en banc defining equitable tolling as stop ping a limitations period from continuing to run after it has already begun to run tristar freitas,cir.
roth relies on our decision in whittaker for his argument that the defendants inaccurate disclosures should toll b limitations period.in whittaker,a corporation recovered profits from a defendant whose share of the corporation equity stock,when added to his mother share,exceeded of the company equity shares.at.the district court found that the defendant exercised virtually complete control over his mother affairs,including her finances and stock holdings,and therefore must be deemed the beneficial owner of his mother stock in the corporation.id.at.the court therefore concluded that the defendant was a beneficial owner within the meaning of,who should have reported the transactions under a,and who was liable to the company under b for profits de
