a jury found the appellant guilty of securities fraud.the court of appeals reversed the conviction and concluded that the term other evidence of indebtedness,as used in the definition of security in the texas securities act,requires a writing.we granted review to determine whether the term other evidence of indebtedness requires a written instrument because the cases that we have found all involve some form of writing,the term is part of a group of securities that are all written instruments,and the common understanding of the term seems to envision a writing,we hold that the term other evidence of indebtedness requires a writing.accordingly,we shall affirm the court of appeals.
the appellant met don edwards through sunday school classes at their church.through his corporation united media group,umg,the appellant attempted to develop and market electronic kiosks that could dispense videotapes.the appellant suggested that edwards become a salesman for umg and further convinced edwards to invest in the corporation.the appellant said that edwards could expect the return of his original principal in thirty to sixty days,would receive five times the original investment in several months,and would receive an additional five times his investment within a year.throughout june of,edwards invested a total of.the only document signed by the appellant and edwards was a june,letter of agreement that described edwards kiosk distribution territory.the letter of agreement mentions a equity deposit for the territory,but nowhere mentions edwards actual investments.
about a month later,the appellant informed edwards that further investment,up to,had become available because a family in tennessee needed the return of its principal immediately.on august,edwards invested an additional.like the other investments,neither the appellant nor umg signed any agreement concerning the investments issued any shares,notes,or bonds or paid edwards any profits on his investments.it was later discovered that the appellant had filed for personal bankruptcy and had used funds invested in umg to cover his personal expenses.the appellant disclosed neither fact to edwards.
the appellant was indicted and later convicted for violations of the texas securities act concerning the august,transaction.stat.specifically,a jury found the appellant guilty of two counts of securities fraud in the sale or offer of sale of a security,namely an evidence of indebtedness,by failing to disclose that he had previously spent funds invested in umg for purposes unrelated to umg and failing to disclose that he had filed for personal bankruptcy.
on direct appeal,the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment and entered a judgment of acquittal in an unpublished opinion.thomas state,wl,not designated for publication.the court of appeals rejected a definition of the term evidence of indebtedness used by the texas supreme court in searsy commercial trading,adopting the definition of evidence of indebtedness from united states austin,cir,and held instead that the term referred to a mortgage certificate.thomas,slip op.at.
we reversed the court of appeals decision upon the state petition for discretionary review and adopted the searsy definition of evidence of indebtedness.we held that an evidence of indebtedness was all contractual obligations to pay in the future for consideration presently received.thomas state,thomas ii.we remanded the case to the court of appeals with instructions to consider whether an evidence of indebtedness requires a writing under the act.
on remand,the court of appeals held that,because the particular provision of the act under which thomas was convicted is penal in nature,the statute should be narrowly construed.thomas state,thomas iii.the court of appeals then held that,under the texas securities act,an evidence of indebtedness requires a writing.id.at.the court of appeals relied largely on the common law doctrine of ejusdem generis and on our observations from thomas ii that the act purpose and context limits how the term is construed.id.at.it concluded that,because evidence of indebtedness is grouped with written instruments that all acknowledge the owing of money by agreement,an evidence of indebtedness must also be in writing.id.at.since there was no writing constituting an evidence of indebtedness admitted into evidence,and because there is no evidence that the appellant offered to sell such an instrument,the court of appeals once again entered a judgment of acquittal.id.at.
discussion 
the texas securities act defines security,in part,as 
any share,stock,stock certificate under a voting trust agreement,collateral trust certificate,equipment trust certificate,preorganization certificate or receipt,subscription or reorganization certificate,note,bond,debenture,mortgage certificate or other evidence of indebtedness,any form of commercial paper,certificate in or under a profit sharing or participation agreement,certificate or any instrument representing any interest in or under an oil,gas or mining lease,fee or title,or any certificate or instrument representing or secured by an interest in any or all of the capital,property,assets,profits or earnings of any company,investment contract,or any other instrument commonly known as a security,whether similar to those herein referred to or not 
stat.a emphasis added.
strict construction and ejusdem generis 
before addressing the question of whether a writing is required,several related issues need to be addressed 
the state argues that the court of appeals use of ejusdem generis was inappropriate because the doctrine had not been discussed since judge davidson dissenting opinion in dossey state.we disagree that the use of ejusdem generis was inappropriate.
ejusdem generis means of the same kind,class,or nature.black law dictionary ed.the doctrine states that when interpreting general words that follow an enumeration of particular or specific things,the meaning of those general words should be confined to things of the same kind.lefevers state,perez state.
in thomas ii,we tacitly approved of the ejusdem generis doctrine in determining the meaning of evidence of indebtedness without using that exact phrase.we viewed other evidence of indebtedness as expanding upon the grouping note,bond,debenture,mortgage certificate.in other words,notes,bonds,debentures and mortgage certificates are types of evidence of indebtedness,but other evidence of indebtedness might also fall within the act.thomas ii,at.furthermore,we emphasized that the definition was limited by the purposes of the act itself and by the context in which it appears an evidence of indebtedness is a similar type of security as a note,bond,debenture,and mortgage certificate.id.at.the word type is similar to kind,class,or nature,and our analysis is consistent with ejusdem generis,which gives effect to both the particular and the general words,by treating the particular words as indicating the class,and the general words as extending the provisions of the statute to everything embraced in that class,though not specifically named by the particular words.lefevers,at.the application of ejusdem generis was not improper 
finally,relying on our holding in vernon state,the state argues that reviewing courts must not employ definitions of relevant statutory words that are different from or more restrictive than the jurors are legally entitled to use.in thomas ii,however,we held that within the context of the definition of security,an evidence of indebtedness must be of a similar type of security as a note,bond,or debenture.thomas ii,at.evidence of indebtedness is grouped together with terms that have both technical and judicial meanings within securities law.reves ernst young,d discussing definition of the term note thomas ii,at noting that an evidence of indebtedness must be an investment to fit within the act loss seligman,securities regulation,ii ed suggesting that like the term note,evidence of indebtedness might be so broad as to preclude a literal reading and suggesting that the criteria developed for notes may be helpful.while evidence of indebtedness may have a broad meaning,it nevertheless has meaning within the particular subject matter of investments and securities law vernon,therefore,does not apply.medford state,holding that the word arrest has an established and technical meaning that precluded the application of vernon thomas ii,at,holding that an evidence of indebtedness must be of a similar type of security as notes,bonds,debentures,and mortgage certificates and requiring an evidence of indebtedness to be an investment.
writing requirement 
because of the similarities between b federal securities act of and article a,texas courts often look to federal cases interpreting the federal securities act of for guidance in interpreting the texas securities act.see searsy,at noting the term evidence of indebtedness appear s to have been taken from an almost identical definition of security in the federal securities act of grotjohn precise connexiones int l,no pet.noting that because of the similarity to the texas act,texas courts may look to the federal securities act campbell payne geldermann,writ denied same thomas ii,at citing to numerous federal cases interpreting.in addition to texas sources,we will also look to federal cases and materials for guidance.
we have not found a federal or texas case directly dealing with a writing requirement for the term evidence of indebtedness.significantly,we have found no cases where an oral agreement alone was characterized as an evidence of indebtedness.to the contrary,the cases and secondary materials that we have found all deal with some form of written instrument.see,weeks,cir noting district court could have found that a contract,when considered with a commitment letter,was an evidence of indebtedness austin,at holding that letter of commitment was an evidence of indebtedness ltv federal credit union umic gov t,concluding standby commitment contracts were not evidence of indebtedness united states attaway,holding uncashed checks,when considered in light of oral representations,were evidence of indebtedness searsy,at holding commodity option contracts to be evidence of indebtedness because of representations made in the defendant literature adickes andreoli,dist,writ dism holding a written receipt for funds in the purchase of a partnership interest did not constitute an evidence of indebtedness king commodity of texas,state,no writ holding that option certificates,when considered in the light of advertising brochures,constituted an evidence of indebtedness under the texas securities act.
we find the case of addison,to be the closest case to the one at bar.in addison,addison and his associates obtained money from lenders for the operating and marketing costs of a machine that turned unmarketable uranium into marketable ore.id.at.addison and his agents orally represented to various lenders that the lenders would participate and share in the millions of dollars in profits that would be made from various ventures,in addition to being repaid the amount loaned in one year plus interest.id.most of the lenders received written notes,signed by addison,acknowledging the loan and bearing a interest rate.id.at.addison,however,neither issued nor delivered to some later lenders any note or any instrument in writing evidencing such loan transaction or the promised participation and sharing in the profits to be made.id.addison ventures were ultimately unprofitable,and the loans and investments were not repaid.
the district court found that addison had sold securities in the form of notes,evidence of indebtedness,certificates of interest and participation in agreements,and investment contracts.id.at.the court characterized the personal loan notes issued by addison as both notes and evidence of indebtedness.id.at the personal loan notes issued and delivered to the lenders are also securities by reason of being an evidence of indebtedness.the court characterized the oral representations made to the later lenders who did not receive a note or writing as investment contracts and not as evidence of indebtedness.id.at.the oral agreements the defendants made with the lenders to the effect that the lenders would participate and share in the millions of dollars of profits that would be made by the defendants from their mining and other operations are investment contracts,and,as such,are securities.id.citing securities exchange commission howey.unlike the personal loan notes that were characterized as both notes and evidence of indebtedness,the oral agreements were characterized only as investment contracts.id.at.this suggests that some form of writing is required for a security to be characterized as an evidence of indebtedness.
in addition to case law,there are scholars who indicate that an evidence of indebtedness requires a writing.in explaining the coverage of the federal securities act,professor loss observed that an evidence of indebtedness requires a writing by its own terms.as we have seen,a writing is not essential for either an investment contract or a transferable share or an interest commonly known as a security.an evidence of indebtedness does by its terms require a writing,but when a writing is available this phrase is sometimes a handy anchor to windward.loss,securities regulation,ed thomas ii,at neither does strict construction mean that we ignore the plain meaning of the terms.boykin state.also,professors bromberg and lowenfels have adopted the fifth circuit definition of an evidence of indebtedness as used in jones,cir bromberg and lowenfels,securities fraud commodities fraud.the term evidence of indebtedness embraces only such documents as promissory notes which on their face establish a primary obligation to pay the holders thereof a sum of money.id.
furthermore,we stated in thomas ii that the definition of evidence of indebtedness was consistent with other federal cases.thomas ii,at.we cited thunderbird valley,for this proposition and observed that the thunderbird court viewed evidence of indebtedness as being a term,requiring no further definition.id.if a term is,requiring no further definition,this suggests a common understanding of that term.
as the searsy court pointed out,the term evidence of indebtedness in the texas securities act appears to have been taken from the federal securities act of.searsy,at.a review of black law dictionary from does not yield a definition of evidence of indebtedness,but it does have a definition of evidence of debt.the definition of evidence of debt was a term applied to written instruments or securities for the payment of money,importing on their face the existence of a debt.black law dictionary ed.this same definition appeared in the earlier second edition and the later fourth edition.black law dictionary ed black law dictionary ed.thus,in the immediate edition before the securities act of,in the edition of the act actual enactment,and in the next edition after enactment some years later,the same definition of evidence of debt remained,and this definition envisioned some form of written instrument.although evidence of debt is not the exact term,the terms are sufficiently similar for us to glean guidance.based on the definition in these editions,we think that the common understanding implied by thunderbird valley entails a written instrument 
finally,the conclusion that a writing is required is consistent with our instructions and analysis in thomas ii.we said that the definition was limited not only by the purpose of the act,but also by the context in which it appears.thomas ii,at.the term appears in a group of four other terms that are all some form of written instrument that acknowledge money owed by agreement.see id.at.in context,the term evidence of indebtedness expands upon the terms note,bond,debenture,and mortgage certificates.see id.at.it appears that an evidence of indebtedness need not necessarily take on the exact form of these other terms,as it expands upon them,but it is similar to them in that it requires some writing that indicates a contractual obligation to pay in the future for consideration presently received.see id.at.
based on the terms of the statute,as well as the persuasive authorities cited above,we hol
