following a significant drop in the share price of zafgen,a biopharmaceutical developer based in boston,massachusetts,its investors brought a securities fraud class action suit against the company and its chief executive officer,thomas hughes defendants,pursuant to sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,b and t a,and securities and exchange commission rule.the investors complaint focuses on several allegedly misleading statements made by the defendants regarding zafgen drug beloranib.specifically,the complaint alleges that the defendants disclosed some,but not all,of the adverse events that occurred during beloranib clinical trials.the investors claim that these partial disclosures caused zafgen common stock to trade at prices prices that plunged after a clinical patient taking beloranib died and the food and drug administration fda placed the drug on a partial clinical hold.
despite these allegations,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss,concluding that the investors complaint did not contain facts giving rise to a cogent and compelling inference of scienter as required under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.brennan zafgen,supp,quoting tellabs,makor issues rights.we agree,and therefore affirm.

zafgen stated goal is to significantly improv e the health and of patients affected by obesity and complex metabolic disorders.to that end,zafgen has focused its efforts on developing beloranib,a drug aimed at combating these conditions hughes,as zafgen chief executive officer,oversaw beloranib clinical testing.while doing so,hughes also steered zafgen towards its initial public offering ipo,which the company completed on june.the current dispute arises from the intersection of these two strategic endeavors.
beloranib and the fda approval process 
as part of the development process,the fda requires that any new drug go through a series of clinical trials before it can be approved for marketing and sales in the united states.carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.citation omitted.after a pharmaceutical developer finishes its initial testing of a drug on animals,it must then submit an application to the fda for approval to test the drug on humans.see also.if the fda approves that request,human testing begins.typically,such testing consists of three phases of clinical trials biogen idec,at see also.each phase requires the company to test the drug on a broader population and results in more stringent monitoring and evaluation.biogen idec,at.throughout the course of these trials,the drug company must report to the fda and to all participating physicians any serious and unexpected adverse drug experiences that occur.id.citing c i a.
at the time the investors first brought this suit,zafgen had conducted three phase i trials,four phase ii trials,and one phase iii trial.the investors complaint,however,concentrates on zafgen trial,a phase ii trial that consisted of patients and lasted from august to may.from this group of patients,zafgen treated of them with beloranib.as the trial progressed,four of the patients given beloranib suffered adverse thrombotic,or,events of varying severity.clinical investigators classified two of these adverse events as superficial and the other two as serious.zafgen disclosed the two serious adverse events in advance of its ipo,noting their occurrence in its april,form registration statement.the company did not,however,directly disclose the two superficial adverse events at that time.
zafgen stock price declines 
zafgen share price began to decline in october.on october,zafgen share price closed at.by the close of trading the next day,zafgen share price had dropped to.on october,zafgen announced that a patient in its ongoing phase iii trial had died,and confirmed on october that the patient had been treated with beloranib,not a placebo,and that the fda had placed beloranib on a partial clinical hold.during a conference call held that same day,dennis kim,zafgen chief medical officer,likewise informed analysts that a total of six adverse thrombotic events had occurred throughout the course of beloranib clinical testing two in the company ongoing clinical trials and four in the completed trial.kim comments marked the first time that zafgen or any of its representatives had informed its investors of the two superficial adverse thrombotic events that had occurred in the trial.by the close of trading on october,zafgen share price plummeted to per share,a nearly decline from the previous day closing price.
zafgen disclosures 
based on these events,the investors brought a class action suit against zafgen and hughes.the complaint asserted claims on behalf of a putative class consisting of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired zafgen common stock between june,the date of zafgen ipo,and october,the date the company announced the fda partial clinical hold.in the complaint,the investors claimed that the defendants made false or misleading statements concerning the results of the trial,to wit 
as severely obese patients are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease,we measured systemic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk,including low density lipoprotein cholesterol,hdl,crp,triglycerides and blood pressure in trial participants,to determine b eloranib impact on such biomarkers.the results of these biomarker measurements in this trial,as summarized below,suggest that b eloranib treatment does not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and may be associated with reduced cardiovascular disease risk.
there were no deaths or any saes serious adverse events deemed to be possibly,probably,or definitely related to b eloranib,although there were two serious thrombotic adverse events which,while not attributed to b eloranib treatment,may point to the utility of assessment of prior history of thrombotic events in patients enrolled in subsequent trials and added vigilance for aes related to blood clotting during future clinical trials.the most commonly reported teaes adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders,mainly nausea,diarrhea,or vomiting,nervous system disorders,mainly dizziness,and psychiatric disorders,mainly insomnia,sleep disorder,or abnormal dreams.teaes were generally mild in severity and transient.other frequently reported teaes were headaches and injection site,although the incidences were comparable to placebo and not observed to be.
the investors alleged that zafgen made these statements and others that used substantially similar language in ten different documents,all of which hughes signed.these disclosures,the investors maintained,were materially misleading because the fda considers the of adverse events in determining whether a drug is causing those adverse events,meaning that the defendants should have disclosed even the superficial adverse thrombotic events.similarly,the investors alleged that a t all times during the class period,d efendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that there was a significant risk of thrombotic adverse events in future clinical trials of b eloranib.
in response to the investors allegations,the defendants emphasize several other statements made by zafgen in its form and its subsequent sec filings,claiming that these additional disclosures belie the investors accusations of fraudulent intent 
saes that are not characterized by clinical investigators as possibly related to b eloranib or saes that occur in small numbers may not be disclosed to the public until such time the various documents submitted to the fda as part of the approval process are made public.we are unable to determine if the subsequent disclosure of saes will have an adverse effect on our stock price.
many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in development,and we can not be certain that we will not face similar setbacks.these setbacks have been caused by,among other things,findings made while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials,including previously unreported adverse events.
d.the district court dismissal of the complaint 
on august,the district court granted zafgen and hughes motion to dismiss on the ground that the investors had failed to adequately plead scienter with respect to the investors section b claim,the district court determined that the complaint allegations were only marginally material,thus weakening any inference of scienter.the district court then also dismissed the investors section a claim against hughes.this appeal followed.
the investors argue that the district court improperly heightened the pslra pleading requirements,applied these heightened requirements to its complaint,and then mistakenly dismissed both their claims for failing to plead facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.we review whether a complaint meets the pslra pleading requirements de novo,accepting all factual allegations as true and making all reasonable inferences in a plaintiff favor.see.pub.emps.ret.bos.sci,cir.even through this lens,we agree with the district court that the facts alleged in the investors complaint do not give rise to a sufficiently strong inference of scienter.
section b and rule

scienter and the pslra 
scienter encompasses a mental state embracing an intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.ernst ernst hochfelder.at the pleading stage,the pslra requires plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with scienter.b a see also aca fin.guar.advest,cir.describing the pslra pleading standard for scienter as rigorous.in the current setting,scienter encompasses both a conscious intent to defraud and,alternatively,a high degree of recklessness.aca fin.guar,at quoting aldridge cross,cir.specifically,recklessness involves a highly unreasonable omission that involves not merely simple,or even inexcusable,negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and which presents a danger of misleading buyers and sellers that is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the actor must have been aware of it.greebel ftp software,cir.quoting sundstrand sun chem,cir.
meanwhile,t o qualify as strong an inference of scienter must be more than merely plausible or reasonable it must be cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference of nonfraudulent intent.tellabs,at.when evaluating a complaint for compliance with this demanding standard,a court must consider the complaint in its entirety courts must ask whether all the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.id.at.to that effect,we have found the standard met where a complaint contains clear allegations of admissions,internal records or witnessed discussions suggesting that at the time they made the statements claimed to be misleading,the defendant s were aware that they were withholding vital information or at least were warned by others that this was so.in re bos.sci.sec,cir.likewise,a plaintiff may combine various other facts and circumstances indicating fraudulent intent,including those demonstrating motive and opportunity,to satisfy the scienter requirement.aldridge,at.
here,the investors maintain that they met the pslra requirements for pleading scienter.they hinge this argument on their allegations that the defendants knew,or were reckless in not knowing,about news and scientific articles that purportedly established a link between beloranib and the occurrence of thrombotic adverse events and had a motive to commit securities fraud,as shown by zafgen compensation structure and the heavy insider sales that occurred before the patient death.we find these arguments unpersuasive,and therefore hold that the complaint allegations,viewed holistically,do not support a strong inference of scienter under either a conscious intent or recklessness theory.
news and scientific articles 
to start,the investors reliance on news and scientific articles analyzing the effects of angiogenesis inhibitors,the class of drug to which beloranib belongs,is misplaced.the key question in this case is not whether defendants had knowledge of certain undisclosed facts,but rather whether the defendants knew or should have known that their failure to disclose those facts risked misleading investors.city of dearborn heights act police fire ret.waters,cir.internal citation omitted.here,though the articles may suggest that the defendants had an awareness of some connection between beloranib and thrombotic events,they do not show that the defendants deliberately or recklessly risked misleading investors by not disclosing the two superficial adverse thrombotic events from the study until october.see in re nvidia.sec,cir.noting that the articles cited by the plaintiffs did not contribute to a strong inference of scienter,in part because they d id not reflect the defendants knowledge at the time of the alleged misstatements.
for example,two of the cited articles simply analyze the general effects of angiogenesis inhibitors.three other articles,meanwhile,examine clinical trials conducted for drugs other than beloranib which were used to treat cancer,not severe obesity.moreover,developers often administered these other drugs at significantly higher dosage levels compared to those dispensed in the study of those articles that did discuss beloranib,several suggested that lower doses of the drug reduced the risk of potential side effects in patients being treated for ailments.
taken together,the articles do not add much support for the complaint allegation that the defendants knew,or were reckless in not knowing,that they risked misleading investors unless they disclosed the two superficial adverse thrombotic events.see in re ariad.sec,cir.noting that a statement can not be intentionally misleading if the defendant did not have sufficient information at the relevant time to form an evaluation that there was a need to disclose certain information and to form an intent not to disclose it alteration in original quoting biogen idec,at.this conclusion is especially warranted where,as here,the complaint contains no specific facts about any warnings by subordinates or expressions of concern by executives regarding the propriety of allegedly deceptive disclosures.see auto indus.pension tr.fund textron,cir.
motive and insider trading allegations 
the complaint motive allegations are similarly deficient.first,the investors focus on zafgen compensation structure,namely that a significant portion of its executives annual compensation consists of option awards and incentive plan compensation,cash bonuses.they allege that this structure resulted in zafgen insiders,armed with undisclosed information regarding the study results,selling substantial amounts of company shares in september.hughes,for instance,so
