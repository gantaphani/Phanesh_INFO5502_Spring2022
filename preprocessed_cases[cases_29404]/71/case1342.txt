respondent william statile,a former attorney,settled lawsuits brought by parties alleging that he had misappropriated trust funds.the settling plaintiffs reserved their right to seek additional reimbursement from the client security fund csf,administered by appellant state bar of california state bar or the bar.those same settling plaintiffs as well as a trustee of a separate trust alleging wrongdoing by statile applied for reimbursement from the csf,which reimbursed them for losses allegedly caused by statile.the state bar brought this action for reimbursement pursuant to its rights of subrogation under business and professions code section section.on appeal,the bar challenges the trial court conclusion,following a court trial,that the bar right of recovery was limited to money due under the agreement settling lawsuits against statile.we reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounda.statile settles lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trust funds.
statile was an attorney licensed to practice law in the state.in that capacity,he represented the trustees of various trusts.a trust known as the barbettini revocable trust and its successor trustee,bette nicholas,filed three lawsuits in against respondent in san diego superior court case no.the probate case and case nos.and collectively,the barbettini cases.the lawsuits alleged that statile,in his capacity as trustee of the trust,misappropriated trust funds and kept them for his own benefit.respondent statile,the barbettini revocable trust,and nicholas entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the barbettini cases on august,settlement agreement.
the settlement agreement called for statile,among other things,to pay to the barbettini revocable trust by august,and to pay an additional plus interest in periodic installments,with the final payment due on january,in the event of any default in payment,the settlement agreement called for a stipulated judgment to be entered against statile in the amount of minus previous payments.it was undisputed at the time of trial in this case in february that statile had timely made all payments required under the settlement agreement as they had come due.
the settlement agreement also required statile to submit his resignation to the state bar with charges pending,which he did on september.the supreme court accepted statile resignation on august.
finally,the settlement agreement provided that statile not object to any notice of intention to pay sent by the csf for any claims made by the trustees beneficiaries presumably of the barbettini revocable trust for reimbursement from the fund.statile agreed to cooperate in obtaining or providing any additional documentary evidence required by the client security fund in connection with claims made by nicholas.the agreement further provided that statile failure to object to any notice to pay not constitute an admission of the truth of anything alleged in the barbettini cases or in the application to the client security fund.each party was to execute a mutual general release of claims,except that statile release would contain no provision precluding the trustee from claiming and receiving the maximum allowable reimbursement from the client security fund.
csf applications.
four trusts that were continuations of,or created out of,the barbettini revocable trust that was the subject of the settlement agreement collectively,the barbettini trusts filed applications for reimbursement with the csf in march and may.all four applications sought reimbursement for statile alleged misappropriation of trust funds and assets before execution of the settlement agreement.the barbettini family trust submitted an application requesting.the barbettini marital trust submitted an application requesting.the marital trust claimed that its total losses amounted to however,the maximum allowable payment to a csf applicant is.rules of state bar,tit,client security fund matters,rule c csf rules.the barbettini trust submitted an application requesting.the trust claimed that its total losses amounted to.finally,the barbettini trust submitted an application requesting 
statile received notice that the state bar was processing at least three of the four applications.a state bar paralegal notified statile on may,that nicholas had filed applications against statile on behalf of the barbettini family trust,the barbettini marital trust,and the barbettini trust.the barbettini trust submitted its application after the bar sent its letter to statile.the bar letter stated,if reimbursement is made from the fund,the state bar is assigned all rights the applicant may have against you.statile attorney wrote to the state bar paralegal indicating that statile had settled the claims of the barbettini trust and was precluded under the parties settlement agreement from objecting to the applications.the state bar and the csf received a copy of the settlement agreement before issuing notices of intent to pay on the applications.the csf never requested additional documents from statile,did not subpoena him to testify,and did not hold a hearing.
in november,the csf served notices of intention to pay informing statile that the fund planned to pay the entire amount requested in all four applications.the notices set forth the factual allegations against statile and concluded that,if uncontroverted,they established a reimbursable loss under csf rules.consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement,statile did not file any written objection to the notices.
in january,the csf paid a total of to the four trusts that had filed applications,the entire amount requested.the parties to this appeal stipulated in the trial court that at the time the csf made payments to the four barbettini trusts,statile only obligations to those trusts were defined by the terms of the settlement agreement,a copy of which the bar received before paying the applicants.
in july,nicholas submitted two applications to the csf in her capacity as beneficiary of two of the barbettini trusts one sought reimbursement for in connection with statile alleged wrongdoing with respect to the barbettini trust the other sought reimbursement for in connection with statile alleged wrongdoing with respect to the barbettini marital trust.like the applications on behalf of the barbettini trusts,nicholas applications sought compensation for statile alleged misappropriation of trust funds that occurred before the execution of the settlement agreement.
on august,the csf commission issued a tentative decision granting nicholas payment of as a beneficiary of the barbettini marital trust,but denying her payment as a beneficiary of the barbettini trust.the csf commission concluded that nicholas had established a reimbursable loss within the meaning of csf rules.the tentative decision acknowledged that statile and nicholas had entered into a settlement agreement that called for statile to pay in installments,statile had already repaid,and the csf had already reimbursed the barbettini trusts a total of.the commission concluded that nicholas had established a total loss of.it then subtracted the that statile had already paid as opposed to the total amount due under the settlement agreement and the that the csf had already reimbursed to the marital trust,which left a balance of.as a beneficiary of percent of the marital trust,nicholas therefore had a balance owing of percent of.because the maximum reimbursement allowed from the csf is,the commission concluded that nicolas was entitled to reimbursement in that amount.after receiving no objection from statile,nicholas was paid on september.as with the payments made to the barbettini trusts,the parties stipulated before trial in this case that at the time the csf paid nicholas,statile only obligations to her were defined by the terms of the settlement agreement.
although statile could have challenged the csf decisions to reimburse the various applicants by seeking a writ of mandate in superior court pursuant to code of civil procedure section csf rule,he did not do so.
proceedings below.
on april,appellant state bar commenced this action when it filed a complaint against respondent statile seeking,the amount the csf paid to the barbettini trust.the complaint alleged causes of action for embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty and theft of client property.the complaint alleged that statile embezzled money from applicants a term that was undefined in the complaint and had failed to return money to them.statile filed a for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that his obligation to the bar if any was limited to his obligations set forth in the settlement agreement.
on march,the bar filed a second complaint against statile seeking plus interest.this amount represented the money that the csf paid to nicholas as beneficiary of the barbettini marital trust,the barbettini family trust,the barbettini marital trust,the barbettini trust and the barbettini trust.the complaint also sought,which the csf had paid to gloria trumble to reimburse her in connection with statile alleged mishandling of assets of a trust known as the edward schneider trust the trumble claim.according to a csf notice of intention to pay admitted at trial,an order filed in san diego superior court surcharged statile that amount.the trumble claim was apparently unrelated to the barbettini cases.it was not covered by the settlement agreement,and trumble was represented by an attorney different from the one who filed applications on behalf of the various barbettini trusts.
complaint alleged causes of action for embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty and theft of client property.statile filed a for declaratory relief,again seeking a declaration that his obligation to the bar,if any,was limited to his obligations set forth in the settlement agreement.
the state bar two complaints were consolidated.statile filed an interpleader action in san diego superior court,requesting a declaration on the respective rights of nicholas and the bar to the remaining payments due under the settlement agreement.pursuant to an agreement with nicholas,statile deposited payments under the settlement agreement with the san diego court as they became due.
a court trial in this action was held on february.two witnesses testified.respondent statile was questioned about his handling of the barbettini trusts and about the settlement agreement.when asked whether he properly accounted for funds in the barbettini trusts,statile testified,due to an interoffice embezzlement by an employee,linda cortez,i did not and could not properly account for funds,no.with respect to gloria trumble,statile testified that trumble was not a client of his he believed she was an attorney and that he was in a mediation with her.
statile also testified at trial that he never suggested to the settling plaintiffs that they should seek the remainder of the amount he owed them from the csf.he testified that he was s omewhat aware of what the csf was when he entered into the settlement agreement,but that he was n ot at all aware that the fund was designed to ameliorate losses sustained at the hands of attorneys.
matthew zawol,senior counsel to the csf,testified about the general procedures for processing claims to the csf.with respect to the applications that are the subject of this appeal,zawol testified that they were processed in the normal course of business.he acknowledged on that he had no personal knowledge of the facts underlying the various csf applications.
the trial court admitted into evidence the csf applications filed by the four barbettini trusts,the application of nicholas as beneficiary of the barbettini marital trust,and the application of gloria trumble on behalf of the edward schneider trust.they were admitted into evidence not to prove the truth of any assertion set forth in the applications.the trial court admitted for all purposes the csf notices of intent to pay the claims of the four barbettini trusts and the claim of gloria trumble on behalf of the edward schneider trust.it also admitted the csf commission final decision that the bar would pay nicholas as beneficiary of the barbettini marital trust as proof that the client security fund commission made the decision that is stated therein on the first page,but not for the truth of matters asserted therein.
the trial court issued a tentative statement of decision on march.the court concluded that upon making payment to the various applicants,the state bar became subrogated to the rights of the applicants against statile,as they existed on the date of payment,and that those rights were defined by and limited to the terms of the settlement agreement.because the state bar rights against statile are no greater than,and are coextensive with,the applicants rights against statile under the settlement agreement,the bar had the right to the two remaining payments under the agreement.the court also concluded that,consistent with the settlement agreement,the state bar was entitled to an entry of judgment in the amount of less credit for previous payments in the event that statile defaulted 
the trial court issued its final statement of decision on april.although the trial court corrected three typographical errors contained in the proposed statement,it did not change its conclusion that the state bar was entitled only to statile remaining payments under the settlement agreement.like the tentative statement of decision,the final statement of decision did not address the trumble claim.the bar timely appealed from the subsequent judgment.
discussiona.the client security fund.
the legislature enacted section in,authorizing the creation of the csf saleeby state bar cal d.the purpose of the fund is to compensate victims who have incurred monetary loss as the result of their attorneys misconduct,subd.a.pursuant to the csf rules,an applicant may fill out a preprinted form to describe the circumstances surrounding a loss,under penalty of perjury.csf rule.in order to qualify for reimbursement from the csf,an applicant must establish the loss of money or property which came into the hands of an active member of the bar by dishonest conduct while the member was acting as a lawyer,trustee,or fiduciary.csf rule.d ishonest conduct includes,among other things,w rongful acts committed by a lawyer in the nature of theft or embezzlement of money or the wrongful taking or conversion of money or property.csf rule a.before the csf commission directs payment from the fund,it must find that a reimbursable loss has been established by a preponderance of the evidence.csf rule e.after an application is screened,the csf commission tentatively decides what action should be taken,and its tentative decision is served on the applicant and the lawyer whose actions led to the applicant loss.csf rule c.the parties then have days to file any written objections to the proposed recommendations and request a hearing,if desired.csf rule c.the csf then takes final action on the application,which may include directing reimbursement from the fund.csf rule a,b.an attorney or an applicant may seek review in superior court of the final decision of the csf to grant or deny reimbursement pursuant to code of civil procedure section.csf rule.

b.the state bar statutory subrogation rights.
the parties disagree over what subrogation rights the bar acquired against statile when the csf paid the barbettini trusts and nicholas on their claims.section,subdivision b provides upon making a payment to a person who has applied to the fund for payment to relieve or mitigate pecuniary losses caused by the dishonest conduct of an active member of the state bar,the state bar is subrogated,to the extent of that payment,to the rights of the applicant against any person or persons who,or entity that,caused the pecuniary loss.the state bar may bring an action to enforce those rights within three years from the date of payment to the applicant.the trial court concluded,and statile argues on appeal,that because the settlement agreement limited the rights of the barbettini trusts and nicholas to recover from statile,the state bar recovery pursuant to its subrogation rights likewise was limited by the settlement agreement.the state bar argues that the settlement agreement did not so limit its subrogation rights.this is apparently an issue of first impression,as we have found no cases addressing a situation where parties settled a lawsuit but preserved the right of the plaintiff to seek reimbursement from the csf.we begin by setting forth the general principles of subrogation.
subrogation,a legal fiction,is broadly defined as the substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim or right.it is a right which is purely derivative and it permits a party who has been required to satisfy a loss created by a third party wrongful act to step into the shoes of the loser and pursue recovery from the responsible wrongdoer.stated another way,it is a substitution of one person in place of another with reference to a lawful claim,demand or right,so that he who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to a debt or claim,and its rights,remedies,or securities.d subrogation,fns.omitted.statutory subrogation,as its name suggests,arises by an act of the legislature that vests a right of subrogation with a party or category of parties,and it is governed by the terms of the statute under which it is claimed as a matter of statutory construction.id.at,fns.omitted.the nature of subrogation and its prohibition against double recovery make it abundantly clear that subrogation involves succession to the rights of others.rights under subrogation are derivative rights,and succession to another rights,like water,can not rise higher than its source.board of administration glover cal d,quoting ventura county employees retirement association pope d.the true nature of subrogation is that it is applied in all cases in which one party pays a debt for which another is primarily answerable,and which,in equity and good conscience,should have been discharged by the latter.fireman fund ins.wilshire film ventures,th,d.it is abundantly clear here that statile was primarily answerable for any loss suffered by the applicants and,in equity and good conscience,should have been the one to discharge it.ibid.
statile argues that because section,subdivision b provides that the state bar becomes subrogated to the rights of an applicant u pon making a payment to the applicant,the bar acquired the applicants rights as they existed at the time of making the payment.we believe that statile misconstrues the import of this language.the payment of a debt is a prerequisite to acquiring subrogation rights,putnam commissioner,d the familiar rule is that,instanter upon the payment by the guarantor of the debt,the debtor obligation to the creditor becomes an obligation to the guarantor,not a new debt,but,by subrogation,the result of the shift of the original debt from the creditor to the guarantor who steps into the creditor shoes smith parks manor d.insurer becomes subrogated to insured rights upon paying insured claim.in the context of payments from the csf,at the time of payment to an applicant u pon making a payment,the bar acquires a right of action against the wrongdoer,which the bar then has three years to pursue,subd.b.the u pon making a payment language of section,subdivision b merely reflects the general requirement that a payment of a debt is a prerequisite to csf subrogation rights.
the question remains to which rights of the applicant against statile,subd.b the state bar became subrogated when it paid the applicants.there is no dispute that,absent the settlement agreement,the state bar would be entitled to subrogation up to the extent of its payment to the various applicants.ibid.the parties stipulated below that at the time the csf made payments to the barbettini trusts and nicholas as beneficiary of the barbettini marital trust,statile only obligation to the trusts was defined by the terms of the settlement agreement.the trial court concluded that because the state bar rights against statile were no greater than,and we re coextensive with,the applicants rights against statile under the settlement agreement,this meant that the bar was entitled only to statile remaining payments under the settlement agreement.in other words,the state bar was subrogated only to the rights that the applicants had against statile as set forth in the settlement agreement.however,the settlement agreement itself specifically provided that nicholas and the barbettini trust were permitted to seek full reimbursement for their losses from the csf the agreement also provided that statile would not object to any notice of intent to pay issued by the csf these provisions necessarily contemplated that the csf would be permitted to seek reimbursement from statile.had the settlement agreement truly barred the csf from seeking full reimbursement from statile,above what he was obligated to pay under the settlement agreement,it would have been unnecessary for statile to waive his right to object to any notice of intent,as he would have had no interest in the proceedings before the csf.moreover,we construe statile agreement not to object to the settling plaintiffs seeking payment from the csf as a waiver of his present claim that the bar is precluded from enforcing its subrogation rights above what is owed under the settlement agreement.the statutory scheme contemplates that the csf may seek reimbursement from a former attorney who caused a client monetary loss through its right of subrogation,subd.b.by permitting the settling plaintiffs to seek reimbursement from the csf,statile implicitly acknowledged that the csf would be permitted to seek reimbursement from him.
undoubtedly due to the paucity of directly applicable and controlling case law,the parties argue subrogation law from other arenas,by analogy.thus,statile argues generally that an assignee has no greater rights against an obligor than did the original assignor.although the bar is not an insurer,this general proposition is consistent with the rule in the insurance context that an insurer in its role as subrogee has no greater rights than those possessed by its insured,and its claims are subject to the same defenses.commercial union assurance city of san jose d.statile in effect argues that he may use the settlement agreement as a defense to an action brought by the bar in the same way he could use it in an action brought by the settling plaintiffs.were the barbettini trust or nicholas or both to pursue an action against statile even though he had timely made all payments due under the settlement agreement,he no doubt would rely on the settlement agreement as a defense to any recovery beyond the amount he owed under the agreement.statile has no such defense against the bar,however,because he specifically waived his right to object to the bar payment of money to the applicants.he therefore likewise waived any objection to the bar seeking reimbursement against him pursuant to its statutory subrogation rights.were we to hold otherwise,statile would get the benefit of having had the state bar reimburse the barbettini trusts and nicholas for his wrongdoing,without any obligation to pay a debt for which he is primarily if not solely responsible.
we emphasize that the bar subrogation rights are granted by statute and do not arise by contract.california courts have recognized that statutory subrogation rights may be greater than those that arise by common law.the effect of the statutory language as to subrogation is not to afford the uninsured tortfeasor an advantage but is to place in the hands of the injured person insurer the right to enforce the tortfeasor liability to the extent that payment was made by the insurer.johnson oliver d.insurer settlement with insured for uninsured motorist insurance did not limit insurer ability to pursue cause of action against tortfeasor.in phoenix of hartford ins.companies colony kitchens d,the court analyzed the version of insurance code section,subdivision g governing uninsured motorist claims,which is similar to section,subdivision b.phoenix at.the statute provided the insurer paying a claim under an uninsured motorist endorsement or coverage shall be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the insured to whom such claim was paid against any persons causing such injury to the extent that payment was made.such action may be brought within three years from the date that payment was made hereunder,quoting,subd.g.the court held that the insurer cause of action under the statute was barred where it was added as a plaintiff in an insured action after the statute of limitations on the insurer as opposed the insured claim under the insurance code had run.phoenix at.the phoenix court noted that rights under the uninsured motorist statute were statutory that a cause of action under the statute is a cause of action in favor of the insurer is not a cause of action in favor of the insured must be brought by the insurer and may not be brought by the insured.id.at.see also west american ins.chalk d.because subrogation rights provided in uninsured motorist statute are statutory and not common law rights,principle that an insurer can have no greater rights than insured as subrogor are inapplicable.
although the bar did not make payments here as an insurer,its subrogation rights were nonetheless statutory and not derivative.this is reflected in section,subdivision b,which provides that the bar may bring an action to enforce its subrogation rights within three years of paying an applicant,regardless of which statute of limitations applies to an applicant claim against an attorney.it follows that the bar acquired a cause of action against statile separate from a cause of action held by the various applicants.in fact,because the state bar as a subrogee has no contractual relationship with statile,we doubt that any unilateral action by statile or any action by statile and the claimants could ever alter his statutory obligation to the bar.we need not decide here whether the parties could have limited the bar subrogation rights,however,because the settlement agreement specifically provided that statile would not object to the bar paying the settling plaintiffs,and thus preserved the bar right to pursue its subrogation rights granted by statute.
the bar argues the applicability of surety law to the present case,again by analogy.in general,where a surety is contractually obligated to pay for a debt owed to a creditor,the debtor alteration of his obligation to the creditor also affects the obligation of the party who promised to pay the underlying debt.as statile correctly notes,however,the state bar is not a surety.a surety is one who promises to answer for the debt,default,or miscarriage of another,or hypothecates property as security therefor.payments made by the csf are by statute discretionary,subd.a csf rule d,a fact recognized by the parties below when they stipulated that a ll payments made from the csf are made entirely at the discretion of the csf.there is likewise no preexisting contractual relationship between the state bar and applicants when they seek reimbursement from the csf.indeed,csf rules specifically provide that no client or member of the public shall have any right in the csf as a creditor.csf rule d.the csf therefore does not promise to answer for any attorney debt,and is not a surety or insurer,for that matter.
for that reason,the surety cases,upon which both parties rely,are inapposite.statile directs us to richards,chartered construction th,d,which held that a settlement agreement between a general contractor and a subcontractor exonerated the general contractor surety the issuer of a stop notice release bond.id.at,d.the promisee subcontractor release of the principal general contractor extinguished the principal obligation and impaired the promisee rights and remedies against the principal within the meaning of civil code section which therefore released the surety of its obligation to pay on the stop notice release bond.richards,supra,at,d.it is logical that where a surety is under a contractual obligation to pay on a stop notice release bond because of a debt allegedly owed to a creditor,and the debtor alters the obligation to the creditor,the surety is released from its obligation.here,however,the bar was under no contractual obligation to pay statile debt,and therefore there was no preexisting obligation to be altered by the settlement agreement.moreover,richards did not address the question of whether the surety could pursue reimbursement from the primary obligor for any money paid to the creditor,because,unlike the bar,it never paid money to the creditor.
to support its position,the bar relies on the restatement of security,section,and comment d thereto which provide that a reservation of rights against a surety in a settlement agreement preserves the right of the surety to pursue reimbursement against a principal.we note,however,that this section of the restatement of security has been superseded by section of the restatement third of suretyship and guaranty,which substantially revises the law upon which the parties focus on appeal axess,intercargo ins.cir,hall son ace masonry,fn.the principles set forth in either restatement are not persuasive here,however,because the bar is not a surety.for the same reason,cases interpreting section,upon which the bar relies,are likewise inapposite 
the bar directs us to no california case that addresses this issue where an injured party releases a tortfeasor but reserves its right against a party with statutory subrogation rights,is that party later permitted to seek reimbursement from the tortfeasor if it pays money that the tortfeasor owed the injured party our independent research likewise has not revealed any california case that has addressed this precise question although statile had no specific knowledge that the bar would pay the barbettini trusts and nicholas at the time he settled their lawsuits against him,he certainly knew that was a possibility and perhaps a probability,given his concurrent agreement not to object to the applications,and it therefore would be unfair to disallow the bar subrogation rights here.
if statile position were correct,it would work a great injustice to the bar and to the csf,and ultimately would result in all members of the state bar in essence paying for the harm that statile alone harm that he alone should ultimately be responsible for.carried to its logical conclusion,under statile logic,any member of the bar who caused financial loss to his clients through his wrongdoing could arguably settle a civil suit brought by the clients for pennies on the dollar,preserve the clients right to seek reimbursement from the csf,shift responsibility for reimbursement to the csf,and escape liability for the majority of the monetary loss occasioned by his misconduct.of course,this injustice would be especially egregious if the csf had no notice of the settlement prior to acting upon the application for reimbursement.for example in the present case,had the state bar paid the barbettini trusts and nicholas without notice of the settlement agreement,it would be fundamentally inequitable to hold that the settlement agreement to which the bar was not a party and in which the bar had no role in negotiating limited its subrogation rights.
in sum,we conclude that neither the statutory scheme nor the settlement agreement in the present case limits the bar subrogation rights against statile.the trial court therefore erred when it concluded that the settlement agreement limited the bar right to recover from statile.in light of our conclusion,we need not address many of the bar various other arguments on appeal,such as whether the settlement agreement was illegal,whether affirming the judgment would serve as a disincentive to future settlements,or whether there was a failure of proof as to whether the parties to the settlement agreement entered into a release of claims.
we do find it necessary,however,to address certain other issues raised on appeal that are likely to arise on remand.the parties on appeal agree on the basic proposition that the state bar is subrogated to the rights of the barbettini trusts and nicholas,but focus almost exclusively on what that means in practice.having concluded that the state bar is entitled to reimbursement to the extent of its payment to the applicants notwithstanding the settlement agreement,we next consider whether the parties may litigate on remand whether the bar is entitled only to less than full reimbursement.
collateral estoppel applies.
the state bar determines whether it will reimburse an applicant,and it must then bring a separate action to enforce its rights against the alleged wrongdoer,subd.b.the trial court concluded that the determination that an applicant is entitled to reimbursement from the csf has no effect on the bar subsequent action against the offending attorney to pursue its subrogation rights.the court statement of decision stated decisions by the csf or the csf commission to pay the applicants did not constitute an adjudication of the applicants rights against statile at the time of payment,and did not establish state bar rights of subrogation against statile,and such decisions,therefore,have no res judicata effect in these regards against statile.on appeal,the state bar claims that collateral estoppel,a different but related legal doctrine,precludes statile from challenging the csf decision to reimburse various applicants.we agree.
collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.the doctrine applies only if several threshold requirements are fulfilled.first,the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation must be identical to that decided in a former proceeding.second,this issue must have been actually litigated in the former proceeding.third,it must have been necessarily decided in the former proceeding.fourth,the decision in the former proceeding must be final and on the merits.finally,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the former proceeding.citations.the party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.pacific lumber state water resources control bd.cal th,d,pacific lumber.there is no dispute that the fourth and fifth elements are met here.because the time for challenging the csf decisions to reimburse the applicants by writ of mandate has long since passed,those decisions are final and on the merits.statile,the party against whom preclusion is sought,is the same as the party to the former proceeding.
the trial court concluded that the first element did not apply here namely,that the applicants rights against statile at the time of payment by the csf and the bar rights of subrogation against statile the issues to be determined in this action were not identical to the csf decision to pay the applicants having concluded,however,that the state bar is entitled to subrogation to the extent of its payment to the various applicants,subd.b,nothing remains to be determined upon remand.the csf decision to pay the applicants,in the amount they did,in fact determined the amount that statile now owes to the bar pursuant to the bar statutory right of subrogation,under the specific language of section,subdivision b.in light of this conclusion,it is also clear that the second and third elements of collateral estoppel are met here.the issue of whether to reimburse the applicants was actually litigated and necessarily decided in the former proceeding.
because statile is collaterally estopped from arguing that the bar is not entitled to full reimbursement for the amount the csf paid the barbettini trusts and nicholas,judgment should be entered in the bar favor on those claims.
no right of reimbursement in form of bar dues.
the state bar argues in passing that it was entitled to full reimbursement pursuant to section,subdivisions c and d,in addition to subdivision b.although we have concluded that the bar is entitled to full reimbursement pursuant to section,subdivision b,the same is not true with respect to subdivisions c and d.as set forth above,subdivision c provides that an attorney shall reimburse the csf as a condition of continued practice,or,in the case of a member who resigned,as a condition of reinstatement of membership.subdivision d provides that any assessment against an attorney pursuant to subdivision c that is part of an order imposing a public reproval on a member or is part of an order imposing discipline or accepting a resignation with a disciplinary matter pending,may also be enforced as a money judgment.
the bar certainly would be entitled to full reimbursement plus interest and costs from statile if he ever seeks reinstatement of membership,subd.c,as statile acknowledges on appeal.had statile been an active member of the bar when the csf reimbursed the applicants,he likewise would have been required to repay the full amount again,plus interest and costs as a condition of continued practice.ibid.however,because the supreme court accepted statile resignation from the bar months before the csf issued its first notices of intent to pay the applicants,and statile has not sought to practice law since his resignation,section,subdivision c requiring full reimbursement as a condition of continued practice or reinstatement is inapplicable here section,subdivision d provides that a ny assessment against an attorney pursuant to subdivision c that is part of an order imposing a public reproval on a member or is part of an order imposing discipline or accepting a resignation with a disciplinary matter pending,may also be enforced as a money judgment.because no such assessment has been made,subdivision d likewise is inapplicable.
e.the trumble claim.
the bar sought reimbursement in this action for that the csf paid on the trumble claim,which was not covered by the settlement agreement.statile counsel acknowledged below that the claim was properly before the court,but that we simply need to see the bar evidence and proof.the parties presented evidence regarding the claim,and the trial court heard argument about it.
on march,the bar filed a proposed statement of decision that did not specifically mention the trumble claim,except to cite to an attached table that listed the trumble claim along with the claims by nicholas and the barbettini trusts.on march,the trial court issued its tentative statement of decision the statement did not mention the trumble claim.the bar objected to the tentative statement,but it did not argue that the trial court had failed to address the trumble claim.the trial court final statement of decision did not address the trumble claim.
without any citation to the record or any legal authority whatsoever,the bar argues on appeal the court denied relief for the trumble claim,without any findings and without any reason.accordingly,appellant is entitled to reimbursement from statile for the payments made on the trumble claim.in general,a judgment or order of a lower court is presumed to be correct on appeal,and all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of its correctness.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d.i f the statement of decision fails to resolve a controverted issue or is ambiguous the defects must be brought to the court attention to avoid presumptions in favor of the judgment.id.at,litigant who claimed on appeal that trial court statement of decision failed to decide two matters on which a decision was requested waived right to complain about error on appeal judgment therefore affirmed code civ,when statement of decision does not resolve a controverted issue and record shows that omission was brought to attention of trial court,it shall not be inferred on appeal that the trial court decided in favor of the prevailing party as to thos
