mark levy levy,is a shareholder of immunogen,inc immunogen.he brings this shareholder derivative action alleging that defendant,southbrook international investment,southbrook,by virtue of its ownership of immunogen convertible preferred shares,is a more than beneficial owner of immunogen common stock and realized short swing profits through the purchase and sale of immunogen stock within a six month period.seeks disgorgement of southbrook profits as required by section b of the securities and exchange act of as amended,b the exchange act.
article iii,paragraph the conversion cap of the convertible preferred stock purchase agreement between immunogen and southbrook the agreement provides that southbrook may not convert shares to the extent that such conversion would result in southbrook owning more than of immunogen outstanding common stock.
there is no claim that southbrook ever exceeded the conversion cap.rather,claims that due to southbrook ability to make limited conversions and sales over a period it could have cumulatively owned more than of immunogen common stock within the meaning of a and d i rules a and d i,respectively.therefore,according to,southbrook is a more than beneficial owner within the meaning of section b and subject to section b trading liability.
in the alternative,contends that 
the agreement is void as a sham transaction the conversion limitation provision is void pursuant to rule b and the conversion limitation constitutes a waiver of section b,and therefore is void pursuant to section a of the exchange act as amended,a 
southbrook counters that,because the conversion cap prevents southbrook from owning,at any one point,more than of immunogen common stock,southbrook is not a more than beneficial owner within the meaning of rules a and d i,and consequently,is not subject to section b trading liability.additionally,according to southbrook,because the conversion cap is valid and binding,alternative grounds for relief are inapplicable.
we conclude that where a binding conversion cap denies an investor the right to acquire more than of the underlying equity securities of an issuer,at any one time,the investor is not,by virtue of his or her ownership of convertible securities,the beneficial owner of more than of those equity securities within the meaning of rules a and d i.we further find that the conversion cap in this case is binding,and accordingly,affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
the allegations in the complaint disclose the following.on october,southbrook and immunogen entered into the agreement.pursuant to the agreement southbrook agreed to purchase immunogen convertible preferred stock.the agreement limits southbrook ability to convert the preferred stock to the extent that such conversion would result in southbrook owning more than of the common stock,at any one time.the conversion cap in part reads as follows 
purchaser ownership of common stock.the purchaser may not use its ability to convert shares hereunder or under the terms of the vote certificates or to exercise its right to acquire shares of common stock under the warrants to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in the purchaser owning more than of the outstanding shares of the common stock.
joint app.at convertible preferred stock purchase agreement.
alleges that by february,southbrook was a more than beneficial owner of immunogen outstanding common stock by virtue of southbrook ownership of immunogen convertible preferred stock.the complaint further alleges that between january and february,southbrook acquired immunogen common shares through conversion and sold them presumably at a profit.southbrook allegedly repeated this process between january and august,and again in october.
on december,demanded that immunogen board of directors bring an action to cause southbrook to disgorge its alleged,short swing profits.see levy southbrook international investments,civ.nrb,wl,at may.by letter dated february,the board refused,and this suit followed.see id.
mark levy,derivatively on behalf of immunogen,brought this action for disgorgement pursuant to section b of the exchange act,claiming that southbrook improperly profited from its investment in immunogen because it was a more than beneficial owner of immunogen common stock.see id.at.southbrook filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,for failure to state a claim,on the ground that the conversion cap prevented it from being a more than beneficial owner of immunogen common stock.see id.southbrook motion to dismiss was accompanied by an affidavit and copies of various documents referred to in the complaint 
the district court,in a written opinion,granted southbrook motion to dismiss.see id.it found beneficial ownership argument inconsistent with precedent in this circuit.see id.citing levner saud,aff,levner prince alwaleed,cir.additionally,the district court concluded that it is clear that only those holders of derivative securities,who could acquire ownership,by conversion or otherwise,of more than of the common stock,at one time,are subject to b liability.id.at emphasis in original.
finally,in response to alternative grounds for relief,the district court held that because conversion caps are legitimate the sham transaction doctrine was inapplicable since there was no plan or scheme to evade,and the plaintiff did not allege such in his complaint,the conversion cap was not void pursuant to rule b and section a applied only to express waivers of,and there was no such waiver here.see id.at.

ii.discussion 
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to.b de novo.see feder frost,cir.issues of statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo.see united states proyect,cir.although on a motion to dismiss a court must accept all factual allegations as true and draw all inferences in the plaintiff favor,see sheppard beerman,cir,dismissal is appropriate if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.see cooper parsky,cir.
additionally,this court is bound by the sec interpretations of its regulations in its amicus briefs,unless they are plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s,press quick reilly,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
section b of the exchange act compels corporate insiders to disgorge profits earned on purchases and sales of securities made within six months of each other.see securities and exchange act of b,b.l iability under b does not attach unless the plaintiff proves that there was a purchase and a sale of securities by an officer or director of the issuer or by a shareholder who owns more than of any one class of the issuer securities within a six month period.gwozdzinsky fund,cir emphasis added.in other words,only officers,directors,and persons who beneficially own more than of an issuer common stock are subject to section b short swing trading liability.inasmuch as southbrook is neither an officer nor a director of immunogen,section b liability can attach only if it is a more than beneficial owner.therefore,the issue presented is whether southbrook,despite the existence of the conversion cap,is a more than beneficial owner of immunogen common stock.
an investor subject to an effective,binding conversion cap of is not a more than beneficial owner of the underlying equity stock 
section b does not define the term more than beneficial owner,but rule promulgated thereunder provides that for the purposes of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of more than of any class of equity securities the term beneficial owner shall mean any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder.see a.rule,in turn,determines beneficial ownership.it states 
a for purposes of sections d and g
