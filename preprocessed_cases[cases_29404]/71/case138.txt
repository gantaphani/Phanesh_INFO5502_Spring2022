lead plaintiffs state boston retirement system and fjarde ap fonden brought this putative securities fraud class action on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated investors plaintiffs pursuant to sections b and a,b and a,of the securities exchange act of.they allege that morgan stanley and six of its officers and former officers john mack,zoe cruz,david sidwell,thomas colm kelleher,and thomas daula collectively,morgan stanley or defendants made material misstatements and omissions between june,and november,the class period in an effort to conceal morgan stanley exposure to and losses from the subprime mortgage market.as a result,plaintiffs claim,they suffered substantial financial loss when morgan stanley stock prices dropped following public disclosure of the truth about morgan stanley positions and losses.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,dismissed all claims on the pleadings for failure to state a claim,and we affirm.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs claim that defendants omission of information purportedly required to be disclosed under item of regulation s k,a ii item,violated section b.we also affirm its order dismissing plaintiffs other claims in a summary order issued simultaneously with this decision.
this case arises out of a massive proprietary trade executed by morgan stanley proprietary trading group in december.the trade consisted of two components a billion short position short position and a billion long position long position.in the short position,morgan stanley purchased credit default swaps cdss on collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by mezzanine tranches of subprime residential securities rmbss these cdss operated like insurance policies morgan stanley paid annual premiums for the assurance that,if the housing market worsened and the mezzanine rmbs tranches backing its cdos defaulted or declined in value,it would receive payments.in the long position,morgan stanley sold cdss.these cdss,like those it bought for the short position,referenced cdos backed by mezzanine tranches of subprime rmbss.but the cdos referenced by the long position were tranches of cdos that were and than the cdos referenced by the short position.through the long position,morgan stanley therefore received premium payments for the guarantee that it would pay the cds purchasers in the event that these cdo tranches defaulted or declined in value.morgan stanley could use the income from those premiums to finance the short position,but would have to make payouts if the cdo tranches referenced by the long position suffered defaults up to a maximum of billion in the event of a percent default in these cdos.in essence,the company was betting that defaults in the subprime mortgage markets would be significant enough to impair the value of the cdo tranches referenced by the short position,but not significant enough to impair the value of the cdo tranches referenced by the long position.
according to the plaintiffs,b y mid,the biggest housing bubble in history had popped.subprime mortgages issued in and,like those backing morgan stanley proprietary trade,rapidly began to suffer from delinquencies and defaults.on february,morgan stanley economist richard berner acknowledged that these s oaring defaults signal that the meltdown in subprime mortgage lending is now underway.although morgan stanley proprietary trading group had correctly predicted the direction that the subprime housing market would turn,it apparently underestimated the magnitude of the collapse.the value of morgan stanley swap positions declined substantially over the course of,and morgan stanley ultimately lost billions of dollars on the proprietary trade.
plaintiffs allege that defendants made numerous material misstatements and omissions from june,through november,to conceal morgan stanley exposure to and losses from this subprime proprietary trade.the second amended complaint identifies two categories of misrepresentations and omissions misrepresentations and omissions regarding morgan stanley exposure to credit risk related to the subprime mortgage market arising from its long position the exposure claim,and misrepresentations regarding morgan stanley losses arising from the long position the valuation claim.plaintiffs allege that these misstatements and omissions fraudulently inflated morgan stanley stock price during the class period and caused them to suffer financially when the market learned the truth about morgan stanley exposure and losses.
exposure claim 
the second amended complaint alleges that defendants materially misrepresented morgan stanley exposure to the subprime mortgage market.plaintiffs rely on four statements from morgan stanley officers,and one alleged omission.first,on a june,call with market analysts about morgan stanley second quarter earnings,defendant sidwell stated that concerns early in the quarter about whether issues in the market were going to spread dissipated.second,on that same call,sidwell responded to a request to characterize morgan stanley position in the mortgage market and to explain the decline in the company fixed income revenues by stating that morgan stanley really did benefit from conditions in the subprime market in the first quarter of,and certainly did not lose money in this business during the second quarter.third,during another earnings call with market analysts on september,defendant kelleher stated that morgan stanley remain ed exposed to risk exposures through a number of instruments including cdos,without describing the extent of that exposure.and fourth,kelleher stated in an october,interview with cibc world markets analyst meredith whitney that he did not see further to morgan stanley carrying values over the near term.plaintiffs claim that each of these statements was materially false or misleading.
as pertinent here,plaintiffs also allege that defendants made material omissions in their q filings by failing to disclose the existence of the long position,that morgan stanley had sustained losses on that position in the second and third quarters of,and that the company was likely to incur additional significant losses on the position in the future.they argue that item of regulation s k and related guidance requires companies to disclose on their q filings any known trends,or uncertainties that have had,or might reasonably be expected to have,a n unfavorable material effect on the company revenue,operating income or net income.plaintiffs claim that b y july,at the latest,defendants knew that the long position was reasonably expected to have an unfavorable material effect on revenue.it is not disputed that morgan stanley did not make this item disclosure on its q filings in.
valuation claim 
in a separate claim,the second amended complaint alleges that morgan stanley overstated its earnings in the third quarter of because it did not sufficiently write down the value of its long position.according to plaintiffs,the long position value was inherently linked to an index of rmbss known as the index the abx index.thus,when the abx index declined by percent in the third quarter of,morgan stanley should have marked down the value of the long position by that same percentage and disclosed the loss in its quarterly statement.instead of taking that billion markdown,however,morgan stanley recognized only a billion loss on the long position after valuing it using internal models that did not exclusively rely on the abx index.plaintiffs allege that morgan stanley later wrote down the value of the long position by a percentage greater than that dictated by the abx index in order to make up for the misstatement in the third quarter.
procedural history 
plaintiffs brought suit in the united states district court for the central district of california,filing an initial complaint in early and then an amended complaint on november.the case was then transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,where defendants moved to dismiss all claims pursuant to rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure and section b of the private securities litigation reform act.stratte mcclure morgan stanley,d.the district court granted the motion to dismiss on april.id.at.on the exposure claim,the district court ruled that the amended complaint did not specify why defendants statements about risk and its trading positions were false or misleading and decided that defendants had no obligation to disclose the long position.see id.at.on the valuation claim,the district court ruled that plaintiffs failed to plead loss causation.see id.at.the court granted plaintiffs leave to amend their pleadings with regard to the exposure claim and loss causation on the valuation claim,but otherwise dismissed plaintiffs claims with prejudice.see id.at.
on june,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and defendants moved to dismiss soon thereafter.once again,the district court dismissed all of the claims.stratte mcclure morgan stanley,civ,wl.the district court found no reason to alter its earlier decision that plaintiffs failed to plead loss causation for the valuation claim.see id.at.with regard to the affirmative statements considered in connection with the exposure claim,the district court found no reason to alter its earlier decision that plaintiffs did not sufficiently plead falsity.see id.at.but this time,the court ruled that morgan stanley did have a duty under item to disclose the long position in its form q filings.see id.at.the district court justified the change in its stance by relying on this court intervening decisions in panther partners ikanos communications,cir,and litwin blackstone group,cir,which held that item may provide a basis for disclosure obligations under sections and a of the securities act of.wl,at.the district court nevertheless dismissed the exposure claim after deciding that the second amended complaint failed to plead a strong inference of scienter with respect to defendants failure to disclose the long position.id.at.plaintiffs now appeal both district court decisions.

this opinion addresses the district court decision that morgan stanley failure to disclose the long position in its july and october q filings,in alleged disregard of item of regulation s k,constituted an actionable omission under section b and rule we conclude,as a matter of first impression in this court,that a failure to make a required item disclosure in a q filing is indeed an omission that can serve as the basis for a section b securities fraud claim.however,such an omission is actionable only if it satisfies the materiality requirements outlined in basic levinson,d,and if all of the other requirements to sustain an action under section b are fulfilled.here,the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs exposure claim predicated on morgan stanley failure to disclose under item because the second amended complaint did not sufficiently plead scienter.
the supreme court has instructed that s ilence,absent a duty to disclose,is not misleading under rule.basic,at see also chiarella united states,d.as a result,we have consistently held that an omission is actionable under the securities laws only when the corporation is subject to a duty to disclose the omitted facts.in re time warner.sec,cir see glazer formica,cir.such a duty may arise when there is a corporate insider trad ing on confidential information,a statute or regulation requiring disclosure,or a corporate statement that would otherwise be inaccurate,incomplete,or misleading.glazer,at quoting backman polaroid,cir en banc accord oran stafford,cir.
as plaintiffs correctly argue,item of regulation s k imposes disclosure requirements on companies filing reports,including quarterly form q reports.see louis loss joel seligman,fundamentals of securities regulation ed.those requirements include the obligation to d escribe any known trends or uncertainties that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material unfavorable impact on revenues or income from continuing operations.a ii.the sec has provided guidance on item,clarifying that disclosure is necessary where a trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have material effects on the registrant financial conditions or results of operations.management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,exchange act release,docket,wl,at may,hereinafter exchange act release.
item affirmative duty to disclose in form qs can serve as the basis for a securities fraud claim under section b.we have already held that failing to comply with item by omitting known trends or uncertainties from a registration statement or prospectus is actionable under sections and a of the securities act of see panther partners,at litwin,at accord j r mktg.motors,cir silverstrand invs.amag,cir.like section a,rule requires disclosure of material fact s necessary in order to make statements made not misleading.this court and our sister circuits have long recognized that a duty to disclose under section b can derive from statutes or regulations that obligate a party to speak.see,glazer,at backman,at oran,at gallagher abbott,cir.and this conclusion stands to reason for omitting an item required to be disclosed on a q can render that financial statement misleading.like registration statements and prospectuses,form qs are mandatory filings that speak to the entire market.shaw digital equip,cir abrogated by statute on other grounds.as required elements of those filings,item disclosures give investors an opportunity to look at the registrant through the eyes of management by providing a historical and prospective analysis of the registrant financial condition and results of operations.exchange act release,wl,at.due to the obligatory nature of these regulations,a reasonable investor would interpret the absence of an item disclosure to imply the nonexistence of known trends or uncertainties that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material unfavorable impact on revenues or income from continuing operations.a ii see also donald langevoort mitu gulati,the muddled duty to disclose under rule,vand.it follows that item imposes the type of duty to speak that can,in appropriate cases,give rise to liability under section b 
the failure to make a required disclosure under item,however,is not by itself sufficient to state a claim for securities fraud under section b.significantly,rule makes only material omissions actionable.b b.in basic levinson,the supreme court concluded that,in securities fraud cases under section b and rule,the materiality of an allegedly required forwardlooking disclosure is determined by a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity.at quoting sec texas gulf sulfur,cir en banc emphasis added.the sec test for a duty to report under item,on the other hand,involves a and different inquiry.once a trend becomes known,management must make two assessments 
is the known trend likely to come to fruition if management determines that it is not reasonably likely to occur,no disclosure is required.
if management can not make that determination,it must evaluate objectively the consequences of the known trend on the assumption that it will come to fruition.disclosure is then required unless management determines that a material effect on the registrant financial condition or results of operations is not reasonably likely to occur.
exchange act release,wl,at.according to the sec,this disclosure standard is unique to item,and t he test for materiality approved by the supreme court in basic is inapposite.id.at see also oran,at noting that item disclosure obligations extend considerably beyond those required by rule.
since the supreme court interpretation of material in rule dictates whether a private plaintiff has properly stated a claim,we conclude that a violation of item disclosure requirements can only sustain a claim under section b and rule if the allegedly omitted information satisfies basic test for materiality.that is,a plaintiff must first allege that the defendant failed to comply with item in a q or other filing.such a showing establishes that the defendant had a duty to disclose.a plaintiff must then allege that the omitted information was material under basic test,because only makes unlawful an omission of material information that is necessary to make statements made,in this case the form qs,not misleading.matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d quoting b b internal quotation marks omitted.of course,as with any section b claim,a plaintiff must also sufficiently plead scienter,a connection between the omission and the purchase or sale of a security,reliance on the omission,and an economic loss caused by that reliance.levitt morgan,cir.
we note that our conclusion is at odds with the ninth circuit recent opinion in in re nvidia.securities litigation,cir.that case held that item disclosure duty is not actionable under section b and rule,relying on a third circuit opinion by alito,oran stafford,at.but oran simply determined that,b ecause the materiality standards for rule and item differ significantly,a violation of item does not automatically give rise to a material omission under rule.id.at emphasis added.having already decided that the omissions in that case were not material under basic,the third circuit concluded that item could not provide a basis for liability.id.contrary to the ninth circuit implication that oran compels a conclusion that item violations are never actionable under,oran actually suggested,without deciding,that in certain instances a violation of item could give rise to a material omission.at a minimum,oran is consistent with our decision that failure to comply with item in a form q can give rise to liability under rule so long as the omission is material under basic,and the other elements of rule have been established.
the ninth circuit opinion in nvidia also misconstrues the relationship between rule and section a of the securities act.in litwin and panther partners,we established that item creates a duty to disclose for the purposes of liability under section a.litwin,at panther partners,at.the ninth circuit had also adopted that position.see steckman hart brewing,cir.in nvidia,a panel of the ninth circuit found these decisions irrelevant to its interpretation of rule.but section a prohibition on omissions is textually identical to that of rule both make unlawful omission of material fact s necessary in order to make statements,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.see also b.sec regulations,like item,dictate the contents of mandatory disclosures be they form qs in the case of rule or prospectuses in the case of section a and are therefore an essential part of the circumstances under which such disclosures are made.litwin and panther partners recognized that issuing financial statements that omit elements required by item can mislead investors.those decisions provide firm footing for our decision in this case.
applying the standards set forth above,we conclude that plaintiffs have adequately alleged that defendants breached their item duty to disclose that morgan stanley faced a deteriorating subprime mortgage market that,in light of the company exposure to the market,was likely to cause trading losses that would materially affect the company financial condition.we assume,arguendo,that this omission was material under basic.we nonetheless affirm the district court dismissal of the claim,concluding that plaintiffs failed adequately to plead scienter.plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that,by the second and third quarters of,there was a significant downward trend in the subprime residential mortgage market that could negatively affect morgan stanley overall financial position.to begin with,plaintiffs allege that market watchers,including morgan stanley analysts,reported a downward trend in the real estate and subprime mortgage markets as early as.by february,a morgan stanley economist had written that s oaring defaults signal that the meltdown in subprime mortgage lending is now underway,and the company own cdo analysts reported significant risks to cdos backed by asset backed securities,including rmbss.that trend continued into the summer,when morgan stanley analysts allegedly reported that r atings downgrades in asset backed cdo tranches are inevitable and material,that those cdos were expected to remain under severe pressure,and that longterm value assessment metrics would continue to decline.emphasis omitted.
plaintiffs have also plausibly alleged that morgan stanley had significant exposure to a sharp downturn in the subprime market through its long position.at the beginning of the class period,defendants had already written down the long position by million as a result of the weakening market.while that did not exceed gains from the short position,it did catch the defendants attention,and morgan stanley ordered stress tests on the long position and then initiated a task force to find strategies to sell off its assets that were placed at risk by the collapse of the subprime market.at the motion to dismiss stage,these allegations are sufficient to support a claim that morgan stanley was faced with a known trend that was reasonably expected to have material effects on the company financial position.exchange act release,wl at emphasis omitted describing reduction in the registrant product prices erosion in the registrant market share changes in insurance coverage or the likely of a material contract as examples of currently known trends.
defendants argue that they satisfied their obligations under item by disclosing the deterioration of the real estate,credit,and subprime mortgage markets,and its potential negatively to affect morgan stanley.but morgan stanley disclosures about market trends were generic,spread out over several different filings,and often unconnected to the company financial position.such generic cautionary language does not satisfy item.see panther partners,at.the sec has emphasized that item requires not only a discussion but also an analysis of known material trends,and that disclosure is necessary to an understanding of a company performance,and the extent to which reported financial information is indicative of fu
