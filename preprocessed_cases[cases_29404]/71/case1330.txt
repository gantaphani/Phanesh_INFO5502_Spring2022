on april,defendant objected to the proposed statement of decision,arguing that the trial court failed to address four arguments he had raised at trial he was not in privity with the investors each investment was exempt from the qualification requirement as each investor had a personal or business relationship with defendant or cole he did not know the statements made to investors were false and he could not be liable for substantially assisting cole in cole violations of the securities law.the trial court responded by stating that it had specifically found that defendant was a seller of the securities,fraudulently offered them for sale,and sold rendering any legal arguments against substantial assistance liability moot.the court also stated that it had found defendant exemption argument to be inapplicable.the trial court adopted its proposed statement of decision as its statement of decision.
judgment was entered in accordance with the statement of decision on june.defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.
issues on appeal 
on appeal,defendant makes the following arguments as a matter of law,he can only be held liable for the alleged securities law violations if he was in privity with the investors,and the undisputed evidence is that he was not the pias were exempt from the qualification requirement because undisputed evidence establishes that a preexisting business or personal relationship existed between defendant or cole and each investor he can not be liable as a principal in ladycare because ladycare did not exist,and,to the extent that it did,he was not a control person in ladycare there can be no civil liability on a theory of substantial assistance the undisputed evidence establishes that defendant himself made no fraudulent representations or material omissions to investors,nor was he aware of the falsity of any of his representations and restitution and the civil penalties were improperly calculated.we reject defendant first two contentions this conclusion mandates affirmance of the trial court judgment in most respects.however,we conclude that defendant is not directly responsible with respect to one of the investors,requiring remand for the trial court to determine whether he is indirectly liable.we also conclude that restitution was improperly calculated.
