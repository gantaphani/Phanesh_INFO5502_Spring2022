factual background 
backdated stock options 
brocade develops and sells data switches for networks.it became a publicly traded company in.reyes was hired in,and during his tenure served as ceo and chairman of the company board of directors board.brocade offered stock options to its newly hired employees,and its employees generally could also earn stock options through annual incentive programs.these options gave employees the right to purchase brocade stock at a fixed exercise strike price on or after a specific vesting date.a stock option is if the strike price is below the stock current market value.backdating stock options means that an option grant date and strike price are recorded retroactively.during the relevant time period,backdating of brocade stock options was not illegal as long as the benefit to brocade employees was recorded on the company financial records as a compensation expense to brocade.see reyes,at.this accounting treatment was required by the accounting principles board opinion apb it is undisputed that the stock options relevant to this appeal were backdated,and were not properly entered in the company books,as then required by apb.
reyes approved grants of stock options to brocade employees from through.company policies permitted reyes as a sort of committee to approve grants of stock options to non corporate officer employees.however,a committee of outside directors,who comprised the compensation committee,was required to approve the grant of stock options to company officers and the full board of directors was required to approve the grant of stock options to directors.committee minutes or unanimous written consents were used to document the number of options granted to specific employees as of a particular date.
procedural history 
in,brocade board of directors began investigating some of the company accounting practices with respect to the granting of stock options to new employees.in early,brocade changed some of its accounting practices,and announced that reyes had resigned as ceo and chairman.concerned,the sec and department of justice undertook a joint investigation into brocade option accounting,which led to the sec filing civil complaints against reyes and several others involved in the granting of stock options and accounting practices at brocade.
on august,the government charged reyes with committing criminal securities fraud,mail fraud,falsifying corporate books and records,and violating related statutes and regulations.in august,reyes was found liable on all counts except the mail fraud charge,which was dismissed before trial.on appeal,we vacated reyes conviction and remanded for a new trial after finding prosecutorial misconduct.reyes,at.specifically,we held that the prosecution knew that several employees of brocade finance department had given statements to the federal bureau of investigation acknowledging that the finance department knew about reyes and the company stock option backdating practices,but that during closing argument,the prosecution knowingly and falsely claimed that the finance department did not know about the stock option backdating.id.at.we held that this deception was material because it went to reyes defense that he relied on others.id.at.
after a second jury trial in february,reyes was acquitted on a conspiracy charge but convicted on all other counts,including securities fraud and making false filings with the securities and exchange commission sec in violation of b and,and b falsifying corporate books and records in violation of b a and,and and making false statements to auditors in violation of and.reyes was sentenced to months imprisonment,two years of supervised release,and was fined.reyes timely appeals.

discussion 
prosecutorial misconduct 
reyes claims that the government asserted a new,false theory at his second trial specifically,that reyes grant ed options to himself to pad his own pocket.reyes argues it was prosecutorial misconduct to focus on this theory when,as the prosecution knew,reyes could not grant himself options because the compensation committee had to approve all options granted to him.in particular,reyes objects to testimony and exhibits highlighted at trial by the government where reyes name was listed next to other employees to whom he granted options.
reyes concedes that he did not object at trial to the prosecutor allegedly improper conduct of introducing evidence that reyes granted himself stock options.accordingly,we review this aspect of reyes claim of prosecutorial misconduct for plain error.geston,at.
we review reyes claims of prosecutorial misconduct in the light of clearly established legal principles.the prosecutor job is just to win,but to win fairly,staying well within the rules.united states kojayan,cir.i t is improper for the government to present to the jury statements or inferences it knows to be false or has very strong reason to doubt.reyes,at.
it is certainly within the bounds of fair advocacy for a prosecutor,like any lawyer,to ask the jury to draw inferences from the evidence that the prosecutor believes in good faith might be true.but it is decidedly improper for the government to propound inferences that it knows to be false,or has very strong reason to doubt,particularly when it refuses to acknowledge the error afterwards to either the trial court or this court and instead offers explanations of its actions.
blueford,at.faithful adherence to these principles is particularly important because a prosecutor opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the government and making false or misleading assertions may induce the jury to trust the government judgment rather than its own view of the evidence.reyes,at quoting united states young.
viewed in the light of these authorities,reyes fails to establish that there was prosecutorial misconduct at his second trial regarding this aspect of his claim.what the government argued at the second trial was that reyes motivation for engaging in a fraudulent scheme,in part,was to personally profit.to substantiate its theory,the government introduced evidence showing the significant number of stock options reyes received thirteen million,the value of those options approximately million for eleven million options,that he made almost million from exercising some of his backdated options and that reyes received almost six times the amount of options granted to any other officer or employee of the company.
the government also presented evidence that reyes was involved in the process of granting stock options to himself because he signed lists of grant options with his name on them.for example,reyes several times signed lists of stock option grants,which included his own name along with those of employees.by signing his name to the lists,reyes was also able to influence the date of his grants to match those of certain employees.in one instance,reyes received almost million in options for an april,stock price,the same date as the date applicable to the stock grants he made to certain employees,even though he did not obtain the compensation committee final approval for,or ratification of,the grant until may.presenting this evidence did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct because the government was not pursuing an invalid theory of the case,but rather was showing reyes involvement in the process of granting backdated stock options.moreover,the government clarified any confusion that might have flowed from the referenced setting by proffering testimony from its own expert that technically,in accordance with brocade own internal rules,the compensation committee was required to approve stock options granted to reyes.
in short,the evidence the government presented was not false reyes did sign off on the lists showing grants of backdated stock options to himself and to certain employees,and the government did not impermissibly ask the jury to draw false inferences from the evidence presented at trial about reyes role in the process of granting backdated stock options to himself because the prosecution acknowledged that ultimately the approval of the compensation committee was required,even if that approval was simply pro forma.reyes,at.in this way,the government sought to show that reyes knowingly benefitted from the scheme by approving the dates and lists,some of which included his name as a backdated stock option recipient.without evidence of the government relying on known false or misleading statements,reyes allegations of this type of prosecutorial misconduct do not rise to the level of improper conduct that so affected the jury ability to consider the totality of the evidence fairly that it tainted the verdict and deprived reyes of a fair trial.united states weatherspoon,cir quoting united states smith,cir.
reyes also asserts that the government introduction of evidence that between and reyes received eleven million backdated options out of a total of thirteen million,worth approximately million,and that he exercised of his backdated options in september,for a gain of approximately million collectively,the option gains evidence,was irrelevant,unduly prejudiced the jury,and constituted prosecutorial misconduct.we disagree.
reyes does not explain how the admission of such allegedly irrelevant or unfairly prejudicial evidence constitutes prosecutorial misconduct,and we fail to see independently how it does.see,see also,greenwood.faa,cir we will not manufacture arguments for a party.the option gains evidence was based on facts and testimony introduced at trial and the inferences that flowed therefrom were linked to reyes motives.see reyes,at.moreover,because we conclude below that the options gains evidence was properly admitted,reyes can not rely on the admission of that evidence to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct.see united states hinton,cir.
tellingly,reyes also did not object to the introduction of the options gains evidence on prosecutorial misconduct grounds he simply raised an evidentiary objection to its admission.evidentiary rulings will be reversed for abuse of discretion only if such nonconstitutional error more likely than not affected the verdict.united states tran,cir citation omitted.the district court permitted the introduction of the options gains evidence because it related to motive,knowledge,and intent,and because it demonstrated that reyes made money in the backdating scheme.on the other hand,the district court showed sensitivity to undue prejudice concerns when it forbade the introduction of evidence that reyes made million from the sale of brocade stock,reasoning that such evidence was unduly prejudicial,whereupon the parties agreed that the jury would be told only that reyes sold a significant amount of brocade stock between and.
the government was not permitted to introduce evidence simply to show that reyes was wealthy.see,united states mitchell,cir a rich man greed is as much a motive to steal as a poor man poverty.proof of either,without more,is likely to amount to a great deal of unfair prejudice with little probative value.however,the government was allowed to introduce evidence about reyes motivation for his involvement in the backdating scheme,his scienter,even if such evidence is generally not sufficient,standing alone,to prove intent to defraud.tellabs,makor issues rights,while it is true that motive can be a relevant consideration,and personal financial gain may weigh heavily in favor of a scienter inference,we agree that the absence of a motive allegation is not fatal.livid holdings salomon smith barney,cir mere motive to commit fraud is insufficient to adequately plead scienter united states quattrone,cir permitting evidence of executive compensation where the introduction of the evidence was for the limited purpose of demonstrating motive and not simply wealth.
consistent with these authorities,the district court permitted the introduction of relevant and not unfairly prejudicial evidence related to reyes motive.reyes gains from backdated options permitted the jury to draw a reasonable inference that he knew what he was doing,and how the scheme operated to his benefit.reyes also fails to demonstrate that the government sought a verdict from the jury based on reyes wealth,instead of with respect to his conduct related to backdated stock options.the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of the relevant crimes,including specific willfulness and intent on reyes part to defraud,a heightened standard from mere motive.there was also significant evidence in the record that reyes knowingly participated in a scheme that he recognized was illegal.
the jury was also presented with evidence by both parties showing the amount of gain actually made by reyes,approximately million,and that he did not exercise or receive the full potential gain of million that could have been realized on his backdated options.under these circumstances,we conclude the options gains evidence constituted probative evidence of reyes motive,knowledge,and intent to participate in the backdating scheme,and its admission into evidence fell far short of meeting the level required to find unfair prejudice.see united states mende,cir under the terms of the rule,the danger of prejudice must not merely outweigh the probative value of the evidence,but substantially outweigh it.united states patterson,cir stating that rule is an extraordinary remedy to be used sparingly.
reyes further argues that the government committed prosecutorial misconduct in its questioning of two witnesses.specifically,reyes contends that through the testimony of stephen beyer,a former employee in brocade human resources department,the government furthered the false impression that brocade process was secretive and unusual.reyes similarly objects to the introduction of the testimony of carol bowie,a consultant with iss governance services,who discussed brocade governance and compensation practices.
reyes fails to show how the introduction of the beyer or bowie evidence constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.reyes does not demonstrate that beyer gave any false testimony related to his experience with accounting practices at kla tencor,and then brocade.beyer testified on direct examination that he was instructed not to use email at brocade to discuss backdating stock options,in order to avoid an audit trail for an incorrect practice.defense counsel then beyer about his work at kla tencor,and that company practice of backdating stock options.defense counsel then introduced evidence of emails sent to beyer at kla tencor showing a list of backdated stock options to undermine beyer credibility and to show that backdating was a common practice.on redirect,the government sought to distinguish kla tencor process of pricing stocks with the backdating process at brocade.
approximately a week after beyer testimony,defense counsel raised an objection to his testimony on prosecutorial misconduct grounds.according to reyes,the government effort to distinguish the two practices was prosecutorial misconduct,because the government surely knew that backdating was occurring at kla tencor.the district court denied the objection on the ground that the witness did not give false testimony because the questions posed on redirect were related to beyer own knowledge of the practices at kla tencor 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was no prosecutorial misconduct based on the government questioning of beyer on redirect.beyer direct testimony dealt with his concerns about brocade stock option practices,when compared with his experiences at kla tencor.the defense sought to impeach beyer on the grounds that he was not a credible witness and that he had lied about his experience at kla tencor,in order to show that he did not actually have concerns about brocade practices.on redirect,the government asked questions that were specifically related to beyer personal knowledge about kla tencor practices,and did not seek an inference that,regardless of any knowledge beyer may have had,the kla tencor never backdated its stock options.because there is no evidence that beyer knowingly offered false testimony,or that the government sought to draw false inferences beyond beyer personal knowledge testimony,reyes fails to show prosecutorial misconduct.see reyes,at finding prosecutorial misconduct where the government made statements that it knew,or had very strong reasons to doubt,that such statements were accurate.
moreover,even if the district court did err in permitting beyer testimony,it was harmless.see blueford,at.three other witnesses from brocade human resources department testified that they thought the backdating practices at brocade were improper.the jury was specifically instructed that backdating was not in and of itself illegal.the jury also heard other testimony that a significant number of other companies had engaged in backdating as a routine practice.accordingly,whether the jury knew specifically about kla tencor backdating practices from beyer was unlikely to substantially affect the jury verdict.see mckoy,at.
the district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied defense counsel motion to strike carol bowie testimony.martinez rodriguez,cir.bowie testified that investors care how companies compensate employees and that granting stock options is the equivalent of granting equity in the company.she also testified about materiality,see infra,and about a report finding that brocade had a disturbing pattern of granting stock options to reyes when the stock price dropped.
reyes strongly objects to bowie arresting testimony that his compensation through the grant of stock options,most of which were not exercised increased at the same time that brocade stock prices were falling.reyes claims that this evidence is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial because it relies on biases and class prejudice.
notably,reyes does not explain how the introduction of bowie testimony constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.reyes does not demonstrate that such testimony was false,or that the government sought to draw improper inferences based on its admission.see reyes,at.as previously noted,while it would be improper to admit this evidence simply to show reyes wealth,the evidence is relevant to reyes motives for the backdating scheme,since he had a financial interest in the process of backdating options.see mitchell,at.the compensation increase figure is not so arresting as to make it unfairly prejudicial because this figure was tied to potential gain had reyes exercised all of the stock options.the record reflects that reyes did not exercise all of his stock options,and the jury was clearly informed of that fact.under these circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting bowie testimony.
reyes also maintains that the district court erred in admitting public statements in the form of two press releases and a civil pleading answer made by his first defense counsel to the effect that reyes did not engage in backdating options at brocade collectively,the prior case evidence.specifically,reyes argues that the admission of the prior case evidence was irrelevant to establishing his guilt and was unfairly prejudicial because it was introduced as evidence of his guilt 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prior case evidence.at his second trial,reyes defense strategy was to admit that he backdated stock options,but deny that he had knowledge and responsibility for misreporting the compensation expenses.to show that reyes understood that he was engaged in illegal conduct,the government introduced the testimony of an attorney who conducted an internal investigation of brocade practices,at the company request.the attorney testified that reyes told him that he never backdated stock options.defense counsel sought to discredit the attorney by questioning the attorney memory and bias.to corroborate the attorney testimony,the government introduced reyes first defense counsel press releases and his answer in the civil enforcement suit brought by the sec.for example,the press releases quoted reyes first counsel,who claimed that reyes did not backdate options.reyes answer to the sec civil complaint made similar denials.reyes objected to these admissions.
the statements were relevant because they were inconsistent with reyes position at his second trial,to the effect that he engaged in backdating,and were used to corroborate another government witness testimony that reyes told him that he did not backdate.the prior case evidence was also relevant to reyes guilty state of mind.see united states perkins,cir false exculpatory statements can be considered as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
reyes also asserts that the prosecution unduly focused on a theme of corporate responsibility whereby reyes was ultimately responsible for any misconduct because he was ceo of br
