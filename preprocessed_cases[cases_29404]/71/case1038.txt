we consider a set of issues concerning the application of the securities litigation uniform standards act of slusa,stat,codified in relevant part at amending the securities exchange act of slusa provides for the removal to federal court and then dismissal of certain securities fraud cases,while allowing others to go forward in state court.in this case,the scope of both slusa coverage and of the delaware exception is at stake,as is the delicate relationship between state and federal courts considering securities fraud questions.
more specifically,at the time this action was first filed in state court,plaintiffs rebecca proctor,rex brooks,john donovan,and robert needles collectively,proctor were minority shareholders in siliconix,siliconix.they brought suit against siliconix majority shareholder,vishay intertechnology,and other related defendants,alleging that over the course of several years vishay misappropriated siliconix assets and breached its fiduciary duties to siliconix and to the other shareholders.vishay later acquired all the outstanding minority shares in siliconix through a merger,allegedly at a price unfair to proctor and the other minority shareholders,and proctor amended her complaint to include allegations related to this merger.
proctor suit thus began as a relatively straightforward class action and derivative shareholders suit,stating claims under california law.the filing and settlement of a separate class action lawsuit against vishay in the delaware court of chancery,combined with subsequent changes to proctor own pleadings,have complicated matters substantially.reflecting these developments,the federal district court held that proctor suit was properly removed to federal court under slusa,but then held that the suit was barred by an injunction filed against the plaintiffs in the delaware court of chancery and so could not proceed.
we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.we agree with the district court that proctor suit was subject to removal under slusa and that removal was timely and procedurally proper.we affirm the district court dismissal of proctor second claim on the alternative ground that it was precluded by slusa.but we reverse the district court order granting vishay motion to dismiss and ernst young motion for summary judgment,because the district court erroneously gave effect to the delaware injunction.once proctor second claim was dismissed,the district court was required to remand the case to state court.
background 
siliconix was a publicly owned semiconductor manufacturer incorporated in delaware and headquartered in santa clara,california.vishay,a manufacturer of electronic components,became siliconix majority shareholder in,when vishay acquired control over of siliconix shares.the remaining of siliconix shares were held by approximately minority shareholders,including rebecca proctor and the other named plaintiffs in this action.
vishay made a tender offer to the minority shareholders in,but the offer was not supported by a majority of the minority shareholders.according to the plaintiffs second amended complaint,after the failure of its first tender offer,vishay had strong incentives to drain assets from siliconix,because so doing would both enrich vishay and keep the price of the remaining of siliconix stock as low as possible,thus reducing the cost of any future acquisition of the remaining siliconix shares by vishay.the complaint goes on to allege that vishay did in fact take various actions that appropriated or depleted siliconix assets while enhancing vishay financial position.
concerned about vishay actions as siliconix majority shareholder,the plaintiffs filed a complaint in california superior court on august,naming vishay,its subsidiaries,and its chief executive officer felix zandman as defendants collectively,vishay.plaintiffs pleaded two claims for relief a derivative shareholder claim on siliconix behalf for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets,and a class action claim on behalf of two classes of minority shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty.the complaint also named vishay auditor,ernst young,llp,as a defendant,alleging that after ernst young became siliconix auditor at vishay initiative,the auditing firm conspired to hide vishay misappropriations from the minority shareholders and the sec.
after filing and service,proceedings in the california superior court were stalled for over two years while the plaintiffs sought to obtain corrective action via communications with siliconix counsel,officers and directors,and formal requests under the federal securities acts and regulations to siliconix.these attempts failed.in january,the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint containing more detailed factual allegations and exhibits regarding vishay alleged unlawful actions.
in march,vishay announced a plan to make a tender offer of shares of vishay common stock for each share of siliconix stock,an offer later increased to vishay shares per siliconix share.some of the minority shareholders believed that the tender offer price was unfairly low.under delaware law,however,if vishay was able to obtain through such a tender offer enough shares of siliconix stock to hold more than in all,vishay could execute a or short form merger,forcing the sale of any remaining shares to vishay.see.
shortly after the tender offer announcement,several shareholder suits against vishay,later consolidated,were filed in the delaware court of chancery,all alleging that the tender offer was unfair and that vishay had breached its fiduciary duties to the minority shareholders.see in re siliconix.shareholders.ch.filed.the class representatives in the delaware litigation soon reached an agreement in principle with vishay to settle the class action in return for additional disclosures and an increase in the tender offer share price from shares of vishay stock per siliconix share to.the parties executed a memorandum of understanding with vishay late in april,and the final settlement agreement was filed with the delaware court of chancery in september.the stipulation of settlement filed with the chancery court specified that the delaware class action should be dismissed with prejudice and provided for the release of liability the release as to a broad swath of other existing and potential claims 
any known or unknown claims that have been,could have been,or in the future can or might be asserted in any court by on or behalf of any member of the class,whether individual,class,derivative,representative,legal,equitable,or any other type or in any other capacity against defendants or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries and each and all of their respective past,present or future officers,directors,stockholders,principals employees,attorneys,financial or investment advisors,insurers,consultants,accountants advisors or agents,heirs,predecessors,successors and assigns collectively,the released persons which have arisen,arise now or hereafter may arise out of or relate in any manner to the allegations,facts,events,transactions,acts,occurrences,statements,representations,omissions or any other matter whatsoever set forth in or otherwise related,directly or indirectly to i the allegations in the complaints in the action,ii the tender offer including all amendments and supplements iii the merger,or iv the fiduciary obligations or disclosure duties of any of the released persons in connection with the tender offer of merger,but excluding any claims to enforce the settlement or any claims by siliconix stockholders for appraisal pursuant to.c ode,are hereby released,discharged and settled 
meanwhile,vishay tender offer closed in may after attracting enough sales of shares to allow the merger,with the result that each remaining siliconix share was converted into the right to receive vishay shares.
the delaware court issued an order and final judgment in october.the order certified a class under court of chancery rules b and b as consisting of all record and beneficial owners of the common stock of siliconix during the period beginning on and including the close of business on march,through and including may,the date of the consummation of the merger,including any and all of their respective successors in interest,predecessors,and representatives the same order also approved the settlement,finding that the notice of the pendency of the class action and proposed settlement had been adequate and sufficient and that the terms of the settlement were fair,reasonable,and adequate and in the best interests of the class.finally,the order adopted the settlement release of liability stipulation language,quoted above,verbatim.
although members of the delaware class,none of the named plaintiffs in the california action participated in the delaware proceedings or appealed the delaware judgment.instead,the present plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in their california state court action.in addition to the original two causes of action,the second amended complaint stated a third,claim for.this cause of action alleged that the notice of appraisal rights in the delaware litigation was inadequate and that the terms of the settlement were unfair.vishay and ernst young filed demurrers to the second amended complaint in early,arguing,among other points,that the delaware judgment precluded the plaintiffs suit.although the california court rejected most of the demurrers it sustained ernst young demurrer as to the first and second causes of action the derivative shareholder claim and the class action claim for breach of fiduciary duty because of inadequate factual pleadings.the plaintiffs subsequently filed an amendment to their second amended complaint,adding specific facts relevant to ernst young alleged false statements and concealment.
meanwhile,vishay sought an injunction against the california litigation from the delaware court of chancery,which was granted.the delaware court injunction,dated june,ordered that plaintiffs,their successors and assigns,agents,attorneys,and all persons in active concert or participation with any of them,including but not limited to all members of the class certified in the delaware court october,order and final judgment,are permanently enjoined from prosecuting the action pending in the superior court of california,county of santa clara,proctor vishay intertechnology,case.
vishay presented the delaware injunction to the california court at a case management conference,stating its intention to file a motion to dismiss if the plaintiffs continued to litigate their case in spite of the injunction.ernst young took the position that the delaware injunction precluded the plaintiffs claims against it as well,even though it was not a named party in the delaware action.the california judge instructed plaintiffs to get their papers together and decide whether to challenge the injunction in the delaware court,and ordered the defendants to file their answers or demurrers to the plaintiffs most recent filing on schedule the judge further noted i will tell you this.i think it is rather extraordinary for a court in one state to tell the parties in litigation in this state how the court ought to rul e on the issue of whether or not settlement in that other state affects this litigation.
ernst young reaction to these developments was to file a notice of removal of the action to federal district court pursuant to slusa.slusa places limits on plaintiffs ability to litigate covered class action s,which it defines as private,suits involving a covered security that is,a nationally traded security such as siliconix was at the time in which damages are sought on behalf of more than persons or prospective class members.f b i i,e.see generally madden cowen,cir explaining the purpose and impact of slusa.if such a covered class action contains any allegation of a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact or the use of any manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,f,it is removable to federal court and,once removed,must be dismissed,id.f.see generally madden,at discussing slusa removal and preclusion provisions.
congress purpose in enacting slusa was to channel securities fraud litigation away from class actions and into the federal courts under the private securities litigation reform act of,stat.codified at and,which requir es plaintiffs who bring private securities fraud actions in federal court to surmount a number of procedural hurdles not applicable under state law.madden,at.there are,however,statutory exceptions to slusa preclusion,one of which is known as the delaware,which allow certain actions otherwise coming within slusa to go forward.see f a see also madden,at infra,part a.the in re siliconix litigation proceeded in the delaware chancery court under the delaware.the district court here held that proctor action,in contrast,does not fall within the delaware.
having so decided,the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand to state court and accepted jurisdiction over the case,finding that removal was proper under,a,and b.quoting metropolitan life insurance company taylor,d,it noted that slusa completely preempts covered state law claims,thereby creating a basis for removal jurisdiction by recharacterizing the state law claim as a federal claim for purposes of the well pleaded complaint rule.
the district court then dismissed the action as to ernst young under.b and granted summary judgment as to vishay under.the court justified both rulings as compelled by the delaware injunction and the principle of comity 
while plaintiffs correctly state the general rule that a state court may not enjoin proceedings in a federal court,the injunction at issue here encompasses,among other claims,all the claims asserted by the representative plaintiffs in proctor vishay intertechnology,case,and plaintiffs settled and released,among other claims,all the claims asserted in that action the fact that the case in question has been removed to this court because some of the claims asserted are preempted by slusa does not entitle plaintiffs to ignore the injunction any more than they were entitled to do so while the matter was pending before the california superior court.as a matter of comity,this court will not entertain arguments regarding the jurisdiction of the delaware chancery court unless and until plaintiffs first have sought relief from the injunction in delaware.accordingly,the instant action will be dismissed.in order to permit plaintiffs to initiate appropriate proceedings in delaware,the dismissal shall be effective ninety days after the date of this order.
internal citation omitted.the plaintiffs did not initiate proceedings in delaware court,and the district court dismissal became effective.

a.the remand motion 
proctor first contends that the district court erred in denying the motion to remand the case to state court at the outset.for the reasons below,we affirm the district court.
removability 
proctor now concedes that this lawsuit was,but challenges the district court denial of her remand motion solely on the ground that there were procedural defects in the defendants removal notice.parties can not waive a court lack of subject matter jurisdiction.stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir emphasis omitted.regardless of the parties concessions,therefore,we must satisfy ourselves that this lawsuit was in fact removable under slusa.
we begin by clarifying the jurisdictional basis of cases.the district court reasoned that slusa completely preempted the state law causes of action,thereby approving of ernst young removal on the basis of and.a case arises under federal law within the meaning of if a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d quoting franchise tax bd.of cal.constr.laborers vacation trust for,d brackets omitted.one exception to the statutory complaint rule is when congress so completely s a particular area that any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.metro.life ins,at.see also avco aero lodge,int l ass of machinists,d.
this court had suggested that slusa completely preempts state law claims and therefore falls under the complete preemption exception to the complaint rule of.see,falkowski imation,cir recognizing that slusa provides for removal but explaining the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction as slusa complete preemption of state claims patenaude equitable life assurance soc y of,cir noting that because of the complaint rule,a federal defense will not ordinarily create subject matter jurisdiction,and that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over patenaude complaint if,and only if,slusa completely preempted the state law claims assert ed.
after these cases were decided,however,the supreme court made clear in kircher putnam funds trust,d,that slusa does not itself displace state law with federal law but makes some claims nonactionable through the class action device in federal as well as state court.in other words,slusa does not provide a federal rule of decision in lieu of a state one,but instead provides a federal defense precluding certain state law actions from going forward.thus,what we termed complete preemption in cases by which we are no longer bound on this issue given the supreme court more recent pronouncement,see miller gammie,cir en banc,is actually a federal preclusion defense,and would not fall under the complete preemption exception to complaint rule 
we need not consider whether applies on some basis other than complete preemption,as slusa itself provides a basis for federal jurisdiction.slusa creates a federal defense to certain covered class actions,prohibiting those actions from going forward in state or federal court.f.it separately provides for removal jurisdiction over those actions.id.f.congressional provision of removal jurisdiction apart from is entirely permissible,so long as the jurisdiction does not exceed the bounds of article iii and congress has in fact so provided by statute.see verlinden cent.bank of nigeria,d.slusa meets both requirements.
slusa removal provision does not exceed the bounds of article iii federal question jurisdiction,which is broader than arising under jurisdiction.see id.at.while the act removal provision,f alone is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction within constitutional bounds,see verlinden,at,the separate provision for a preclusion defense requiring the dismissal of covered class actions,id.f creates a federal question hook on which removal can hang,see verlinden,at.see also mesa california,d reaffirming,in a case involving a statutory right of removal to federal court by federal officers,that an assertion of a federal defense in a removal petition is sufficient for article iii purposes to support jurisdiction.as slusa removal provision makes clear,congress intended to permit federal court adjudication of such claims.section f is therefore constitutionally sufficient to support removal jurisdiction,and no recourse to another jurisdictional as necessary.
having determined that slusa alone could properly confer jurisdiction over this case if a claim is covered by slusa,we next analyze the claims.as currently pleaded,the complaint contains three claims a derivative claim on siliconix behalf for breach of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets a class action claim on behalf of the putative class of minority shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty and a class action claim on behalf of the putative class of minority shareholders for under delaware code.the plaintiffs initially brought all three claims against all the defendants but later withdrew claim with regard to ernst young.
to be removable under slusa,a complaint must contain at least one precluded claim.see f providing for the removal of a ny covered class action brought in any state court involving a covered security falkowski,at allowing the removal of an entire case where some but not all of the plaintiff claims were precluded by slusa.on the basis of this removal,the district court could have,at least temporarily,exercised jurisdiction over any claims as well,as slusa provides for the removal of a ny covered class action,f,not just individual claims 
proctor lawsuit contains one precluded claim claim,the class action claim for breach of fiduciary duty.this claim meets all four of slusa threshold requirements first,it is brought in the context of a covered class action,in that the plaintiffs seek a damages remedy on behalf of more than persons or prospective class members.f b i i.second,it is based upon the statutory or common law of a state,california.id.f.third,the siliconix minority shares at issue are covered securit ies,id.f e,because they were nationally traded and listed on a national securities exchange,id.b,at the time during which it is alleged that the misrepresentation,omission,or manipulative or deceptive conduct occurred,id.f e.fourth,and finally,the claim rests on allegations of misrepresentation s or omission s of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security,id.f a the allegation that ernst young made false or intentionally incomplete and misleading statements in several documents directed at shareholders and at shareholders meetings concerning vishay actions with regard to and impact on siliconix so that vishay could acquire the stock of siliconix minority shareholders below the stock true value.
as to this fourth requirement,we note that ernst young alleged misrepresentations and omissions were made before the announcement of the tender offer and merger.nevertheless,based on the plaintiffs allegations alone these misrepresentations and omissions were made specifically for the purpose of masking vishay looting of siliconix and its deceptive inflation of the relative value of vishay own stock,thereby inducing the minority shareholders to sell their siliconix stock to vishay at a disadvantageous exchange rate once a tender offer was made.these allegations establish a sufficiently close connection between the misrepresentations and the sale of siliconix stock to satisfy slusa in connection with requirement.see falkowski,at holding that t he claim that defendant concealed the impending accounting sufficiently alleges fraud in connection with a contract to sell imation shares because it involves a misrepresentation about the value of the options see also instituto de prevision militar merrill lynch,cir prof l mgmt,at 
moreover,these allegations are sufficiently pleaded to invoke slusa preclusion of claim against ernst young and vishay while plaintiffs allege only that ernst young directly made misrepresentations and omissions,some of the alleged misrepresentations are in documents issued on behalf of vishay and the amendment to the second amended complaint clearly asserts that ernst young misrepresentations were among the overt acts,or omissions,in which ernst young engaged in furtherance of its conspiracy with,and in aiding and abetting,vishay and the other defendants.thus,although claim against vishay does not state that vishay itself made misrepresentations or omissions,the plaintiffs pleadings implicate vishay as responsible for ernst young acts and so warrant dismissal of this claim against all defendants.
proctor claims and,in contrast,do not come within slusa preclusive scope.claim,a shareholder derivative action alleging breach of a fiduciary duty,is not a class claim and so does not satisfy the first requirement for slusa preclusion.see f b i i.claim,alleging inadequacy of the notice given the minority shareholders before the merger,was not affected by proctor amendment to the sac,which expressly applied only to claims and,and so,lacking any reference to material omissions and misrepresentation,does not satisfy the fourth requirement for preclusion.f a.as already noted,however,only one claim in a complaint needs to be precluded under slusa to make removal to federal court of the entire action proper.
we therefore hold that the district court correctly assumed removal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs lawsuit under slusa,and now turn to the other grounds upon which proctor challenges denial of the motion to remand the case.
timeliness 
under b,a defendant sued in state court must file a notice of removal within thirty days after receipt by the defendant of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.ernst young notice of removal was filed on june.proctor suggests that the clock for removal began to run when the first or second amended complaint was served,making ernst young removal notice untimely.not so.
again,the sole basis for federal jurisdiction in this case is slusa.it was not ascertainable from either the first or the second amended complaint that the case came within slusa preclusive scope.
the first amended complaint contains allegations of looting,not allegations of misrepresentations made in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.indeed,the tender offer and merger did not happen until after the first amended complaint was filed,so the allegations therein could not,at the time of service,have put the defendants on notice of any alleged misrepresentations made in connection with the purchase or sale of siliconix stock.f a.
nor would the second amended complaint have supported removal under slusa.the only allegation in that complaint that could be construed as an allegation of material misrepresentation is the assertion that in,ernst young obviously knew that siliconix was guaranteeing vishay line of credit and that ernst young allegiance to vishay affected its good judgment.but the second amended complaint does not specifically allege that ernst young omitted or represented any material information in connection with the tender offer and merger,and so,without amendment,that complaint would not have supported removal under slusa.in fact,as the district court noted,the state court sustained ernst young demurrer to the second amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs had set forth insufficient facts to link ernst young to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
in short,the basis for federal removal under slusa was not ascertainable on the face of either the first or second amended complaint.see harris bankers life cas,cir.that the defendants might have guessed that the plaintiffs would amend their pleadings to put forward sufficient facts to support removal is not sufficient to start the clock.w e do charge defendants with notice of removability until they received a paper that gives them enough information to remove.durham lockheed martin,cir.
the amendment to the second amended complaint,filed and served on the defendants on may,did provide that information.the amendment contained specific allegations that ernst young concealed or made false or intentionally incomplete and misleading statements in various reports and filings,and at shareholders meetings,concerning vishay misappropriation of siliconix software systems and sales subsidiaries,vishay impact on siliconix indebtedness and borrowing capabilities,and vishay other actions affecting siliconix financial position,so that vishay could acquire the stock of siliconix minority shareholders below the stock true value.these allegations of false statements or omissions in connection with the purchase or sale of siliconix stock met the slusa requirements for federal jurisdiction.following the rule laid out in harris,the for purposes of b clock was the date of service of the amendment to the second amended complaint.see harris,at.ernst young removal notice was filed within thirty days of that date.the district court holding that the removal notice was timely was therefore correct.
plaintiffs next argue that ernst young notice of removal was procedurally improper because ernst young vishay did not provide timely written notice of its joinder.in a case involving multiple defendants,a ll defendants must join in a removal petition.hewitt city of stanton,cir.ernst young notice of removal represented that a ll defendants consent to the removal of this action emphasis added,but vishay itself did not submit a written notice stating its joinder until september,well outside the window for removal.
the circuits are divided as to what form a codefendant joinder in removal must take.we have not yet decided the matter.the sixth circuit requires only that at least one attorney of record sign the notice and certify that the remaining defendants consent to removal it does not insist that each defendant submit written notice of such consent.see harper autoalliance int l,cir.in contrast,the fifth,seventh,and eighth circuits have adopted the more demanding requirement that each must submit a timely,written notice of consent to joinder.see getty oil ins.of,cir roe,cir,abrogated on other grounds by murphy,michetti pipe stringing,d pritchett cottrell,cir.
we adopt the sixth circuit position as fully sufficient to implement the unanimous joinder rule.the rule of unanimity,announced by the supreme court in chicago,rock island,pacific railway martin,as an interpretation of a predecessor removal statute,merely says that all the defendants must join in the application for removal.see also lapides bd.of regents of.of,d citing chicago only for the proposition that removal requires the consent of all defendants.chicago does not specify how defendants must join in removal.nor does any federal rule or statute specifically prescribe a particular manner in which codefendants joinder must be expressed.in the absence of any rule governing joinder in removal,we turn to the general principles that govern procedures for removal and for attorney representations to district courts generally.under a,a defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action must file a notice of removal signed pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule,in turn,provides that e very pleading,written motion,and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record.a,and that b y presenting to the court a pleading,written motion,or other by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating attorney certifies that the factual contentions therein have evidentiary support id.b.
applying these general principles,we conclude that the filing of a notice of removal can be effective without individual consent documents on behalf of each defendant.one defendant timely removal notice containing an averment of the other defendants consent and signed by an attorney of record is sufficient.ernst young submitted such an averment under threat of sanctions pursuant to rule the other were notified of the removal notice and had an opportunity to object to it.these two availability of sanctions and of concerns that one defendant might falsely state the other defendants consent,or that one defendant might game the system by silently allowing another to remove and,if the federal forum proves disadvantageous,belatedly object that he had not consented.
we emphasize that chicago requirement that all codefendants join in requesting removal remains binding.like the sixth circuit,however,we interpret that requirement as met if,as here,one defendant avers that all defendants consent to removal.see harper,at.
as the removal notice was timely and procedurally proper,the district court properly denied proctor motion to remand.
b.the merits 
having established that this case is properly in federal court,we now address the more precisely,whether this case should have been dismissed in its entirety,as it was,because of the delaware injunction or for another reason.we affirm the district court dismissal of proctor claim,on which slusa removal was predicated,as it should have been dismissed as precluded by slusa.we reverse the district court dismissal of claims and once proctor second claim was dismissed,the district court was required by slusa to remand the remaining claims to state court.the delaware injunction did not bind the district court.
preclusion under slusa 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims on the basis of comity.on appeal,however,we may affirm the district court holding on any ground raised below and fairly supported by the record.see washington confed.bands tribes of yakima indian nation,d stating that a prevailing party is free to defend its judgment on any ground properly raised below whether or not that ground was relied upon,rejected,or even considered by the district court atel fin.quaker coal,cir per curiam providing that this court may affirm on any ground fairly supported by the record.we therefore begin by considering which of proctor claims,if any,are subject to dismissal by virtue of slusa.
as discussed above,one of proctor,the class action claim for breach of fiduciary under slusa as a precluded class action claim alleging misrepresentation s or omission s of material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.f a.although the district court did not rely on slusa to dismiss this claim,we do so now.slusa permits nothing less,because n o covered class action that alleges a misrepresentation of material fact in connection with the sale of a covered security based upon the law of any state may be maintained in federal court.id.f.
that leaves claim,the derivative claim on siliconix behalf for breach of fiduciary duty against vishay and ernst young,and claim,for,against vishay only.as explained,these claims were not themselves subject to removal and preclusion under slusa,but were removed along with claim and came within the federal court jurisdiction authorized by slusa.
slusa unquestionably requires the dismissal of the precluded claim,but does it require the dismissal of the other,claims as well our decision in falkowski assumed that it does not but unstated assumptions on issues are not precedential holdings binding future decisions,sakamoto duty free shoppers,cir,and our subsequent decision in saxton treated the issue as an unsettled one.see saxton,at.other courts of appeals have directly considered the question and held that dismissal of the entire complaint is not required.see in re lord abbett mut.funds fee,cir considering complaint with state law claims and federal claims dabit merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir dabit i,rev on other grounds by,d dabit ii considering complaint with and precluded state law claims today we,too,clarify that slusa does not require the dismissal of claims along with precluded claims.
looking first to the statutory language,we find no indication that the dismissal of the entire action is required.true,slusa preclusion provision speaks of actions and lawsuits,not of individual claims.see f no covered class action may be maintained id.f b defining covered class action as any single lawsuit or group of lawsuits.but congress use of the term action in slusa is not alone determinative as to whether the entire case must be dismissed based on the presence of one precluded claim.the supreme court made this much clear in the context of the prison litigation reform act a,which provides that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.see jones bock,d.in doing so,it stated that 
as a general matter,if a complaint contains both good and bad claims,the court proceeds with the good and leaves the bad.only the bad claims are dismissed the complaint as a whole is not.if congress meant to depart from this norm,we would expect some indication of that,and we find none.
id.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted see also in re lord abbett,at applying this plra example in the context of slusa lasala ubs,ag,d,stating that jones language about norms for interpreting statutory language concerning dismissal of a complaint reinforce d the district court interpretation of slusa that claims must be considered separately internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,once a precluded slusa claim is dismissed,the complaint no longer includes a claim that rests on an allegation of misrepresentation.requiring the federal court to refrain from dismissing the claims does not offend slusa command that n o covered class action may be maintained in any state or federal court if it alleges a misrepresentation or omission of a material fact f emphasis added.by using the word maintained rather than filed,the language focuses on the content of the action as it goes forward,not as it began,and so does not require that a federal court dismiss an entire action where only some claims are precluded by slusa.dismissal of precluded claims while allowing the remainder of the case to remain pending thus fully comports with the statutory language.
moreover,the purposes of slusa would not be served by the dismissal of entire actions.as the house report made clear,among slusa purposes are to prevent plaintiffs from circumvent ing the private securities litigation reform act provisions by filing frivolous and speculative lawsuits in state court,where essentially none of the reform act procedural or substantive protections against abusive suits are available and to prevent a single state from impos ing the risks and costs of its peculiar litigation system on all national issuers,at.internal quotation omitted.like the third circuit,w e struggle to see how permitting claims that do not specifically trigger the slusa preclusion provision to proceed would lead to either abusive litigation or to the application of different legal standards to national securities.in re lord abbett,at.nothing in slusa text or the legislative history suggests that congress intended to place roadblocks in the way of federal claims or state law claims its only discernible intent was to preclude the use of the device to prosecute certain class action claims.see dabit ii,at.in fact,if slusa required the dismissal of all claims,precluded and,appearing in the same complaint,plaintiffs could easily circumvent the statute by dividing their claims into two separate actions,one action with the potentially precluded state law claims and one or more with the remaining claims.in re lord abbett,at.reading slusa to allow the survival of claims,in contrast,achieves congress goals without encouraging such inefficient behavior.
kircher is not to the contrary.kircher states in a footnote that if a claim is precluded,it may not be maintained,and if the claim is not precluded,the federal courts no longer have any business being involved,as there is no longer any federal question on which to moor the district court jurisdiction.at.internal citation and brackets omitted.importantly,in kircher,the district court concluded that it lacked slusa jurisdiction over the action at the outset because the plaintiffs claims did not satisfy the in connection with the purchase or sale requirement of the act preclusion provision.id.at.nothing in kircher suggests that an action over which the district court properly assumed jurisdiction when the removal notice was filed must be dismissed in its entirety,rather we next to the state court from whence it came.accord in re lord abbett,at distinguishing kircher.
we therefore join the second and third circuits in holding that slusa does not require the dismissal of all claims appearing in the same complaint as a precluded claim.
remand under slusa 
there remains the question to which we just the district court was required to remand the action to state court after dismissing claim,the claim.our case law does not directly govern this question.we assumed in falkowski,but did not directly decide,that a district court could retain jurisdiction over garden variety state law claims after a claim was dismissed.at.we subsequently stated in saxton that i t is not settled whether slusa either permits or requires the remand of particular claims in a single suit that contains some claims that are preempted,and some claims that are not.at.
we now hold that slusa requires remand once a federal court dismisses precluded claims slusa contains its own remand provision,which states that i n an
