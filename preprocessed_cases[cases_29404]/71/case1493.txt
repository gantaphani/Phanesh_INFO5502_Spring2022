in this appeal,we affirm the judgment of the court of chancery holding that a corporation could validly initiate a reverse stock split and selectively dispose of the fractional interests held by stockholders who no longer hold whole shares.the vice chancellor interpreted section of the delaware general corporation law to permit the corporation,as part of a stock split,to treat its stockholders unequally by cashing out the stockholders who own only fractional interests while opting not to dispose of fractional interests of stockholders who will end up holding whole shares of stock as well as fractional interests.in the latter instance the fractional shares would be reconverted to whole shares in an accompanying forward stock split.
we hold that neither the language of section nor the principles guiding our interpretation of statutes dictate a prohibition against the disparate treatment of stockholders,for this purpose.we also hold that the corporation may dispose of those fractional interests pursuant to section by aggregating the fractional interests and selling them on behalf of the stockholders where this method of disposition has a rational business purpose of saving needless transaction costs.
a further issue we address is whether,as an alternative method of compensation,the corporation may satisfy the fair price requirement of section by paying the stockholders an amount based on the average trading price of the corporation stock.here,the vice chancellor properly held that the trading price of stock of a corporation,the stock of which is,will provide an adequate measure of fair value for the stockholders fractional interests for purposes of a reverse stock split under section.
avaya,is a delaware corporation that designs and manages communications networks for business organizations and large agencies.the enterprise is a descendant of the industry,at avaya was established as an independent company in october of when it was spun off from lucent technologies.lucent itself is a of at because its capital structure is the product of two transactions,the outstanding stock of avaya is one of the most on the new york stock exchange.over million common stockholders own fewer than shares of avaya stock each.
although a large number of stockholders hold a small stake in the corporation,avaya incurs heavy expenses to maintain their accounts.avaya spends almost million per year to print and mail proxy statements and annual reports to each stockholder as well as to pay transfer agents and other miscellaneous fees.stockholders who own their stock in street names cost avaya an additional million in similar administrative fees.
since the cost of maintaining a stockholder account is the same regardless of the number of shares held,avaya could reduce its administrative burden,and thereby save money for its stockholders,by decreasing its stockholder base.in february of,at the corporation annual meeting,the avaya board of directors presented the stockholders with a transaction designed to accomplish this result.the avaya board asked the stockholders to grant the directors authorization to engage in one of three alternative transactions 
a reverse stock split followed immediately by a forward stock split of the common stock 
a reverse stock split followed immediately by a forward stock split of the common stock 
a reverse stock split followed immediately by a forward stock split of the common stock.
we refer in this opinion to all three of these alternative transactions as the proposed transaction or the split.regardless of the particular ratio the board chooses,at some future date the reverse split will occur at,followed by a forward split one minute later.once selected,the effective date of the split will be posted on avaya website.
the transaction will cash out stockholders who own stock below the minimum number ultimately selected by the directors for the split pursuant to those three alternative options.stockholders who do not hold the minimum number of shares necessary to survive the initial reverse split will be cashed out and receive payment for their resulting fractional interests the stockholders or targeted stockholders.stockholders who own a sufficient amount of stock to survive the reverse split will not have their fractional interests cashed out.once the forward split occurs,their fractional holdings will be converted back into whole shares of stock.
avaya will compensate the stockholders through one of two possible methods.avaya may combine the fractional interests and sell them as whole shares on the open market.in the alternative,the corporation will pay the stockholders the value of their fractional interests based on the trading price of the stock averaged over a period preceding the reverse split.stockholders who hold their avaya stock in street names have been advised to contact their nominees to see that they receive the same consideration as stockholders who have their interests registered in their own names 
to illustrate the proposed transaction through a hypothetical,assume stockholder a owns fifteen shares of stock and stockholder b owns shares of stock.if avaya chooses to initiate a reverse stock split,stockholder a will possess a fractional interest equivalent to a share of stock.stockholder b will hold one whole share of avaya stock and a fractional interest equivalent to a share.using the provisions of section or of the delaware general corporation law avaya would cash out stockholder a since he no longer possesses a whole share of stock.stockholder a would no longer be an avaya stockholder.stockholder b will remain a stockholder because avaya will not cash out the fractional interest held by her.stockholder b fractional interest remains attached to a whole share of stock.when avaya executes the accompanying forward stock split,stockholder b interest in one and shares will be converted into shares of stock,the same amount that she held prior to the transaction.
at the annual meeting,avaya stockholders voted to authorize the board to proceed with any one of the three alternative transactions.applebaum,a holder of shares of avaya stock,filed an action in the court of chancery to enjoin the split.under any one of the three alternatives applebaum would be cashed out because he holds less than thirty shares.
proceedings in the court of chancery 
applebaum asked the court of chancery to enjoin the proposed transaction,alleging that avaya treatment of fractional interests will not comport with the requirements set forward in title,section of the delaware code.applebaum argued that section does not permit avaya to issue fractional shares to some stockholders but not to others in the same transaction.even if avaya could issue fractional shares selectively,applebaum contended that the methods by which avaya plans to the smaller stockholders do not comply with subsections and of section.
after considering for summary judgment,the court of chancery denied applebaum request for an injunction and held that the split would comply with section and dispose of the stockholders interests in a fair and efficient manner applebaum appeals the final judgment entered for the defendants.we affirm.
issues on appeal 
applebaum claims the court of chancery erred by holding that title,section permits avaya to issue fractional shares to the surviving stockholders but not issue fractional shares to the stockholders holding that avaya can combine the fractional interests and sell them on the open market holding that avaya can instruct nominees to participate in the split even if a particular nominee holds a sufficient amount of stock on behalf of all of its beneficial holders to survive the split granting summary judgment and holding that the payment of cash for fractional interests based on a average of the trading price of avaya stock constitutes fair value under section and holding that the meaning of fair value in sections is different from section and thus failing to value the fractional shares as proportionate interests in a going concern.
section does not prevent avaya from disposing of fractional interests selectively 
applebaum questions the board authority to treat stockholders differently by disposing of the fractional interests of some stockholders but not others.applebaum contends that avaya will issue fractional shares in violation of section.according to this view of the transaction,during the one minute interval between the two stock splits the corporation will not issue fractional shares to stockholders who possess holdings below the minimum amount.those stockholders will be cashed out.stockholders who hold stock above the minimum amount,by contrast,will be issued fractional shares that will be reconverted in the forward split into the same number of whole shares owned by those stockholders before the reverse split.
applebaum argues that section prevents avaya from achieving this disparate result by providing that 
a corporation may,but shall not be required to,issue fractions of a share.if it does not issue fractions of a share,it shall arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto,pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined 
applebaum reads section to mean that avaya can employ the methods provided in section only if the corporation does not issue fractions of a share.
this court reviews de novo the court of chancery decision to grant avaya motion for summary judgment we need not reach the merits of applebaum interpretation of section because he has based his argument on the flawed assumption that avaya will issue fractional shares.since the split is an integrated transaction,avaya need not issue any fractional shares.the initial reverse split creates a combination of whole shares and fractional interests.avaya will use either section or to cash out the fractional interests of stockholders who no longer possess a whole share of stock.fractional interests that are attached to whole shares will not be disposed of.nor will they be represented by fractions of a share.fractional shares are unnecessary because the surviving fractional interests will be reconverted into whole shares in the forward split 
applebaum correctly notes that avaya stockholders are not treated equally in the proposed transaction.the disparate treatment,however,does not arise by issuing fractional shares selectively.it occurs through the selective disposition of some fractional interests but not others.the provisions of section do not forbid this disparate treatment.while principles of equity permit this court to intervene when technical compliance with a statute produces an unfair result equity and equality are not synonymous concepts in the delaware general corporation law moreover,this court should not create a safeguard against stockholder inequality that does not appear in the statute here there is no showing that applebaum was treated inequitably.from all that appears on this record,the proposed transaction was designed in good faith to accomplish a rational business transaction costs 
our jurisprudence does not prevent avaya from properly using section in a creative fashion that is designed to meet its needs as an enterprise the subsections listed in section merely require the corporation to compensate its stockholders when it chooses not to recognize their fractional interests in the form of fractional shares based upon this record,we conclude that avaya is free to recognize the fractional interests of some stockholders but not others so long as the corporation follows the procedures set forth in section.
avaya may proceed with any of its alternative plans to dispose of the fractional interests 
the balance of applebaum appeal challenges the alternative methods by which avaya proposes to dispose of the fractional interests.the court of chancery concluded that avaya could proceed under section by aggregating the fractional interests and selling them on behalf of the stockholders.the court also held that avaya could employ section,which requires payment of the fair value of the fractional interests,by paying the stockholders an amount based on the average trading price of avaya stock.we agree with the decision of the court of chancery and address separately the issues based on each subsection of the statute.
section permits avaya to sell the factional interest on behalf of the stockholders 
the stockholders have authorized avaya to compensate the stockholders by combining their fractional interests into whole shares and then selling them on the stockholders behalf.section permits avaya to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by those entitled thereto.
applebaum claims that avaya can not use section because the corporation will sell whole shares rather than fractional interests.according to this rendition of the transaction,the fractional interests held by the targeted stockholders must be reconverted into whole shares in the forward split.otherwise,their fractional interests will be diluted avaya must reconvert the interests back to their initial value as whole shares in order to sell the combined fractional interests.thus,avaya would be selling whole shares rather than fractional interests.
applebaum argument incorrectly assumes that avaya must issue fractions of a share in the proposed transaction.after the reverse split takes place,the stockholders holding shares below the minimum amount will be cashed out.the fractional interests will not be represented as shares and are therefore not involved in the forward split.avaya will then aggregate the fractional interests and repackage them as whole shares which the corporation will sell on the open market.the statute does not mandate any set procedure by which the fractional interests must be disposed of so long as those interests are sold in a manner that secures the proportionate value of the holdings.
applebaum also contends that avaya can not sell the fractional interests on behalf of the stockholders.if avaya sells the interests for the stockholders,applebaum argues that the corporation will not comply with section because the interests are not disposed of by those entitled thereto.as the vice chancellor noted,applebaum presents a strained reading of section the court of chancery correctly reasoned that in the eyes of equity,such sales would be by the stockholders 
applebaum interpretation also ignores the corporation responsibility under section to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests.since fractional shares can not be listed on the major stock exchanges the corporation must arrange for their aggregation in order to sell them aggregation is normally performed by 
affording to the stockholder an election to sell the fractional share or to purchase an additional fraction sufficient to make up a whole share.the elections are forwarded to a trust company or other agent of the corporation who matches up the purchases and sales and issues certificates for the whole shares or checks for payment of the fractional shares 
the general practice requires the corporation to act as an intermediary to package the fractional interests into marketable shares.if the corporation were not permitted to do so,the fractional interests of the stockholders would be dissipated through the transaction costs of finding other fractional holders with whom to combine and sell fractional interests in the market 
avaya may instruct nominees to execute the proposed transaction on behalf of the beneficial owners 
to execute the split,avaya stated in its proxy statement that nominees will be instructed to effect the split for their beneficial holders.applebaum argues that nominees can not be forced to elect to receive cash in exchange for the fractional interests held by their beneficial holders if the nominee combined holdings for all of its beneficial holders exceeds the minimum amount of stock necessary to survive the reverse split.
applebaum misstates the responsibility of a corporation to stockholders who hold their interests through nominees and brokers.nominees,as agents of the beneficial owners owe a duty to take the necessary steps to afford the true owners the opportunity to realize the benefits of the proposed transaction.the court of chancery properly held that the split could operate at the level of the corporate ledger avaya is not required to take any additional actions to effect the transaction for stockholders who own their stock through a nominee the beneficial stockholders are responsible for making proper arrangements with their agents 
applebaum also raises a disclosure issue related to the instructions for beneficial owners.the proxy statement informs stockholders that nominees will be instructed to effect the transaction.applebaum argues that this statement is misleading because,as explained above,he contends that a nominee has the option either to effect the split or refrain from doing so if the aggregate amount of the beneficial holders stock is sufficient to survive the reverse split.the proxy statement places the beneficial owners on notice that they must make arrangements with their nominees to receive payment from the transaction the proxy statement is not misleading because it accurately states that the nominees must execute the transaction on behalf of the beneficial holders.
the trading average by which avaya proposes to compensate the stockholders constitutes fair value under section 
as an alternative to selling the fractional interests on behalf of the stockholders,avaya may opt to pay the stockholders cash in an amount based on the trading price of avaya stock averaged over a period preceding the proposed transaction.to do so,avaya relies on section,which provides that a corporation may pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined.
the corporation owes its stockholders payment representing the fair value of their fractional interests.the stockholders will receive fair value if avaya compensates them with payment based on the price of avaya stock averaged over a period preceding the proposed transaction.while market price is not employed in all valuation contexts our jurisprudence recognizes that in many circumstances a property interest is best valued by the amount a buyer will pay for it the vice chancellor correctly concluded that a,liquid trading market will provide a measure of fair value superior to any estimate the court could impose 
applebaum relies on two instances where the court of chancery intimated that a section valuation may be similar to a going concern valuation employed in an appraisal proceeding.in chalfin hart holdings the court of chancery rejected a market price offered by a majority stockholder because the stock was not traded in an active market.in metropolitan life ins.aramark the court of chancery declined to apply a private company discount presented by a controlling stockholder seeking to squeeze out the minority stockholders.neither case applies here.
the court can not defer to market price as a measure of fair value if the stock has not been traded actively in a liquid market in chalfin,for example,the court of chancery held that the controlling stockholder could not offer as fair value in a reverse stock split the same amount alleged to be the past trading value because the stock had not been publicly traded for some time.the market price offered by the controlling stockholder was based on stale information an active trading market did not exist to monitor the corporation performance.thus,a more thorough valuation would have been necessary.
avaya stock,by contrast,is actively traded on the nyse.the concerns noted in chalfin are not pertinent to the proposed transaction because the market continues to digest information currently known about the company.the value of avaya stock is tested daily through the purchase and sale of the stock on the open market.
in a related argument,applebaum contends that the trading price can not represent fair value because the stock price is volatile,trading at a range of prices from per share to per share over the past year the volatility in trading does not necessarily mean that the market price is not an accurate indicator of fair value.avaya stock is and actively traded in the market.the average has been recognized as a fair compromise that will hedge against the risk of fluctuation.corporations often cash out fractional interests in an amount based on the average price over a given trading period 
applebaum also misunderstands the appropriate context for which a valuation may be necessary under section.in both chalfin and aramark,the court of chancery recognized that a transaction employing section may warrant a searching inquiry of fair value if a controlling stockholder initiates the transaction when a controlling stockholder presents a transaction that will free it from future dealings with the minority stockholders,opportunism becomes a concern any shortfall imposed on the minority stockholders will result in a transfer of value to the controlling stockholder.the discount in value could be imposed deliberately or could be the result of an information asymmetry where the controlling stockholder possesses material facts that are not known in the market thus,a section inquiry may resemble a section valuation if the controlling stockholder will benefit from presenting a suspect measure of valuation,such as an trading price or a wrongfully imposed private company discount 
although the split will cash out smaller stockholders,the transaction will not allow the corporation to realize a gain at their expense.unlike the more typical context,the avaya stockholders may continue to share in the value of the enterprise.avaya stockholders can avoid the effects of the proposed transaction either by purchasing a sufficient amount of stock to survive the initial reverse split or by simply using the payment provided under section to repurchase the same amount of avaya stock that they held before the transaction.
the split merely forces the stockholders to choose affirmatively to remain in the corporation.avaya will succeed in saving administrative costs only if the board has assumed correctly that the stockholders who received a small interest in the corporation through the lucent spin off would prefer to receive payment,free of transaction costs,rather than continue with the corporation.the transaction is not structured to prevent the stockholders from maintaining their stakes in the company.a payment based on market price is appropriate because it will permit the stockholders to reinvest in avaya,should they wish to do so.
the meaning of fair value under section is not identical to the concept of fair value in section 
the court of chancery correctly interpreted fair value in section to have a meaning independent of the definition of fair value in section of the delaware general corporation law relying on the maxim that the same words used in different sections must be construed to have the same meaning applebaum argues that fair value under section requires the court to perform a valuation similar to an appraisal proceeding.borrowing from appraisal concepts that require that shares of stock be valued as proportionate interests in a going concern,applebaum contends that the average trading price would be inadequate because the market price possesses an inherent discount that accounts for the holder minority stake in the company 
the delaware general assembly could not have intended section to have the same meaning as the fair value concept employed in section the reference to fair value in section first appeared in the general assembly did not place the term fair value in section until furthermore,the case law developing the concept of fair value under the appraisal statute did not acquire its present form until this court discarded the delaware block method and underscored the necessity of valuing a corporation as a going concern this court has not suggested similar valuation guidelines for the right to receive fair value under section.finally,section b c expressly excludes fractional interests from the appraisal remedy when the stock is traded on a national exchange.when applied in the context of a merger or consolidation,applebaum interpretation of fair value under section would accord the s
