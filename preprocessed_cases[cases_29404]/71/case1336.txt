plaintiff alexander vondjidis was employed by defendant hewlett packard corporation hp at hp athens,greece office in the.he purchased shares in hp through hp employee stock purchase plan.vondjidis left hp employment in.although hp was aware of vondjidis athens home address,which vondjidis had provided to hp in writing when he purchased his shares,hp listed hp athens,greece office as vondjidis shareholder address of record.after hp closed its athens office around,vondjidis ceased receiving any shareholder mailings from hp.vondjidis continued to maintain the same athens home address.vondjidis never inquired about the lack of communication.
in,hp transferred vondjidis shares to the state of california the state as unclaimed property.vondjidis learned of this transfer in,recovered some money from the state,and sued hp.the superior court granted hp summary judgment motion on the ground that hp was immune from liability under california statutory scheme for the transfer of unclaimed property to the state.
on appeal,vondjidis contends that hp did not establish that it was entitled to this immunity.he claims that the immunity does not apply where the transferor was actually aware of the property owner home address when it transferred the property to the state.hp maintains that compliance with the statutory scheme is not required to claim the immunity,that it established that it had complied with the statutory scheme and therefore was entitled to the immunity,and that the superior court ruling may be upheld on the alternative ground that vondjidis action was barred by the statute of limitations.
we reverse the judgment.we hold that no statutory immunity is available under title of part of the code of civil procedure in the absence of compliance with title statutory scheme,that hp failed to establish that it had complied with the statutory scheme,and that hp has not demonstrated that it was entitled to summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.
undisputed facts 
vondjidis,a greek citizen,was employed by hp as an engineer at hp athens,greece office from march to october.vondjidis lived in athens at the time.vondjidis purchased shares of hp stock through hp employee stock purchase plan spp.when vondjidis initiated his spp stock purchases,he filled out an application to participate in the spp on which he provided hp with his athens home address.
it was hp practice to send mailings related to stock purchased through the spp by an employee working abroad to the foreign office at which the employee worked.if the employee left hp employment,hp position was that t he former employee was responsible for providing a new address of record for all future mailings relating to their hp stock.if the former employee failed to provide a new address of record,shareholder mailings continued to be sent to the hp foreign office.hp transfer agent was required to use this address of record until the former employee provided a new one in writing.
while vondjidis was employed by hp,all communications relating to his hp shares were sent from hp california office to vondjidis at hp athens office,which hp had listed as vondjidis shareholder address of record.after he terminated his employment with hp,these communications continued to be sent to vondjidis at hp athens office,and hp employees there forwarded these communications to vondjidis athens home address.he never received any communications from hp at any address other than hp athens office or his athens home address.
in december,hp sent a change of address form to vondjidis.he did not complete the change of address form.in august,vondjidis received a note from an hp employee at hp athens office along with his stock dividend check.the note said in greek alex,hi.i am sending you the common stock dividend alto sent to my office,and i telexed them to send them directly to your home from now on.so,you will have to go to the bank and cash the check.i meaning hp do not need anything else from you.vondjidis understood that hp had been sending all his communications to the athens hp office rather than to vondjidis athens home address and that this was why his address had needed to be changed.after vondjidis received the august note,he did not receive any communications directly from hp california office at his athens home address.in or,someone from hp office in greece twice contacted vondjidis and his wife by telephone to try to persuade them to sell his shares.they told this person that they were not interested in selling the hp shares.
in,an hp employee in greece forwarded to vondjidis athens home address correspondence sent from hp california office to hp athens office.the note said in greek alex,please send us your correct address so this is sent directly to you.change of address forms were enclosed with the note.vondjidis believed that his wife responded to this note you got my address.do not bother me any more with selling my stock or whatever.vondjidis did not fill out a change of address form because m y address was known.hp shareholder records continued to reflect that vondjidis address was hp athens office.
vondjidis moved to canada in,but he continued to maintain the same home address in athens and continued to receive mail that was sent to his athens home address hp closed its athens office sometime between and.vondjidis received no communications from hp after.he did not receive annual reports,account statements,or dividend checks.vondjidis did not contact hp between and,and he did not hear anything from hp about his stock.after hp athens office closed,hp mail to vondjidis at the athens office address was returned to hp as undeliverable.
vondjidis did not cash the few dividend checks he received from hp prior to,because currency regulations made it cumbersome to cash the checks in greece.these dividend checks were for very small amounts,such as.i t was easier to put the in the garbage than to go through the pain of cashing it.when he failed to receive further dividend checks after,vondjidis assumed that they had worked something more clever out and they would reinvest my money.between and,hp dividend checks for vondjidis shares,totaling,were never cashed.by,due to a number of stock splits,vondjidis owned shares of hp stock.
hp considered a shareholder to be lost if multiple mailings went out and returned with unknown address on it.hp utilized an outside escheatment vendor to transfer shares belonging to lost shareholders to the state.before hp transferred stock belonging to a lost shareholder to the state,its outside escheatment vendor would ask hp to verify any foreign addresses,and hp would look up those addresses on its system and would forward any address from hp system,including its personnel system,that hp had for that person to the escheatment vendor to do that final mailing.it was the escheatment vendor responsibility to send a letter to each of the lost shareholders.
in,hp transferred vondjidis shares to the state as unclaimed property.vondjidis received no actual notice prior to the transfer,and there was no evidence that any notice was sent or attempted to be sent to him prior to the transfer.
vondjidis learned in that his stock had been transferred to the state.he eventually recovered about from the state.
ii.procedural background 
in march,vondjidis filed this action against hp.he alleged causes of action including breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,conversion,and fraud.vondjidis alleged that hp had transferred his shares to the state without notice to him or his consent on the mistaken ground that vondjidis had abandoned them.vondjidis alleged that hp had known his identity and address,but it had failed to exercise due diligence before transferring the shares.vondjidis sought reissuance of his shares,general,special and punitive damages,and injunctive and other relief.
hp filed an answer in which it raised as an affirmative defense that vondjidis complaint was barred by the statutes of limitations and by code of civil procedure section,a provision of california unclaimed property law upl.
in december,hp moved for summary judgment on immunity and statute of limitations grounds.in august,the superior court granted hp summary judgment motion on the ground that hp was indisputably immune under code of civil procedure section.the court rejected vondjidis claim that the immunity provision was applicable only if hp established that it had complied with the upl.this would render section nugatory since a holder would be entitled to immunity only after it had successfully defended itself from an action asserting that it improperly transferred money or property to the controller.further,the court found that hp had established by undisputed facts that it had complied with the upl.
the superior court rejected hp claim that vondjidis action was barred by the statute of limitations.the court concluded that there were triable issues of fact as to plaintiff state of mind between,when he ceased receiving communications about his stock,and when he filed his action and whether a reasonable person would have been on notice that their stock had escheated if they had not received any information that their stock had escheated.
the court entered judgment for hp and dismissed the action.on september,vondjidis filed a motion for reconsideration.as new evidence,vondjidis attached a declaration by a former employee of the state regarding the state shoddy performance in locating the owners of unclaimed property,and the bad practices of audit agents.the superior court denied his motion.vondjidis filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
appellate review of a ruling on a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion is de novo.brassinga city of mountain view th,d.the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there are no triable issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.the moving party also bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar,at,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar,at,d.
scope of immunity 
title of part of the code of civil procedure title governs the transfer of unclaimed property of various types to the state.it is the purpose of this title to provide for the receipt,custody,investment,management,disposal,escheat and permanent escheat of various classes of unclaimed property,to the possession of which the state is,or may become,entitled under the provisions of this title or under other provision of law.unclaimed property is defined in title as all property which is unclaimed,abandoned,escheated,permanently escheated,or distributed to the state,or which,under any provision of law,will become unclaimed,abandoned,escheated,permanently escheated,or distributed to the state,or to the possession of which the state is or will become entitled,if not claimed by the person or persons entitled thereto within the time allowed by law,whether or not there has been a judicial determination that such property is unclaimed,abandoned,escheated,permanently escheated,or distributed to the state,subd.b.
title contains a general immunity provision.any person delivering money or other property to the treasurer or controller under the provisions of this title shall,upon such delivery,be relieved and held harmless by the state from all or any claim or claims which exist at that time with reference to such money or other property,or which may thereafter be made,or which may come into existence,on account of,or in respect to,such money or other property.no action shall be maintained against any person who is the holder of such money or other property,nor against any officer as agent thereof,for a the recovery of such money or other property delivered to the treasurer or controller pursuant to this title,or for interest thereon subsequent to the date of the report thereof,if any,to the controller or b damages alleged to have resulted from such delivery to the treasurer or controller,italics added.
the upl is contained in chapter of title.this chapter contains another immunity provision that is specifically applicable to transfers of stock.the holder of any interest under subdivision b of section shall deliver a duplicate certificate to the controller or shall register the securities in uncertificated form in the name of the controller.upon delivering a duplicate certificate or providing evidence of registration of the securities in uncertificated form to the controller,the holder,any transfer agent,registrar,or other person acting for or on behalf of the holder in executing or delivering the duplicate certificate or registering the uncertificated securities,shall be relieved from all liability of every kind to any person including,but not limited to,any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate of the certificate issued to the controller for any losses or damages resulting to that person by the issuance and delivery to the controller of the duplicate certificate or the registration of the uncertificated securities to the controller,subd.d.
this second immunity provision applies only to t he holder of any interest under subdivision b of section.subdivision b of section provides subject to section,any intangible interest in a business association,as evidenced by the stock records or membership records of the association,escheats to this state if the interest in the association is owned by a person who for more than three years has neither claimed a dividend or other sum referred to in subdivision a nor corresponded in writing with the association or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the association,and the association does not know the location of the owner at the end of the period.with respect to the interest,the business association shall be deemed the holder,subd.b,italics added.
vondjidis argument is that hp conduct did not fall within either of these immunity provisions.in his view,hp did not transfer his stock under the provisions of title,which is the premise for the application of section.the provisions of title apply only to unclaimed property,and,vondjidis argues,hp was always aware of his identity and home address,thereby negating any assertion that his stock was unclaimed property within the meaning of title.vondjidis maintains that hp did not hold his stock under subdivision b of section,as required by section,because hp could not claim that it d id not know the location of the owner,as required by section,subdivision b.hp asserts that these immunities apply notwithstanding its alleged awareness of vondjidis address.
the scope of the immunity granted by section and section,subdivision d is,of course,a question of statutory construction.as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.authority for california cities excess liability city of los altos th,d.
the plain language of section restricts the immunity to those who transfer property under the provisions of title.this language would be surplusage if,as hp argues,any transfer to the state,whether in accordance with title or in violation of title,confers immunity on the transferor.we can conceive of no rational reason why the legislature would wish to shield from liability those who violated the statutory scheme in derogation of the property owner interests.the objectives of the unclaimed property act are to protect unknown owners by locating them and restoring their property to them and to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of the use of it,most of which experience shows will never be claimed.douglas aircraft cranston cal d.since title is intended to serve the interests of the property owners and the state,rather than those who are holding the property of another,we agree with vondjidis that section immunity does not apply unless the transfer complied with the provisions of title.
the same is true as to section,subdivision d.this immunity provision is explicitly limited to t he holder of any interest under subdivision b of section.a corporation is the holder of an interest under section,subdivision b only if the corporation does not know the location of the owner of that interest.again,the plain language of the statute precludes immunity for a corporation that transfers property to the state even though the corporation is aware of the owner location.the plain language of the statute is also consistent with the legislature intent to protect unknown owners by locating them and restoring their property to them.douglas aircraft cranston,supra,cal d at.
we must presume that the legislature acts rationally and in accordance with the overall purpose of the statutory scheme.no rational legislature,acting with the intent to protect unknown property owners by locating them and reuniting them with their property,would grant immunity to a corporation that,notwithstanding its knowledge of the owner location,chose to deprive the owner of his or her property by transferring it to the state.the immunity provided to corporations by section,subdivision d does not extend to a corporation that transfers property to the state even though it knows the location of the property owner 
hp contends that restricting these statutory immunities to those who comply with the statutory scheme would lead to an absurd result that is directly counter to the purpose of the upl.in hp view,our interpretation of the scope of the statutory immunity would provid e immunity only where it is unnecessary.see olney sacramento county bar d.olney immunity for arbitrator in arbitration conducted pursuant to statutes and rules of procedure applies even where arbitrator made an error of law under those statutes and rules.
hp vision is skewed.the immunity provided by section extends to any claim or claims which exist at that time with reference to such money or other property,or which may thereafter be made,or which may come into existence,on account of,or in respect to,such money or other property as long as the transferor complies with the statutory scheme.this immunity is not without value where the transferor has complied with the statutory scheme section shields a transferor from all claims regarding the property,not simply claims based on the transferor failure to comply with the statutory scheme.a transferor who complies with the statutory scheme will be shielded from any claims regarding the property that are unrelated to the transfer of the property under the upl and any claims for consequential damages arising from the transfer of the property.for example,the owner of stock will not be able to hold the transferor liable for the owner loss of any increased value that the stock acquired after its transfer.the virtually unlimited immunity that a transferor can acquire by compliance with the statutory scheme far outstrips claims that the transferor has failed to comply with the statutory scheme.
similarly,the immunity provided by section,subdivision d is not restricted to claims that the transferor did not comply with the statutory scheme.section,subdivision d shields the transferor from all liability of every kind to any person italics added.this extensive immunity,like section immunity,ranges well beyond claims that the transferor has failed to comply with the statutory scheme.
furthermore,our construction of the statute must be consistent with the legislature intent,and the statutory scheme,which was intended to benefit the owners of property and the state,does not favor immunizing those who wrongfully deprive owners of their property in violation of the express requirements of the statutory scheme.the purpose of title statutory scheme distinguishes it from the arbitration immunity statute and the child abuse reporting immunity statute that were found to grant absolute immunity in olney and storch silverman d.storch.the public interest in encouraging arbitration olney and child abuse reporting storch favor immunizing the arbitrator and the reporter,but the public interest in reuniting owners with their property does not favor immunizing a corporation that wrongfully wrests property away from its owner.in addition,the arbitrator immunity is limited to the arbitration,and the child abuse reporter immunity extends only to the report,while the immunity in question here,when it applies,is,as we have already noted,far more extensive.
finally,hp asserts that absolute immunity furthers the purpose of the statutory scheme to encourage the delivery of unclaimed property to the state by alleviating the holder concerns about potential claims by the owners of such property.but this assertion begs the question.the state has no proper interest in encouraging corporations to deliver property to the state that does not qualify as unclaimed property.indeed,the legislature intent to reunite unclaimed property with its owner would be subverted if corporations were encouraged to deliver an owner property to the state rather than to allow the owner to retain it.
only one published case has addressed this issue,and it presented a sharp conflict between the majority opinion and the dissent hp relies on the majority opinion in harris,supra,th,d.in harris,the second district court of appeal majority held that title immunity provisions applied even if the transfer was in violation of title.harris,at,d.the plaintiffs in harris had been gte employees who had acquired stock in gte as a fringe benefit of their employment.gte was aware of the identities and locations of the plaintiffs but nevertheless transferred the stock to the state as unclaimed property.the second district majority concluded that the immunity provided by title was absolute.harris the immunity is conditional and vanishes if the escheatment was render the immunity meaningless because immunity comes into play when,and only when,the defendant is charged with wrongdoing.harris,at,d.
the majority in harris concluded that the legislature had granted corporations absolute immunity.t he legislature adoption of a rule of absolute immunity is consistent with the purpose of the upl,which is to give the state rather than the holders of unclaimed property the benefit of its use.citation.without this protection,holders of unclaimed property concerned about lawsuits such as this class action would likely err on the side of retaining rather than delivering unclaimed property to the controller,thereby depriving the state of the benefit of its use.the legislature,faced with a choice between absolute immunity which promotes delivery of unclaimed property to the controller but provides only limited redress to the owners of the property and conditional immunity which would have discouraged delivery but allowed redress,plainly and unambiguously opted for absolute immunity.harris,supra,th at,d.
justice mallano dissent in harris took the opposite view.he noted that the purpose of the upl is not limited to affording the state the use of unclaimed property.instead,the upl is intended both to protect property owners and to give the state,rather than the holder,the benefit of holding unclaimed property.harris,supra,th at,d dis.opn.of mallano.but the first purpose of the reunite the plaintiffs with their unclaimed only be furthered by permitting the plaintiffs to pursue their claims against gte.affording gte immunity for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty here would prov
