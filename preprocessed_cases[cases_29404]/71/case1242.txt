the sec brought a civil action against scott ginsburg alleging violations of b and e of the securities and exchange act,b,e,and accompanying rules and.the allegations were that ginsburg had communicated material nonpublic information to his brother mark ginsburg and to his father jordan ginsburg regarding ez communications,and katz media group,and that mark and jordan had traded on ez stock using that information 
the case was tried to a jury which found that ginsburg had violated the insider trading provisions.the district court initially ordered him to pay in penalties but denied the sec request to enjoin him from violating securities laws in the future.later the district court granted ginsburg renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and vacated the judgment against him,because it concluded that the evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that he had tipped off his brother or father about inside information.
the sec appeals from that judgment as a matter of law,and also contends that if we reverse it,we should direct the district court to enjoin ginsburg from violating securities laws in the future.in addition to defending the district court judgment on the specific insufficiency of evidence ground given for it,ginsburg offers two other grounds for affirming it.first,he contends that even if the evidence is sufficient to show he communicated insider information to mark or jordan,it is insufficient to show the information materiality.second,he contends the evidence is insufficient to show substantial steps were taken toward a tender offer of katz,and ginsburg knowledge of the tender offer.finding merit in the sec position and none in ginsburg,we conclude that the judgment is due to be reversed,the civil penalty reinstated,and an injunction entered against future violations of the securities laws by ginsburg.
the nature of a judgment as a matter of law and our review of it is such that we take the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the party who won before the jury only to have its victory taken away by the court.russell north broward,cir.we draw from the evidence all reasonable inferences in support of the verdict,because the jury could have done so.united states gregory,cir.

we review a decision to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.sec adler,cir.a judgment as a matter of law is warranted only i f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.that means,as we have already said,that we review the evidence,and the inferences arising therefrom,in the light most favorable to the party.we may not weigh the evidence or decide the credibility of witnesses.adler,at.however,the nonmoving party must provide more than a mere scintilla of evidence to survive a motion for judgment as a matter of law.isenbergh newspaper sales,cir.

iii.discussion 
judgment as a matter of.sufficiency of evidence that ginsburg tipped mark or jordan 
in order to establish liability under b and e of the securities and exchange act and accompanying rules and,the sec must prove that ginsburg acted with scienter,a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.sec adler,cir quoting aaron sec,d.scienter requires that the insider or tippee,if the trader is not the insider possess material nonpublic information at the time of the trade.id.at.in addition,it requires that the material nonpublic information be used in a trade.id.proof of knowledge of such information at the time of a trade gives rise to a strong inference of use.id.
the sec must prove violations of b and e,and their supplementary rules,by a preponderance of the evidence,and may use direct or circumstantial evidence to do so.herman maclean huddleston,d.circumstantial evidence has no less weight than direct evidence as long as it reasonably establishes that fact rather than anything else.burrell bd.of trustees of.military college,cir.
the parties disagree about which body of precedent controls the sufficiency of the evidence issue upon which the district court granted judgment as a matter of law.the sufficiency issue in general involves the circumstances in which it will be inferred from a act following a conversation with b,who knew a given fact,that a had been informed of that fact when he acted.as it arises in insider trading cases,the more specific issue is when it may be inferred from a trade in stock by a,following a conversation with insider b,that b disclosed inside information to a who acted upon it.the sec argues,logically,that the sufficiency of the evidence and the permissibility of inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in this insider trading case are governed by our insider trading decisions,especially sec adler,cir,which is the closest of those cases to the facts we have here.
ginsburg argues,and the district court concluded,that four employment retaliation decisions,which he views as inconsistent with adler on the issue of what may be inferred from conversations of an actor with one in the know,control instead.see burrell,cir clover total,cir brungart bellsouth,cir brochu city of riviera beach,cir.the last three of those employment decisions can not possibly trump adler to the extent of any inconsistency.where prior panel decisions conflict,we follow the first one released,cohen office depot,cir where two prior panel decisions conflict we are bound to follow the oldest one united states dailey,cir where there is an conflict,the earliest panel opinion resolving the issue in question binds this circuit until the court resolves the issue en banc,and adler came out before any of those three decisions.
however,burrell,one of the four employment decisions that ginsburg cites,and upon which the district court relied to award him judgment as a matter of law,preceded adler.if an evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence should not take into account the specific factual context from which that evidence arose,then we would be bound to follow burrell and disregard adler to the extent of any inconsistency.but it should,so we are not.
this is what we are talking about.decision maker a comes into contact with information possessor b and soon thereafter engages in conduct c.when will that factual scenario support an inference that,despite their denials,a was told the information by b and on that basis a did c more to the point,does an earlier decision of this court,concluding that scenario would not support an inference the information was communicated and acted upon in an employment retaliation case,compel us to conclude that the same scenario would not support an inference of communicated information and action based upon it in insider trading cases 
we think the earlier employment retaliation decision in burrell does not control this case,because insider trading cases are different from employment retaliation cases.the context in which the facts arise and the strength of the competing inferences can differ.as a result,evidence that may appear to be materially identical for purposes of determining whether a decision maker knew a particular fact can actually have different probative force in an insider trading case than in an employment retaliation case.
there are many sound,business reasons to take some job action that is challenged as retaliatory.that multitude of potential reasons dilutes the strength of any inference that because a decision maker took an action against an employee he must have been told of a fact which could have led him to take the action for a prohibited reason.
by contrast,people do not make large stock trades for as many reasons as businesses take job actions.although there are exceptions,people generally buy when they believe the price of a stock is going up and sell when they believe it is going down either absolutely or relative to the expected performance of other stock.the factfinder in an insider trading case need only infer the most likely source of that belief.the temporal proximity of a phone conversation between the trader and one with insider knowledge provides a reasonable basis for inferring that the basis of the trader belief was the inside information.the larger and more profitable the trades,and the closer in time the trader exposure to the insider,the stronger the inference that the trader was acting on the basis of inside information.the magnitude of the incentive to trade on insider information is illustrated by the trades that were made in this case.in less than a month jordan made by trading ez stock in the direction someone with knowledge of the insider information his son possessed would have,and mark made a total of by trading ez and katz stock as someone privy to the insider information of his brother would have.
it is not at all clear that the same considerations apply with equal force in job discrimination cases.the inference that a job action was based on a retaliatory motive which arose from imparted information may well be weaker than the comparable inferences in insider trading cases for several reasons.for one thing,the incentive to tip and to act on tipped information is usually a great deal stronger than the incentive to impart and act upon information about an employee engaging in legally protected conduct.we expect that most people would rather make or in a short period trading stocks than they would like to see an employee be punished for something the employee had a legal right to do.
because it is far from clear that employment retaliation cases are interchangeable with insider trading cases,the district court should have looked to the more specifically applicable precedent instead of regarding it as wrongly decided in light of decisions that had nothing to do with insider trading.rodriguez de quijas.express,d if a precedent of this court has direct application in a case,yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions,the court of appeals should follow the case which directly controls,leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.it is insider trading decisions,instead of employment retaliation cases,to which we will look for guidance in deciding this case.
in the adler insider trading case,richard adler,an outside director of comptronix corporation,attended a november board meeting at which he was asked to investigate the activities of two comptronix executives for potential fraud.adler,at.the next day,november,adler friend and associate harvey pegram called adler home at.the call lasted seconds.at pegram called his wife at home.at pegram wife called their stockbroker and placed an order to sell shares of comptronix,and over an period beginning with that telephone call they sold a total of shares.on the evening of november at,pegram called his business associate philip choy in hong kong.at choy faxed his stockbroker an order to sell shares of comptronix.another associate of pegram,domer ishler,called adler on november and again on november.on november,ishler purchased put options on comptronix stock.on november comptronix announced that certain officers had been suspended for overstating gross profits,and comptronix common stock lost of its value.id.at.the pegrams avoided losses of,choy avoided losses of,and ishler realized gains of.id.at.
the sec brought a civil action against adler,pegram,choy,and ishler for violations of b and rule.id.at.after a hung jury,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law to pegram,adler and,choy,and summary judgment to ishler.id.at.the court concluded that the phone calls raised a possible reasonable inference that pegram received inside information from adler,but any such inference was rebutted by pegram evidence of a preexisting plan to sell his comptronix stock.the circumstances related to the other defendants were similar,and the district court made the same determination for each one.id.at.
we reversed,concluding that the phone calls and stock sales raised a reasonable inference that pegram was tipped by adler,and thus that pegram possessed nonpublic information.we noted that a credible and innocent explanation for the timing of calls and sales can rebut the inference of possession of information.id.at.nevertheless,though pegram provided strong evidence that his plan to sell comptronix stock predated the alleged tip,and evidence of innocent explanations for the relevant telephone calls,we stated that the jury is not required to believe the defendant explanations.t hese issues should be decided by a jury,which is in the position to observe the demeanor of witnesses and make appropriate credibility determinations.id.at.choy calls and sales similarly created a reasonable inference,as did ishler.id.at.
in adler the pattern repeated twice on one day and once again the next week.in this case there is evidence of one clear pattern concerning ez stock the july call from ginsburg to mark followed the next day by his purchase of shares,and one concerning katz stock the june call from ginsburg to mark followed the next day by his purchase of shares.the other ez calls match less well with trades.the july call to jordan was followed by a purchase by mark,and the july call to mark followed with a purchase by jordan.but because mark and jordan admitted discussing ez throughout that period,the mismatch of calls and trades is not a big problem.the multiple occurrences of the pattern in this case are similar enough to those in adler.
this case does have stronger evidence suggesting that conversations between the parties were more frequent and that the types of trades made were not unique and it also features longer spans of time between the conversations and trades.ginsburg offered evidence of public information about the companies as motivation for mark trading argued that the trades were consistent with prior trading history,and put forward innocent explanations for the calls.the district court commented that it is plausible that the investments were driven not by tips but rather by public knowledge.it is also plausible that they were driven by insider information.and it was up to the jury to choose between those competing plausible theories of fact.
the jury was free to disbelieve ginsburg evidence just as the adler jury was free to disbelieve what we characterized as the strong evidence of a preexisting stock trade plan in adler.evidence of the innocent explanations for the calls between the parties in this case and of mark trading habits is not enough to justify overturning the jury verdict.if it were otherwise,family members who regularly traded in a particular stock or type of stock could trade based on insider information with impunity.
the district court stated that t he phone records are insufficient to compel an inference that scott ginsburg conveyed material,information to mark,but that is not the issue.the sec did not have the burden of putting in evidence that compelled the inference ginsburg conveyed nonpublic information to mark.all it was required to do was put in evidence that reasonably permitted that inference.it did that.the pattern occurrences coupled with the jury right to disbelieve the innocent explanations of the calls and trades are enough to support the verdict.
alternative grounds to affirm 
ginsburg argues that even if sufficient evidence was presented that he tipped mark and jordan,the district court decision to grant judgment as a matter of law can be affirmed on two independent grounds.though not reached by the district court,these arguments were presented in ginsburg renewed rule motion,and they raise legal issues over which we would exercise de novo review,so we may decide them in the first instance.
sufficiency of evidence that the information tipped was material and nonpublic 
ginsburg contends that the sec did not provide sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that the information tipped was material and nonpublic,as required by rule.an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.tsc,northway,d.materiality is proved by showing a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.
the insider information in this case meets the materiality standard.in basic levinson,d,the supreme court held that preliminary merger talks can be material well before any agreement is reached.the materiality of an uncertain prospective event depend s at any given time upon a balancing of both the indicated probability that the event will occur and the anticipated magnitude of the event in light of the totality of the company activity.id.the court explained that a factfinder will need to look to indicia of interest in the transaction at the highest corporate levels,and consider factors such as board resolutions,instructions to investment bankers,and actual negotiations between principals or their intermediaries.id.at.at.the determination of materiality requires delicate assessments of the inferences a reasonable shareholder would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact.tsc,at.at.in an analogous context,the jury unique competence in applying the reasonable man standard is thought ordinarily to preclude summary judgment in negligence cases.id.at.at.
alan box,ez ceo,and ginsburg discussed a specific share price,and ginsburg knew both that evergreen was interested in acquiring ez and that ez was talking to other companies.the jury was free to find that a reasonable investor would view evergreen executives talking to ez executives about a possible acquisition at the specific price of a share as altering the total mix of information available.a merger is an event of considerable magnitude to an investor,and preliminary merger negotiations constitute concrete steps indicating an increasing possibility of a merger occurring.as for the nonpublic nature of the evidence,the jury heard testimony from ron peale,ez cfo,that the talks were confidential.the jury could recognize as material the difference between public information that ez was having conversations about a possible sale and about potential sale prices,see supra,and nonpublic information about a private meeting between executives and the specific share price they discussed confidentially.
as to katz,ginsburg was clearly privy to information gleaned under a confidentiality agreement.the jury had before it sufficient evidence to conclude that ginsburg june meeting with olds indicated to ginsburg that a deal had to happen fast.the jury could reasonably infer that the information was material and nonpublic.
sufficiency of evidence of substantial steps under rule 
ginsburg also argues that there was not enough evidence to permit an inference that,at the time of his alleged katz tip on june substantial steps had been taken to commence a tender offer,as required by rule and ginsburg knew of the tender offer,as ginsburg claims is required by rule.rule prohibits purchase or sale of a company stock by any person who is in possession of material information relating to a tender offer if an offering person has taken a substantial step or steps to commence,or has commenced,a tender offer.a.rule d prevents any insider of the target or acquiring company,or any person in possession of material information relating to a tender offer,from communicating that information to another likely to trade on it,after substantial steps have been taken.the sec release accompanying rule states 
s ubstantial step or steps to commence a tender offer include,but are not limited to,voting on a resolution by the offering person board of directors relating to the tender offer the formulation of a plan or proposal to make a tender offer by the offering person or the person s acting on behalf of the offering person or activities which substantially facilitate the tender offer such as arranging financing for a tender offer preparing or directing or authorizing the preparation of tender offer materials or authorizing negotiations,negotiating or entering into agreements with any person to act as a dealer manager,soliciting dealer,forwarding agent or depository in connection with the tender offer.
