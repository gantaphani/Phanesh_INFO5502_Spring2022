the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of reed slatkin,avoiding under a and california civil code a certain transfers made by slatkin during his operation of a ponzi scheme the district court affirmed the grant of summary judgment.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under,and we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
in may,slatkin filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.shortly thereafter,he was charged in a federal criminal case with mail fraud,wire fraud,money laundering,and conspiracy to obstruct justice in connection with his operation of a ponzi scheme.he pled guilty to the criminal charges pursuant to a plea agreement and currently is serving a prison sentence.in his plea agreement,slatkin admitted that from to may,he operated a ponzi scheme in which he paid investors purported profits primarily using funds raised from other investors.slatkin ponzi scheme involved over million and approximately investors,and resulted in losses exceeding million.
in august,the trustee initiated the first of hundreds of adversary proceedings against slatkin investors.in these adversary proceedings,the trustee sought avoidance and recovery,under a and california civil code a,of actual fraudulent transfers made by slatkin to investors.specifically,the trustee sought to avoid as fraudulent any transfer made by slatkin to an investor to the extent that such transfer exceeded the amount the investor had given slatkin,the amount of the investor purported profit on their investment.
the present case involves the adversary proceeding filed by the trustee against investors glenn johnson,barbara johnson,and santa barbara capital management collectively,the johnsons.during the period of time that slatkin was operating the ponzi scheme,he transferred millions of dollars in purported profits to the johnsons.the trustee seeks to avoid and recover these purported profits.
the bankruptcy court granted the trustee partial summary judgment,finding that slatkin guilty plea and plea agreement conclusively established that slatkin operated a ponzi scheme from to may with the actual intent to defraud his creditors.slatkin actual intent is important because,to be avoidable and recoverable as a fraudulent transfer under a a and california civil code a,the transfer must have been made with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors.see a a cal.a.
the bankruptcy court then granted the trustee summary judgment on the remaining issues,finding that the trustee had the right to avoid and recover the transfers to the johnsons,and that the trustee was entitled to prejudgment interest.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court grants of summary judgment.the johnsons timely appeal to this court.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court.ditto mccurdy,cir.we review the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment de novo.id.we may affirm the grant of summary judgment on any basis supported by the record.ryman sears,roebuck,cir.
on a motion for summary judgment,all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.summary judgment must be granted if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
a.the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the johnsons motion for a continuance to conduct further discovery.
the johnsons argue that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying them additional discovery prior to granting summary judgment on the issue of slatkin intent.in particular,they argue that they were not allowed to depose slatkin or review the transcript of slatkin testimony in a proceeding before the trustee prior to the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment on the issue of slatkin intent.
we review the bankruptcy court refusal to grant a continuance to permit additional discovery for an abuse of discretion.see matter of bishop,baldwin,rewald,dillingham wong,cir.w e will only find an abuse of discretion if the movant diligently pursued its previous discovery opportunities,and can demonstrate that allowing additional discovery would have precluded summary judgment.see bank of,nt sa pengwin,cir.
the johnsons have now had the opportunity to conduct the requested discovery by deposing slatkin and reviewing the transcript of his previous testimony in the proceeding before the trustee.the johnsons fail to point to anything that contradicts the plea agreement or the bankruptcy court finding,based on the plea agreement,that slatkin operated a ponzi scheme over a fifteen year period with the actual intent to defraud.the johnsons also fail to demonstrate that additional discovery would have otherwise precluded the grant of summary judgment on the issue of slatkin intent.we therefore hold that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion.
b.the johnsons right to a jury trial was not violated by the grant of summary judgment.
the johnsons argue that the grant of summary judgment violates their right to a trial by jury guaranteed by the seventh amendment to the united states constitution.we reject this claim as without merit.as the supreme court held,over one hundred years ago,a summary judgment proceeding does not deprive the losing party of its seventh amendment right to a jury trial.see fid.deposit of united states.see also anderson,at.holding that there is no right to a jury trial where the evidence is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.
c.the bankruptcy court properly determined that slatkin acted with the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment on the issue of slatkin actual intent based solely on slatkin guilty plea and plea agreement.the johnsons argue that,in doing so,the bankruptcy court erred.specifically,the johnsons argue that the plea agreement should not have been admitted,and that the plea agreement should not be given preclusive effect as to slatkin intent.
we review the bankruptcy court evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.latman burdette,cir.to reverse on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling,we must conclude not only that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion,but also that the error was prejudicial.id.
the plea agreement is admissible to demonstrate that slatkin operated a ponzi scheme with the intent to defraud.
the plea agreement is being offered to show the truth of the information contained slatkin ran a ponzi scheme and,in doing so,had the actual intent to defraud his creditors.the plea agreement is therefore hearsay.see.c.to be considered on a motion for summary judgment,the plea agreement must accordingly fall within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.see.e requiring that only admissible evidence be considered for purposes of summary judgment.hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other applicable rules.
the bankruptcy court did not make clear which hearsay exception it relied upon in finding the plea agreement to be admissible.we can,however,affirm the bankruptcy court evidentiary ruling on any ground supported by the record,even if it differs from the reasoning of the bankruptcy court.see atel fin.quaker coal,cir per curiam.
we hold that the plea agreement is admissible under federal rule of evidence,and that the bankruptcy court did not,therefore,abuse its discretion when it considered the plea agreement in granting summary judgment.
under rule,
a statement not specifically covered by rule or but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,is not excluded by the hearsay rule,if the court determines that a the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact b the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts and c the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.
slatkin plea agreement meets the requirements for admission under this rule.first,the plea agreement is offered as evidence of a material operation of a ponzi scheme over a period and his actual fraudulent intent in doing so.
second,slatkin admissions in the plea agreement that he operated a ponzi scheme,and that he did so with the actual intent to defraud,are more probative on these issues than any other evidence the trustee could procure.in fact,it is precisely because such direct proof of fraudulent intent is rarely available that courts allow a finding of fraudulent intent based on circumstantial evidence.see consove cohen in re roco,cir a court may make a finding of fraudulent intent under section a on the basis of circumstantial evidence direct proof of the transferor fraudulent intent will rarely be available.am.express travel related servs.golchin in re golchin,rarely will a person who is guilty of fraudulent conduct admit his guilt.thus,direct proof of fraudulent intent is rarely available.internal quotations and alterations omitted.
third,admission of the plea agreement to prove slatkin actual fraudulent intent and operation of the ponzi scheme furthers the general purposes of the rules of evidence and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the plea agreement into evidence.
finally,slatkin plea agreement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.his guilty plea,based on the plea agreement,was made under oath with the advice of counsel,subjected slatkin to severe criminal penalties,was made after slatkin was advised of his constitutional rights,and was accepted by the court in the criminal matter only after the court determined that slatkin plea was knowing and voluntary.
the johnsons take issue only with the equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness requirement of rule.the johnsons argue that the plea agreement is unreliable and untrustworthy because slatkin is a perpetrator of a fraud to which he admits and he is thus not reliable or credible slatkin made statements in the plea agreement solely for the purpose of demonstrating his extraordinary cooperation,resulting in his sentence being reduced from years to years and the trustee requested certain things be included in the plea agreement solely to benefit the trustee litigation position.we reject these arguments and hold that the plea agreement was admissible under rule.
first,the criminal consequences to slatkin of making the admissions contained in the plea agreement provide a sufficient circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness to overcome any concern regarding slatkin unreliability or lack of credibility.b deeming admissible statements made by an unavailable declarant that tend to subject the declarant to criminal liability such that a reasonable person in the declarant position would not have made the statements unless believing them to be true 
second,the plea agreement did not,as the johnsons argue,reduce slatkin sentence from years to years.if slatkin had been subjected to the maximum statutory sentence on each of his counts of conviction,and if the sentences on each of the counts of conviction had been imposed to run consecutively,the total length of his combined sentence would have been years there is,however,no indication that the district court would have sentenced slatkin to the statutory maximum on each count of conviction or imposed consecutive sentences if slatkin had not entered into the plea agreement.further,the district court was not bound by the plea agreement.thus,although slatkin obviously benefitted from the plea agreement through the government agreement to make certain sentencing recommendations,the plea agreement did not,as the johnsons argue,result in a year reduction in slatkin sentence.
finally,the fact that the trustee may have requested that certain information be included in the plea agreement does not,under the circumstances,render the plea agreement unreliable.this is particularly true here because slatkin has consistently maintained,in both written testimony and during oral testimony,that the factual statements in the plea agreement are true and accurate.
the plea agreement preclusively establishes slatkin intent to defraud in relation to transfers to investors of purported profits.
the johnsons argue that the plea agreement can not be used to establish slatkin intent regarding the transactions slatkin had with the johnsons.the johnsons further argue that evidence they tax an issue of fact precluding summary judgment on the issue of intent.we reject both of these arguments and hold that the plea agreement preclusively establishes that slatkin transfers of purported profits to investors during his operation of the ponzi scheme were made with the actual intent to defraud.
slatkin actual intent to defraud is established by his admissions in his plea agreement.
slatkin admitted in his plea agreement that from to may,he used the bulk of investor funds to operate a massive ponzi scheme whereby he defrauded his investors by paying them returns largely with funds raised from other investors planned and executed a scheme to defraud approximately investors of over million did not invest the vast majority of investor funds he received during this time but instead disbursed those funds to other investors as fraudulent returns,diverted funds for his own personal benefit,and dissipated funds on many speculative,undisclosed,and ultimately unprofitable investments used newly invested funds from some investors to pay other investors because his investments did not generate sufficient income to meet investors periodic requests for payments and sent false and fabricated account statements to investors.
we previously have found the mere existence of a ponzi scheme sufficient to establish the actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors under a and california civil code a,or another state equivalent fraudulent transfer statute.see barclay mackenzie in re afi holding,wl,at cir.april,examining a and cal.a hayes palm seedlings in re agric.research tech.group,cir examining a and hawaii uniform fraudulent transfer act see also plotkin metro honda in re cohen,cir.bap examining a and.a.we now hold that a debtor admission,through guilty pleas and a plea agreement admissible under the federal rules of evidence,that he operated a ponzi scheme with the actual intent to defraud his creditors conclusively establishes the debtor fraudulent intent under a a and california civil code a,and precludes relitigation of that issue.see floyd dunson in re ramirez rodriguez,t he criminal conviction of rodriguez based on the debtors operation of a ponzi scheme conclusively establishes fraudulent intent,and precludes the defendant from relitigating this issue.martino edison worldwide capital in re randy,holding that debtor actual intent to defraud investors was preclusively established by the jury verdict against him in a criminal proceeding emerson maples in re mark benskin,the debtors intent to defraud creditors was established by the guilty pleas to the related criminal charges and preclusive effect may be given to those guilty pleas as factual findings to the extent that the debtors intent to defraud creditors is required in this adversary proceeding.
b.the plea agreement provides a sufficient factual basis to support the bankruptcy court finding that the conveyances to the johnsons were fraudulent.
the johnsons argue that the plea agreement does not provide a sufficient factual basis to support a determination that slatkin transfers to them were fraudulent.the johnsons claim that the trustee must demonstrate the source of each of the transfers to them and demonstrate that the source of those transfers was not legitimate.we disagree.we hold that once the existence of a ponzi scheme is established,payments received by investors as purported,funds transferred to the investor that exceed that investor initial investment are deemed to be fraudulent transfers as a matter of law.
although this circuit has not yet addressed this issue,the seventh circuit has,in a decision authored by judge posner.see scholes.
in scholes,as in the present case,the debtor masterminded a ponzi scheme.id.at.the debtor in scholes operated a ponzi scheme for a period of approximately two years and defrauded investors of approximately million.id.he pled guilty to fraud in a criminal proceeding and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.see id.
a receiver was appointed to attempt to recover certain funds transferred by the debtor to investors.id.one of the individuals from whom the receiver attempted to recover funds was phillips,who was in a position similar to the was one of the investors in the ponzi scheme who was lucky enough to make money.id.at.the seventh circuit held that the payments phillips received from the debtor representing profits,funds transferred to phillips by the debtor that exceeded phillips initial investment,were fraudulent conveyances that phillips was not entitled to keep.id.at.
as the court explained,the source of the profits received by phillips was a theft by the debtor from other investors.id.at.
it is no answer that some or for that matter all of phillips profit may have come from legitimate trades made by the debtor.they were not legitimate.the money used for the trades came from investors gulled by fraudulent representations.phillips was one of those investors,and it may seem only fair that he should be entitled to the profits on trades made with his money.that would be true as between him and the debtor.it is not true as between him and either the creditors or the other investors phillips should not be permitted to benefit from a fraud at their expense merely because he was not himself to blame for the fraud.all he is being asked to do is to return the net profits of his difference between what he put in at the beginning and what he had at the end.
id.at see cunningham brown.holding,in what has been referred to as the original ponzi scheme case,that under circumstances involving multiple victims and commingled funds,tracing should not be utilized and that,instead,equity demands that all victims of the fraud be treated equally.
in the present case,the source of any profits received by the johnsons was a theft from the other investors.see scholes,at.although the johnsons argue that there is a question of fact as to whether the purported profits they received were from legitimate investments made by slatkin,in truth none of the trades made by slatkin were legitimate because the money used for the trades came from investors gulled by slatkin fraudulent representations.see id.
all the johnsons are being asked to do is return the purported profits on their investment.see id.at.this will prevent the injustice that would result if the johnsons were allowed to retain their purported profit at the expense of other defrauded investors.see id.at see also cunningham,at.
c.the tax return does not raise a genuine issue of material fact.
the johnsons argue that slatkin tax lists taxable income of tax liability of payments made of and capital gains attributed to various investors,including the a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of whether slatkin operated a ponzi scheme from through.we disagree.
as discussed above,slatkin guilty plea and plea agreement conclusively establish that he operated a ponzi scheme from through with the intent to defraud his creditors and the transfers to the johnsons of purported profits on their investment are therefore deemed fraudulent as a matter of law.
the mere fact that slatkin reported income to the internal revenue service and delineated capital gains for certain investors is not inconsistent with his operation of a massive ponzi scheme.further,that slatkin may have invested a small percentage of the funds he received from investors,and may have received a profit from such investments,does not create a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual existence of the ponzi scheme.
d.the bankruptcy court properly determined that slatkin was not a stockbroker under the bankruptcy code.
the johnsons next argue that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of whether slatkin was a stockbroker under the bankruptcy code.the question of whether slatkin was a stockbroker is significant because the trustee is prohibited from avoiding settlement or margin payments made by stockbrokers.see e.
to be a stockbroker under the bankruptcy code,an individual has to have a customer as defined in,and be engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities i for the account of others or ii with members of the general public,from or for such person own account.we hold that although slatkin had customers,he was not engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities,and was not,therefore a stockbroker.
slatkin had customers.
a customer includes an entity that has a claim against a person arising out of a deposit of cash,a security,or other property with such person for the purpose of purchasing or selling a security.b ii.the johnsons,like slatkin other investors,deposited funds with slatkin for the purpose of having him purchase securities with those funds.the johnsons were therefore customers of slatkin.see b ii wesbanco bank barnesville rafoth in re baker getty fin,cir in re baker getty holding that defrauded investors who deposited funds with the debtor for the purpose of having the debtor purchase securities were customers of the debtor wider wootton,cir holding that a debtor clients were not customers where the clients did not provide the debtor with a reservoir of cash from which to purchase securities,but instead paid the debtor only after the debtor had purchased the securities.
the trustee does not contest that the johnsons fall within the plain language of customer under b ii.the trustee argues,however,that an requirement should be read into the definition of customer under b ii.the trustee reasons that because the definition of customer under a includes an requirement,congress clearly intended to include that same requirement in the b definition of customer.the trustee further argues that b definition of customer does not make sense unless it includes an requirement.we disagree.
the text of b,combined with the legislative history,makes clear,that the definition of customer turns not on the status or intent of the debtor,but instead on the purpose of the investor.see in re baker getty,at citing,reprinted in.an investor qualifies as a customer under b ii when the investor deposits money or securities with the debtor with the expectation that the debtor purchase stock or trade securities.id.it is the act of entrusting the cash to the debtor for the purpose of effecting securities transactions that triggers the customer status provisions.whether the debtor plans to purchase securities with the funds or defraud investors is irrelevant.id.citations,quotations,and alterations omitted.
slatkin was not engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities.
to be a stockbroker,slatkin not only must have had customers,he also must have engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities.b.to determine whether slatkin was engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities,we begin by giving this language its ordinary and plain meaning.see salazar mcdonald in re frank salazar,cir.if the language is clear and unambiguous,we look no further when we seek to ascertain its meaning.see id.
the operative term of the language engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities is effecting.see in re baker getty,at.effect is commonly understood to mean t hat which is produced by an agent or cause a result,outcome,or consequence or t o bring about to make happen.black law dictionary ed.applying this common meaning of the term effect,the relevant question is whether slatkin was in the business of making securities transactions happen.see in re baker getty,at.we hold that he was not.
it is undisputed that slatkin was not a licensed stockbroker.it also is undisputed that,to the extent he did buy securities with investor funds,he did so by contacting a stockbroker who,in turn,would effect or make the requested trade in securities happen.further,slatkin purchased and held the securities
