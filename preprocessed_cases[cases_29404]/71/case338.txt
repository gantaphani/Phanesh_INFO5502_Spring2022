this case requires us to examine one circumstance in which an accountant may incur primary liability for securities fraud.david overton and jerome kransdorf filed this action against todman,cpas todman,and its successor in interest,trien,rosenberg,rosenberg,weinberg,ciullo fazzari,llp,asserting a fraud claim under b of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission rule,and related state law claims.in a brief memorandum order,the district court for the southern district of new york dismissed the federal claim with prejudice for failure to plead a viable theory of primary liability and,as a result,dismissed the state law claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the precise issue on appeal is whether an auditor may incur primary liability under b and rule when the auditor provides a certified opinion that is false or misleading when issued,subsequently learns or was reckless in not learning that the earlier statement was false or misleading,knows or should know that potential investors are relying on the opinion,yet fails to take reasonable steps to correct or withdraw its opinion the underlying financial statements.we hold that under such circumstances,an auditor becomes primarily liable for securities fraud,assuming all the other elements of a securities fraud claim are present.since the complaint pleads precisely this theory of liability,we vacate the district court dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
todman flawed audits and subsequent failure to correct its certified opinion 
for the purposes of a motion to dismiss,we take the following facts from the complaint and presume their truth.from through,todman audited the financial statements of direct brokerage,dbi,a registered with the securities and exchange commission sec and a member firm of the new york stock exchange nyse.each year,todman issued its unqualified opinion that dbi financial statements accurately portrayed the company fiscal health.
specifically,in its certification of dbi financial statement,todman set forth that,in our opinion,the financial statements referred to above present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position of direct brokerage as of december,and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted auditing principles.as required by law,dbi filed its yearly financial statements,along with todman certified opinions,with the sec and nyse.
despite its certifications of accuracy,todman made significant errors that concealed dbi largest liability.in,payroll taxes were dbi largest single line item its certified financial statements for that year reflect a payroll tax liability of.yet in,dbi statements inaccurately reflected a payroll tax liability of zero.todman work papers show no explanation for the wholesale and erroneous disappearance of that line item.in its audit,todman perpetuated its error by again inaccurately recording dbi payroll tax liability.moreover,todman failed to uncover these errors in either its or audits.
plaintiffs allege several facts in support of their assertion that todman recklessly audited dbi affairs and recklessly evaluated whether dbi could survive as an ongoing concern.as a general matter,plaintiffs point out that because payroll taxes were dbi largest line item,the nature and size of the financial misstatements relative to dbi size demonstrates a complete reckless disregard in accurately stating the true financial position of dbi.
more particularly,plaintiffs allege that todman ignored five red flags that cast serious doubt on the accuracy of dbi financial statements.first,in a todman auditor noted a large payroll tax payable at the end of the year and noted that such an amount necessitated further analysis to determine if the liability was understated,but no analysis was ever done.second,todman knew that dbi paid no payroll tax after june of even though plainly people were working and payroll taxes were due,but did not investigate this apparent anomaly.third,todman knew that dbi payroll taxes dropped from to zero between and,but never investigated this large discrepancy.fourth,todman knew that dbi employee compensation rose significantly in while dbi payroll tax liabilities fell precipitously,but did not investigate the divergence.fifth,todman knew that this diverging trend continued in,but again failed to investigate.
the errors in dbi financial statements ultimately came to light in early.in february,the new york state division of taxation subpoenaed dbi payroll records.when dbi thereafter appeared before the division of taxation,it was determined that the company had not filed or paid its payroll taxes for or.dbi later began its own internal investigation that revealed that its former cfo failed to record the payroll tax liabilities on the company books.
in addition to its internal investigation,dbi retained the forensic accounting firm integrated management solutions to evaluate todman audits.over several months,a representative of integrated reviewed todman work and interviewed several todman employees.the integrated representative concluded that todman audits were deficient and lacking in many respects,specifically,that if todman had properly reviewed dbi payroll tax liabilities,it would have been apparent that todman should have delved deeper into the materials that were available to them or should have made further inquiry of dbi employees in a manner sufficient to learn that there were serious problems with the handling of payroll issues.
these events left dbi in precarious financial position by june of.its unrecorded liabilities amounted to more than million in unpaid taxes,interest,and penalties.in addition to the liabilities,dbi needed approximately in immediate capital to meet the sec and nyse capitalization requirements.the company also required further infusions of capital going forward.
based on the above facts,plaintiffs allege that todman became aware of each of the events relating to the discovery of dbi undisclosed liability and dbi concomitant need for additional capital,at or about the time each event occurred.todman also knew of dbi efforts to secure new capital,and that dbi financial statements would be provided to potential investors.yet todman never took any steps to withdraw its certification or clean opinion,and never issued any kind of directive or instruction to dbi not to disclose the financial statements.
in,dbi officers and directors infused roughly into the company.in order to satisfy the remaining obligations,however,they turned to outside investors.overton was among those solicited to invest in dbi.in connection with the investment solicitation,overton received dbi audited and certified financial statements.overton relied principally on the audited financial statements certified by todman and issued under cover of todman clean opinion,and took todman opinion to represent a seal of approval regarding dbi financial affairs.
overton agreed to invest a substantial sum.in january of,he entered into a stock purchase agreement and subordinated loan agreement with dbi,by which overton invested into dbi and loaned to dbi.three months later,dbi collapsed under the weight of its liabilities,defaulted the loan,and ceased operations when the nyse summarily suspended it.
ii.the district court decision 
plaintiffs filed suit in the southern district of new york,alleging six claims.the only claim relevant here,count i,alleges that by failing to correct its certified opinion under the circumstances described above,todman made a materially misleading misrepresentation and omission under b of the securities exchange act of and rule,and thereby damaged overton.in connection with this claim,overton did not plead or rely on todman alleged recklessness in initially conducting its audit todman initial recklessness was alleged only in connection with the state law claims.defendants moved to dismiss count i pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
after hearing oral argument,the district court granted the motion and dismissed the claim with prejudice.the reason that overton securities fraud claim failed,according to the district court,was that todman failure to correct its certified opinion simply was not actionable under the federal securities laws.the district court conceded that in wright ernst young llp,cir,we set forth that a ccounting firms do have a duty to take reasonable steps to correct misstatements they have discovered in previous financial statements on which they know the public is relying.nevertheless,for three reasons the district court concluded that this passage did not adequately support plaintiffs theory of liability.
first,the district court characterized that passage as dicta.second,the district court concluded that the passage was no longer good law.in so concluding,the district court noted that wright took the above quotation from a section of iit cornfeld,cir,in which we analyzed a claim of accountant aiding and abetting liability.the district court then noted that after we decided cornfeld,the supreme court held in central bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d,that b does not authorize aiding and abetting liability.from this sequence,the district court reasoned that pursuant to cornfeld,an accountant failure to correct its certified opinion may support only aiding and abetting liability,pursuant to central bank there can be no such liability,and therefore,an accountant failure to correct its certified opinion does not trigger liability at all.the district court did not discuss the fact that we decided wright after,and in light of,central bank.third,the district court noted that dbi was a corporation whose stock was not traded on a public exchange,and,we assume,concluded that the securities laws applied with rigor,or not at all.
after dismissing count i on the sole ground that plaintiffs failed to plead a viable theory of primary liability,the district court did not address whether the complaint adequately pled any other elements of a rule claim.

ii.the duty to correct 
a fundamental principle of securities law is that before an individual becomes liable for his silence,he must have an underlying duty to speak.chiarella united states,d.in a line of cases beginning with iit cornfeld,cir,we have alluded to one such duty to speak an accountant duty,in certain circumstances,to correct its certified opinion.despite our prior statements on the subject,we have not until today squarely held that such a duty exists,and that its violation gives rise to primary liability under the securities laws.
in cornfeld,we considered whether an auditor could be liable as an aider and abettor for failing to disclose the existence of a raiding conspiracy between a mutual fund and a complex of companies.the auditor had issued certified financial statements for the fund.unsurprisingly,those statements did not divulge the existence of the conspiracy.plaintiffs sued on the theory that the auditor,having certified the financial statements,was under a duty to disclose such information as it became known,and that the violation of that duty rendered the accountant liable as an aider and abettor to securities fraud.
we recognized that a ccountants do have a duty to take reasonable steps to correct misstatements they have discovered in previous certified financial statements on which they know the public is relying.id.at.however,we limited this duty to only those statements that the accountant actually prepared and certified.id.since the information that the plaintiffs claimed the accountant should have not a correction of anything in the certified statements,the auditor had no duty to disclose it,and the claim was dismissed.id.because the plaintiff had charged the accountant as an aider and abettor only,we had no opportunity or reason to consider whether primary liability could arise from a violation of the duty to correct,and did not reach that issue.id.at noting that the complaint pleaded only an aiding and abetting violation against the auditor.
fourteen years later,in central bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d,the supreme court held that b does not authorize aiding and abetting liability.in order to be liable under b,the court held,an actor must himself mak e a material misstatement or omission or commi t a manipulative act.id.at.the rationale underpinning this holding was that by its terms,b requires the making of a statement or omission and without such a statement or omission,the critical element of reliance would be absent.id.at.
although the court did not specifically discuss an auditor duty to correct,it made clear that under its rule,secondary actors such as accountants may incur primary liability based on their omissions 
the absence of b aiding and abetting liability does not mean that secondary actors in the securities markets are always free from liability under the securities acts.any person or entity,including a lawyer,accountant,or bank,who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement or omission on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under,assuming all of the requirements for primary liability under rule are met.
shortly thereafter,in shapiro cantor,cir,we again addressed an accountant duty to correct a certified statement,this time within the context of a claim of primary liability.we also,for the first time,offered insight into the source of this duty.shapiro concerned a suit by a group of investors over a complex of sham limited partnerships.the investors claimed that the partnerships accountant was primarily liable for securities fraud because it had provided financial projections circulated in the partnerships offering memoranda without disclosing that one of the principals was a convicted felon and his son was the sole officer,director,and shareholder of a managing entity.
we held that the complaint failed to state a claim predicated on the accountant omissions.we reasoned that a duty to disclose arises only when one party has information that the other party is entitled to know because of a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence between them.id.at quoting chiarella,at.alterations incorporated.we recognized that when an accountant issues a certified opinion,it creates the required special relationship with the investing public 
the concept of a duty to disclose appears to stem from the extent of reliance on the accountant work made by the public and the expectations of the public.clearly,in a situation in which the accountant gives an opinion or certifies statements about a which the accountant later discovers may not have been accurate then the accountant has a duty to disclose the fraud to the public conversely,if an accountant does not issue a public opinion about a company,although it may have conducted internal audits or reviews for portions of the company,the accountant can not subsequently be held responsible for the company public statements issued later merely because the accountant may know those statements are likely untrue.

apart from issuing a certified opinion,we noted one other way in which an accountant creates a duty t
