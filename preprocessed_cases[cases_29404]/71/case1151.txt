the outcome of this appeal from a disciplinary action involving a registered securities representative rests in large part on the standard of review.the national association of securities dealers found violations of its rules of fair practice regarding unsuitable switches in mutual fund investments and imposed a disciplinary sanction on a registered securities representative.the securities and exchange commission independently reviewed the record,upheld the finding of violations,and modified the sanction.after a review process,the scope of our review is limited.we affirm the securities and exchange commission because substantial evidence supports the findings and the sanction is not unwarranted in law or without justification in fact.sartain sec,cir quoting american power light sec.
background 
a.the transactions 
kenneth krull became a registered securities representative in.at the time of the transactions at issue,krull was a general securities principal,branch manager,and sole registered representative in the marysville,washington office of investment management and research.investment management is a member firm of the national association of securities dealers,nasd.
from november through july,krull repeatedly switched eight customers,holding ten accounts,in and out of a series of common stock mutual funds.with one exception,these funds were loaded that is,they charged a transaction fee at the time of purchase.the remaining fund was subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if sold within a holding period.krull recommended all of the more than one hundred transactions in question to customers who invariably heeded his advice.customers held the mutual funds on average for just over ten months.although the customers consented to each transaction by signing a switch form,krull failed to follow company policy to keep such activity to a minimum,to execute mutual fund trades only at the shareholder request,and to submit switch forms to the home office for review.
krull recommendations in the franklin rising dividends fund franklin fund,a common stock fund with an income and growth objective,are illustrative of what the securities and exchange commission commission or sec labeled a clear pattern of excessive trading between june and october,all eight customers purchased franklin fund shares on krull recommendation.krull recommended the fund because of its morningstar rating superior performance,management disciplined approach,and the protection offered in the shaky economy.krull enthusiasm for the fund was and somewhat inconsistent.soon after recommending purchase of this fund,krull began switching customers out of the fund and,between december and june,seven of the eight customers sold their franklin fund shares.in december,when other customers were selling their shares on krull advice,krull recommended to one customer that he purchase this very same mutual fund and then in february and april switched this same customer out of the franklin fund and into funds outside the franklin family of funds.as it turns out,switches within the franklin family incurred no sales charge,and yet krull offered no explanation why other franklin family funds were not suitable investments.nor did he explain the rationale for the quick switches in light of his strong buy recommendation.and when queried about the customer who was buying franklin when krull was recommending a sell to other clients,he conceded that,looking back on it,it does make any sense.
krull followed this same pattern of switching in other growth fund,franklin growth fund,idex fund,templeton world fund,sogen international fund,and others.although all of his customers ultimately profited from these transactions in absolute terms,six of the eight collectively earned less by following krull recommendations than they would have by holding their initial fund investments.krull,however,earned more than in commissions on the switches.
b.the structure of the disciplinary process 
the disciplinary review process for a securities representative involves multiple levels of entities.here the process began with the district business conduct committee dbcc of the nasd and culminated in the sec order that is on direct appeal to this court.
established pursuant to the maloney act amendments to the securities exchange act of,the nasd is a nonprofit corporation registered with the commission as a national securities association.see maloney act,stat,et,amending the securities exchange act of,et see generally austin municipal,nasd,cir.
the nasd is required to promulgate rules to protect investors and the public interest,b,and to enforce these rules through disciplinary proceedings and sanctions,b,h,g.the commission approves proposed nasd rules,such as the rules of fair practice now known as conduct rules.b,b.
at the time of this proceeding,the dbcc and the national business conduct committee nbcc were a part of the nasd regulatory arm,or nasd regulation.nasd.the regulatory and disciplinary process was restructured after krull case was filed.see order exchange act release,wl,at,approving proposed rule changes whereby dbcc and nbcc were restructured.the members of these committees were brokers and dealers within the securities community,thus assuring the collective business experience of securities professionals in each disciplinary decision.see hamilton bohner,wl,at see also order,wl,at.
under this disciplinary regime,the dbcc makes the first determination as to a member alleged misconduct.nasd manual et.the dbcc decisions are reviewable by the nbcc on its own motion or upon application of an aggrieved party.id.at et.the final stop in the administrative process is review of the nbcc decision,essentially the final nasd ruling,by the commission.d,e.although the commission reviews the record de novo,its review of the sanction is sanction may be modified or canceled only if it is excessive or oppressive.e hateley sec,cir sartain,at.
disciplinary proceedings against krull 
after a hearing,the dbcc found that krull had violated the rules of fair practice by recommending purchases and sales of mutual fund shares without reasonable grounds to believe such transactions were suitable for his customers.a total of transactions,or switches,were deemed unreasonable,in part because of nasd presumption that trading in mutual funds is improper.the dbcc imposed a fine of and a suspension.no restitution was ordered.
although krull did not appeal the dbcc decision,the nbcc called for review as permitted under the nasd code of procedure.nasd manual a.upon reviewing the dbcc decision,the nbcc remanded the matter for reconsideration of the sanctions,instructing the dbcc to consider the rationale regarding the sanctions,including the issue of restitution.on remand,the dbcc reduced the fine to,reaffirmed the suspension,and ordered disgorgement of the amount of commissions received as a result of the switching activity 
krull appealed.after oral argument and a de novo review of the record,the nbcc affirmed the findings of unsuitability as to transactions.the nbcc imposed a fine and,in lieu of disgorgement,restitution to the customers in the amount of krull commissions modified and reduced from because of the reduced number of improper switches found.the nbcc also increased the censure period,ordering a suspension due to the egregious nature of krull violative conduct.
krull appealed again,this time to the commission,which,after an independent review of the record,confirmed the unsuitability of krull mutual fund recommendations and sustained the finding of violation of the rules of fair practice.the commission did,however,modify the sanction by reducing the restitution.the parties stipulated that two of the eight customers made more through the switching than they would have through a buy and hold strategy.the commission then ordered restitution of to the remaining six customers representing the amount they would have earned had they held their initial investments without switches.the suspension and fine were affirmed.this petition for review of the sec order followed.
