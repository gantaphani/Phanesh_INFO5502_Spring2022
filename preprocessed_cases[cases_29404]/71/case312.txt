this appeal arises out of the consolidation of the member regulation operations of the national association of securities dealers nasd and the new york stock exchange group,nyse the appeal presents the unusual situation of a case,dismissed for lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies,in which the appellant,standard investment chartered,standard contends that the required exhaustion was concluded before argument of the appeal.the appeal is taken from the may,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york shirley wohl kram,district judge.see standard investment chartered,nasd et,wl may.the appellees are nasd,three of its officers,and nyse.
the appellant wants us to reverse so that the case may be returned to the district court.the appellees want us to affirm the dismissal,a result that would also leave the case available for return to the district court.under these circumstances,we conclude that the controversy as to the appeal,though not as to the case,has been eliminated,and we therefore dismiss the appeal as moot,without prejudice to the right of any party to pursue any issues sought to be raised on this appeal in the event of a subsequent appeal from a final judgment of the district court.
background 
the parties and their functions.standard is a california corporation and a member of nasd.nasd is a delaware corporation,registered with the securities and exchange commission sec as a national securities association pursuant to the maloney act amendments to the securities exchange act of exchange act,a.nyse is also a delaware corporation,registered with the sec as a national securities exchange.see id.both entities are organizations sros within the meaning of the exchange act.see id.a.nyse exercises its regulatory functions through its subsidiary nyse regulation,nyse regulation.as sros,the nasd and nyse have a duty to promulgate and enforce rules governing the conduct of their members,under the oversight of the sec.barbara new york stock exchange,cir see also new york stock exchange,cir.this court has recognized that the nasd serves as a critical aid to the sec in implementing and effectuating compliance with the securities laws.dl capital group,llc nasdaq stock market,cir.
the exchange act grants the sec broad oversight of sros promulgation and enforcement of rules.see id.an sro rules are broadly defined as including the organization constitution,articles of incorporation,bylaws,and rules.see a.an sro proposed rules,and any proposed rule changes,must be filed with the sec.see id.b.with few exceptions not relevant here,an sro can not change its rules,including its bylaws,without the sec approval.see id.
under the exchange act,the sec shall approve a proposed rule change of a organization if it finds that such proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the exchange act,and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization.b.in addition,the exchange act authorizes the sec to abrogate,add to,and delete from the rules of a organization as the commission deems necessary or appropriate to conform its rules to requirements of the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization,or otherwise in furtherance of the purpose of this chapter.id.c.
the consolidation.in november,nasd and nyse announced a plan to consolidate the member regulation operations of nasd and nyse regulation into a combined organization.the regulatory organization created by the consolidation,known as finra,would become the sole provider of member firm regulation and enforcement.to accommodate the consolidation,nasd board of governors proposed a set of amendments to nasd bylaws that would modify nasd governance structure to be compatible with that of the nyse 
nasd called a special meeting of its members to vote on the bylaw amendments,permitting members to vote by proxy.the proxy statement explained that nasd members were being asked to vote only on the bylaw amendments,not the transaction itself.the proxy statement described certain aspects of the proposed transaction in addition to the governance changes.in particular,it explained that nasd anticipated substantial cost savings from the consolidation of regulatory functions and proposed to share these saving with members in two ways.first,upon closing,nasd would make a payment to each nasd member of.second,for the next five years,nasd would discount all members annual dues,subject to annual board approval.the proxy statement asserted that a larger payment than is not possible because nasd is a organization and therefore is limited by tax laws regarding size and source of payments it can make to its members.the special member payment of per nasd member,or approximately million in the aggregate,will be funded therefore limited expected value of the incremental cash flows that will be produced by the consolidation transaction.in january,the bylaw amendments were approved by a majority of voting members.
the lawsuit.in march,standard filed the instant lawsuit on behalf of the putative class of nasd members that are not also nyse members.the complaint alleged that the terms of the proposed consolidation represent a massively unfair disenfranchisement of nasd members,in both governance and financial terms.the complaint pleaded three claims the nasd officers breached their fiduciary duties to the proposed class in negotiating the consolidation and failing to disclose all material facts in the proxy statement the defendants engaged in negligent misrepresentation with respect to the proxy statement and the nyse and individual defendants would be unjustly enriched by the consolidation.
the moved to dismiss standard complaint pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of standard failure to exhaust administrative remedies or,in the alternative,pursuant to rule b because nasd absolute regulatory immunity barred standard claim for damages and because standard failed to state a claim.
standard filed an amended complaint in response to the first motion to dismiss.the amended complaint emphasized that standard was not challenging the wisdom of the consolidation,but only the manner of accomplishing it.in addition to the original three claims,the amended complaint alleged a denial of state law rights under delaware corporate law,conversion,substantial diminution of value in membership,and deprivation of voting membership.standard sought declaratory relief,an injunction prohibiting the consolidation,an order that the nasd prepare a new proxy statement and hold a new vote,compensatory and punitive damages,and an accounting,among other prayers for relief.
the again filed a motion to dismiss standard claims based on their jurisdictional and immunity defenses.while briefing was underway,standard sought and obtained expedited discovery from all defendants.standard obtained communications between nasd and the internal revenue service irs regarding nasd status and the special member payment.
in may,the district court granted the motion to dismiss standard amended complaint on the ground that it failed to establish subject matter jurisdiction under rule b.standard investment,wl,at.the court held that because the proposed bylaw amendments necessary for the consolidation consummation were an exercise of the nasd authority,standard was required to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by the exchange act and failed to do so.the court also ruled that standard damages claims could not proceed because they were based entirely on a future c onsolidation consummation.id.at.the court did not reach the absolute immunity defense.
standard then filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court ruling.its motion included two new arguments,first that nasd members were entitled to a control premium based on the adoption of the bylaw amendments,and second that under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction the dismissal should be changed to a stay pending sec proceedings.the district court denied the plaintiff motion for reconsideration.standard investment chartered,nasd et,wl july.the court stated that the control premium claim d id not affect the court exhaustion analysis,and that the request for a stay was untimely raised.id.at.
standard filed in this court an appeal of the district court judgment and the order denying reconsideration.
sec proceeding.in march,shortly after standard filed its original complaint,nasd filed with the sec a proposed rule change to amend its bylaws.pursuant to the exchange act,the sec published the proposed bylaw amendments in the federal register to solicit comments.see b.after dismissal of the lawsuit,standard submitted comments to the sec,attached the proxy statement,and urged the sec to request and review the communications produced in expedited discovery.in response to the comments,the sec requested that nasd provide additional information about the disclosures regarding the payment but did not request the communications with the irs.nasd submitted a purported explanation for its statement that a larger payment than is not possible,including a letter from nasd general counsel,a letter from expert tax counsel,and a letter from delaware counsel.
in july,the sec approved the proposed rule change in a lengthy release,thereby approving the nasd bylaw amendments.see order approving proposed rule change to amend the of nasd,exchange act release july,sec release,available at.the sec release expressly considered standard comment that the focus of the proxy statement was the fundamental change in members voting rights and the that each member is to receive in exchange for surrendering members equity valued at as much as,or more,per nasd member.id.at quoting letter from benchmark financial services,and standard letter.the release noted that standard had alleged an inconsistency between the statements in the proxy statement and the statements in the nasd response letter regarding the payment,and had also alleged that t he sec can not approve the payment without determining whether the statements with respect to the proxy statement were truthful and complete.id.quoting letter.
the sec stated,however,that it had reviewed standard claims only to the extent necessary to make a finding that nasd proxy approval process was consistent with the exchange act requirement that sros comply with their bylaws and certificates of incorporation.as the sec release explained,the sec does not ordinarily consider w hether an sro failed to complete all action required to be taken under its constitution,articles of incorporation,bylaws,rules,or similar instruments at the time it considers whether to approve a proposed rule change.id.if such a dispute arises,the sec general practice is to ask the sro to supplement the proposed rule change to address issues raised by commenters.id.the sec explained that it had followed this practice with respect to standard comment and requested that nasd provide additional information about the disclosures regarding the payment noted in the proxy statement.id.
after describing all the information provided by nasd about the payment,the sec stated in the following language what it had done with respect to consideration of standard claims 
the commission ordinarily does not make determinations regarding state law issues but,when required to do so because state law necessarily informs its findings under the exchange act,it relies on the conclusions of experts or other authorities with respect to the adequacy of the proxy statement,the commission has considered the nasd explanation regarding the proxy statement representation about the payment.the commission believes that nasd has made a prima facie showing that these representations were not misleading and that nasd explanation is uncontradicted by the commenters submissions regarding this matter.accordingly,after reviewing the record in this matter,the commission believes that nasd has provided a sufficient basis on which the commission can find that,under the exchange act,nasd complied with its certificate of incorporation and with respect to the proxy approval process and that the proposed amendments to its were properly approved by nasd members.
id.at emphases added.
on july,the consolidation of nasd and nyse was concluded.
the petition to review the sec order in the ninth circuit.standard filed a petition for review of the sec order in the ninth circuit,pursuant to a,and requested the court of appeals to modify the sec order to vacate its finding regarding the proxy statement.brief of pet r standard at,cir.standard argued to the ninth circuit that t here is no question that the order can stand without that finding.id.
the ninth circuit never reviewed the sec approval order.before the sec responsive brief was due in the ninth circuit,standard and the sec filed a joint motion in which the commission sought a remand of its order to allow the commission to clarify the order by making it clear that the order did not purport to reach a final and binding judgment on whether the nasd proxy statement was deceptive or misleading under state law.joint motion of parties at,standard investment chartered,sec,cir,joint motion the joint motion represented that t he commission would also add language to the order stating that,in adding clarifying language,the commission is not vacating,nullifying or rendering void the consolidation and that the consolidation remains in effect as of the original issuance date of the order,july.id.at.the ninth circuit granted the joint motion in april.
in may,the sec issued a release amending the sec approval order.see amended order approving proposed rule change to amend the of nasd,exchange act release may.june,available at.the sec release amending the approval order added a new paragraph immediately after the sentence that stated that the commission can find that,under the exchange act,nasd complied with its certificate of incorporation and with respect to the proxy approval process and that the proposed amendments to its were properly approved by nasd members.the new paragraph stated 
this finding as to nasd compliance and members approval is not a definitive adjudication under state law,such as a trial court would make after an evidentiary hearing,regarding the claim that the proxy statement was misleading.except to the extent that state law informs the commission finding that,as a federal matter under the exchange act,nasd complied with its certificate of incorporation and with respect to the proxy approval process and that the proposed amendments to its were properly approved by nasd members,the commission is not purporting to decide a question of state law.the commission does not intend that its determination regarding the nasd uncontradicted prima facie showing before the commission that the proxy statement was not misleading be binding on a court in a claim based on state law.
in june,the ninth circuit dismissed standard petition.
the parties return to this court.after the ninth circuit dismissal of standard petition,the parties in the pending appeal filed supplemental briefs in this court.standard contended that the sec amended order confirms that the sec has no authority to,and did not,consider standard state law claims.in response,nasd contended that standard had abandoned any possibility of exhausting its claims by voluntarily dismissing its petition to review the sec order.nyse contended that standard had waived the ability to demonstrate that its administrative remedies were inadequate.
discussion 
although the procedural developments preceding the argument of this appeal are complicated,the disposition at this point is not.both parties are in essence seeking from this court the same return of the case to the district court.standard seeks a reversal of the district court judgment and a remand to the district court.the appellees seek an affirmance of the district court judgment,but that disposition would also result in a return of the lawsuit to the district court.the district court dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.although the dismissal was not expressly stated to be without prejudice,a dismissal for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies should be without prejudice as we h
