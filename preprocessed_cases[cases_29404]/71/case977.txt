this case,involving robotic surgical devices,raises the question of how precise public statements of a company potential growth must be to comply with the protections of the securities laws.intuitive surgical,intuitive is a corporation that designs,manufactures,and markets da vinci surgical systems systems,robotic devices used for minimally invasive surgeries.the police retirement system of louis prs is a public pension fund that purchased shares of intuitive stock.
prs brought a class action suit against intuitive on behalf of purchasers of intuitive common stock,alleging violations of b and a of the securities exchange act of and securities and exchange commission sec rule.see b,a b.prs also named as defendants the following intuitive executives collectively,the individual defendants lonnie smith,the ceo and chairman of the board of directors gary guthart,the president and coo jerome mcnamara,the executive vice president of worldwide sales and marketing marshall mohr,the senior vice president and cfo aleks cukic,the vice president of business development and strategic planning and benjamin gong,the vice president of finance.
the complaint alleges that through its executives intuitive knowingly issued false and misleading statements regarding the company growth and financial health,which caused artificial inflation of the share price throughout the class period,from february,to january,resulting in losses to the class members.despite the nearly six hundred allegations contained in the over complaint,the company statements are,in large part,statements or garden variety corporate category is actionable under the securities laws.the complaint is also deficient in suggesting that the executives made false statements with knowing or reckless disregard for intuitive economic circumstances.although prs tries to paint a picture of intuitive affirmative misrepresentations,we conclude that after two amendments,the complaint does not meet the heightened pleading requirements under federal rule of civil procedure b and the private securities litigation reform act of pslra.
background and procedural history 
intuitive sells systems and instruments for robotic surgeries,specifically da vinci prostatectomy procedures dvp and da vinci hysterectomy procedures dvh.the sale of new and instruments system placement and of replacement instruments recurring revenue to hospitals generates intuitive revenue.revenue grew continuously from,when the systems were first introduced,to.for example,intuitive share price closed at in january and grew to by december.
the landscape changed significantly in the first quarter of when the share price fell to.shortly after intuitive announced these results,oppenheimer released a report the oppenheimer report,expressing the view,corroborated by other sources,that intuitive first quarter of share price was nowhere near enough to sustain its valuation and that system placement was decelerating.
stock prices and revenues continued to fall,and,by the end of the class period,the share price closed at.around this time,the board of directors adopted a severance plan providing for generous benefits to the individual defendants in the event of a change in control of the company.ultimately,intuitive disclosed that it was unable to sustain system placement growth,and revenue increased only,meeting the company guidance of growth,but falling slightly short of its expected growth for.
prs alleges that in the annual report filed with the sec and in four analyst calls in,intuitive knowingly or recklessly misrepresented the company financial situation.the report warned that an economic downturn may have significant impact on the ability of our customers to secure funding to buy our products or might cause purchasing decisions to be delayed,which may result in decreased revenues and also allow our competitors additional time to develop products that may have a competitive edge,making future sales of our products more difficult.the analyst calls also contained warnings that certain statements might be made and that a ctual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied,as a result of certain risks and uncertainties,such that investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.
relying on witness accounts,prs alleges that the individual defendants by virtue of their positions with the company,had access to adverse undisclosed information about the company business,operations,operational trends,financial statements,markets and present and future business prospects via internal corporate documents,conversations and connections with other corporate officers and employees,attendance at management and board of directors meetings and committees thereof,and via reports and other information provided to them in connection therewith.according to the witnesses,intuitive proprietary software tracked each use of the systems for each procedure down to the types of movements involved,and this information,was used to track all aspects of intuitive business in and to generate reports on intuitive business operations and business goals.prs also points to witness accounts that this software was accessible and thus available at all times to the individual defendants.one witness described the company management as,with the individual defendants play ing very active roles in running the operations.
based on the witness accounts,prs asserts that the individual defendants knew of or recklessly disregarded the falsity of certain public statements and disclosures because the proprietary software reflected a different situation.although the individual defendants publicly claimed that the company would remain in a growth position,prs alleges that the individual defendants knew or should have known that system placement was decreasing because of the economic downturn,market saturation,and sales and service trends,and that this decreased growth was evident from the reports to which the executives had access.
in addition to alleging false statements,prs claims that statements about increased revenue were misleading because intuitive did not disclose known trends,including the facts that revenue increased due to price increases for systems rather than higher system placement rates the economic crisis would continue to impact system placement negatively market saturation was also causing decreased system placement diminished system placement would impact recurring revenue and the number of dvp procedures,which generate the most revenue per procedure,was decelerating faster than disclosed and would result in decreased system placement that the growth in dvh procedures would not offset.these representations allegedly misled investors about the sustainability of system placement growth and r ecurring revenue growth.
prs also highlights other allegedly suspicious activity during the class period.the compensation of intuitive executives spiked.smith,guthart,mcnamara,and mohr made lucrative sales of intuitive stock allegedly based on insider information.finally,in march,three months following the end of the class period,the board of directors,led by smith,authorized a stock buy back,which was privately negotiated with the individual defendants.
after two amendments,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.
the adoption of the pslra in spurred a growing body of appellate precedent related to pleading requirements in securities suits.see,tellabs,makor issues rights,d in re verifone holdings.sec,cir.the pslra standards,though well known,require careful application in each case,particularly in evaluating dismissal under federal rules of civil procedure b and b.see tellabs,at.rule,which implements the provisions of section b of the securities exchange act,makes it unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.b.to state a claim for securities fraud,a complaint must allege a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant scienter a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission economic loss and loss causation.halliburton erica john fund,at,d,at,wl,at june,citations omitted.only the first and second elements material misrepresentations or omissions and scienter are at issue in this appeal.
in our de novo review of the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim,we accept as true all allegations of material fact and construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.parks sch.of,symington,cir.a fraud claim must satisfy both the pleading requirements of the pslra and the heightened pleading standard of rule b,which requires that the complaint state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.b see also reese malone,cir.the pslra also imposes more exacting pleading requirements including,among other things,that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind,b a.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.although we examine individual allegations in order to benchmark whether they are actionable,we consider the allegations collectively and examine the complaint as a whole.see tellabs,at.
material misstatements or omissions 
to meet the materiality requirement of rule,the complaint must allege facts sufficient to support the inference that there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d internal quotation marks omitted.the heart of prs allegations,which target misstatements made during various analyst calls,are not actionable because they are statements covered by the safe harbor provision of the pslra or mere corporate puffery.nor are the claimed omissions in the annual report actionable because they are not material.
safe harbor for forward looking statements 
the pslra safe harbor provision exempts,under certain circumstances,a statement,which is any statement regarding financial projections,plans and objectives of management for future operations,future economic performance,or the assumptions underlying or related to any of these issues.emp r teamster joint council pension trust fund am.holding,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the safe harbor applies if the statement is i identified as a statement,and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement,or ii if it is not identified as a statement and not accompanied by cautionary language,unless the statement was made with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.c see in re cutera sec,cir.
the alleged misstatements in analyst calls are classic growth and revenue projections,which are on their face.see id.at an earnings projection is by definition a statement.statements such as i nstrument and accessor ies revenues are expected to grow approximately over,we continue to expect dvp procedures to grow approximately,and we are now forecasting our system revenue to grow over,are illustrative examples of intuitive revenue projections.contrary to prs assertions,the statements are not misleading as to the effects and circumstances,of known trends on intuitive financial health they plainly project expectations for future growth.we adopt the district court analysis regarding these statements.
we also identify three additional statements,beyond those the district court identified,as falling within the safe harbor as with the other statements,these responses during the analyst calls relate to future economic performance or assumptions underlying those projections 
gynecology plays a bigger and bigger role each day g ynecology is a big player in that,and i think will continue to be and continue to expand.
so those procedures,gyn procedures you see that the addition of those procedures has required a lot of hospitals to get third and fourth systems.and we see that continuing.
you guys probably know more than we do.clearly it not a positive for anyone.we have seen a significant impact yet on system leasing.and that is all i can say i suspect that they may increase our leasing companies still have an appetite for these devices.
prs also argues that,in the case of mixed statements,the looking portions of statements are actionable.we need not resolve whether the safe harbor covers portions of statements because,examined as a whole,the challenged statements related to future expectations and performance.see cutera,at.only two statements plausibly fall in this category.in answer to a question about lower capital expenditures by hospitals,mohr stated at the present time,we do have any indicators that tell us that the case.but we early into this.this statement is properly classified as an assumption underlying or related to projections for lower hospital expenditures on systems.see emp r teamster joint council pension trust fund,at.similarly,when asked if anything in the external environment made the executives nervous about system purchases in the next twelve months,smith responded t here always a decision within a hospital of how do they prioritize their capital investment i think we come up typically fairly high on that priority list we are hear ing anything that causes us any significant concern no change from last quarter,i guess in context,this statement is properly understood as regarding smith expectations of the future impact of the external economic environment on intuitive.
next,prs challenges the warnings accompanying the statements as inadequate under c a i.the following disclaimer accompanied each of the statements 
before we begin,i would like to inform you that comments mentioned on today call may be deemed to contain statements.actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied,as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.these risks and uncertainties are described in detail in the company sec filings.prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements.
this cautionary language is virtually identical to the cautionary language approved in cutera t hese prepared remarks contain statements concerning future financial performance and guidance management may make additional statements in response to questions,and factors like cutera ability to continue increasing sales performance worldwide could cause variance in the results.at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.because the cautionary language was sufficient,the statements are exempt under the pslra safe harbor provision.
corporate puffery 
statements of mere corporate puffery,vague statements of optimism like good,or other feel good monikers,are not actionable because professional investors,and most amateur investors as well,know how to devalue the optimism of corporate executives.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.four of the challenged statements fall into this category.intuitive communicated optimism i that the opportunity for system placement at hospitals is still very,very large ii that there is potential for growth in the dvp market iii that the company is reservedly optimistic about sales and iv wishing it had a crystal ball,that intuitive will come out stronger and in a pretty good position despite the economic crisis.
according to prs,these pronouncements are objectively verifiable and thus qualify as material misstatements,not mere puffery.the statements are,however,the antithesis of facts.they represent the feel good speak that characterizes puffing.see id.in cutera,we detailed similar statements,noting that such optimistic,subjective assessment hardly amounts to a securities violation.see,id.n one of our employees is represented by a labor union,and we believe our employee rela
