this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant ziasun technologies,ziasun,on two consolidated actions filed by plaintiffs scott bowen and leif aa.fredsted together sometimes,plaintiffs,which alleged that they were defrauded by a pyramid or ponzi scheme orchestrated by foreign brokerage houses from which they purchased shares of stock.the court granted summary judgment in favor of ziasun,finding that there was no legal basis for or evidence to support plaintiffs claims against ziasun.
on appeal bowen and fredsted assert that the court erred in granting summary judgment when it found that plaintiffs claims brought under business professions code section had no application to the securities transactions at issue plaintiffs failed to provide any admissible evidence that ziasun made any misrepresentations to plaintiffs and that ziasun was not an offeror of securities no evidence supported plaintiffs conversion and conspiracy claims and plaintiffs were not entitled to a continuance of the hearing on the summary judgment motion to conduct further discovery.we conclude that the court did not err in granting summary judgment or in denying leave to conduct additional discovery and therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs allegations 
bowen is a resident of australia.fredsted is a resident of norway.ziasun is a publicly traded nevada corporation that formerly had its headquarters in san diego county.
in february bowen filed a complaint in the san diego superior court against ziasun and others bowen complaint alleged that ziasun,acting in concert with others,sold approximately of its stock and the stock of other publicly traded companies to bowen by making misstatements and omissions of material fact.bowen alleged that ziasun failed to disclose that it was using investors funds to perpetrate a pyramid or ponzi scheme and that ziasun stock had little or no market value.
specifically,bowen alleged that in,he was contacted by defendant frank robinson,who held himself out to be a senior consultant at amber securities corporation amber,now allegedly known as defendant world trade financial corporation world trade,who solicited him to invest in a company called titan motorcycles of america,titan.at that time bowen did not invest.
in june,robinson contacted him again,soliciting an investment in ziasun.robinson stated that amber had changed its name to capital assets,capital.based upon robinson solicitation,bowen purchased shares of ziasun stock.however,he was not told that the stock was restricted the funds he was investing would be used to finance criminal behavior,securities fraud,pornography,false corporate disclosures,and illegal business practices returns would be paid from new investors funds and there was little or no market for the stock.
thereafter,defendant robert mason contacted him and stated that he would now be handling his account on behalf of capitol,and solicited him to invest in several other companies.mason introduced him to a lynn briggs,who mason described as being a financial and investment consultant for capital.mason told bowen that briggs and capital had a close association with ziasun and other companies,including chequemate international,chequemate,loraca international,loraca,and,castpro.briggs touted ziasun and the other companies for investment.briggs told bowen that no investor had ever lost money with these companies because of capital close association and intimate knowledge of the companies being recommended.based upon the misrepresentations made by robinson,mason and briggs,bowen bought stock in ziasun,chequemate,loraca,castpro and novamed,novamed,at a total cost of.bowen alleged robinson,mason and briggs were acting as agents for the companies in which he invested,including ziasun.further,bowen alleged that their actions were taken at the direction of defendant bryant cragun,an alleged investment advisor and fundraiser for the companies bowen invested in,including ziasun.
the complaint stated causes of action for unfair,unlawful and deceptive business practices under section,common law fraud,securities fraud,injunctive relief,conversion and conspiracy.
in august fredsted filed an action in the san diego county superior court against ziasun,as well as other individuals and one corporation see fn,ante.similar to bowen complaint,fredsted alleged that ziasun,acting in concert with other individuals and entities,induced him to buy worth of stock by making misstatements and omissions of fact.however,fredsted did not allege that he ever purchased any ziasun stock.fredsted complaint mirrored bowen in its allegations of a pyramid or ponzi scheme and stated the same causes of action,with the exception of alleging contact with different individual agents who solicited his investment,and some different companies in which he invested.
fredsted complaint alleged that in january he was contacted by defendant richard swatman.swatman told him that he was a broker and portfolio advisor with capital and solicited his investment in chequemate.he purchased shares based upon the representations of swatman.
shortly after the initial purchase,he was advised of an increase in the price of chequemate and was solicited by swatman to purchase additional shares.after he agreed to buy the additional shares,swatman told him that the stock was restricted and could not be sold for one year.fredsted also alleged that he was not advised that funds invested by him would be used by the defendants to finance activities involving criminal behavior,securities fraud,pornography,false corporate disclosures,and illegal business practices returns on his investment would be made from new investors funds,a pyramid or ponzi scheme and that little or no market existed for the chequemate stock.
according to fredsted,shortly after he opened his account with capital defendant james howard contacted him and advised him that he would now be his account manger,and solicited him to invest in,castpro,ref and broadcast international broadcast.howard arranged a meeting between himself and briggs,who howard represented to be a consultant for capital and as having a close association with the companies being touted.at the meeting,briggs touted the stock of several companies and represented that he was closely affiliated with broadcast.between january and december,based upon the misrepresentations of swatman,howard and briggs,fredsted invested in the stock of broadcast,chequemate,ref,and castpro.fredsted further alleged that their actions were taken at the direction of defendant cragun,who allegedly was an investment advisor and fundraiser for the companies in which he invested,and ziasun as well.
the court thereafter consolidated bowen and fredsted actions.
summary judgment motion 
ziasun moving papers 
in july,ziasun brought a motion for summary judgment or,alternatively,for summary adjudication of issues.ziasun argued that the first through third causes of action brought under section were without merit because that statute did not apply to securities transactions.ziasun argued that the fourth cause of action for fraud failed as bowen and fredsted could not show any facts demonstrating that plaintiffs had purchased ziasun stock or that ziasun defrauded them.ziasun argued that the fifth cause of action for securities fraud was without merit because there were no facts showing that it violated the law on securities fraud and ziasun was not a seller or offeror of securities.ziasun asserted that the sixth cause of action for injunctive relief failed as there was no viable cause of action to support this remedy.ziasun asserted that the seventh cause of action for conversion was without merit as there was no identifiable sum of money that it was unlawfully interfering with.finally,ziasun argued that the eighth cause of action for conspiracy was without merit as there was no evidence that ziasun conspired with anyone else to commit any wrongdoing.
in support of the motions,ziasun submitted the declaration of scott elder,the of investools,the successor merger company of ziasun.according to elder,fredsted was never a shareholder of ziasun,and ziasun never had any direct dealings with either plaintiff.elder also stated that ziasun was never the parent company of and never exercised any control over that company.ziasun had no part in any alleged scheme against plaintiffs and,to elder knowledge,no ziasun employees ever engaged in any insider trading.according to elder,ziasun never converted anything belonging to plaintiffs and never directed any communication to plaintiffs.elder also denied that ziasun was engaged in any conspiracy with any other defendants to deprive plaintiffs of money or property.
according to elder,defendant cragun resigned from ziasun as a consultant in and never held a position with ziasun as an officer,director,agent or employee at the times relevant to the plaintiffs complaint.similarly,elder stated that briggs ceased his affiliation with and resigned from ziasun in,before the events alleged in plaintiffs complaint.elder also stated that none of the other defendants was ever an agent or employee of ziasun.
ziasun attached to its motion fredsted responses to ziasun requests for admissions,wherein fredsted stated that he lacked sufficient information or belief to admit or deny whether he had any facts supporting his allegations.ziasun also submitted both plaintiffs responses to interrogatories,wherein plaintiffs did not identify any facts supporting their allegations.
discovery dispute 
following the filing of plaintiffs complaint,ziasun obtained an order under code of civil procedure section requiring plaintiffs to each post a bond of within days to secure payment of costs to ziasun should it prevail,as a condition of allowing plaintiffs action to proceed plaintiffs were unable to post the bond within the days ordered by the court and ziasun brought a motion to dismiss the complaint.
in june,plaintiffs noticed a deposition for ziasun person most knowledgeable pmk.ziasun objected to the deposition notice on the basis that plaintiffs had not timely posted the bond ordered by the court and the action was therefore subject to dismissal and the deposition was overbroad,burdensome and harassing,seeking categories of issues for the pmk to testify about and categories of documents.ziasun did not appear at the deposition.
in july,plaintiffs brought an ex parte application to shorten time for an order compelling the deposition of ziasun pmk.the court denied plaintiffs motion without prejudice on the basis that ziasun motion to dismiss was pending.in july,the court denied ziasun motion to dismiss as the bonds had been posted,albeit in an untimely fashion.the court also thereafter granted ziasun ex parte application to continue the trial date to october.
in august,plaintiffs brought a second ex parte application for an order shortening time to bring a motion to compel the deposition of ziasun pmk.plaintiffs argued that they had noticed the deposition of ziasun pmk,but ziasun did not appear for the deposition and the deposition was necessary to oppose ziasun pending motion for summary judgment.the court took ziasun motion for summary judgment off calendar and ordered that each side was entitled to depose the parties and persons most knowledgeable.
on september,plaintiffs renoticed the deposition of ziasun pmk for september.however,on september,the court reset ziasun summary judgment motion for september,to be heard at the same time as the parties discovery disputes.
plaintiffs opposition 
in opposing ziasun motion,plaintiffs objected to the evidence submitted by ziasun argued that triable issues of fact existed precluding summary judgment and argued that the motion should be denied or continued to allow them to conduct further discovery.however,plaintiffs did not submit any legal authority disputing the legal basis for ziasun summary judgment motion.
in opposition to ziasun motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs submitted the declaration of their counsel,james shalvoy,their own declarations,and documentary evidence.shalvoy declaration referenced several items of documentary evidence submitted with plaintiffs opposition.first he identified excerpts from a deposition transcript in another case wherein a witness by the name of allen hardman,president of ziasun,testified that briggs worked for cragun in some unknown fashion.he also attached a copy of a lawsuit filed by cragun in which cragun stated that he had served as an investment adviser and fundraiser for ziasun,titan,chequemate,dynatec,loraca and bevex.shalvoy also attached a copy of a nevada certificate of corporate information showing that as of april cragun was president and briggs was secretary and treasurer of a company named applied technology consultants.shalvoy attached a nevada annual list of officers,directors and agents for ziasun,filed in april,wherein briggs name was crossed out as president of ziasun and the name tony tobin is handwritten in.hardman was listed as a director of ziasun.shalvoy attached a copy of a nevada annual list of officers,directors and agents for a company called best way,usa,showing briggs as president.
shalvoy also attached a copy of an article from the south china morning post,which alleged that ziasun,when it was known as momentum internet,ran businesses and was behind a stable of porn web sites and phone chat lines that promised bangkok babes and china dolls.shalvoy also attached a copy of a press release that stated that amber global limited,acting as agent for amber,was successfully prosecuted for dealing in securities while unregistered.shalvoy also detailed his attempts to take the deposition of the pmk for ziasun and requested that ziasun motion be denied because plaintiffs had been unable to conduct discovery necessary to oppose the motion.
fredsted declaration essentially mirrored his complaint,with a few items of documentary evidence attached.it detailed his interactions with swatman,howard and briggs,their representations to him,and their alleged improper activities concerning the stock in which he invested,and his purchase of stock in broadcast,chequemate,ref,and castpro,all as detailed above.fredsted also attached to his declaration business cards for briggs,showing him to be a managing director of the amber group and an investment relations officer for broadcast.he also attached a copy of an article from the wall street journal concerning,among other things,ziasun alleged activities.he attached a brochure he received from howard that stated that ziasun was the parent company of.he stated that his investments were now worthless.
bowen declaration also essentially mirrored his complaint,again,with a few additions.he related his contacts with robinson,mason and briggs,their solicitation of his investment in ziasun,chequemate,loraca,and castpro,and the alleged illegal and improper activities surrounding his stock that he purchased.he also detailed the purchase dates of his stock in ziasun and attached invoices for those stock purchases.he attached an correspondence he received describing the relationship between ziasun and.he stated that the investments he made were now worthless.
ziasun filed a reply to plaintiffs opposition,not only addressing plaintiffs opposition on the merits,but also filing written objections to much of plaintiffs evidence.
court ruling 
in september,the court granted ziasun motion for summary judgment by telephonic ruling.the court found that the first through third causes of action brought under section failed as a matter of law because section does not apply to securities transactions.the court found that the fourth cause of action for fraud did not have merit because plaintiffs had not produced evidence that they ever purchased shares of ziasun.the fifth cause of action for corporate securities fraud failed because plaintiffs could not show that ziasun violated the statute,was a seller or offeror of securities or made any misrepresentation to plaintiffs.the sixth cause of action for injunctive relief was found to have no merit because no specific identifiable sum of money was involved the eighth cause of action for conspiracy failed because plaintiffs could not show that ziasun participated in any concerted action,or that a common plan to commit tortious acts existed.the court also found that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate good cause for a continuance of the motion for summary judgment to conduct further discovery.
plaintiffs requested oral argument.at that hearing,the court addressed plaintiffs request for further discovery based upon their inability to proceed with the deposition of ziasun pmk.the court stated that its notes showed that as of the ex parte hearing on august it had given them the permission to go forward with the deposition of the person most knowledgeable for ziasun.counsel for ziasun argued that plaintiffs did not move forward with discovery on a timely basis,never made efforts to resolve the discovery dispute and did not try to set the deposition of ziasun pmk in a timely manner after the court gave it permission to take that deposition.the court took the matter under submission and thereafter confirmed its telephonic ruling.in doing so,the court specifically addressed plaintiffs request for further time to conduct discovery 
the court notes that at an ex parte on the court continued the trial date to october.at ex parte on each side sought a motion to compel discovery.the court set a global motion for september.the court stated each side was entitled to reasonably depose the parties and the persons most knowledgeable pmk.however,plaintiff s failed to ever accomplish this.
this appeal follows.

ii.analysis 
section claims 
bowen and fredsted assert that the court erred in finding that section does not apply to securities transactions.although this is a question of first impression in california,we find federal and authority persuasive on this issue and conclude that the court did not err in granting ziasun motion on this basis.
section provides in part u nfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising.section is known as california little ftc act,which mirrors its federal counterpart,the federal trade commission ftc act,united states code section et.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.historically,the ftc has not viewed the ftc act as reaching securities transactions.russell dean witter reynolds,russell the ftc has never undertaken to adjudicate deceptive conduct in the sale and purchase of securities.
further,federal cases some,admittedly unpublished have held that california section also does not apply to securities transactions.see dietrich bauer d,perera chiron wl shearson lehman brothers,greenberg transfer binder fed.sec.cch,wl,affd.shearson lehman brothers greenberg cir,wl cal.bus.is inapplicable to securities transactions.
additionally,at least other jurisdictions that have considered whether investment securities are within the scope of their consumer protection statutes have reached the same conclusion,holding that claims based upon securities violations are not actionable under those statutes.see spinner princeville dev.cir hawaii law spinner russell,supra,law.only three states have ruled that their little ftc acts apply to securities transactions.see denison kelly.law onesti thomson mckinnon securities.law state ex rel.corbin pickrell,law.
no published decision in california has yet reached the issue.however,based upon persuasive federal and authority we conclude that section does not apply to securities transactions.spinner,supra,a ninth circuit case interpreting hawaii law,is instructive.
in spinner,the ninth circuit was interpreting hawaii little ftc act,which is almost identical to california.spinner,supra,at.the court there concluded that in enacting hawaii little ftc act,the primary intent of the legislature was to protect consumers from unethical business practices resulting in relatively small commercial injuries actions involving securities,such as the ones alleged in this case,are not typically on the agenda of consumer advocates.spinner,at.the court there also relied upon the fact that its federal counterpart,the ftc act,has not been applied in a securities context since.citation.spinner,supra,at.
the spinner court also relied on decisions interpreting other states little ftc acts,including russell,supra,wherein that court stated the ftc has never undertaken to adjudicate deceptive conduct in the sale and purchase of securities,presumably because such transactions fall under the comprehensive regulatory umbrella of the securities and exchange commission t he plaintiff has cited no case in which the ftc or a federal court has applied the ftc act to a securities transaction and we have found none consequently,in this case,taking our guidance from the ftc,we must construe the little ftc act as not purporting to cover transactions for the purchase and sale of securities.citations omitted,fn.omitted.the connecticut statute interpreted in that case is also similar to hawaii and our own.spinner,supra,at.
there is nothing to suggest that the intent of the california legislature in enacting section was any different from the intent of the hawaiian legislature to protect consumers from unethical business practices resulting in relatively small commercial injuries.spinner,supra,at.further,california cases hold that we may turn for guidance to the jurisprudence arising under the parallel citation section of the ftc act citation.in view of the similarity of language and obvious identity of purpose of the two statutes,decisions of the federal court on the subject are more than ordinarily persuasive.citations.communications,los angeles cellular telephone,supra,cal th,d.because,as discussed,ante,the ftc has never applied the ftc act to securities transactions,and nothing in section indicates a different intent,we are persuaded that section should also not reach such transactions 
in support of their assertion that section does apply to securities transactions,plaintiffs cite roskind,supra,th,d.however,that case is inapposite.
in roskind,the court only held that federal securities laws do not preempt section claims,concluding application of state laws such as section to forbid the practice of trading ahead would not impair or conflict with any provision of federal law,but would be consistent with the purposes and aims of federal law.roskind,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.in doing so,the roskind court relied in part upon the federal securities law,in particular,united states code section,which provides that t he rights and remedies provided by this chapter shall be in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that may exist in law or in equity.roskind,supra,th at,d.
however,we are not presented here with the question of whether federal securities law pre
