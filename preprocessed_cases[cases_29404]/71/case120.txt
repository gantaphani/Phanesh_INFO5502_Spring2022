the indiana public retirement system,the indiana state teachers retirement fund,and the indiana state public employees retirement fund,on behalf of themselves and a class of other similarly situated investors plaintiffs,appeal from an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,denying their motions to vacate the judgment and to amend their complaint.plaintiffs sued saic,walter havenstein,its chief executive officer mark sopp,its chief financial officer and others collectively,defendants for securities fraud in violation of section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,b,section a of the exchange act,a,and securities and exchange commission sec rule,b.their lawsuit arose from a series of alleged material misstatements and omissions in saic public filings regarding its exposure to liability for employee fraud in connection with saic contract work for new york city citytime project.on appeal,we address principally four issues arising from plaintiffs motion to file a proposed second amended complaint psac saic alleged failure to comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap by failing to disclose appropriate loss contingencies associated with the citytime project,in violation of financial accounting standard fas saic alleged failure to disclose a known trend or uncertainty reasonably expected to have a material impact on its financial condition,in violation of item of sec regulation s k,a ii item saic scienter and among other remaining issues,saic allegedly misleading statements regarding its commitment to ethics and integrity contained in its annual report to shareholders.
we conclude that the district court improperly denied plaintiffs postjudgment motion to amend their fas and item claims based on saic march form k.we therefore vacate the district court order denying the motion with respect to those claims and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.we affirm the judgment of the district court with respect to plaintiffs remaining claims.
background 
we accept as true the facts alleged in the psac because plaintiffs appeal from the denial of leave to amend on the ground of futility.see in re advanced battery,cir.
saic provided defense,intelligence,homeland security,logistics,and other services primarily to government agencies.in saic became the prime government contractor on a project with new york city to develop and implement an automated timekeeping program known as citytime for employees of various city agencies.saic anticipated that the project,if successful,would attract business from municipalities across the united states with similar timekeeping requirements and would lead to contracts unrelated to timekeeping in the city.as a result,saic kept a close eye on the project progress.
in saic hired gerard denault as deputy program manager in charge of the citytime project.in denault enlisted technodyne,a small,relatively unknown company,to provide staffing services on the project,but the relationship soon gave rise to an elaborate kickback scheme in which technodyne illegally paid denault and carl bell saic chief systems engineer for each hour a technodyne consultant or subcontractor worked on citytime.the scheme encouraged denault and bell to hire more technodyne workers than the project required and to inflate billable hours and hourly rates.
although saic initially suffered large losses under the citytime contract,the contract became profitable in after denault negotiated an amendment to the contract that transferred the risk of any cost overruns to the city.as a result of the amendment and the cost overruns associated with the kickback scheme,saic billed the city approximately million for citytime through may,well over the million that the city initially budgeted for the contract.
by late,when the scheme began to unravel,saic had removed denault from the citytime project,placed him on administrative leave,and hired an outside law firm to conduct an internal investigation of possible fraud with the help of saic internal auditors,who were tasked with reviewing denault timekeeping practices.at the same time,michael bloomberg announced that he was reevaluating saic role in the citytime project and reviewing whether to seek recovery of the city payments to saic in connection with that project.on march,saic audit team reported the results of its findings regarding denault improper timekeeping practices to saic.
notwithstanding the audit team findings,saic form k,filed on march,and certified by sopp and havenstein,did not disclose saic potential liability related to the citytime project.to the contrary,in a separate annual report to shareholders that same month,saic touted its commitment to high standards of ethical performance and integrity.joint app x.by the end of may,though,denault,bell,the technodyne principals,and others were charged in a federal criminal complaint with defrauding the city the charges,together with the results of the internal investigation from march,prompted saic to fire denault in may and offer to repay the city the amount he had billed after the amendment of the citytime contract a total of million.
thereafter,in a form k filed with the sec on june,saic finally disclosed that the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york the government and the new york city department of investigation doi were conducting a joint criminal investigation into the citytime contract.the k further disclosed that saic had billed a total of million for the citytime project,that it had million in outstanding receivables,that denault had been arrested for fraud,and that saic had offered to refund the city the million that denault billed as part of the kickback scheme with technodyne.finally,the k explained that mayor bloomberg had 
indicated that the city intends to pursue the recovery of costs associated with the citytime program that the city investigation reveals were improperly charged to the city.the city has not filed any claim against the company or otherwise requested reimbursement or return of payments previously made to the company and the company has not recorded any liabilities relating to this contract other than the approximately million it offered to refund.however,there is a reasonable possibility of additional exposure to loss that is not currently estimable if there is an adverse outcome.an adverse outcome of any of these investigations may result in of amounts owed to the company,a demand for reimbursement of other amounts previously received by the company under the contract,claims for additional damages,fines and penalties,which could have a material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial position,results of operations and cash flows.
joint app x.
in addition to filing the k on june,saic held a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss saic earnings.during the call,havenstein referred investors to the k for detailed information about the citytime project and the ongoing criminal investigation.similarly,on june,saic filed a form q that repeated the representations made in the k about the project.
on july,saic filed a second k that included a letter from mayor bloomberg formally demanding that saic reimburse the city in the approximate amount of million.on august,saic issued a press release announcing losses for the fiscal period ending july,due in part to the winding down of the citytime contract and probable restitution to the city for wrongful conduct.joint app x.from june,when saic first disclosed the existence of a criminal investigation and the possible magnitude of its reimbursement to the city,to september,the day after it announced the termination of the citytime contract,saic stock price fell from to per share.
in march saic entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the government and the doi,pursuant to which saic agreed to reimburse the city approximately million and to forfeit million in unpaid receivables.saic also agreed to cooperate with the government investigation of the citytime fraud and to issue a statement of responsibility in which it acknowledged that it had defrauded the city through its managerial employees.saic admitted,among other things,that it should have supervised denault activities,controlled the cost of the project,addressed concerns about its relationship with technodyne,and properly investigated an early anonymous internal complaint about denault relationship with technodyne on the project.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against saic and the individual defendants under section b and section a of the exchange act.as relevant here,they claimed that saic march and june sec filings on forms k,q,and k failed to disclose saic potential liability arising out of the citytime fraud or known trends or uncertainties associated with the fraud,as required by fas and item.plaintiffs also claimed that the march form k contained misstatements regarding the efficacy of saic internal controls,that saic annual report contained misleading statements regarding saic commitment to ethics and integrity,and that in its june conference call,saic misrepresented its potential liability for the citytime project.
by order dated september,the september order,the district court denied defendants motions to dismiss plaintiffs claims alleging violations of fas and item on the march form k,but granted defendants motions to dismiss with respect to most of plaintiffs other claims for failure to state a claim.in re saic.sec.litig.saic i,cv dab,wl,at.it granted plaintiffs leave to amend,within days,a subset of the dismissed claims,specifically the internal control claim based on the march form k and the claims against all of the individual defendants except denault.id.at.plaintiffs elected to forgo amending their complaint to replead those claims within the window,deciding instead to proceed with the surviving fas and item claims relating to saic march form

on march,plaintiffs moved to vacate or to obtain relief from the judgment pursuant to rules e and b of the federal rules of civil procedure and moved under rule a for leave to file a proposed amended complaint in the form of the psac.as relevant here,the psac alleged the following additional facts saic was aware of the government criminal investigation of denault by the end of december and had agreed to advance denault legal fees in connection with the investigation and any criminal proceeding that emerged the december criminal complaint suggested that saic had engaged in improper conduct by december,saic had initiated an internal investigation of denault timekeeping practices mayor bloomberg announced in a press release december,and in a daily news article december,that he was reevaluating saic role in the citytime project and reviewing all payments the city made with a goal of recovering funds from saic saic removed denault from the citytime project and placed him on administrative leave on december,the new york state comptroller office and the city mayor office each rejected contract awards to saic in december based partly on the brewing controversy surrounding the citytime project saic interviewed bell about the fraud allegations on january,the day bell resigned from saic on february,the government and the doi announced the filing of an indictment in connection with a fraud scheme involving citytime bell was subpoenaed concerning citytime,and saic agreed to advance his legal fees in connection with the criminal matter on february,and saic audit team issued a memorandum regarding denault improper timekeeping practices on march.
on september,the district court denied plaintiffs motions for relief from judgment,concluding that any amendment as reflected in the psac would be futile in re saic.sec.litig.saic iii,cv dab,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
a party seeking to file an amended complaint postjudgment must first have the judgment vacated or set aside pursuant to rules e or b.williams citigroup,cir.rule b authorizes a court to grant relief from a final judgment for any reason that justifies relief.b.we have explained that in view of the provision in r ule a that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires,it might be appropriate in a proper case to take into account the nature of the proposed amendment in deciding whether to vacate the previously entered judgment.williams,at quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court denied leave to amend under rule b solely on the ground that amendment in the form of the psac would be futile a determination that we review de novo.city of pontiac policemen firemen ret.ubs ag,cir.we assess futility as we would a motion to dismiss,determining whether the proposed complaint contains enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.in this case,because the psac alleges securities fraud,it must also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act pslra,b,and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.eca,local ibew joint pension tr.of chi.jp morgan chase,cir.the psac therefore must allege with particularity facts that give rise to a strong inference that saic acted consciously and recklessly in omitting or misrepresenting financial information.id.at.
on appeal,plaintiffs elected to substantially shorten the class period and affirmatively waived any challenge to the district court dismissal of claims arising out of alleged false statements,omissions,or other violations of the securities laws that occurred prior to march.see oral argument tr.at.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of those claims,and in the remainder of this opinion we focus only on claims arising from misstatements and omissions during the shorter class period from march,to september.
plaintiffs fas claim based on the march form k 
to succeed on a claim under section b of the exchange act and rule,a plaintiff must allege that each defendant made misstatements or omissions of material fact,with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,upon which the plaintiff relied,and that the plaintiff reliance was the proximate cause of its injury.atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.and while f inancial statements which are not prepared in accordance with gaap are presum ptively misleading or inaccurate,a,allegations of gaap violations or accounting irregularities,standing alone,are insufficient to state a securities fraud claim.novak kasaks,cir.only where such allegations are coupled with evidence of corresponding fraudulent intent might they be sufficient.id.quotation marks omitted.
plaintiffs allege that saic violated gaap by failing to comply with fas,which requires the issuer to disclose a loss contingency when a loss is a reasonable possibility,meaning that it is more than remote but less than likely.financial accounting standards board,statement of financial accounting standards,accounting for contingencies,hereinafter fas board,statement of fas.here,plaintiffs assert that saic failed to disclose the loss contingency related to the citytime fraud in saic march form 
at the outset,we note that the district court appears to have misunderstood the standard applicable to claims under fas when it held that fas does not require disclosure unless it is considered probable that a claim will be asserted.saic ii,wl,at emphasis added quotation marks omitted.the probability standard applies in lieu of the reasonable possibility standard only if the loss contingency arises from an unasserted claim or assessment when there has been no manifestation by a potential claimant of an awareness of a possible claim or assessment.fas board,statement of fas emphasis added.but in this case,the reasonable possibility standard applies in view of the psac allegation that by march the city had manifested an awareness of a possible,sizeable claim against saic.with that standard in mind,we turn to the allegations in the psac relevant to the march form 
by the time saic filed that k,the psac alleges,the citytime criminal investigation was as focused on saic as it was on saic individual employees the december criminal complaint against individuals involved in the citytime project alluded to saic improper actions denault had been interviewed by prosecutors,and both saic and denault received a grand jury subpoena for the production of documents related to the citytime project mayor bloomberg announced a reevaluation of saic role in the citytime project,including a full review of all payments the city had made to saic and saic agreed to pay denault and bell legal fees associated with any criminal proceedings.moreover,the psac alleged that by march,when saic received the results of its internal investigation about possible fraud,saic was aware not only of denault wrongdoing but also its own potential liability to the city.
for these reasons we hold that the psac adequately alleged that saic violated fas by failing to disclose a loss contingency in its march k arising from the city manifest awareness of a possible material claim against saic.
plaintiffs item claim based on the march form k 
we next consider whether the psac adequately pleaded a violation of item,which imposes specific disclosure requirements on companies filing reports on sec forms k and stratte mcclure morgan stanley,cir.as relevant here,item requires that saic k d escribe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that the registrant reasonably expects will have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations.a ii according to the sec interpretive release regarding item,disclosure under item is necessary where a trend,demand,commitment,event or uncertainty is both presently known to management and reasonably likely to have material effects on the registrant financial conditions or results of operations.stratte mcclure,at quoting management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations,securities act release,exchange act release,investment company act release,sec docket may,hereinafter sec interpretive release.
the psac alleges that saic violated item by failing to disclose i that saic had overbilled the city hundreds of millions of dollars on citytime over a period and ii that saic overbilling practices subjected it to numerous undisclosed risks,including monetary risks and reputational risks,particularly because government agencies are saic primary customers and any harm to its reputation relationships with such agencies would adversely affect its current business,as well as its future revenues and growth prospects.joint app x.
saic makes two principal arguments in defense of the district court conclusion that plaintiffs item claim was inadequately pleaded.first,it argues that it must actually have known of the relevant uncertainty at the time of the march filing,but that plaintiffs failed to plead that saic actually knew then about the scheme.second,it insists that the loss of the citytime contract was not material to saic operations as a whole.
we have never directly addressed whether item requires that a company actually know or merely should have known of the relevant trend,event,or uncertainty in order to be liable for failing to disclose it.instead,we appear to have assumed,without deciding,that item required an allegation or showing of actual knowledge rather than a lesser standard of recklessness or negligence.in panther partners,for example,we held that the complaint adequately alleged that defects in the defendant corporation semiconductor chips constituted a known trend or uncertainty that the defendant reasonably expected would have a material unfavorable impact on revenues or income.panther partners ikanos commc ns,cir.we did not separately consider whether the defendant actually had to know about the existing financial uncertainty associated with the defect.see also litwin blackstone,cir concluding that,where it was undisputed that the downward trend in the real estate market was already known and existing at the time of the initial public offering,the sole remaining issue was whether the effect of the known information was reasonably likely to be material.
the plain language of item confirms our previous assumption that it requires the registrant actual knowledge of the relevant trend or uncertainty.item demands that the registrant d escribe any known trends or uncertainties and also requires disclosure where the registrant knows of events that will cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues,such as a known future increase in costs of labor.a ii emphases added.the sec interpretation of item further confirms this reading of item,insofar as it advises that the trends or uncertainties must be presently known to management.sec interpretive release emphasis added.we therefore hold that item requires the registrant to disclose only those trends,events,or uncertainties that it actually knows of when it files the relevant report with the sec.it is not enough that it should have known of the existing trend,event,or uncertainty.
here,the psac allegations support a strong inference that saic actually knew about the citytime fraud before filing its form k on march,and that it could be implicated in the fraud and required to repay the city the revenue generated by the citytime contract moreover,the psac plausibly alleges that,in december,as a result of the citytime fraud,both the city and new york state rejected pending contract awards to saic valued at more than million.exposure of the fraud also jeopardized saic existing or future relationships with other governmental entities that accounted for a significant amount of its revenue.see panther partners,at.indeed,the psac alleges,saic anticipated that the potential sale of citytime timekeeping software to other municipalities presented a market opportunity valued internally at approximately billion.joint app x.saic was aware of the fraud by late march but was uncertain about its likely effect on saic current and future revenues.under those alleged circumstances,saic was required under item to disclose the manner in which th at trend,event,or uncertaint y might reasonably be expected to materially impact saic future revenues.litwin,at.
we next consider saic argument that the loss of the citytime contract was ultimately not material in view of the fact that it was a single contract out of saic more than ongoing contracts and that it was worth a fraction of saic yearly revenues million compared to billion.we reject saic materiality argument,which asks us to consider quantitative factors only in the narrowest light in determining the financial impact of losing the citytime project due to the fraud,and to otherwise ignore qualitative factors.see id.at.
when a district court is in effect faced with a motion to dismiss a complaint,we have cautioned that b ecause materiality is a mixed question of law and fact,in the context of a rule b motion,the complaint may not properly be dismissed on the ground that the alleged misstatements or omissions are not material unless they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.eca,at quoting ganino citizens utils,cir.here,as we have just observed,the psac alleges that saic anticipated that the potential sale of citytime timekeeping software to other municipalities presented a market opportunity valued internally at approximately billion twenty percent of its yearly revenue.the psac also points to saic possible exposure to significant civil and even criminal liability arising from the submission of fraudulent time and billing records to the city and the resulting risk of loss of revenue from future contracts for citytime projects or debarment from other government contracts altogether.the seriousness of the citytime fraud and the alleged importance of the citytime project to saic future presence in the city and its ability to sell similar services to other municipalities around the
