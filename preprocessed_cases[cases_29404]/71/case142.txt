the issue presented in this appeal is whether the securities investor protection act,et sipa or the act,permits an inflation or interest adjustment to net equity claims for customer property.we hold that it does not.
claimants appellants claimants are former investors of bernard madoff investment securities llc blmis.trustee appellee irving picard trustee was appointed,pursuant to sipa,as trustee for the liquidation of blmis.
sipa prioritizes the distribution of customer property in a liquidation.the act creates a fund of customer property for priority distribution exclusively among a failed customers,and customers share in the fund proportionally,according to each customer net equity.
because madoff fraud lasted at least three decades,claimants ask that the trustee adjust their proportional share of customer property to reflect inflation one claimant also asks for an interest adjustment,to reflect the of money.we agree with the trustee and the bankruptcy court,however,that sipa does not permit an inflation or interest adjustment to net equity claims.accordingly,we affirm the order of the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york burton lifland,judge,approving the trustee unadjusted net equity calculation and overruling claimants objections.
background 
we described bernard madoff fraud in a previous appeal in this case.see in re bernard madoff inv.sec.llc,cir net equity decision,cert.dismissed,d,cert.denied,d,and,d.briefly stated,although claimants gave money to madoff for investment,madoff never invested the customer funds.id.at.to conceal his complete lack of trading activity on behalf of his investors,madoff created fictitious paper account statements and trading records.id.the customer account statements listed purported securities transactions,but they did not reflect any actual trading or holdings of securities by madoff on behalf of the customer.id.at.madoff instead funded customer withdrawals with the principal investments of new and existing customers.id.at.the only accurate entries in madoff customer statements were those that reflected the customers cash deposits and withdrawals.id.
after the collapse of blmis,the trustee was appointed pursuant to sipa.id.at.sipa was enacted in as a response to a rash of failures among securities that caused significant losses to customers whose assets were unrecoverable or became tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings.in re new times sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted new times i.the act creates procedures for liquidating failed and provides their customers special protections.net equity decision,at.
sipa is designed to return customer property to customers.see collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed noting that the return of customer property is sipa fundamental premise.in a sipa liquidation,a fund of customer property,separate from the general estate,is established for priority distribution exclusively among customers.net equity decision,at.customer property consists of cash and securities received,acquired,or held by the for the securities accounts of customers,except securities registered in the names of individual customers.
customers of the share ratably in the fund of customer property on the basis and to the extent of their respective net equities.id.c b.the larger the customer net equity,the greater the customer share of the fund of customer property.collier,supra.sipa defines net equity,in relevant part,as 
t he dollar amount of the account or accounts of a customer,to be determined by calculating the sum which would have been owed by the debtor to such customer if the debtor had liquidated,by sale or purchase on the filing date all securities positions of such customer minus any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date 
payments to customers based on net equity are made insofar as the amount owed to the customer is ascertainable from the books and records of the debtor or is otherwise established to the satisfaction of the trustee.id.b see also net equity decision,at.
sipa guarantees customers a minimum amount of recovery.when a customer ratable share of the recovered customer property is insufficient to satisfy his or her net equity claim,the customer claim can be supplemented by the securities investor protection corporation sipc,which was created by sipa and administers a fund capitalized by the brokerage community.see.the sipc advances to the sipa trustee up to per customer,see id.a,except that the advance for a customer claim for cash can not exceed,see id.a,d.to the extent that customer property and sipc advances are insufficient to satisfy a customer full net equity claim,the customer is entitled to participate in the general estate as an unsecured creditor.id.c.
in the net equity decision,we held that madoff investors are customers with claims for securities under sipa.at.we also addressed how net equity should be calculated in this case,given that sipa definition of net equity references securities positions but madoff never invested customer funds.we rejected the argument of various customers that their claims should be based on the amounts listed in their last blmis account statement.id.we observed that reliance on madoff false statements to determine net equity would have the absurd effect of treating fictitious and arbitrarily assigned paper profits as real and would give legal effect to madoff machinations.id.at.instead,we upheld as a matter of law the trustee determination that net equity should be calculated by the amount that a customer deposited into his or her blmis account,less any amount that he or she withdrew from the account.id.at.we declined to address,however,whether the calculation of net equity should be adjusted to account for inflation or interest,because the bankruptcy court had not yet addressed the issue.id.at.
afterward,the trustee and the sipc argued to the bankruptcy court that sipa does not permit adjustments for inflation or interest to customers net equity claims.various claimants objected,some seeking just an inflation adjustment,others an interest adjustment.the securities and exchange commission sec,which has plenary authority to supervise the sipc,sipc barbour,d internal quotation marks omitted,disagreed with the trustee and the sipc and contended that net equity could be adjusted to account for inflation.the sec argued before the bankruptcy court that adjusting for inflation would be an accurate way to calculate customer net equity under the narrow set of factual circumstances presented here,although it acknowledged that the decision to make such an adjustment must rest on the court consideration of the costs and benefits of doing so.sec mem.of law at,sipc bernard madoff inv.sec.llc,smb,ecf.however,in a colloquy with the bankruptcy court,the sec lawyer,when asked what kind of deference he sought,stated that the sec was actually not asking for deference.
the bankruptcy court upheld the trustee determination that no adjustment for inflation or interest could be made under sipa.the court ruled that,as a matter of law,sipa did not permit a adjustment to net equity.it then certified an immediate appeal of its decision pursuant to d.we granted the petition for direct appeal.
discussion 
we review de novo the legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court,including its interpretation of sipa.net equity decision,at.claimants contend that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that sipa does not allow an inflation adjustment to net equity claims for customer property.they also assert that the sec support for an inflation adjustment is entitled to skidmore deference.we disagree.
i.an inflation adjustment to customer net equity claims is impermissible under sipa 
according to claimants,without an inflation adjustment,the claims of madoff earlier investors are unfairly undervalued when compared to the claims of madoff later investors.although sipa text does not provide for an inflation adjustment to net equity,claimants urge us to construe sipa to permit trustee discretion to make such an adjustment.but we conclude that an inflation adjustment to net equity is not permissible under sipa.
