these consolidated petitions for review challenge certain rules releases issued by the securities and exchange commission sec in the wake of new york attorney general elliot spitzer investigation into abuses in the mutual fund industry.petitioner,is an illinois corporation that trades in mutual funds and makes money by taking advantage of discrepancies that occur when the current value of a fund portfolio securities has changed and that change is not yet reflected in the fund share price.that is,is a market timer a firm that exploits mutual fund mispricing that occurs when market prices for the fund underlying securities have become stale due to events after the relevant trading market has closed.
prefers the term active trading to market timing.whatever the nomenclature,the form of legal,but in an effort to curtail it,the sec changed its interpretation of the rules regarding how mutual funds calculate their daily prices,and brought this petition challenging the sec actions.in particular challenges statements made in rules releases issued by the sec in late and requiring mutual fund companies to estimate the current fair value of a security when the market price at which that security closed has become unreliable.we conclude that lacks standing to challenge the sec releases and accordingly dismiss the petitions.
background 
a mutual fund share price does not fluctuate throughout the trading day,but the prices of the securities held by the fund do.the portfolio security prices are aggregated into a single daily fund price known as the net asset value nav,which is generally fixed by a fund when the major stock markets close at eastern time et.the investment company act of,et.ica,requires mutual fund shares to be sold and redeemed at a price that 
will bear such relation to the current net asset value of such security computed as of such time as the rules may prescribe for the purpose of eliminating or reducing any dilution of the value of other outstanding securities of such company or any other result of such purchase,redemption or sale which is unfair to holders of such other outstanding securities.
a emphasis added.for purposes of computing nav,the ica defines value as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available,the market value of such securities and ii with respect to other securities and assets,fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors.a b emphasis added.this case concerns the circumstances under which mutual funds use fair value opposed to market purposes of calculating nav and setting share price.
the sec regulates mutual funds under the ica and investment advisers under the investment advisers act of,et.iaa.the agency is empowered to make rules and regulations to the same extent,covering the same subject matter,and for the accomplishment of the same ends as the ica,and to define accounting,technical,and trade terms used in this title.c,a.
to that end,the sec has promulgated rules governing portfolio valuation and share pricing.one of these rules elaborates on the ica definition of value 
portfolio securities with respect to which market quotations are readily available shall be valued at current market value,and other securities and assets shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors.
c alculations made as of the close of the new york stock exchange on the preceding business day may be estimated so as to reflect any change in current net asset value since the closing calculation on the preceding business day.
a,c emphasis added.another rule establishes a requirement of forward pricing,prohibiting the issuance or trading of fund shares at any price other than one based on current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a purchase or redemption order.a.
forward pricing was implemented by the sec in in order to reduce riskless trading in mutual funds by eliminating the ability to use news to take advantage of navs fixed before that news was released to the markets.see united states ass of sec.dealers,d david ward,protecting mutual funds from profiteers forward pricing international fund shares,hastings.the forward pricing principle of rule a did not fully achieve its goal,however.as the number of mutual funds that offered investors the chance to invest in overseas markets grew,a new type of backward pricing abuses began to emerge,one that was possible because mutual funds were increasingly investing in stocks that traded in markets outside the united states.ward,protecting mutual funds,at.
for example,in the case of a mutual fund that invests primarily in overseas securities trading on the london stock exchange,the daily nav would be set at et using stock prices from the close of the london market at is,stock prices that are five hours old.in the event that favorable economic news emerged during the interim,arbitrageurs could purchase shares in the fund at an undervalued nav that did not account for the positive news see kircher putnam funds trust,cir.under these circumstances,a rbitrageurs make profits with slight risk to themselves,diverting gains from the mutual funds investors while imposing higher administrative costs on the funds whose operating expenses rise with each purchase and redemption.id.at.
in response to attorney general spitzer investigation into illegal late trading in the mutual fund industry and the accompanying growing public awareness of the practice of market timing arbitrage,the sec launched a reexamination of the rules governing mutual fund valuation and share pricing.at issue here are certain statements made by the sec in rules releases issued in late and pertaining to the circumstances under which mutual funds must use fair value pricing.as described above,the ica and sec regulations require funds to use current market quotations in calculating nav with respect to securities for which such quotations are readily available,and in all other circumstances to use fair value estimations.in december the sec adopted a new compliance rule requiring mutual funds and investment advisers to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws,review those policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation,and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures,the compliance rule.in april the sec adopted a new disclosure rule requiring funds to explain in their prospectuses the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing and the effects of using fair value pricing,the disclosure rule.
the compliance rule and the disclosure rule are themselves silent regarding the circumstances under which funds should or must use fair value pricing in calculating daily nav,but the releases issued in connection with the promulgation of the rules contain statements by the sec that contends amount to a new,mandatory fair value rule,promulgated in violation of the requirements of the administrative procedure act apa and contrary to the ica.the challenged language pertains to the circumstances under which current market quotations are not readily available so as to trigger fair value pricing 
when fund shares are mispriced,traders have an arbitrage opportunity they can use to exploit a fund and disadvantage the fund investors by extracting value from the fund without assuming any significant investment risk.mispricing occurs with respect to portfolio securities traded on a foreign market that closes before the time at which the fund prices its shares.if an event affecting the value of the portfolio securities occurs after the foreign market closes but before the fund prices its shares,the foreign market closing price for the portfolio security will not reflect the correct current value of those securities when the fund prices its shares.in,we stated that,in these circumstances,a fund must,to the best of its ability,determine the fair value of the securities,as of the time that the fund prices its shares.
