paul silvester silvester served as connecticut state treasurer the treasurer from to.as treasurer,silvester managed the connecticut retirement and trust funds the fund,the pension fund for approximately employees of the state of connecticut,valued at the time at approximately billion.sec dibella,cv ebb,wl,at,dibella i.
dibella was a connecticut state senator from to,and while in office he served on the investment advisory council the iac,the committee that oversaw investments made by the treasurer on behalf of the fund.after serving in the legislature,dibella formed ncv to further his consulting business.sec dibella,cv ebb,wl,at,dibella ii.
in the fall of,dibella introduced silvester to joseph grano,president of painewebber painewebber,at that time a brokerage and asset management firm.as a result of that meeting,silvester approved a million investment by the fund with painewebber.id.at.both silvester and dibella were under the impression that dibella would receive a finder fee for arranging the meeting between silvester and grano.id.when dibella discovered he would not be paid because he did not qualify as a finder under painewebber internal process,dibella asked silvester to intercede with grano.after silvester and dibella had still failed to convince grano to pay dibella a year later,silvester told dibella that he would try to work something else out.
on november,the day after silvester and dibella met with grano,and eight days after silvester lost as treasurer,silvester telephoned frederic malek,chairman of thayer capital partners thayer,an investment firm,to notify malek that silvester intended to invest million of fund assets with thayer.dibella i,wl,at.thayer,with the help of merrill lynch,had been trying to solicit the treasurer to invest fund assets with thayer since august.dibella ii,wl,at.an officer at the treasurer office,michael macdonald,initially rejected the thayer investment but eventually recommended a maximum investment by the fund of million.id.
silvester instructed malek to talk to dibella regarding a finder fee.dibella i,wl,at.malek felt that dibella could be helpful in developing a relationship with the new t reasurer and with expediting and consummating the document process for the fund investment,but malek did not think that dibella would be helpful in raising capital.at no point did dibella inform malek that because he was not a registered lobbyist he was precluded by connecticut state law from representing thayer in negotiations with the treasurer.
silvester hoped dibella would be a representative of the state of connecticut and earn a finder fee.silvester thought that allowing dibella to be part of the thayer investment would take care of dibella for the painewebber deal and for his help with silvester campaign for as treasurer,while solidifying a future business and political relationship.dibella also viewed the thayer fee as a way for silvester to compensate dibella for the painewebber deal.
after just one conversation with malek,and without any knowledge of where thayer planned to invest the money,dibella asked silvester to increase the fund investment with thayer from million to million.silvester obliged.dibella ii,wl,at.silvester indicated that he revisited and reconsidered the investment and increased the amount the fund invested with thayer solely because of dibella request.dibella testified that he made the request knowing that as the amount of fund moneys invested increased,his fee would increase.silvester also indicated that by increasing the amount of the fund investment with thayer,silvester was also increasing dibella fee.malek,on the other hand,testified that he was relatively indifferent to raising the fund investment to million because the investment portfolio was fully subscribed.dibella and malek agreed that thereby receive a fee for his services in arranging the fund investment with thayer.
on november,a lame duck million of fund assets to thayer for investment,which,according to silvester,was a typical amount for a fund investment.id.on november,signed an agreement with thayer to consult and represent thayer regarding the fund investment in exchange for.id.in december,thayer paid.id.
upon the conclusion of his term in january,silvester was hired by grano to work for painewebber.denise nappier succeeded silvester as treasurer in january.when nappier took office,she reduced the fund commitment to thayer.id.correspondingly,thayer reduced the amount owed to to.id.in march,thayer paid dibella and ncv,the remainder owed them.id.malek testified that he was satisfied with the reduction and never needed to discuss investment strategies with dibella.
in,silvester pled guilty to federal racketeering charges based on the predicate offense of conspiracy to commit money laundering.silvester pled guilty because,among other things,he asked thayer to pay someone a finder fee in exchange for doing business with the fund.the sec then sued for aiding and abetting silvester in violating section b and rule of the act and thayer and malek in violating section of the advisers act.id.in particular,the sec claimed dibella engaged with thayer,helped put the arrangement into the language of a consulting contract that did not reflect the true consideration and services to be provided,and collected fees under it.
after silvester testified as to other transactions inculpating him for racketeering,the district court instructed,t he jury will utilize the material for purposes of this is offered to describe silvester activities.at this point,i will remind you or tell you that dibella is not accused in any way of being involved in transactions that have been enumerated so far.the district court later instructed you heard silvester testify with respect to the transactions as to a certain number of funds dibella is not alleged to have been involved in any of these funds and,in fact,silvester has so stated dibella is not alleged to have any responsibility for that kind of activity.the district court went on to state that a ny illegal act committed by silvester which he has admitted is not coming in to be used against dibella,it was merely to establish a foundation for the kind of activity that silvester was involved in,that all.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court again instructed the jury 
you have heard evidence concerning certain criminal acts and charges against and involving paul silvester.other than evidence involving thayer capital,those acts and charges did not involve defendants dibella or north cove ventures,llc,and they are not alleged in this case to have been involved in those acts or charges.that evidence was presented at trial for the limited purpose by the plaintiff of showing the criminal acts or charges against silvester.you should not consider those acts or charges against the defendants,but may consider them in determining whether silvester committed a securities violation.
the district court also instructed the jury on the nature of the sec claims against.the district court explained that were charged with aiding and abetting silvester violations of section b of the act and rule,as well as aiding and abetting thayer violation of section of the advisor act.the district court explained that the sec charged silvester with violating section b and rule by engaging in a fraudulent scheme,pursuant to which he arranged,so as to pay for unrelated work,political favors,and future goodwill,for the d efendants appellants to receive substantial fees despite providing no meaningful work in connection with silvester investment of fund money with thayer and by fail ing to disclose this arrangement to the fund.the district court explained that the sec charged thayer and malek with violating section by breach ing their fiduciary duties to the fund when they entered into their arrangement with,to pay them a fee despite their providing no meaningful work,and without disclosing that they had done so to the fund.
as to the aiding and abetting claims,the district court instructed the jury that the sec argued that were aware of the fraudulent nature of the fee arrangement and that they provided substantial assistance to the fraud by entering into the arrangement with thayer,by successfully soliciting a larger investment by the pension fund in order to increase their fees,and by ultimately accepting payment despite having performed no meaningful services.the district court then instructed the jury as to the legal elements of violations of section b and rule,section,and aiding and abetting.
the jury found that silvester violated section b and rule,thayer violated section,and knowingly aided and abetted all violations.the district court ordered dibella to disgorge and pay in interest and in civil penalties.
moved for judgment as a matter of law and,in the alternative,for a new trial.dibella ii,wl,at.claimed the sec failed to prove the existence of a fraudulent scheme,as required by rule,because the sec failed to prove that provided no meaningful work in exchange for fee the jury instructions were flawed because they failed to provide a definition of meaningful work silvester,as treasurer,had no duty to disclose the fee agreement between dibella and thayer and,therefore,silvester could not have violated rule b and the sec failed to prove a primary violation of section of the advisers act by thayer,and even if this proof were established,could not aid and abet the violation as a matter of law.id.at.
the district court first found that a reasonable jury could conclude that silvester was motivated by a desire to receive political favors and repay dibella for unrelated work and that this qualified as a fraudulent scheme under rule,regardless of whether provided any meaningful work to thayer.id.at.next,the district court held that a jury could reasonably find provided silvester with substantial assistance because of dibella testimony that he asked silvester to increase the amount of fund assets invested with thayer knowing that dibella had not been hired to do this.id.at.
second,the district court held that the failure to give the jury a definition of no meaningful work did not constitute a fundamental error because the sec allegation that performed no meaningful work was factual and designed to add further support to their claim that the fee arrangement was a fraudulent scheme.id.at.further,the district court held that the jury did not need a definition of the phrase because it was neither outside common understanding nor so technical or ambiguous as to require specific definition.id.quoting united states johnpoll,cir.
third,the district court held that a reasonable jury could find silvester violated section b and rule because silvester was a fiduciary of the fund and thus had a duty to disclose the fee arrangement to the iac and to all fund beneficiaries under connecticut law the information silvester failed to disclose was material because silvester increased the fund investment with thayer at dibella urging while dibella admitted that he had no knowledge of whether million was an appropriate amount to invest with thayer and silvester acted with intent to defraud or with reckless disregard for the truth because silvester knew he had a fiduciary duty to the fund and that his decision to increase the fund investment with thayer did not comport with this duty.id.at.the district court held that a reasonable jury could find that knowingly aided and abetted silvester failure to disclose because dibella knew of silvester fiduciary duty and because dibella substantially assisted silvester by urging silvester to increase the fund investment with thayer.id.at.
fourth,the district court found that a reasonable jury could have concluded that thayer was engaging in a transaction which operated as a fraud on the fund in violation of section of the advisers act because the circumstances surrounding the fee arrangement with dibella would lead an ordinarily prudent person to not enter into the agreement thayer failed to exercise reasonable care in entering into the agreement with the fund and with and thayer breached its duty to disclose the fee agreement,as material information,to another individual in the treasurer office not involved in the formation of the agreement in order to avoid injury to the pension fund.id.at.thus,the district court held that a reasonable jury could find that aided and abetted thayer section violation because knowingly provided substantial assistance to thayer to increase the fund investment with thayer.id.at.
appeal on several grounds as a matter of law state constitutional officers have no federal duty to disclose contracts and the general verdict should be reversed the district court erred in not instructing the jury on the terms no meaningful work the district court erred in applying the advisers act to the fund,which is a state pension fund the district court erred in upholding aiding and abetting verdicts against where had no duty to disclose and a primary violation was based on negligence the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of prior bad acts of and the district court abused its discretion in imposing remedies such as a civil penalty not authorized by statute.

silvester violations and aiding and abetting 
section b and rule violations 
section b of the act prohibits the use or employ ment of any manipulative or deceptive device,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security b.rule states a similar prohibition.see.the sec has authority to bring civil enforcement actions against a defendant for violations of section b and rule.see sec berger,cir.a defendant violates section b and rule where the defendant,in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact,with scienter a victim to whom the defendant had a duty reasonably relied on the defendant action and that reliance caused the victim to be injured eca,local ibew joint pension trust of chicago jp morgan chase,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also sec first jersey,cir.in this case,the sec argues that silvester had a duty to disclose to the fund the fee arrangement between and thayer because of silvester statutory obligations as a fiduciary of the fund and because the fee arrangement was material.argue that the sec failed to prove that silvester had a fiduciary duty under federal or state law and that,even if silvester had a duty to disclose information to the fund,the fee arrangement was not material to the transfer of fund assets to thayer for investment.
under section b and rule,an omission is actionable under the securities laws only when the buyer is subject to a duty to disclose the omitted facts.vacold llc cerami,cir.this court has found that a fiduciary relationship or other relationship of trust and confidence can give rise to a duty to disclose material information,as can unique access to information.powers british vita,cir.
under connecticut law,a fiduciary includes an administrator or trustee.a trustee who invests and manages trust assets owes a duty to the beneficiaries of the trust to comply with the prudent investor rule.id.a.this includes invest ing and manag ing trust assets as a prudent investor would,by considering the purposes,terms,distribution requirements and other circumstances of the trust.id.a.in satisfying this standard,the trustee shall exercise reasonable care,skill and caution,and shall take reasonable steps to verify facts relevant to the investment and management of trust assets,id.d.more generally,a fiduciary relationship is characterized by a unique degree of trust and confidence between the parties,one of whom has superior knowledge,skill or expertise and is under a duty to represent the interests of the other.konover dev.zeller,internal quotation marks omitted.
the treasurer is required to appoint a chief investment officer over the fund who serve s at the pleasure of the treasurer.a.the investment officer is charged with advis ing the treasurer on investing the trust funds of the state.id.the statute implies that,notwithstanding the treasurer appointment of this officer to give him advice,the treasurer still retains power over the investment of the fund.connecticut law also provides that the iac review a ll investments by the treasurer,and then recommend investment polic ies to the treasurer relating to the kind or nature of investment,including limitations,conditions or restrictions upon the methods,practices or procedures for investment,reinvestment,purchase,sale or exchange transactions.id.c.however,the statute does not give the iac the authority to override the treasurer or make independent investment decisions for the fund.id.only the governor may direct the treasurer to change any investments made by the treasurer when in the judgment of the iac such action is for the best interest of the state.id.at c 
as treasurer,silvester had the power of directing investment of the fund,which could only be overridden by the governor,and served as a fiduciary,administrat or,and trust ee for various state funds see.b.he had the authority to form and execute any contracts necessary to carry out these duties.specifically with respect to the fund,the treasurer had a statutory obligation to submit for review all of the fund investments he made.more generally,as a fiduciary,the treasurer had an obligation to verify facts relevant to prudent investment on behalf of those who did not possess the information,such as the iac,governor,or fund beneficiaries.
it would be a strange result indeed to conclude that a publicly elected official who controls billions of dollars of public moneys set aside for the benefit of thousands of public employees in connecticut is not a fiduciary of those funds and has no fiduciary duties as to those funds.one would think the level of public cynicism about those who hold public office has not yet sunk to that level.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that,at the time of the thayer transaction,silvester was a fiduciary such that he had a duty to disclose material omissions to at least the iac because silvester had a duty under connecticut state law,we need not determine whether he had a duty created by federal law 
ii.materiality 
in order to determine whether a misleading statement is material,courts must engage in a inquiry.eca,local,at.a fact will be considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information available.first jersey,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is not sufficient to allege that the investor might have considered the misrepresentation or omission important.on the other hand,it is not necessary to assert that the investor would have acted differently if an accurate disclosure was made.ganino citizens utils,cir.t he determination of whether an alleged misrepresentation is material necessarily depends on all relevant circumstances.eca,local,at.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the fee arrangement for dibella was material.the amount dibella received from thayer was contingent on the amount the fund invested with thayer.silvester admits that he arranged to have dibella receive a fee from thayer,that he knew that dibella fee was contingent on how much the fund invested with thayer,and that he increased the amount of fund assets invested with thayer by.a reasonable in this case the iac,governor,or fund have viewed the fee arrangement,as it related to the level of fund assets invested with thayer,as changing the total mix of information,because it tends to show that silvester may have been motivated to increase the fund investment with thayer not because thayer was a good investment but only to enrich dibella.
therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that a reasonable jury could conclude that silvester violated section b and rule.
aiding and abetting 
liability for aiding and abetting can be established by showing that the defendant joined the specific venture and shared in it,and that his efforts contributed to its success,or,in other words,by showing that the defendant consciously assisted the commission of the specific crime in some active way.united states ogando,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also e.specific to securities violations,the government must prove the existence of a securities law violation by the primary as opposed to the aiding and abetting party knowledge of this violation on the part of the aider and abettor and substantial assistance by the aider and abettor in the achievement of the primary violation.bloor carro,spanbock,londin,rodman fass,cir.t he three requirements can not be considered in isolation from one another.iit cornfeld,cir.satisfaction of the knowledge requirement will depend on the theory of primary liability,and there may be a nexus between the degree of knowledge and the requirement that the alleged aider and abettor render substantial assistance.id.substantial assistance,in turn,requires a showing that the aider and abettor proximately caused the harm to the victim on which the primary liability is predicated.bloor,at.having established that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to find that silvester had committed a section b and rule violation,we turn to the remaining two issues.
as a former member of the iac,dibella was aware of silvester duties as treasurer to submit material investment information to the iac for review and was aware that the iac could use that information to make investment recommendations or ask the governor to override the treasurer investment decisions.he knew that the treasurer had the authority to make investment decisions for the fund and could increase the amount the fund invested with thayer.dibella also knew that his fee was contingent on how much the fund invested with thayer,and he asked silvester to increase that amount without having consulted with malek and without any knowledge of thayer.dibella knew he did no work in the thayer investment process,and he also knew that the money he was receiving from thayer was intended as payback for painewebber.finally,it is relevant that dibella was aware that silvester arranged for dibella to be involved with the fund investment with thayer shortly after silvester lost his election and had a limited amount of time to use his position as treasurer to compensate dibella for his work arranging the painewebber deal.moreover,dibella provided substantial assistance to silvester fraud by requesting that silvester increase the fund investment in thayer.silvester testified that had dibella not made such a request silvester would not have increased the fund investment with thayer.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying dibella motion for new trial because there was substantial evidence that dibella knowingly aided and abetted silvester in violating section b and rule.
aiding and abetting violations of the investment advisers act 
section of the advisers act prohibits any investment advisor from engag ing in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.as this court and the supreme court have noted,the advisers act reflects a congressional intent to eliminate,or at least to expose,all conflicts of interest which might incline an investment or render advice which was not disinterested.sec wall transcript,cir quoting sec capital gains research bureau,d.hence,the supreme court has held that the government need not show intent to make out a section violation,see aaron sec,d noting the holding in capital gains research bureau with approval,nor is it necessary,in a suit against a fiduciary such as an investment adviser,to establish all the elements of fraud that would be required in a suit against a party to an arm length transaction,id.at.
in their challenge to the district court decision with respect to thayer and respective violations of the advisers act,the press three arguments the advisers act does not apply to the fund because it is a public fund thayer and malek had no further duty to disclose the fee arrangement beyond reporting it to silvester and it is impossible to aid and abet a negligent act.
application of advisers act to the fund 
b provides that n o provision in this subchapter shall apply to,or be deemed to include,a state any state authority,or any state officer acting as such in the course of his official duty.b.in one release,the sec has written that a state pension fund was exempt from the requirements of the investment advisers act with respect to its investment in a corporation despite receiving material nonpublic information concerning a prospective acquisition by that corporation of another.see report on investigation pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of the retirement systems of alabama,exchange act release.similarly,the sec has stated that,institutions are also exempt from the advisers act.investment network,sec letter,fed.sec.p may.
notwithstanding these sec opinions,however,thayer and malek may be held liable under section.thayer is not a state entity and malek is not a state agent.and while thayer and malek client for purposes of section the fund,there is no reason that this excludes thayer or malek from liability,given that the state is among the victims of thayer and malek section violations.
duty to disclose 
although there is no specifically enumerated duty to disclose in section,an investment advisor can avoid committing fraud on its clients by disclosing material information to them.see capital gains research bureau,at.the legislative history of the advisers act leaves no doubt that congress intended to impose enforceable fiduciary obligations on investment advisors.transamerica mortgage advisers,tama lewis,d.the sec argues that thayer and malek,to avoid section liability,had a duty to refrain from taking the fund investment,or to disclose the fee arrangement to another individual in the treasurer office not involved in the formation of the agreement in order to avoid injury to the pension fund.see dibella ii,wl,at.
we have held that t hird party disclosure to an agent is not imputed to the principal when the agent is acting adversely to the principal interest and the third party has notice of this.arlinghaus ritenour,cir.this would counsel that thayer and malek had a duty to disclose the fee arrangement to someone other than silvester who could affect the investment decisions of the fund because malek,and therefore thayer,knew that silvester had arranged for dibella to receive a fee for the fund investment.however,we need not go so far as to impose a duty on malek and thayer to disclose to someone other than the treasurer for purposes of liability.thayer and malek are liable under section because they implemented silvester scheme to defraud the fund,the state of connecticut,and the fund beneficiaries,although they knew or should have known that silvester investment was unlawful.malek knew silvester had arranged for dibella to receive a fee from thayer and that dibella offered,or would offer,no investment advice.malek also knew that silvester was increasing the amount the fund invested with thayer consistent with dibella wishes and without any input from thayer or malek.in fact,the investment increase was counter to malek purported investment plan for thayer,and yet malek acquiesced to the increase without informing his client.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that thayer and malek violated section.
aiding and abetting 
the advisers act provides that the sec may seek an enforcement action against aiders and abettors of a violation of any provision of the statute.d.the primary violation here is thayer engag ing in a transaction,practice,or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.the argue that this provision permits a finding of thayer liability based on negligent acts,and,relying upon such reading of the statute,the argue that they can not aid and abet a negligent violation of the advisers act as a matter of law.we disagree.
as noted above,the advisers act reflects a congressional intent to eliminate,or at least to expose,all conflicts of interest which might incline an investment or render advice which was not disinterested.wall transcript,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also aaron,at.consistent with this broad understanding of liability,the advisers act makes it unlawful to engage in any transaction which operates as a fraud.that is,any transaction that functions or otherwise results in a fraud is punishable under this provision.thus,the advisers act holds liable negligent acts.and as the statute makes clear,the sec may seek an enforcement action against aiders and abettors of a violation of any provision of the advisers act,d,which would include certain negligent acts in violation of the advisers act.
here,there was substantial evidence to support a finding that dibella aided and abetted thayer and malek violation of the advisers act for implementing silvester fraudulent scheme,although they knew or should have known that the scheme was unlawful.dibella understood that his fee arrangement with thayer was to compensate him for his past work on the painewebber matter.dibella knew that he was not expected to render any financial or investment advice to thayer and did not in fact render any advice.before conferring with malek,dibella asked silvester to increase the amount of fund assets invested with thayer and expected to receive a higher fee as a result.based on dibella activity,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that a reasonable jury could find that dibella knew that the thayer investment defrauded the fund and that dibella acted to encourage the thayer investment and thus the fraud.
ii.jury instructions 
in a civil case,this court review s jury instructions as a whole to determine if they provide a misleading impression or inadequate understanding of the law and will reverse on this basis only if the appellants can show that in viewing the charge given as a whole,they were prejudiced by the error.schwartz liberty mut.ins,cir internal citation,quotation marks,and brackets omitted see also.t his court may review jury instructions and verdict sheets for fundamental error even when a litigant has not complied with the.objection requirements.jarvis ford motor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the fundamental error standard is more stringent than the plain error standard applicable to criminal appeals under federal rule of criminal procedure b.fabri united techs.int l,cir.for the error to be fundamental,it must be so serious and flagrant that it goes to the very integrity of the trial.jarvis,at internal quotation marks omitted.did not object to the jury instruction at trial,and therefore this court reviews the instruction for fundamental error.
in instructing the jury,the district court explained that the legislative purpose of both section b and section is to ensure fair dealing and to outlaw deceptive and unfair practices by those selling or buying securities.the statutes thems
