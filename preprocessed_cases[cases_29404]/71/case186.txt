in this putative class action,plaintiffs collectively purchased shares in leveraged proshares exchangetraded funds etfs during the august,through june,class period.third amended complaint tac.they seek to hold defendants appellees proshares trust and proshares trust ii collectively,proshares liable for material omissions and misrepresentations in the prospectuses for those etfs pursuant to sections and of the securities act of act,
exchange traded funds 
in a series of press releases,proshares indicated that their etfs were for investors interested in pursuing more sophisticated trading strategies.see tac internal quotation marks omitted.with proshares etfs,investors could hedge and manage risk without having to go through the process of setting up margin accounts or covering margin calls they could simply trade proshares.tac quoting june,press release.and unlike a margin account,an investor ca lose more than she invest s.tac quoting,press release.this is because etfs operate like indexed mutual funds but trade like stocks.tac.
etfs frequently track an index,a sector of stocks,or a commodity or currency.tac.they are considered to be indexed mutual funds that trade like stocks,tac,but they differ from mutual funds because they are generally sold to institutional investors in large blocks of shares,called creation units.these investors generally purchase creation units in exchange for baskets of securities that mirror the securities in the etf portfolio.investors who purchase creation units often split up the units into individual shares and sell them on a secondary market to retail investors who otherwise might not be able to access etfs because of the cost of creation units.these retail investors are then able to sell shares of etfs on the secondary market,but they generally can not redeem shares with the etfs because the etfs often redeem shares only when they are packaged in creation units.tac.
proshares offered three types of etfs an inverse etf,an ultra long etf,and an ultra short etf.tac a c.an inverse etf aimed to replicate the inverse movement of the specified index over one day.tac a.an ultra long etf tried to double the performance of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis.tac b.and an ultra short etf was designed to double the inverse of the performance of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis.tac c.accordingly,if the specific index,benchmark,sector or commodity on which an etf was based increase d by on a given day,then the inverse etf would decrease by the ultra long etf would increase by and the ultra short etf would decrease by.tac.each one of the etfs in this case is leveraged.
registration statements 
proshares i filed its registration statement on sec form n.tac.proshares ii filed its registration statement on forms s and s.tac.the registration statements consisted of,inter alia,a prospectus and a statement of additional information sai.though proshares i and proshares ii provided investors with several different offering documents relevant to this appeal,proshares key disclosures relating to the etfs at issue here were materially consistent across all of the documents.
all relevant proshares registration statements disclosed that the etfs pursued daily investment objectives and daily investment results.see skinner,app x a,item app x b,item.proshares i offering documents make clear that these daily objectives were bets that it could return a stated multiple of an etf underlying index each day by investing in different components of the underlying index through various financial instruments.for example,principal investment strategies include d i nvesting in equity securities financial instruments including derivatives that proshare advisors believe d,in combination,w ould have similar daily price return characteristics of a stated multiple of the etf underlying index.june,proshares i reg.stmt at.
to achieve the predicted daily investment results,proshare advisors or a sponsor would determine the type,quantity,and mix of investment positions that an etf should hold.in addition,proshares reserved the right to substitute a different index or security for an etf underlying index and disclosed that it might or certain components contained in the underlying index.see,id.at see also,proshares ii reg.stmt.at.furthermore,the etfs never took a defensive position and would remain fully invested at all times in securities financial instruments that provide exposure to its u nderlying i ndex without regard to market conditions,trends,or direction.june,proshares i reg.stmt at see also,proshares ii reg.stmt.at.the etfs views were expressly myopic objectives were blurred because they were focused only on meeting a benchmark tied to an underlying index one day at a time with a portfolio of different securities.
moreover,proshares warned that its decision to invest in a particular stock or financial instrument was not based on the investment merit of a particular security,instrument,or company and that it did not use conventional stock research or analysis,or forecast stock movement or trends in managing the assets of the funds.june,proshares i reg.stmt at see also,proshares ii reg.stmt.at.instead,proshares etfs pursued daily results through aggressive investment techniques.for proshares i,each registration statement warned that the etfs used financial instruments and investment techniques that may be considered aggressive,including the use of futures contracts,options on futures contracts,securities and indices,forward contracts,swap agreements,and similar instruments.see skinner,app x a,item.proshares i also disclosed that use of these techniques and financial instruments exposed the etfs to potentially dramatic losses.id.similarly,each relevant proshares ii prospectus warned that the aggressive financial instruments had volatile trading prices,and that even a small movement in market prices could cause large losses because an etf investment was speculative and involved a high degree of risk.see,app x b,item.
proshares also warned that etfs could not pursue their stated objectives for periods because mathematical compounding and leveraging prevented the etfs from reaching those results.see,app x a,item app x b,item.in that regard,proshares disclosed that o ver time,the cumulative percentage increase or decrease in the net asset value of the etfs may diverge significantly from the cumulative percentage increase or decrease in the multiple of the return of the underlying index due to a compounding effect of daily gains and losses for proshares ii,the warning was even more direct u sing leverage should be considered.speculative and could result in the total loss of an investor investment.see,app x b,item.in its brief,proshares provided a hypothetical illustration of two investors who invested in an ultra long etf at separate times to illustrate the effect an index volatility would have on those investments returns.we have provided that example in appendix 
alleged omissions and misstatements 
plaintiffs principally complain that proshares failed to disclose the magnitude and probability of loss for investments in proshares etfs despite investors correct predictions regarding the overall movement of the indices underlying the etfs.furthermore,plaintiffs allege that the registration statements contained various of successful investments which the above omissions made materially misleading.the district court rejected these arguments and dismissed the complaint with prejudice pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in re proshares trust sec,d.in sum,the district court concluded that proshares warned of the risks that materialized.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
discussion 
the standard of review is neither contested nor determinative 
alleged omissions 
liability attaches to a security issuer,its underwriter,and certain other statutorily enumerated parties pursuant to section of the act if any part of the operative registration statements omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.a see also in re morgan stanley info.fund sec,cir.to state a plausible section claim based on an alleged omission,a complaint must pass two distinct hurdles it must identify an omission that is unlawful and material.see morgan stanley,at.in other words,m ateriality alone does not demand disclosure,nor does the duty to disclose encompass information.panther partners,ikanos commc ns,d.
a plaintiff who plausibly pleads an unlawful omission comes close to stating a section claim because materiality will rarely be dispositive in a motion to dismiss.see morgan stanley,at.nevertheless,the materiality hurdle remains a meaningful pleading obstacle,and we will dismiss a section claim where the alleged omission was so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds would agree on that omission unimportance.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in fact,the supreme court has been careful not to set too low a standard of materiality,for fear that management would bury the shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information.matrixx initiatives,siracusano,d quoting basic levinson,d.
in judging whether an alleged omission was material in light of the information already disclosed to investors,we consider whether there is a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted material would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information already made available.demaria andersen,cir emphasis added quoting tsc,northway,d.it is not sufficient to allege that the investor might have considered the misrepresentation or omission important.ganino citizens utils,cir.while the objective of a prospectus is to solicit investment by the general public and the intended audience encompasse s both sophisticated financial analysts and untutored lay persons,greenapple detroit edison,cir,the prospectuses are not required to address reasonable investors as if they were children in kindergarten,id.quoting richland crandall.in the words of the district court below,w hen a registration statement warns of the exact risk that later materialized,a s ection claim will not lie as a matter of law.proshares,d at.
here,the district court concisely summarized plaintiffs allegations the thrust of the p laintiffs s ection claim is that the registration statements omitted the risk that the etfs,when held for a period of greater than one day,could lose substantial value in a relatively brief period of time,particularly in periods of high volatility.id.at.the district court dismissed that claim in equally concise language the disclosures in the registration statements accurately conveyed the specific risk that the p laintiffs assert materialized when investors held the etfs for periods longer than one day the funds performance widely diverged from the performance of the underlying indices sometimes resulting in losses despite the overall direction of the underlying indices.id.at.we agree that the relevant prospectuses adequately warned the reasonable investor of the allegedly omitted risks.
the magnitude of beyond a day losses 
plaintiffs allege that the registration statements omitted the risk that correctly predicting the movement in an etf underlying index could result in a substantial loss in their investment over that same period of time.plaintiffs acknowledge that the prospectuses warned that the value of etf investments may diverge significantly from that etf underlying index.pls.br.at.the complaint even recognizes that the proshares etfs did not seek to achieve long term cumulative investment returns in their etfs and that they could not seek such returns.tac.plaintiffs assert,however,that the diverge significantly disclosure does not speak to a divergence that results in actual,substantial loss.
in evaluating a prospectus,we read it as a whole.demaria,at internal quotation omitted.as we read the prospectus,we consider whether the disclosures and representations,taken together and in context,would have misl ed a reasonable investor about the nature of the securities.id.quoting mcmahan wherehouse entm t,cir.as we have explained,a prospectus will violate federal securities laws if it does not disclose material objective factual matters,or buries those matters beneath information,or treats them cavalierly.demaria,at quoting olkey hyperion term trust,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the district court concluded that it was not possible to read the registration statements without understanding that the etfs were particularly risky and speculative and were intended to meet their stated goal only over the course of a single day.proshares,d at.the district court reasoned that while some p laintiffs lost money while guessing correctly on the direction of the underlying index,this possibility is plainly consistent with the significant divergence that was disclosed in the registration statements.id.on appeal,plaintiffs maintain that the district court overvalued the diverge significantly disclosure because d iverge significantly is not a synonym for loss and refers only to an etfs outperforming or underperforming a perfect correlation with its index.at the very least,they argue,diverge significantly does not include large,rapid losses.pls.br.at.
we are unpersuaded by this argument,and plaintiffs efforts to find a meaningful distinction between diverge significantly and actual loss strains the plain meaning of the former phrase.because one might expect the longterm value of an etf to correlate with the value of its underlying index,proshares warned that the actual results might diverge significantly from that prediction.significant means large or important in the context of the offering documents,divergence means the opposite from one expectation.proshares significant divergence disclosures,fairly read,put investors on notice that an etf value might move in a direction quite different from and even contrary to what an investor might otherwise expect.
plaintiffs use a linguistic preference to read out of the prospectuses a scenario which the proshares disclosures clearly contemplate.time and again,we have said that disclosure is not a rite of confession or exercise in common law pleading.morgan stanley,at internal quotation marks omitted.because the role of the materiality requirement is not to attribute to investors a simplicity,we presume that a reasonable investor can comprehend the basic meaning of disclosures and will not credit plaintiffs narrow reading of diverge significantly.see basic,at citations omitted.
perhaps more importantly,the diverge significantly disclosure takes on additional meaning within the context of the prospectus as a whole.the earliest relevant prospectuses make absolutely clear that the etfs operated pursuant to daily investment objectives,that they utilized leveraged investment techniques to achieve those objectives,and that mathematical compounding combined with leveraging prevented the etfs from achieving their stated objectives over a period of time greater than one day.all the proshares i prospectuses make clear that etfs used aggressive financial instruments and investment techniques that exposed the etfs to potentially dramatic losses in the value of its portfolio holdings and imperfect correlation to the index underlying proshares ii warned that volatility could result in a total loss of an investor investment.see skinner,app x a,item app x b,item.
accordingly,we conclude that it is implausible that substituting actual loss for diverge significantly is a change substantially likely to be viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the import of the total mix of information proshares made available.see basic,at.
the probability of long term loss 
plaintiffs also complain that proshares omitted that certain market circumstances would necessarily cause quick and potentially large losses despite an investor correct prediction of the overall,direction of an etf underlying index.pls.br.at emphasis added see also id.at tac.the complaint further asserts that proshares possessed an undisclosed mathematical formula which very accurately predicted and described the relationship between the movements in each ty
