stephens,stephens petition for panel rehearing is granted.we vacate our prior opinion in this case,cir,and substitute the following in its place.
the plaintiff,financial security assurance,fsa,appeals the district court orders dismissing its rule claim and granting summary judgment in favor of defendants stephens and hayes,james associates,hayes james on its claims for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation.the primary issue presented in this case is whether an insurer of municipal bonds that becomes the owner of those bonds upon default has standing pursuant to b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder.we conclude that,under the facts of this case,they do not.after thorough review,we affirm the district court dismissal of the rule claim and grant of summary judgment on the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims.
in the early,crisp county,georgia approved plans for a regional solid waste processing facility the facility,which would extend the life of a landfill by removing recyclable material from waste before dumping the remainder into the landfill.the county established the solid waste management authority of crisp county the authority to construct and operate the facility.to finance its initial construction,the authority obtained approximately million in bank loans in the bank financing.
once constructed,the authority would obtain revenue for the facility by accepting waste from cities,counties and private companies and by selling materials of value mov from the waste it collected.accordingly,before the facility was built,the authority contracted with more than thirty of these entities the participants,each of which agreed to make minimum payments to the authority based on the expected tonnage of waste the authority would collect or the number of households the authority would service in the city or county.they executed put or pay contracts.the authority also contracted with transwaste services llc transwaste,a waste hauler,to pick up the participants waste and deliver it to the facility,paying a tipping fee for each ton delivered.transwaste agreed to deliver enough waste for the authority to break even.in turn,the authority agreed that transwaste would receive a rebate from the authority revenues from the sale of recyclable mov.
the authority contracted with defendant hayes james for civil engineering services,including the conduct of a feasibility study based on the bank financing and the preparation of a report on the results of an acceptance test that hayes james had developed for the facility equipment.
the authority hired stephens to act as underwriter for a bond financing for the facility.in early,stephens prepared a request for proposal rfp for potential credit enhancers,including fsa.the rfp included a pro forma financial representation the pro forma.the rfp disclaimer instructed potential credit enhancers to perform their own due diligence.
fsa assigned one of its employees,margaret gifford,to analyze the rfp and make a recommendation as to whether fsa should insure the bonds.gifford toured the facility and obtained information about the equipment,the quantities of waste delivered and processed,and the amount of mov recovered.she recommended that fsa insure the bonds.gifford report noted that the authority contracts were the ultimate security for the bond issue.she reviewed only one sample contract between the authority and a participant,however,and she did not request copies of the contracts with transwaste or with crisp county.gifford testified in her deposition that she did not perform any due diligence after july.
fsa submitted a bid in late july,which was later accepted.the bid was conditioned on full review of all legal documentation pertaining to the deal.
the rfp indicated that the facility would be subjected to an acceptance test to ensure that the facility met its design specifications.hayes james supplied the acceptance test design specifications for inclusion in the rfp,based on the original contract created in connection with the bank financing.hayes james made a few minor changes to these specifications and then provided them to stephens for inclusion in the rfp.the acceptance test was administered after fsa agreed to insure the bonds.fsa never requested a copy of the test results,nor did it inquire as to how the facility performed.
after stephens accepted fsa bid,stephens counsel prepared a preliminary official statement the pos for the authority.though her duties were officially finished by that point,gifford testified that she did glance at the pos when it was provided to fsa.ron millet,counsel for fsa,also testified that he read and made suggestions regarding at least one draft of the pos.
in october,at the request of transwaste,the authority and transwaste executed an amendment to their contract.the amendment extended the period for which transwaste was eligible for its rebate based on mov receipts and delayed enforcement of the guarantee requirement.stephens did not notify fsa of this amendment or the conversations that led to it.also in october,stephens,hayes james,and the authority prepared a budget for the authority,which was sent to fsa.hayes james also provided a budget certification letter the bcl,certifying that the budget was reasonable.
the bond transaction closed on november,the bond closing.the final version of the official statement the os was delivered to fsa just prior to the closing.within two months of the bond closing,the authority informed fsa that it was revising its budget and cash flow analysis.fsa terminated gifford employment shortly thereafter,based in part on her performance in this transaction.the authority and transwaste then further amended their contract by reducing the tipping fee and relieving transwaste of its tonnage guarantee.eventually,the authority exhausted its debt service reserve fund and was unable to continue making payments on the bonds.
in anticipation of litigation,the parties to this action entered into a tolling agreement on march.on december,fsa brought the present action in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia,alleging federal securities fraud under rule against stephens and state law claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation against both stephens and hayes james.the district court later granted stephens rule b motion to dismiss the federal securities claim.after a period of discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the state law claims,which the district court granted,based primarily on fsa failure to meet the due diligence requirements for justifiable reliance under georgia law.fsa then filed the instant appeal.
iii.discussion 
the district court dismissed fsa rule claim on the ground that fsa was not a purchaser or seller of securities as required by the rule authorizing statute,b of the exchange act,b,and thus lacked standing to bring the claim.
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.roberts florida power light,cir.in order for the plaintiff to satisfy his obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief,he must allege more than labels and conclusions his complaint must include f actual allegations adequate to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.bell atlantic twombly,d may,citations and quotations omitted.stated differently,the factual allegations in a complaint must possess enough heft to set forth a plausible entitlement to relief.at.moreover,while notice pleading may not require that the pleader allege a specific fact to cover every element or allege with precision each element of a claim,it is still necessary that a complaint contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements necessary to sustain a recovery under some viable legal theory.roe aware woman ctr.for choice,cir quoting in re plywood antitrust,cir.unit a.
in blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d,the supreme court endorsed the standing rule created by birnbaum newport steel,cir,which permits only purchasers and sellers of securities,and those with contracts to purchase and sell securities,to bring suit under rule.the blue chip stamps court noted that three principal categories of plaintiffs are excluded from standing potential purchasers of shares who allege that they decided not to purchase because of the alleged violations actual shareholders in the issuer who allege that they decided not to sell their shares because of the alleged violations and shareholders,creditors,and perhaps others related to an issuer who suffered loss in the value of their investment due to corporate or insider activities in connection with the purchase or sale of securities which violate rule.blue chip stamps,at.stephens contends that fsa is thus excluded.
fsa contends that it has standing on four independent grounds as the true party at risk in this transaction,it was effectively the purchaser of the bonds it is entitled to standing as a guarantor of the bonds it actually purchased the securities pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy and it is fully subrogated to the rights of the individual bondholders and therefore entitled to bring suit based on their purchases.
party at risk 
fsa suggests that as the true party at risk in the bond transaction,it should have standing to assert a claim under rule.that is,fsa argues that it satisfies the requirement set forth in birnbaum and endorsed by the supreme court in blue chip stamps,because,as the insurer of the bonds,it bore the risk that a purchaser would ordinarily bear.fsa is mistaken,however,in interpreting the requirement to entail a functional,and not a formal,inquiry.although the supreme court discussed the functional aspects of the rule in its reasoning,the court deliberately endorsed a standing rule that would not be subject to endless erosion by courts employing a functional analysis to every new group of potential plaintiffs.see blue chip stamps,at.accordingly,fsa assumption of risk in the bond transaction does not provide it with rule standing.
ii.guarantor standing 
fsa argues that it also has standing as a guarantor of the bonds.fsa first contends that it has standing as a guarantor because a guarantor qualifies as a purchaser of securities.this is not so.granting standing to a guarantor as a purchaser would contravene the rule that this court announced in pelletier,cir,that,consistent with blue chip stamps,a plaintiff must have actually purchased or sold,or entered into an enforceable contract to purchase or sell,securities to have standing under rule.id.at.
fsa next advances the novel theory that,in insuring the bonds,it sold a security,that is,a guaranty.this argument fails because a guaranty does not qualify as a security for rule purposes.section a of the exchange act defines a security as follows 
the term security means any note,stock,treasury stock,bond,debenture,certificate of interest or participation in any agreement or in any oil,gas,or other mineral royalty or lease,any certificate,preorganization certificate or subscription,transferable share,investment contract,certificate,certificate of deposit for a security,or in general,any instrument commonly known as a security or any certificate of interest or participation in,temporary or interim certificate for,receipt of,or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase,any of the foregoing 
a.as the foregoing definition does not include a guaranty,fsa lacks standing as a guarantor of the bonds.
iii.contract to otherwise acquire the bonds 
fsa further argues that its insurance policy constitutes a contract to purchase the bonds,qualifying fsa as a purchaser pursuant to blue chip stamps.notably,a of the exchange act defines the term purchase to include any contract to buy,purchase,or otherwise acquire securities.see a emphasis added.the policy provides that 
u pon disbursement in respect of a bond,fsa shall become the owner of the bond,any appurtenant coupon to the bond or right to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on the bond and shall be fully subrogated to the rights of the owner,including the owner right to receive payments under the bond,to the extent of any payment by fsa hereunder.
accordingly,fsa contends that it acquired a contingent interest in the bonds because the policy constitutes a contract to otherwise acquire them upon the occurrence of a specified contingent event,that is,default.
stephens counters that fsa failed to allege a crucial element of a rule action in its it had purchased or sold a security.as stephens notes,fsa did not specifically allege that it had entered into a contract to acquire the bonds.nor did fsa attach the insurance policy or quote relevant terms of the policy in its complaint.indeed,on reading the allegations in fsa complaint,one could understand fsa to be advancing a theory of standing based solely on the fact that it suffered economic harm as a result of the defendant alleged fraud,a basis that was rejected in blue chip stamps.
ordinarily,we do not consider anything beyond the face of the complaint and documents attached thereto when analyzing a motion to dismiss.brooks blue cross blue shield of,cir.this court recognizes an exception,however,in cases in which a plaintiff refers to a document in its complaint,the document is central to its claim,its contents are not in dispute,and the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss.harris ivax,cir brooks,at.here,fsa refers to the existence of the insurance policy and relies on the effect of the fsa is thereby required to make payments to the it does not quote from the policy or discuss its specific provisions.the question,then,is whether the policy is nevertheless central to fsa federal securities claim.
in considering this question,the first circuit has held,with respect to a complaint alleging libel and other related claims,that a magazine article referred to in the complaint and attached to the defendant motion to dismiss was central to the plaintiffs claim because p laintiffs unquestionably would have had to offer a copy of the article in order to prove their case.fudge penthouse int l,cir.according to that the plaintiff would have had to offer the document in order to prove its policy would appear to be central to fsa claim,for fsa would ultimately have to offer a copy of the policy to prevail under any conceivable theory of its case.
this case,however,presents a closer question than most cases in which this issue arises.the potential harm that courts are mindful of in these situations is the lack of notice that the attached document may be considered by the court.see,chambers time warner,cir g enerally,the harm to the plaintiff when a court considers material extraneous to a complaint is the lack of notice that the material may be considered.because stephens attached the policy to its motion to dismiss,we can not find that stephens lacked notice that the district court or this court might consider the document.accordingly,we will consider the policy appended to stephens motion to dismiss as part of the pleadings because it is referred to in the complaint,it is central to fsa federal securities claim,its consideration comports with the requirements of notice pleading,and neither party challenges its authenticity.
even considering the insurance policy,we conclude that fsa did not otherwise acquire a security,and,therefore,fsa does not have standing to bring a claim under rule.although by the insurance policy own terms fsa acquired the bonds upon default by the authority,we conclude that at the time of such transfer the instruments fsa acquired were no longer securities as required for standing under rule.
t o reach the question of an alleged violation of the provisions of the securities acts,the transaction at issue must involve a security as defined in the act.home guaranty ins.third fin.the supreme court has articulated three tests to determine whether an instrument is a security that is protected under the federal securities laws by means of being an investment contract,stock,or note.first,an instrument is an investment contract if it involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.sec howey.second,the characteristics typically associated with stock are that it grants the right to receive dividends contingent upon an apportionment of profits is negotiable grants the ability to be pledged or hypothecated confer s voting rights in proportion to the number of shares owned and has the capacity to appreciate in value.landreth timber landreth,d.third,the factors to consider when determining if an instrument is a note are whether the buyer is interested primarily in the profit the note is expected to generate,it is an instrument in which there is common trading for speculation or investment,the investing public reasonably expects the instrument to be a note,and no other regulatory scheme significantly reduces the risk of the instrument.reves ernst young,d.
in this case,the very terms of the insurance policy and the os regarding the revenue bonds explain why we conclude that fsa did not otherwise acquire a security.under the insurance policy,fsa was obligated to disburse that portion of the principal of an interest on the bonds that shall be due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer.once fsa disbursed the amount due for payment because of the authority,the insurance agreement specified that fsa became owner of the bond,any appurtenant coupon to the bond or right to receipt of payment of principal of or interest on the bond to the extent of any payment by financial security hereunder.according to fsa,this transfer of the bonds satisfied rule requirement that they otherwise acquired a security through the insurance contract.we do not disagree that fsa acquired the bonds through operation of the insurance policy.however,although fsa became the owner of the bonds,it did not acquire a security because,by the os own terms,fsa acquired no right to receive interest or principal in the bonds after disbursement under the os,once the bonds or a portion of the bonds were redeemed,the owners of such bonds or portions thereof ceased to be entitled to any benefit or security under the bond resolution.
on the date so designated for redemption series bonds or portions of series bonds so called for redemption will become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such series bonds or portions thereof on such date and such bonds or portions thereof will cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under the resolution and the owners of such bonds or portions thereof will have no rights in respect thereof except to receive payment of the redemption price thereof and the accrued interest and to the extent provided in the resolution,and to receive series bonds for any unredeemed portions of series bonds.
as such,after fsa acquired the bonds it had no right to past payments of principal and interest because the obligation to pay those portions of the bond had been discharged by fsa disbursement of the amount that was due for payment.
furthermore,fsa had no right to future payments.first,fsa owned the bonds only to the extent of any payment by fsa,and fsa has not disbursed future payments.second,as the bonds for which disbursement had been made by fsa were no longer entitled to any benefit or security under the resolution and the new owner,fsa,had no rights in respect thereof,fsa was not entitled to any future payments on the bonds.
the bonds that fsa acquired at default,therefore,were not securities because they failed to satisfy the definitions of either an investment contract,stock,or note as articulated by the supreme court.first,the bonds were not an investment contract because fsa did not acquire any profit to come solely from the efforts of others through the bonds.howey,at.fsa profit in this transaction came from the consideration paid by the authority for the issuance of the insurance policy,not from the bonds issued by the authority.second,the bonds were not stocks because they did not confer the right to vote or receive dividends and were not negotiable or transferable.landreth timber,at.third,the bonds were not notes because fsa was not interested primarily in the profit the note is expected to generate.reves,at.as discussed above,it does not appear that the bond had the potential to generate any profit for fsa because fsa discharged the debt obligations.furthermore,fsa issued the policy in return for consideration from the authority,not to invest in the bonds.although most instruments bearing a traditional title are likely to be covered by the definition of a security the label is not of itself sufficient to invoke the coverage of the acts.landreth timber,at.rather,the economic realities of the instrument actually conveyed ultimately govern whether the insurance contract is a security.reves,at.because the bonds that fsa acquired under the insurance policy were not securities within the meaning of the exchange act,a,the bonds did not confer standing for fsa to allege a violation of rule.
iv.subrogation 
finally,fsa argues that it has standing based on subrogation.subrogation is t he substitution of one person in the place of another with reference to a lawful claim,demand or right,so that he who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to the debt or claim,and its rights,remedies,or securities.jones motor anderson,quoting black law dictionary ed see also pearlman reliance ins,d.subrogation is either legal or conventional.legal subrogation is an equitable doctrine and arises by operation of the law without any agreement to that effect between the parties conventional subrogation rests on contract,arising where an agreement is made that the person paying the debt shall be subrogated to the rights and remedies of the original creditor.gilbert dunn,citation omitted see also state farm mut.auto.ins.cox.fsa argues that it has standing as a subrogee under both varieties of subrogation because it was obligated by contract to make interest and principal payments on the bonds,and it alleged that it was doing so and the insurance policy expressly stated that upon disbursement,fsa becomes fully subrogated to the rights of the bondholder.
stephens does not dispute that had fsa properly pleaded a subrogation claim,it might be entitled to standing stephens argues,however,that fsa can not recover under this theory because it failed to allege every element of a bondholder claim,as it must according to georgia law.see,nitrogen stevens shipping,holding that,when proceeding upon the theory of conventional subrogation,it is essential that a plaintiff allege facts showing the existence of a cause of action on the part of the subrogor against the defendant.
it appears clear that the bondholders in this case would have standing to bring a claim under rule,as they were the actual purchasers of the bonds.in its complaint,however,fsa failed to allege harm to the bondholders caused by the misrepresentations of stephens.instead,fsa alleged that stephens deceive d fsa and made material misrepresentations for the purpose and effect of inducing fsa to insure the bonds issued by the authority.fsa goes on to allege that,as a result,fsa could not properly assess the risk factors associated with insuring the bonds.as a subrogee,fsa can not file a complaint based on the harm it suffered itself.see liberty ins.holding charter,cir.we conclude,therefore,that fsa did not have standing to bring a claim under rule for harms it suffered,rather than harm suffered by the bondholders,under the theory of subrogation.
statute of limitations and due diligence 
stephens argues that,regardless of whether fsa has standing,fsa rule claim is and fsa failure to perform due diligence bars it from bringing a rule action.as we have already concluded that fsa lacks standing to bring a claim under rule,we need not address these issues.
state law fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of stephens and hayes james on fsa common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims,holding that stephens and hayes james did not owe fsa a duty to d
