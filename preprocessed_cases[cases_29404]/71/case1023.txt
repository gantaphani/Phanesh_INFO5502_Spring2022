charles nolon bush appeals his conviction on of counts charged in the indictment.a jury convicted bush of one count of securities fraud in violation b and a,eight counts of wire fraud in violation of,three counts of mail fraud in violation of,and fifteen counts of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions transactional money laundering in violation of.bush primarily contends that the government failed to prove that his transactions involved the profits of criminal distinction he argues is necessary under the supreme court decision in united states santos.because santos and its progeny dealt with money laundering under a different statute,bush argument that santos applies to a section conviction is a matter of first impression for this court.although we hold that santos applies to section convictions,it provides no relief to bush because his and fraud offenses do not merge as the crimes in santos did.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
bush investment schemes 
bush convictions arise from his creation and operation of three different investment programs in the western united states from until.over the course of what ultimately amounted to a,million ponzi scheme,bush lured approximately victims into investing with him.
in,after several years of marketing lackluster consumer products,bush met developer duane christy,who was seeking financing to construct a luxury resort in baja california to be known as cabo san quintin.bush pledged that he could provide million in financing to construct the resort.to raise this capital,bush began promoting several investments to the public.bush acquainted himself with other promoters by joining an organization called global prosperity.at various global prosperity workshops,bush was introduced to other people involved in such schemes.
hulaman management services 
in early,bush paid unlicensed and ecclesiastical lawyer glen stoll to start an ethereal legal entity known as a corporation soul.stoll filed articles of incorporation in washington state for an entity called director of the cornerstone institute cornerstone.bush began promoting securities known as notes under one of cornerstone auxiliary branches,hulaman management services hulaman.bush told investors that these notes generated profits from favorable movements and that investors could reap substantial gains in just over a month.according to his investors,bush promised an eight to return per year as well as a high probability of a return every four to six weeks.rather than structure the notes and manage the money himself,bush told investors that he was a facilitator for investments.
using his contacts from global prosperity,bush reinvested money given to him in two trading programs ifr trust,operated by larry wilcoxson of california,and mintus,operated by carolyn mintus of new york.at his trial,bush explained his understanding of mintus program into which he was placing investors money 
well,just they made these tranches.these trades were down,and they bought and sold paper.i hear it called bank note.i do know what it is.quite frankly i not a financier.
in addition to a return on his investments,mintus offered bush an million guarantee for his planned investment in cabo san quintin.
although bush testified that he made no promises about the returns he could provide and that his trading programs were based on his best efforts,his clients testified that he represented the investments as.he claimed the principal would remain in the investors own accounts and was secured by real estate or promissory notes.further,literature distributed by bush indicated that his investment had minimal risk and could produce up to a yearly return.according to a letter soliciting new investments,investor funds would be held in trust until the pool accumulated million.at that point,the pooled funds would be transferred to wilcoxson or mintus who would then place the money with a private merchant bank.after investors sent money,bush sent them a hulaman trust international trust and fiduciary agreement,which catalogued investors funds under the reassuring heading assets delivered in trust.soon after bush began to invest with mintus,she failed to make her first payment due to bush.despite this,bush testified that he remained confident about the viability of mintus program and continued to place money with her.
bush recruited several individuals to assist him in promoting hulaman.chief among them was his longtime marketing partner marilyn march.bush also tapped larry and vicki webster to work as financial planners and promoters,paying them a percentage of any funds they raised.bush hired march friend tammy stuckey to work as his administrative assistant.she was paid per week in cash.for his part,bush told investors that he lived an ascetic life and was merely a conduit for charity,using his profits from the trading program to fund his own charity,the from the heart foundation foundation.
beginning in february,and despite not receiving dividends from mintus,bush directed stuckey to prepare and send client account statements to hulaman investors showing balance increases of approximately percent per month.bush also began paying some investors percent returns on their initial investments.
in july,bush and march purchased a property in washington state known as view park golf estate view park.priced at million,this property included an home,a golf course,tennis and basketball courts,and a fishing pond.bush used funds from hulaman bank account to make the down payment on view park and pay the per month mortgage.bush and march used the home as a residence and meeting place for hulaman investors and foundation contributors.bush hired groundskeepers,a chef,a masseuse,and a personal staff for view park.in the summer of,bush hired new staff,including a personal secretary,to whom he paid a salary into an offshore bank account.after several employees objected to being paid exclusively in cash,bush began paying them through kelly temporary services.
using hulaman money,bush also entered into leases with the seattle mariners baseball team and seattle seahawks football team for luxury suites at their respective stadiums.bush invited prospective investors to join him in the suites for various sporting events.
global dominion financial services 
in august,the federal bureau of investigation fbi began probing wilcoxson and mintus,executing search warrants to gather evidence about their offerings of notes.one month later,bush informed his investors that hulaman had moved its operations to the caribbean of nevis and was now operating under the moniker global dominion financial services global dominion.under global dominion,bush promoted investments in international financial institutions.again promising an annual return,with sporadic interest payments,bush asked investors to wire transfer him money at the bank crozier in grenada or to send money to his associate nigel grant,an attorney in coronado,california.bush told investors that a payment to grant was necessary to establish the nevis,which would hold their money.bush transferred all hulaman files to grant law office in coronado.after bush personal secretary traveled to coronado to organize the files,grant began sending account statements from his law office to global dominion investors.
grant began posting investor account statements on global dominion new website.for the first trading period under global dominion watch,client statements showed a percent return on investment.as was the case with hulaman,neither bush nor his associates at global dominion were reaping substantial returns from their investments in mintus and wilcoxson.indeed,of the million bush claims to have invested with wilcoxson and mintus from both hulaman and global dominion,bush received back a pittance of.nevertheless,global dominion continued to post new earnings to client account statements.
on october,bush received a letter from the washington state department of financial institutions dfi which questioned the legality of his operations.bush sought counsel from stoll,his unlicensed attorney.stoll sent a letter on bush behalf to the dfi denying that bush was connected to any improper activity.
beginning in december and continuing through may,bush and his associates directed their office manager in nevis to transfer money from the bank crozier to various accounts in the united states.these included mintus account in new york,grant account in the bahamas,and various bush accounts in seattle.fifteen of these transactions to bush accounts,each in excess of,formed the basis for the unlawful monetary transaction charges in this case counts.according to bush office manager,money was never paid out to global dominion investors.
in may,bush began winding down global dominion.when investors called to inquire about the absence of dividends,bush told an employee in nevis to placate them by claiming there were delays at the federal reserve in new york that prevented wire transfers.when investors called back to see if the money had been freed up,employees repeated the lies.
cornerstone institute 
in july,bush signed an installment contract that formalized his commitment to provide million in financing for cabo san quintin.thereafter,bush began operating the cornerstone institute and recruited new investors for another notes scheme,purportedly secured by bush interest in cabo san quintin.bush did not inform investors that his interest was subject to his satisfaction of the million financing obligation.bush provided prospective investors an application packet that included instructions and an escrow agreement.investors received monthly account statements,which again reflected frequent and substantial dividend returns sometimes percent of the principal.despite the good news communicated to investors,bush was still not generating returns from cabo san quintin,mintus,or wilcoxson.by the end of,he had paid less than million out of the million due under his obligation to the resort.
since bush was unable to find any new investors by to permit him to fund his cabo san quintin obligations,his partners in cabo san quintin forced him out of the project.in june,view park was repossessed by its former owner after bush and march stopped making payments on the mortgage.in july,bush moved to paris.
in total,between and,hulaman,global dominion,and cornerstone received more than million from investors.as noted earlier,bush placed million in the ponzi schemes run by wilcoxson and mintus.he also placed with wilcoxson personally and million with mintus personally.he paid million back to investors who requested payments of dividends.he paid more than million in expenses and salaries.finally,he diverted million to his own accounts,including million in cash withdrawals,and funds used to purchase and make improvements to view park,and to purchase artwork and make gifts to friends and family.
on august,a federal grand jury returned a count indictment against bush.after being extradited from poland in january,bush was arraigned in the western district of washington.
ii.bush trial and sentence 
bush jury trial commenced in october.at the close of the government,bush did not move for a judgment of acquittal.
bush testified at trial about his investment offerings and dealings with wilcoxson and mintus.he stated his belief that both of their investment programs were legitimate enterprises,even explaining how mintus took impressive steps to satisfy his due diligence.for instance,bush claimed that at his first meeting with mintus,she was accompanied by two former board members of the federal reserve bank of new york.bush detailed how he had divided investor money into three to mintus,transfers to mexico,and operational expenses.because he had sworn secrecy to his associates,bush was unable to inform his investors about how he invested their money.when asked why he was using investor money to buy the house and the suvs and the masseuse and the chef,bush responded,the only reason i am doing that is because i believe that there is money sitting in new york that offset sic this.he then admitted he never told investors about mintus defaults.in total,mintus purportedly owed bush more than million.
bush shifted significant responsibility for planning the investment scheme to grant and his other associates,claiming that grant designed the structure of global dominion in nevis,as well as its business plan.although he stated that grant and others had completely taken over global dominion in nevis,bush conceded that he could direct wire transfers.
bush testified that the million he and march spent to remodel view park enabled them to use the property for the foundation.he claimed that other expenditures amounted to asset placement,and that his repeated per day bank withdrawals were for charity and employee salaries.
prior to charging the jury,bush requested that the district court give an instruction predicated on an defense to fraudulent intent.finding no factual basis in the trial record,the district court declined to give the instruction and,instead,gave an instruction that good faith is a complete defense to those charges where intent was at issue.
the jury convicted bush on the count,eight counts,three counts,and all fifteen counts.bush was acquitted on five counts that did not involve financial transactions.
the district court sentenced bush to months months for the securities fraud,months for the money laundering to run consecutive with months,and months for the wire fraud to run concurrent.the district court ordered bush to pay million in restitution and the mandatory special assessment.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
bush asserts two errors.first,he argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions under because the government did not prove that his bank transfers included the profits of his criminal activities.second,he assigns error to the district court refusal to give a jury instruction he proposed.both contentions are without merit.
sufficiency of the evidence for convictions 
this is the first proceeding where bush has objected to the sufficiency of evidence submitted by the government to convict him of transactional money laundering.evidence is sufficient for conviction if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states mincoff,cir quoting united states dearing,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while we normally undertake such reviews de novo,because bush failed to move for acquittal before the district court,we will only apply plain error analysis here and examine the conviction to ensure there was no manifest miscarriage of justice.united states green,cir.
bush argument is.first,he claims that his convictions are not distinct crimes from the fifteen convictions.bush asserts that proceeds in the money laundering statute must mean the profits,rather than the receipts,of predicate crimes.he proffers the legal hypothesis that whenever a predicate offense to money laundering necessarily involves the payment of the crime receipts,the offense merges with the predicate crime.assuming his premise is sound,bush proceeds to his second argument that the government did not present evidence to allow the jury to distinguish which money he laundered for his personal profit and which he laundered to pay the costs of his ponzi scheme.
money laundering proceeds 
enacted in,the money laundering control act added to the criminal code two substantive offenses for laundering monetary and.a,stat.both statutes prohibit conducting monetary transactions with the proceeds of criminal activity,albeit in different ways.section a uses proceeds twice in its substantive text,which provides 
whoever,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity shall be guilty of a crime.
by contrast,section a provides 
whoever,in any of the circumstances set forth in subsection d,knowingly engages or attempts to engage in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property of a value greater than and is derived from specified unlawful activity,shall be guilty of a crime.
a.while proceeds does not appear in section a description of the offense,subsection f incorporates the term into the statute when it defines criminally derived property to mean any property constituting,or derived from,proceeds obtained from a criminal offense.id.f emphasis added.at the time relevant here,section f provided that specified unlawful activity has the meaning given that term in section.id.f 
the meaning of proceeds in section has received significant judicial attention in recent years after the supreme court plurality decision in united states santos.two of our states van alstyne,cir,and united states moreland.cir have wrestled with the meaning of justice scalia plurality opinion in santos,as well as justice stevens concurrence.
the defendant in santos was convicted,inter alia,of operating an illegal lottery and section money laundering.at.after he received money from gamblers,santos paid a commission to his employees and then paid lottery winners.id.those payments formed the basis of the charges.id.in habeas proceedings,santos challenged the propriety of his conviction,claiming his transactions were merely the distribution of receipts from the form of payments to runners,winners,and opposed to the profits of the illegal lottery.id.at.the district court and seventh circuit agreed and vacated the convictions.
the supreme court affirmed,although no opinion commanded a majority of the court.in the four justice plurality opinion,justice scalia held that because proceeds,as then defined under section could fairly be interpreted to mean either profits or receipts,the rule of lenity meant that the tie went to the defendants.id.at.in santos,accepting the government proffered interpretation that proceeds meant receipts would yield a peculiar person who operated an illegal lottery would,by default,simultaneously commit money laundering because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts.id.at.this created a merger problem.id.at.the plurality went on to note that this merger problem was not limited to transactions in furtherance of an illegal lottery and noted that f or a host of predicate crimes,merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime.id.justice scalia highlighted that t he government suggests no explanation for why congress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the criminal code to radically increase the sentence for that crime.id.at.
unwilling to categorically define proceeds to mean profits,justice stevens concurred in the judgment and limited his opinion to the illegal gambling context.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.his concurrence endorsed the plurality view on merger as applied to illegal gambling prosecutions.id.at quoting plurality opinion.
in van alstyne,we considered the import of santos for the first time.see at.there,we overturned two convictions committed in furtherance of a ponzi scheme when the evidence at trial showed the transactions were merely putative dividends paid by the defendant for the purpose of encouraging further principal contributions by investors.id.at.we posited that proceeds means profits where viewing proceeds as receipts would present a merger problem of the kind that troubled the plurality and concurrence in santos.id.at.we reasoned that santos did not examine the statute itself but,rather,inquired into the elements and purpose of the predicate offense from which the laundered funds were derived.see id.at considering the elements and purpose of the statute.because fraud statutes prohibit the broader scheme to defraud as opposed to the completed fraud,id.citing neder united states,the appropriate test was whether the money laundering was a central component of the defendant criminal scheme.van alstyne,at.because two of van alstyne transactions furthered his fraud by encouraging new investment to the ponzi scheme,we adhered to justice scalia reasoning that a defendant should not be punished for t ransactions that normally occur during the course of running a n illegal scheme.santos,at.consistent with this view,we upheld van alstyne third conviction because it concerned a transaction to refund an investor principal outlay and thereby left fewer funds available to lull other investors into maintaining their investment.van alstyne,at.
more recently,in moreland,we again applied the central to the scheme to defraud framework where the defendant used a pyramid scheme to obtain in excess of million from investors.moreland,at.but united states.webster,cir we read santos as holding that where,as here,a money laundering count is based on transfers among of money from the sale of drugs,proceeds includes all receipts from such sales.we reversed two convictions that corresponded to wire transfers for the purpose of paying commissions central to carrying out the scheme objective of encouraging further investment.moreland,at.on grounds not relevant here,we upheld several other counts in moreland because the jury instructions did not require a specific showing of proceeds,and it was thus irrelevant whether profits of the illegal activity were involved.id.at.
applicability of santos to 
because bush was convicted of engaging in unlawful monetary transactions under,while santos,van alstyne,and moreland all concerned money laundering under the companion section,we first consider whether bush convictions are covered by santos and its progeny.the government briefly notes that santos applicability is not clear and obvious in this context.we decline to draw such a superficial distinction between two coordinate statutes and hold that santos applies with equal force to transactions prosecuted under section.
as noted earlier,sections and contain different elements but have a common genesis.for purposes here,the statutory differences do not concern the usage or meaning of proceeds instead the crimes differ with respect to the knowledge element.section does not require that the defendant know of a design to conceal aspects of the transaction or that anyone have such a design,while section has that requirement.see united states wynn,citation omitted.both sections make explicit use of the word proceeds,and since they were enacted together in the money laundering control act,we follow the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.dep t of revenue of or.acf,citations and some internal quotation marks omitted.our reading of the terms as synonymous across these statutes is supported further by the in section f that specified unlawful activity has the meaning given the term in section and further buttressed by the fact that both sections target transactions.f see brown,at textual confirms this conclusion,envtl.def.duke energy,thomas,concurring when congress repeats the same word in a different statutory context,it is possible that congress might have intended the context to alter the meaning of the word.emphasis added.likewise,the sixth circuit,in holding that santos applies to section concluded that i t makes particular sense to give the words an identical meaning here because the two statutes cover the same subject matter in a common way.united states kratt.
the statutory symmetry between sections and is but one reason to extend the meaning of santos.even more important is that santos and its progeny are less an examination of the statutes and more an inquiry into the predicate crimes which generate funds to be laundered.see santos,at for a host of predicate crimes,merger would depend on the manner and timing of payment for the expenses associated with the commission of the crime.as we highlighted in van alstyne,the import of santos is its requirement that a court evaluate whether the government has been redundant in its prosecution of a fraudulent
