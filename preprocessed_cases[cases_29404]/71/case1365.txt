an attorney representing the purchaser of stock agreed to act as an escrow holder for the transaction.the seller delivered his stock certificates to the attorney,to be held in escrow.after delays in the closing of the transaction,the seller decided to terminate the sale.he provided to both the purchaser and the attorney a written notice of rescission and demand to return documents.this notwithstanding,the attorney proceeded to close the transaction and to deliver the stock certificates to the transfer agent with instructions to effectuate the transfer of the shares.
in the ensuing litigation,the seller obtained a judgment against the attorney and his law firm.the attorney and his law firm appeal.they contend that closing escrow with the expectation that the seller would sue was the functional equivalent of filing an interpleader action.they also argue that the court erred in precluding the introduction of evidence of privileged communications with their clients and in permitting the use of jury instructions that identified the seller as a party to whom the attorney owed a duty as an escrow holder.furthermore,the attorney and his law firm try to convince this court that affirming the judgment would discourage attorneys everywhere from acting as escrow holders in transactions in which their clients participate.
the attorney and his law firm sought the backing of the los angeles county bar association the bar association with respect to the appeal,by asking that it file an amicus brief on their behalf.the bar association did file a brief,albeit couched in general terms.the bar association contends that it is important for lawyers to be poised to act as escrow holders and that a lawyer who carries out the escrow instructions in strict accordance with the conditions jointly agreed to by the parties should not face third party tort liability exposure simply for engaging in that conduct.
that simple proposition,however,does not resolve the case before us.here,the attorney closed the transaction before the conditions of the escrow instructions had been satisfied,before the parties had reached written agreement on material contract terms,and after he had received a notice of rescission and demand for return of documents.what the attorney did was the one thing he was not at liberty to do.he not only breached a duty,as escrow holder,to the seller of the stock,he also converted the stock when he forwarded the certificates to the transfer agent with directions to transfer the same.
closing escrow and delivering the stock certificates to the transfer agent was in no wise the functional equivalent of filing an interpleader action.furthermore,the court did not abuse its discretion in making the challenged evidentiary rulings.finally,to the extent that the jury instructions may have been imprecise,they were not prejudicial,inasmuch as a result more favorable to the attorney and his law firm would not have been probable had the instructions been more comprehensive.we affirm the judgment.
in doing so,we do not intend to discourage attorneys from acting as escrow holders.indeed,it is both useful and commonplace for attorneys to act as escrow holders with respect to closing documents,settlement agreements,releases,funds and other items.however,we caution that an attorney should be aware of the duties of an escrow holder before agreeing to act as one.when an attorney faces conflicting demands from his or her own client and another party to the escrow,the attorney can not favor his or her own client and completely disregard the rights of the other party,to whom he or she owes a duty as an escrow holder.if the competing demands are not resolved,the law provides the attorney with a mechanism to avoid both the area between the rock and the hard place and tort liability,an interpleader action.however,the attorney can not convert the escrowed property to his or her client own use.
the seller in this matter,disappointed with the lack of a punitive damages award,also appeals from the judgment,and from the order denying his motion to have the punitive damages issue tried again.he contends that he is entitled to have a partial retrial as a matter of right under code of civil procedure section,because the jury deadlocked on the punitive damages issue.he is in error on that point,inasmuch as a retrial is not automatic under section,but rather is discretionary.however,we hold that in this case the court abused its discretion in denying a partial retrial on punitive damages as to the attorney.at the same time,the court correctly denied a partial retrial with respect to the attorney law firm.therefore,we reverse the order denying a partial retrial on punitive damages with respect to the attorney and affirm the order denying a partial retrial with respect to the law firm.
jorma virtanen virtanen was the chief scientist and a of burstein technologies,bti.he was also a founder,director and shareholder of bti.bti was engaged in the development and marketing of discs for clinical diagnostics.
virtanen engaged in negotiations to sell his bti stock to richard burstein burstein,president,chief executive officer and chairman of the board of bti.in order to effectuate the contemplated purchase,burstein got together with gerald goldstein goldstein,also a director of bti,to form investors llc to serve as the purchaser.
on april,virtanen executed a stock purchase agreement for the sale of shares of his bti stock to at a price of per share,or.the purchase price was to be paid in installments.an initial was to be paid at closing,with a remainder of to be paid pursuant to a promissory note.the stock purchase agreement granted a right of first refusal to acquire an additional shares from virtanen.
under cover letter dated april,attorney steven dunning dunning,on behalf of virtanen,delivered the stock purchase agreement executed by virtanen,the original stock certificates together with stock assignments executed in blank,and related closing documents,to attorney christopher of parker,milliken,clark,samuelian parker milliken.the cover letter stated that was to hold each of the items until three conditions had been fulfilled was in possession of fully executed closing documents and was authorized to deliver originals of the same to dunning virtanen had confirmed to that he had received the and the stock certificates and stock assignments had been delivered to guzik associates to be held under the terms of an escrow agreement regarding the payment of the secured promissory note over time.after dunning sent the package to,he left town for a florida vacation,returning to his office on may.before leaving,dunning informed that he was going on vacation.
according to goldstein,on april,he received an execution copy of the stock purchase agreement.however,he was just about to leave the state on a trip and did not have time to review it.goldstein says that he told virtanen,in an april,telephone conversation,that he would be returning from his trip on april,and would like until may,to review the stock purchase agreement and related documentation.
on april,virtanen sent a notice of rescission of the transaction to burstein,by both facsimile and hand delivery.in that notice,he demanded that and all its agents return to him the stock certificates and other documents previously delivered by him in connection with the transaction.the following morning,may,attorney russell tyler,tyler,then representing virtanen,sent,by facsimile,a copy of an april,letter from virtanen,in which virtanen notified of the rescission of the transaction.in that letter,virtanen also requested that return to him all documents that dunning had previously delivered to in connection with the transaction.according to virtanen,he had not,by that date,received a copy of the stock purchase agreement or any related documents as signed by.
sent out two letters dated may.one was a letter addressed to both and virtanen,requesting that they agree to a closing date of may,and to a change in a variety of dates in the stock purchase agreement and related documents,and that they demonstrate their agreement by signing and returning their copies of his letter.according to virtanen,he never signed this extension request.the other may,letter was addressed to virtanen.in that letter stated that the transaction was closed and that he was sending the stock certificates to bti transfer agent for transfer.
tyler and spoke by telephone on may.tyler demanded that refrain forwarding the stock certificates to the transfer agent.insisted on doing so.
on may,understanding that bti acted as its own transfer agent,forwarded to bti virtanen two stock certificates,in the denominations of shares and shares,respectively.in his may,written instructions,directed bti to register the transfer of of virtanen shares to and to reissue,in the name of and in various denominations,stock certificates representing those shares.he also directed that the remaining shares be reissued as one certificate in the name of virtanen.in addition,instructed bti to deliver directly to burstein one of the reissued certificates,in the name of and in the denomination of shares,and to deliver all of the other reissued certificates to guzik associates.
on may,virtanen filed suit against burstein,and parker milliken.the following day,he filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order to prevent the transfer of his shares of stock in bti.the court granted the application and subsequently issued a preliminary injunction as well.filed a against virtanen,seeking declaratory relief,specific performance and enforcement of the terms of the stock purchase agreement through the doctrine of promissory estoppel.
by agreement dated december,virtanen settled with burstein and.the matter proceeded to trial by jury against and parker milliken,on virtanen fifth amended complaint,which asserted causes of action for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.
the jury returned a special verdict in which it found that and parker milliken were liable to virtanen,whose total compensatory damages were.the jury deadlocked on the issue of whether virtanen had proved by clear and convincing evidence that and parker milliken had acted with malice,fraud or oppression,so as to entitle virtanen to punitive damages.the court offset the amount of the settlement with burstein and,against the special verdict amount,for a resulting judgment amount of,plus costs.
virtanen filed a motion for a partial new trial with respect to the punitive damages issue.and parker milliken moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the court denied both motions.each party appeals 
discussiona.breach of duty as escrow holder 
contends that the jury impliedly found that he was acting as an escrow holder and further that,as escrow holder,he had a duty to return virtanen shares when requested to do so.does not challenge the implied finding that he was an escrow holder.see wasmann seidenberg d.attorney who accepts documents from opposing party under conditional authority to use them is escrow holder.however,contends that he had no duty to return the shares.in support of this assertion,he cites authority for the proposition that an escrow holder must follow joint escrow instructions and that,when faced with competing demands,he or she must either hold the property or interplead it.see diaz united california bank d.
the problem is that neither held the property nor interpleaded it.his remarkable choice was to close escrow and forward the stock certificates to the transfer agent with instructions to register the transfer and reissue the shares.does not explain how this action was in compliance with his duties as an escrow holder who had received competing demands.it could not be more clear that in taking this action,rather than continuing to hold the shares or interpleading them,he breached his duties as an escrow holder.see diaz united california bank,supra,d at.simply did not have a right to ignore these options and blindly close the escrow ibid.
says that forwarding the shares to bti,with the expectation that virtanen would promptly sue to halt the transfer,was the functional equivalent of filing an interpleader action.we can hardly agree.
a party against whom double or multiple claims are made,or may be made,may bring a separate action compelling the claimants or potential claimants to interplead and litigate their claims inter se.code civ,subd.b.a court may issue an order restraining parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other proceedings affecting the rights and obligations as between the parties.code civ,subd.f.cantu resolution trust th,d,fn.omitted.
an interpleader action is an equitable proceeding.citations.in an interpleader action,the court initially determines the right of the plaintiff to interplead the funds if that right is sustained,an interlocutory decree is entered which requires the defendants to interplead and litigate their claims to the funds.upon an admission of liability and deposit of monies with the court,the plaintiff then may be discharged from liability and dismissed from the interpleader action.citations.the effect of such an order is to preserve the fund,discharge the stakeholder from further liability,and to keep the fund in the court custody until the rights of the potential claimants of the monies can be adjudicated.citations.dial fesbinder th,d.by implementing an interpleader action and obtaining a discharge from further liability,the stakeholder avoids tort liability.cantu resolution trust,supra,th at,d.
not surprisingly,cites no authority to the effect that closing an escrow is the functional equivalent of filing an interpleader action just because the closing results in a lawsuit.by definition,closing escrow,delivering property to parties on the completion of a transaction or the satisfaction of identified conditions,is not the same thing as filing an interpleader action,depositing property into the court until the rights thereto are resolved by judicial intervention.see,paul schoellkopf th,d escrowed items delivered to parties on happening of specified event or performance of prescribed condition dial fesbinder,supra,th at,d interpleaded property retained in court custody until rights resolved.the former device harbors obvious dangers for an aggrieved party that the latter does not.
simply has not convinced us that putting the burden on a party to an escrow to commence immediate litigation following a premature closing is the same as the escrow holder filing of an interpleader action before any closing takes place.when the escrow has already closed,there is a risk that the party will not get to court in time to fully protect his or her halt the transfer of stock certificates to a bona fide purchaser for value,for example.in an interpleader action,the parties rights remain protected while the court sorts things out.dial fesbinder,supra,th at,d.
to permit a malfeasant escrow holder to dictate the nature of the litigation that follows a premature closing and to claim immunity from tort liability,would be the same as permitting a converter of property to dictate to the owner thereof how his or her property must be used.just as we do not countenance the latter dakota gardens apartment investors b pudwill d,we also do not countenance the former.the conflicted escrow holder may shield himself or herself from liability,and protect the interests of the parties to the escrow as well,by filing an interpleader action.dial fesbinder,supra,th,d cantu resolution trust,supra,th,d.an escrow holder who fails to do so acts at his or her own peril.see cantu resolution trust,supra,th at,d burlesci petersen th,d.
further insists that his actions were the functional equivalent of filing an interpleader action in light of the fact that an aggrieved shareholder can employ the procedures of commercial code section in order to protect his or her position.he characterizes section as a vehicle whereby a shareholder can take steps to block the transfer of shares,thereby transforming the issuer of stock into a neutral stakeholder.he complains that due to the trial court erroneous ruling on virtanen motion in limine,he was precluded from making his functional equivalency argument.
in his motion in limine,virtanen requested that the court preclude from making any argument or presenting any evidence pertaining to commercial code section,on the grounds that the provision could not provide with a defense to his actions and that making reference to it would confuse the jury.we find his arguments persuasive and conclude the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence and argument pertaining to section.tudor ranches,state comp.ins.fund th,d court has discretion in ruling on motions in limine.in any event,cites no authority for the proposition that an escrow holder,when faced with competing demands,may properly close escrow on the assumption that one of the parties will timely employ a statutory mechanism for blocking the transfer of try to undo the effects of the already closed escrow.
duty to client 
argues that to affirm the judgment would be to enunciate a rule that an attorney who acts as an escrow holder can not provide his or her client with legal advice pertaining to the transaction.his argument in support of this position is strained.
points out that virtanen expert,anthony pierno pierno,testified that with competing demands,would have been justified in interpleading the stock.pierno qualified that no interpleader would have been proper,however,if one of the competing demands were spurious,that is to say,based on a recommendation by that the demand be made.uses this testimony to spin a fantastical defense to his actions.he implies that in order to find in favor of virtanen,the jury must have determined that advised his clients to make a spurious,competing demand.then,per pierno viewpoint,interpleader would have been improper,and,even more importantly,functional equivalent of interpleader would have been improper as well.claims that if this is why he was held liable,no attorney anywhere would ever agree to act as an escrow holder,because to do so would be to give up the right,and obligation,to render legal advice to the client during the course of the escrow.
is unduly alarmed.there are no express or implied findings here to the effect that either advised his clients to make a spurious demand or erred in continuing to provide advice to his clients during the course of the escrow.what did is close escrow when the conditions to close had not been met,the parties had not reached written agreement on material contract terms,and one party to the escrow had delivered a notice of rescission and demanded the return of his documents.action gave rise to liability irrespective of what advice he provided to his clients or whether his clients competing demand was spurious.
as an offshoot of his argument,contends the court erred in granting virtanen motion in limine,which precluded him from introducing any evidence or making any arguments pertaining to the duties an attorney owes to his or her own client.in making the motion,virtanen argued that the duties were irrelevant to the case and would confuse the jury.in opposing the motion,argued that any duty he owed to virtanen conflicted with his undivided duty of loyalty to his own clients and that he could not have satisfied both of those conflicting duties.concluded that his duties to his clients were extremely relevant to the case and implied that when faced with conflicting duties,his only permissible course of action was to satisfy the demands of his clients over the demands of virtanen.
the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence and argument pertaining to an attorney duties to his or her client tudor ranches,state comp.ins.fund,supra,th at,d abuse of discretion standard we will accept word that he had competing instructions from his clients.see frazier superior court th,d.however,the question is not what his duty to his clients may have been given those competing instructions,but whether violated a duty owed to virtanen by closing escrow when none of the conditions to close had been met,the parties had not reached written agreement on material contract terms,and virtanen had delivered a notice of rescission and request for return of documents.the fact that owed duties to his clients does not excuse him for violating his duty to virtanen and converting the stock certificates.as we have already discussed,if believed that no joint resolution of the conflicting demands was forthcoming,he could have filed an interpleader action.he had a statutorily sanctioned method for dealing with conflicting demands,even when one of those demands came from his own clients.he just chose not to take advantage of that method.
similarly,is off base in arguing that the case should have been dismissed because,without a waiver of the privilege and the ability to inform the court as to his confidential communications,he was unable to put on a defense in the litigation.it is true that an action against an attorney may be dismissed if the attorney can not mount a defense without breaching the privilege.solin myers th,d see also mcdermott,will emery superior court th,d.however,in this case,no disclosure of privileged communications is required for to address whether he owed a duty to virtanen,whether he breached that duty,whether he converted virtanen stock certificates,and whether virtanen suffered damages.as we have said,the communications had with his clients were irrelevant to those issues.
jury instructions 
requested the following jury instruction an attorney owes his client an undivided duty of loyalty and diligence.virtanen,in turn,requested a lengthy instruction about the fiduciary duty an attorney owes to a when he or she accepts property from that in order to facilitate a transaction.the court rejected each of the proposed instructions.
now claims the court erred in failing to give his desired instruction.failed to preserve his objection in the trial court.when arguing the two proposed jury instructions before the judge,counsel stated if they both out,your honor,just let me comment that in my final analysis,they probably more confusing than helpful to the jury.that it.he conceded that the instructions were more confusing than helpful,and he did not argue that the court would err in excluding them.end of story.
next,complains that the court erred in giving two jury instructions on the definition of,and the duties of,an escrow holder.the first of the two instructions provided in part an escrow holder owes a fiduciary duty to the person whose property they are holding.if you find that defendants are escrow holders,you must find that they owed a fiduciary duty to virtanen.the second of the two instructions read it is the duty of an escrow holder to strictly obey the instructions of the person whose property he is holding.
asserts that these instructions are neither legally correct nor supported by the evidence.yet it is hard to imagine how one can seriously dispute that an escrow holder owes a fiduciary duty to the parties to the escrow,including the party who has deposited property into the escrow.an escrow holder is the agent of all the parties to the escrow at all times prior to performance of the conditions of the escrow citations bears a fiduciary relationship to each of them citation and owes an obligation to each measured by an application of the ordinary principles of agency.citation.diaz united california bank,supra,d at.although owed virtanen no professional duty,his acceptance of virtanen stock certificates gave rise to a duty of care.the wellspring of this duty is the fiduciary role of an escrow holder.citations.wasmann seidenberg,supra,d at.the fiduciary obligations of an escrow holder,and an attorney acting as an escrow holder,are well settled.
also,we disagree with assertion that the jury instructions are not supported by the evidence.see people marshall cal th,d,only theories supported by substantial evidence should be presented to jury.it is undisputed that dunning delivered virtanen documents to together with a cover letter specifying the conditions under which those documents could be used.if did not want to be responsible for the documents,he should have promptly returned them to virtanen.we hold a trier of fact could find any failure to do so was an acceptance of virtanen entrustment.wasmann seidenberg,supra,d at.moreover,h aving accepted the documents from virtanen,was bound to comply strictly with the escrow instructions.citations.ibid.the jury instructions are supported by the evidence.
still,contends that the first of the two jury instructions essentially told the jury that was the fiduciary of virtanen only,to the exclusion of clients.we disagree with this construction.the issue was whether owed a duty to virtanen and whether he breached any such duty.the instruction was properly framed to help the jury assess whether owed a duty to virtanen.
where the second of the two jury instructions is concerned,it is well settled that i t is the duty of an escrow holder to comply strictly with the instructions of his principal citations,and if he disposes of the property of his principal in violation of these instructions,or otherwise breaches that duty,he will be responsible for any loss occasioned thereby.citations.diaz united california bank,supra,d at.the rule continues to apply when the escrow holder in question is an attorney.wasmann seidenberg,supra,d at.
even so,says that the second of the two jury instructions was erroneous because it could be interpreted to mean that he was obligated to follow virtanen unilateral instructions.as stated previously,we need not resolve the issue of whether was indeed obligated to follow virtanen unilateral instructions.were we to agree with that joint escrow instructions were required and that the second jury instruction could be interpreted to mean,contrarily,that was obliged to follow virtanen unilateral instructions,we still would not find reversible error.a judgment may not be reversed on appeal,even for error involving misdirection of the jury,unless after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,it appears the error caused a miscarriage of justice.cal,art.vi.when the error is one of state law only,it generally does not warrant reversal unless there is a reasonable probability that in the absence of the error,a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached.citation.soule general motors cal th,d.put another way,instructional error in a civil case requires reversal where it seems probable that the error prejudicially affected the verdict.citations.id.at,d.
in the case before us,it does not appear probable that a result more favorable to would have been reached had the instruction stated that was required to strictly comply with joint escrow instructions agreed to by each party to the escrow.factors to be evaluated in assessing the prejudicial effect of an erroneous instruction include the degree of conflict in the evidence on critical issues citations whether respondent argument to the jury may have contributed to the instruction misleading effect citation whether the jury requested a rereading of the erroneous instruction citation or of related evidence citation the closeness of the jury verdict citation and the effect of other instructions in remedying the error citations.citations.ortega pajaro valley unified school dist.th,d.
addresses only two of these second and the fourth.where the second factor is concerned,cites several passages of the argument virtanen counsel made to the jury.the lawyer told the jury that experts had testified that owed virtanen a duty.he further said that,even though owed virtanen a duty and had received virtanen demand,what did he do he did return the stock.instead,he did everything he could to just ram that stock transaction through.the lawyer also stated the bottom line is this when it came to the stock,the defendants had a duty,a duty to follow virtanen instructions they did follow those instructions.they did just the opposite.virtanen said,give me back the stock.what did they do they sent it off.they did send it to him.
these arguments can be read two ways.first,they can be read to mean that violated his duty to virtanen by closing the escrow.second,they can be read to mean that violated his duty to virtanen by failing to return the stock certificates to him.it is the latter possibility that complains about,because it supports an interpretation of the jury instructions to the effect that was required to comply with virtanen unilateral demand,not with joint escrow instructions.even though the comments of virtanen attorney can be interpreted to bolster that interpretation of the jury instructions,that is only one factor to be considered in assessing whether the jury instructions had a prejudicial effect.as we shall show,this one factor is not determinative in this case.
where the fourth factor is concerned,says that the closeness of jury vote demonstrates the seriousness of the error.the jury found by a to vote that and parker milliken were liable to virtanen.we do not consider this to be a close split.rather,the vote,although not unanimous,was weighted heavily in favor of virtanen.this is not surprising,considering the substantial evidence that violated his duty to virtanen and converted his stock.
this brings us to the first factor,which is the most striking in this particular case.with respect to that factor,there is no conflict in the evidence on the critical issues.closed escrow when none of the conditions to close had been met.
first,at the time of close,he was not prepared to deliver to dunning fully executed copies of the april,documents that virtanen had approved and signed.rather,on april,sent virtanen a written request to approve changes to certain dates contained in the contract documents,including delayed payment dates under the promissory note.virtanen declined to sign the extension request.this notwithstanding,on close,delivered to virtanen a promissory note containing changed but unapproved dates.one of those dates,pertaining to a payment,was pushed from one calendar year into another,an event that virtanen testified would have adverse tax consequences for him.
second,closed escrow without virtanen having confirmed to him that the had been received.third,the stock certificates were not delivered to guzik associates to be held under the terms of a written escrow agreement pertaining to the payment of the secured promissory note over time.instead,they were sent to bti,with instructions to register the transfer of shares to and to deliver directly to burstein a reissued certificate in the name of and in the denomination of shares.
in addition to the fact that the conditions to close had not been satisfied,the parties had not agreed in writing to material contract terms,and virtanen had delivered a notice of rescission and request for return of documents.without question,breached his duty to virtanen.given this,we can not conclude that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a verdict more favorable to had the jury instructions been more complete or more precise on the duties of an escrow holder to each party to the escrow.
request for reversal with directions 
is so certain he did nothing wrong that he requests that this court reverse the judgment with directions to enter judgment in his favor.he insists that a judgment in his favor is the only possible result.he explains that there is no theory under which he could possibly be held liable and further that virtanen can not prove damages.
conversion 
among other things,argues that virtanen has not presented a viable conversion cause of action.he states that virtanen impliedly ratified any taking of his stock when he sought an injunction to stop the transfer agent from reissuing the shares,instead of seeking an injunction to compel the return of the shares,and cites farrington teichert son d,in support of this assertion.we reject this argument out of hand.
first off,we note that virtanen,in his declaration in support of his application for a temporary restraining order,did in fact request that the court issue orders not only preventing the transfer of his shares,but also requiring the return of the shares to him.second,we can hardly construe the commencement of litigation,due to the closing of escrow and the delivery of the stock certificates to the transfer agent,as a ratification of those acts.third,farrington teichert son,supra,d,is clearly distinguishable from the case before us.
in farrington teichert son,supra,d,the plaintiff landowner observed that the defendant contracting firm was removing rock,sand and gravel from city property that bordered upon his own property.he visited the site a number of times and ultimately became concerned that some of the materials were being removed from his property,not city property.the plaintiff approached the city and the contracting firm about the matter.he did not want to halt the excavation,but rather was content to have the materials removed from his property,for a reasonable price.the parties had difficulty,however,in agreeing as to what price was reasonable.id.at.
the plaintiff ultimately brought a conversion action.the trial court held that the plaintiff did not have a viable cause of action for conversion because he had consented to the removal of the material from his property.however,the court awarded him what it determined to be the reasonable value of the material,based on quantum meruit.farrington teichert son,supra,d at.the plaintiff appealed,seeking a higher damages award based on conversion.id.at.the appellate court affirmed.id.at.
the farrington court stated at no time did the plaintiff ever do anything to avoid the consequences or minimize the defendant taking instead he encouraged and abetted that taking.thus it would seem that not only was there implied consent and acquiescence to the defendant acts but express ratification and approval thereof and the law is well settled that there can be no conversion where an owner either expressly or impliedly assents to or ratifies the taking,use or disposition of his property.citations.farrington teichert son,supra,d at.
it is true that dunning,on virtanen behalf,delivered the stock certificates to to be held pending close of escrow and to be transferred under the conditions specified.however,virtanen certainly did not consent to transfer of the certificates to bti under the circumstances that occurred.not one of the conditions to close that dunning had set forth in his cover letter was met,as detailed above.
furthermore,the parties had not reached written agreement on material contract terms,payment dates.in addition,virtanen had delivered a notice of rescission and request to return documents to burstein and tyler had sent a notice of rescission directly to.tyler also had placed telephone calls to and had sent him an explicit demand letter insisting that he refrain from forwarding the stock certificates to bti.it could not be more clear that virtanen did not consent to the delivery of the stock certificates to bti.rather,he objected vigorously to intended placement of the stock certificates in the hands of another and even threatened a lawsuit for conversion.
conversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another.citation.conversion is a species of strict liability in which questions of good faith,lack of knowledge and motive are ordinarily immaterial.citation.irving nelkin south beverly hills wilshire jewelry loan th,d.furthermore,the fact that a plaintiff regained possession of the converted property does not prevent him from suing for damages for the conversion.citation.id.at,d.clearly,converted virtanen stock certificates when he handed them over to the transfer agent even though none of virtanen conditions to close had been met,the parties had not reached written agreement on material contract terms,virtanen had delivered a notice of rescission and demand to return documents,and tyler had expressly warned against exercising dominion and control over the stock certificates.see trask garza.
asserts that even if the record supported a cause of action for conversion,virtanen suffered no damages.wrong again.
as a general rule,the normal measure of damages for conversion is t he value of the property at the time of the conversion and a fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property,spates dameron hospital th,d lueter state of california th,d.does not discuss this general rule,or whether the amount of damages specified in the special verdict constitutes the value of the stock certificates at the time of conversion.instead,he cites myers stephens d,which notes that an alternate measure of damages,such as lost profits,may be available when necessary to indemnify the injured party for damages proximately caused.id.at.has cited no case persuading us that the alternate measure of damages should have been applied in this instance,assuming for the purpose of discussion that it was not.
the record contains substantial evidence supporting the jury award,as demonstrated by the testimony of investor harvey vechery.vechery family trust had purchased shares of bti stock for,or per share,in.in april,vechery was in discussions with virtanen to purchase additional bti stock at per share.in april or july,vechery or his family trust purchased an additional shares at that price.of those shares,belonged to virtanen and belonged to virtanen children.vechery testified that he would have purchased all of virtanen shares at that time,for per share,had they been available.

breach of duty 
with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty and negligence causes of action,insists he could not have violated a duty because he was not required to return the stock to virtanen.yet at the same time,states that r egardless of its genesis and timing,conflicting demand triggered his obligation to hold or interplead the stock.the breach of that duty gave rise to liability,as we have already discussed.
as far as is concerned,whether he breached a duty to virtanen or not,virtanen could not have suffered any damages.from his perspective,the shares were going to be tied up in litigation one way or another,so virtanen could not have been harmed by his lack of possession of the shares during the litigation period.
this argument presupposes two things.first,it assumes that there could have been no negotiated resolution of the matter,no joint escrow instructions forthcoming,had simply held onto the shares for a while to see how things played out.second,it assumes that the litigation that ensued once escrow had closed and virtanen was in the position of trying to undo it was essentially the same,or at least of the same duration,as the litigation that would have ensued had an interpleader action been filed instead.we are not prepared to accept either assumption.
when the parties are still in escrow they tend to be predisposed to resolution.once an escrow has been closed in such a manner as to make one party feel victimized and to force that party to hire a litigator to assert his or her rights,the chances of a speedy resolution diminish.there may even be a difference in the tenor of the litigation in that instance and in the instance in which a conflicted escrow holder has been the one to file an interpleader action.indeed,himself notes at least one difference,stating that vigorously opposed virtanen injunction,which required considerably more effort than responding to an interpleader action.
those points aside,we need not resolve whether the harm virtanen suffered due to the close of escrow and the resultant litigation was identical to the harm he would have suffered had an interpleader action been filed instead,so as to determine what damages might have been available under either a breach of fiduciary duty theory or a negligence theory.as we have shown,the record supports the damages award under a conversion theory.we decline request to direct the entry of a judgment in his favor.
punitive damages 
introduction 
the jurors were deadlocked on the question do you find by the standard of clear and convincing evidence that virtanen has proved that christopher and parker,milliken,clark,samuelian acted with malice,fraud or oppression,so that virtanen is entitled to punitive damages the jurors voted to in favor of punitive damages against and to in favor of punitive damages against parker milliken.
virtanen contends that he was entitled to have the punitive damages issue tried again as a matter of right,under code of civil procedure section,and that the court erred in denying his request for a retrial.code of civil procedure section provides in all cases where the jury are discharged without having rendered a verdict,or are prevented from giving a verdict,by reason of accident or other cause,during the progress of the trial,or after the cause is submitted to them,except as provided in section,the action may be again tried immediately,or at a future time,as the court may direct.according to virtanen,this means that a retrial is mandatory unless the court,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision f,directs a new verdict.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision f provides when the jury for any reason has been discharged without having rendered a verdict,the court on its own motion or upon motion of a party,notice of which was given within days after discharge of the jury,may order judgment to be entered in favor of a party whenever a motion for directed verdict for that party should have been granted had a previous motion been made.except as otherwise provided in section,the power of the court to act under the provisions of this section shall expire days after the day upon which the jury was discharged,and if judgment has not been ordered within that time the effect shall be the denial of any motion for judgment without further order of the court.
virtanen reasons that if code of civil procedure section were interpreted to give the court the discretionary authority to grant or deny a retrial as it deemed proper,then the provisions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision f would be rendered superfluous.and,as he points out,statutory provisions should be construed so as to give significance to every part thereof and to avoid an interpretation that would render some parts mere surplusage.elsenheimer elsenheimer th,d.however,we disagree that to interpret section as giving the court discretionary authority would be to render section,subdivision f superfluous.section,subdivision f permits the court to order the entry of judgment under the circumstances described therein.section permits the court to grant a retrial,when it has not ordered the entry of judgment under section,subdivision f.construing section as providing discretionary authority to grant a retrial when no entry of judgment has been ordered does not make section,subdivision f meaningless,but rather gives effect to the provisions of each of the two statutes.elsenheimer elsenheimer,supra,th at,d statutory provisions are to be harmonized when possible.
when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of a particular law.of course our first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.woolls superior court th,d.here,we note that code of civil procedure section uses the word may.that word is permissive.ibid.a plain reading of the statute shows that the court is granted the discretionary authority to act on motions for retrial under that provision.it is not required to grant a motion for retrial,just because it also did not order entry of judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision f.
accordingly,we review the trial court order on a motion for retrial under the abuse of discretion standard.plancarte guardsmark th,d.in so doing,we must bear in mind the circumstances under which punitive damages may be awarded.civil code section,subdivision a provides for the recovery of punitive damages i n an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract,where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice as the supreme court in taylor superior court cal d,explained something more than the mere commission of a tort is always required for punitive damages.there must be circumstances of aggravation or outrage,such as spite or malice,or a fraudulent or evil motive on the part of the defendant,or such a conscious and deliberate disregard of the interests of others that his conduct may be called wilful or wanton.citation.id.at.
given this requirement,and parker milliken state that there simply is insufficient evidence to warrant a retrial with respect to punitive damages.more particularly,they contend the evidence would not enable a reasonable trier of fact to conclude that virtanen presented clear and convincing proof of oppression,fraud or malice.they insist that the evidence shows nothing more than aggressive representation.we certainly disagree,at least with respect to.
