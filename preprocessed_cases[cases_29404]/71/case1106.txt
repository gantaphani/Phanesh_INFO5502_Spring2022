this case presents the disappointing story of a promising federal appellate law clerk gone bad.robert gordon,a graduate of stanford law school and a former law clerk for one of our colleagues,a judge on the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,embezzled millions of dollars in cash and stock from his employer,cisco systems.following his guilty plea conviction for wire fraud,and insider trading,b,gordon appeals the district court final order of restitution.the district court imposed restitution in a total amount of under the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,title ii,subtitle a of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat,codified in relevant part at.gordon does not dispute the entire amount of the restitution order but contends that certain portions should not be included.at issue on appeal are the restitution order award of for embezzled shares from one company prejudgment interest of and reimbursable investigation costs totaling.
the primary and overarching goal of the mvra is to make victims of crime whole.in achieving this objective,congress intended district courts to engage in an expedient and reasonable restitution process,with uncertainties resolved with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.guided by these principles,we hold that the district court restitution analysis for the embezzled shares,including its fairly sophisticated date of the loss calculation,was not an abuse of discretion.nor did the district court abuse its discretion in declining to account for brokerage house commissions or for awarding restitution for costs incurred by cisco during its participation in the criminal investigation.finally,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest in regards to the embezzled cash and shares of the companies terayon and cabletron.the district court did,however,abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest for the other embezzled securities.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for entry of a new order of restitution.
background 
statutory framework 
the mvra makes restitution mandatory for particular crimes,including those offenses which involve fraud or deceit.see c a ii.under the mvra,a court must order restitution to each victim of an offense,and the court can not consider the defendant economic circumstances.see f a.the prior restitution statute,the victim and witness protection act vwpa,required courts to consider the economic circumstances of the defendant prior to ordering restitution,and the granting of restitution was discretionary,not mandatory.see.with these exceptions,the two statutes are identical in all important respects,and courts interpreting the mvra may look to and rely on cases interpreting the vwpa as precedent.see united states randle,nn.cir the provisions of the vwpa and the mvra are nearly identical in authorizing an award of restitution.
factual background and procedural history 
robert gordon attended stanford law school,where he was an associate managing editor of the stanford law review.upon graduating from law school,gordon served as a law clerk for a judge on the court of appeals for the seventh circuit.prior to his employment at cisco,gordon was an investment banker at goldman sachs and first boston.
gordon was employed at cisco from september to april.he started at cisco as a director in the corporate finance department and,in,transferred to the business development group.through late until april,gordon obtained stock certificates from companies in which cisco had acquired an interest and,instead of depositing those certificates with cisco treasury department,transferred them to two brokerage accounts he had established.he then sold the embezzled shares and used the proceeds to make stock trades using information gained from his insider position with cisco.
in addition,under gordon guidance,cisco loaned million to spanlink,a company in which cisco had previously invested.cisco was not aware,however,that gordon personally had previously lent spanlink million,posing as a venture capital investor and using funds previously embezzled by him from cisco,and that gordon had received shares of spanlink series b preferred stock in return for arranging that loan.after spanlink received the million,gordon redeemed the preferred shares for million,turning a million profit for himself.
in april,cisco discovered that shares were missing from one of the accounts from which gordon had embezzled stock.cisco officers spoke to gordon about the missing shares.they asked him for his laptop computer.gordon said his laptop was at home,but he agreed to bring it to cisco the following day.gordon was told that he should not erase anything from the hard drive.yet as confirmed by subsequent forensic analysis,gordon went home that night and used an evidence eliminator software program to delete files from his computer.further analysis established that gordon had run that program at least five times to overwrite deleted files.
discovering that gordon had embezzled certain shares,cisco launched an internal investigation to determine the extent of the embezzlement.this involved identifying all the transactions in which gordon had been involved during his five years with the company.as a result of this investigation,cisco identified five additional embezzlements totaling more than million in losses to cisco.two of these embezzlements involved cisco investments in another technology company called terayon.
in april,the government charged gordon with wire fraud,and in may,an indictment alleging two counts of wire fraud was returned.gordon pled guilty to a superseding information alleging two counts of wire fraud,one count of insider trading,and one forfeiture count.under the plea agreement,gordon agreed to pay restitution totaling to cisco and to the government,and to forfeit the amounts alleged in the forfeiture count.gordon also agreed to waive his right to appeal his convictions,the judgment,and orders of the court,in addition to the right to appeal his sentence.the government reserved the right in the plea agreement to argue for additional restitution for cisco lost opportunity costs for the terayon shares,investigation costs,and prejudgment interest.
the district court sentenced gordon to a term of months in prison.the court scheduled a further hearing pursuant to d to address the disputed issues of restitution.the court established july,the date of gordon guilty pleas as the date for prejudgment interest.the district court subsequently issued an order addressing the areas of restitution and forfeiture that were not contested by the parties and conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the remaining disputed restitution issues.in the court final order of restitution,gordon was ordered to pay restitution totaling,including 
for the embezzled terayon shares 
prejudgment interest of and 
reimbursable investigation costs totaling 
both the final order of restitution and final order of forfeiture were incorporated into the amended judgment.gordon timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
waiver of right to appeal 
we review de novo the question of whether a defendant has validly waived his statutory right to appeal.united states anglin,cir.a defendant right to appeal is statutory,rather than constitutional,in nature.id.knowing and voluntary waivers of appellate rights in criminal cases are regularly enforce d.id.the sole test of a waiver validity is whether it was made knowingly and voluntarily.id.at see also united states baramdyka,cir noting that the proper enforcement of appeal waivers serves an important function in the judicial administrative process by preserving the finality of judgments and sentences imposed pursuant to valid plea agreements quotation marks and citation omitted.
the government argues that because gordon waived the right to appeal the orders of the court in his plea agreement,he waived his right to appeal the restitution order.at gordon plea colloquy,the district court also emphasized its view that gordon had waived the right to appeal the restitution order.we disagree.gordon lacked sufficient notice to waive his right to appeal the restitution award.as we held in united states phillips,cir,while i t is true that a court can impose restitution when the plea agreement is silent as to the amount of restitution as long as the amount is based on actual damages,a llocating actual damages in this manner carries with it a requirement of notice to the defendant.id.at.notice was absent in this case due to the ambiguous nature of the plea agreement.id.gordon plea agreement was unclear about exactly what the amount of actual damages would be for such contested issues as the embezzled terayon shares,prejudgment interest,and investigation costs.id.gordon therefore did not waive his right to appeal these contested amounts.
moreover,e ven if gordon had voluntarily and knowingly waived his general right to appeal,this waiver would not affect his ability to appeal a violation of the mvra.id.a restitution order which exceed s its authority under the mvra is equivalent to an illegal sentence.id.citation omitted.s uch a restitution order is in excess of the maximum penalty provided by statute and,therefore,the waiver of appeal is inapplicable to it.id.quotation marks omitted.
restitution order 
a restitution order is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,provided that it is within the bounds of the statutory framework.factual findings supporting an order of restitution are reviewed for clear error.the legality of an order of restitution is reviewed de novo.united states stoddard,cir citations omitted.
the largest item that gordon challenges is the district court restitution award for the embezzled terayon shares.gordon argues that in calculating cisco losses for the terayon shares,the district court applied an incorrect date of the loss under the mvra.he also contends that the district court erroneously disregarded the alleged fraudulent inflation of terayon shares,which he posits constituted an intervening cause of cisco terayon related loss.in addition,gordon argues that the district court abused its discretion in failing to subtract brokerage house commissions costs from its restitution award,in including cisco investigation costs as part of its total losses,and in awarding prejudgment interest for the embezzled securities and cash 
terayon shares 
cisco acquired terayon shares in.in december,gordon,without cisco consent,sold short of cisco terayon shares.he deposited the in proceeds from the sale into his brokerage account.in june,gordon embezzled an additional terayon shares from cisco account.he later deposited the shares into his brokerage account and eventually sold them for a total of.
date of the loss provision 
before gordon embezzlement was discovered,cisco sold all of its holdings of terayon stock.specifically,cisco sold all of its shares between july,and march.during this period,the price of terayon jumped from per share on july,to a high of per share on march,the stock price dramatically declined,however.on march,the day cisco liquidated the last of its terayon shares,the stock closing price was per share.cisco,which had no knowledge that gordon had taken some of its terayon holdings,would have sold these shares as well except for gordon wrongdoing.
in situations where the return of stolen or embezzled property is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,the mvra requires defendants to pay victims the greater of i the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction or ii the value of the property on the date of sentencing.b b i i ii emphasis added.in determining the date of the loss for the terayon shares,the district court reasoned that it was reasonable,equitable and consistent with the purposes of the restitution statute to consider cisco lost opportunity to sell the terayon shares at a higher price in determining the amount of the loss caused by defendant embezzlement of the shares.to reflect cisco lost opportunity to sell the terayon shares,the district court held that the date of the loss for the embezzled terayon shares was the date on which it could reasonably be inferred that cisco would have sold the shares if gordon had not embezzled them in these circumstances,though,no single date could be identified,only a range of dates,so the district court calculated the loss using the average closing price of terayon shares during the entire period in which cisco liquidated its shares july,through march.using calculations that are not themselves disputed,the district court arrived at a restitution figure for the terayon shares of gordon argues that the date of the loss should have been the date that the terayon shares were embezzled,or the taking date,with a corresponding loss valuation of,more than million less.
the mvra offers no further elaboration on the date of the loss provision.because it is unclear whether the district court average stock price valuation method is consistent with the text of the statute,we must consider t he purpose,the subject matter,the context and the legislative history of this statute.united states miguel,cir quoting pfizer,government of india,d alterations in original.as there is no discussion within the mvra legislative history regarding the date of the loss provision,we turn to the remedial principles underlying the mvra and restitution generally 
w e are presented with a statute,the primary and overarching goal of which is to make victims of crime whole,to fully compensate these victims for their losses and to restore these victims to their original state of,that expressly directs the sentencing judge to award restitution in an amount equal to the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction.united states simmonds,cir interpreting mvra emphasis added.as we noted in the general restitution context in nelson serwold,cir,the purpose of restitution is to restore the defrauded party to the position he would have had absent the fraud.id.at emphasis added.
guided by the remedial purposes underlying the mvra,other circuits have granted district courts a degree of flexibility in accounting for a victim complete losses.for example,in simmonds,the third circuit concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in calculating the value of the victims furniture destroyed in a fire under at its replacement value that is,the amount of money necessary to replace the furniture rather than at its market value or the actual price that the furniture in question would have commanded on the open market on the date of destruction.at emphasis added.the court reasoned that because furniture often has a personal value to its owners that can not be captured or accurately estimated by simply determining the market value of the furniture on a particular date,the district court properly concluded that the replacement value was a more accurate means of accounting for the victims total losses under the mvra.id.at.
similarly,other circuits interpreting the mvra have permitted a degree of flexibility in making victims of securities fraud whole by allowing district courts to place the risk of downward fluctuations in stock prices on defendants rather than victims.in united states rhodes,cir,the seventh circuit affirmed the district court restitution order under the mvra,which ordered the defendant,who defrauded a number of investors,to pay his former employer the amount of money magna investments had to dole out in order to make its customers whole as a result of the defendant fraud.id.at.the defendant argued that the district court order was improper under the mvra because his former employer immediately liquidated the unauthorized investments the defendant had made,thereby incurring losses caused by a dip in the values of those investments and the fact that at least some of the investments were sold before their maturation date.id.rejecting this argument,the seventh circuit reasoned that the defendant should bear the risk of declining stock prices,not the victim the defendant,rather than the victims,should bear the risk of forces beyond his control t o the extent that the interest rates have come into play in calculating the amount of loss,they have done so due to the defendant own conduct.id.quoting district court opinion nelson,at holding that where a person with knowledge of the facts wrongfully acquires property of fluctuating value,such as stock,the injured party may be awarded an amount equal to the highest value reached by the stock within a reasonable time after the tortious act emphasis added.
the district court date of the loss determination is consistent with the remedial purposes underlying the mvra and restitution generally.the district court reasonably construed the loss to cisco concerning the terayon stock to be its inability to liquidate the stock between july,and march,and therefore the date of the loss to be each possible date within that particular period.absent gordon illegal conduct,which notably included the purposeful concealment of his misappropriations,cisco would have had the opportunity to sell the embezzled stock at a given market value on each possible date,which it clearly intended to do 
because cisco lacked knowledge as to gordon activities,it was unable to liquidate the embezzled terayon shares throughout this period.the district court therefore concluded that gordon,rather than cisco or the government,should bear the risk associated with the fluctuations in terayon share value.
a brief examination of the taking date,the alternative date of the loss proposed by gordon,illustrates the reasonableness of the district court restitution method in making cisco whole under the mvra.on the date of gordon first taking of shares,december,terayon value was per share.on the date of gordon second taking of shares,june,terayon value was per share.but it is undisputed that cisco did not know on these dates that the shares had been taken,cisco did not intend to sell any terayon shares on these dates,and cisco did sell all of its terayon shares,mostly for prices higher than these,before gordon embezzlement was detected.under those circumstances it is plain that limiting the restitution amount to the value of the shares on the date gordon secretly stole them would underestimate cisco loss.but for gordon misconduct,cisco would have sold those shares at higher prices and would have made substantially more money.the taking date is an appropriate date of the loss for the other securities that cisco did not completely liquidate because it is too speculative to conclude that cisco would have sold those securities absent gordon wrongdoing.in the terayon context,however,the district court sensibly concluded that the taking date would have prevented the district court from accounting for cisco total losses.
that said,it is important to note that the legislative history of the vwpa demonstrates that congress intended the restitution process to be quick and reasonable.see,at,reprinted in,w here the precise amount of restitution owed is difficult to determine,authorizes the court to reach an expeditious,reasonable determination of appropriate restitution by resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.while the district court did engage in a fairly sophisticated analysis in determining the restitution amount for the terayon shares,the record demonstrates that it was not so complex as to be unreasonable,burdensome,or dilatory.moreover,the court calculations were undertaken with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.
to be clear,we do not hold that the district court was required to undertake this particular restitution exercise in determining the date of the loss for the embezzled terayon shares rather,we only hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in doing so 
intervening cause 
gordon argues in the alternative that the district court abused its discretion in including in its determination of the average terayon share value the price of terayon stock between july,and july,because,he contends,during that period terayon share price was fraudulently inflated.he cites a pending class action lawsuit in support of his assertion that a dramatic spike in terayon share price coincided with false statements by terayon insiders.gordon describes the spike as an intervening cause to cisco loss.he does not allege that cisco was involved or aware of such alleged false statements.
t he main inquiry for causation in restitution cases is whether there was an intervening cause and,if so,whether this intervening cause was directly related to the offense conduct.united states meksian,cir.the purported intervening cause in this alleged fraudulent inflation of the price of terayon not an intervening cause because it did not cause the loss to cisco,but merely adversely affected the value of the property that gordon embezzled.though the extent of cisco loss may have been affected by outside forces,gordon his resulted in the loss.rhodes,at the defendant,rather than the victims,should bear the risk of forces beyond his control quoting district court opinion meksian,at reversing a restitution order and concluding that the loss to the lender was caused not by the defendant false tax returns but by the contaminated nature of the loan property and by the lender reliance on an inaccurate environmental risk report prepared by a third party.moreover,even if gordon claims regarding an inflated stock price were true,there is no reason to believe that,absent gordon conduct,cisco would have been prevented from selling the terayon shares and realizing whatever premium may have been generated by such alleged fraudulent behavior.the market prices were available to cisco,no matter how the market prices came to be.
it would have been unreasonable,in any event,to expect the district court to discount accurately the restitution amount to reflect as of yet unproved fraudulent behavior alleged in pending litigation among third parties.as noted above,the legislative history of the vwpa demonstrates that congress intended the restitution process to be quick and reasonable.see,at.
we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to take into account the alleged fraudulently induced spike in the value of terayon shares.
brokerage house commissions 
gordon contends that to be an accurate approximation of the lost opportunity loss,the restitution amount would have to be based on the net proceeds to cisco after brokerage commissions costs.without accounting for brokerage commission costs,the restitution order arguably compensates cisco for more than it ultimately lost.see united states quillen,cir noting that restitution under the mvra must be limited to an amount pegged to the actual losses suffered by the victims of the defendant criminal conduct quoting united states barany,cir.
the record is insufficient,however,to allow a court to deduct accurately the commissions from the restitution award.the pages of the record gordon points to are merely receipts from various brokerages houses that show the commission paid on sales of certain blocks of shares.nothing within the record provides a commission percentage rate for a particular brokerage house or a detailed list of which securities were bought and sold through which houses.a directs that before making an order of restitution,the district court should review,to the extent practicable,a complete accounting of the losses.id.emphasis added.because the record does not indicate what percentage of shares cisco bought and sold through which particular brokerage houses,or what the commission rates for each house were,the district court reasonably concluded that it would have been impractical for it to account for the brokerage house commissions in its restitution award.
given that congress intended the restitution process to be expedient and reasonable,with courts resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to account for the brokerage house commissions.
investigation costs 
gordon also argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay cisco investigation costs.b provides in relevant part 
b the order of restitution shall require that such defendant 
in any case,reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care,transportation,and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense.
id.emphasis added 
this circuit has adopted a broad view of the restitution authorization for investigation costs.united states phillip s,cir citation omitted emphasis added.generally,investigation attorneys by private parties as a direct and foreseeable result of the defendant wrongful conduct may be recoverable.see also united states cummings,cir.holding that the district court properly included in the restitution order attorney fees incurred by a mother in separate state and international proceedings to recover children whom the defendant wrongfully removed,cert.denied,d united states hayward,cir holding that the district court correctly concluded that parents were entitled to restitution under the mvra for reasonable costs in obtaining the return of their victimized children from london and in making their children available to participate in the investigation and trial united states piggie,cir concluding,under plain error review,that the district court properly included in a restitution order investigation costs and fines that a university incurred because they were caused by the defendant conduct,cert.denied,d.
the district court reasonably concluded that cisco investigation costs,including attorneys fees,were necessarily incurred by cisco in aid of the proceedings.cisco investigation costs were a direct and foreseeable result of gordon actions.the record demonstrates that cisco investigation costs were incurred in response to five grand jury subpoenas and a number of government requests requiring cisco to analyze vast amounts of documentation and electronic information.cisco was required to retrieve every item regarding its investments in companies that were the subject of possible insider trading by gordon,and over companies that were identified as candidates for gordon possible embezzlement of shares or proceeds.cisco was forced to identify and reconstruct hundreds of sales and acquisitions from which gordon might have been able to embezzle proceeds.gordon purposefully covered his tracks as he concealed his numerous acts of wrongdoing from cisco over a period of years.as the victim,cisco can not be faulted for making a concerted effort to pick up his trail and identify all the assets he took amid everything he worked on.
the district court carefully analyzed cisco requests.cisco investigation included a forensic analysis of gordon computer to determine whether the eliminated evidence could be restored.the district court reduced the award for this analysis,finding that the evidence does not support fully the extraordinary expense associated with cisco attempt to recover data from defendant laptop computer,and made other reductions,finding that several categories for which expenses are claimed are at least to some extent overlapping or duplicative.indeed,the district court ultimately ordered reimbursement for of the total of for which cisco had sought reimbursement.
we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding restitution for cisco investigation costs.
prejudgment interest 
the district court awarded prejudgement interest on all assets,both cash and stock.for all assets excluding the terayon shares,the district court set the interest accrual date as the date the assets were taken by gordon,and the interest termination date as july,the district court applied the prevailing government interest rate in effect on the date of the misappropriation.for the terayon shares,the district court used a slightly different calculation method.because the district court concluded that cisco terayon loss occurred between july,and march,when cisco had completed liquidating the terayon shares and its losses became fixed,the court set the accrual date for prejudgment interest as march.the district court also set the interest termination date as july,using the prevailing government interest rate in effect on march,
though the mvra is silent on the issue of prejudgment interest,we have held that the vwpa authorizes restitution for a victim actual losses and that f oregone interest is one aspect of the victim actual loss.united states smith,cir interpreting the vwpa emphasis added.a number of other circuits have likewise held that restitution under the mvra or the vwpa may include prejudgment interest.see united states shepard,cir construing government of virgin islands davis,cir construing vwpa united states hoyle,cir construing vwpa united states patty,cir construing vwpa united states rochester,cir construing vwpa 
gordon first argues that an award of prejudgment interest is unwarranted in this case because it does not constitute an actual loss to cisco,who,unlike the victim in smith,is not a financial institution that has a tangible expectation to earn interest on its cash reserves.additionally,gordon contends that if interest should apply to any of the securities,it should only apply to the terayon shares,because by cisco admission,the other securities would have been held had gordon not embezzled them.we consider each argument in turn.
gordon first argument is unavailing.prejudgment interest reflects the victim loss due to his inability to use the money for a productive purpose,and is therefore necessary to make the victim whole.patty,at emphasis added.in smith we held that this proposition is particularly true when the victim is a financial institution because f oregone interest is one aspect of the victim actual loss.smith,at.we in no way limited this holding to financial institutions,however.indeed,other circuits have allowed restitution for prejudgement interest to other parties,such as individuals and family estates.see shepard,at awarding prejudgement interest where the money came from an account of a defrauded woman davis,at,allowing prejudgement interest where the embezzled cash came from the estate of james merrills rice.
as a corporation,cisco is likewise eligible for prejudgment interest restitution.while cisco would not necessarily have placed its stock proceeds in an interest bearing account had gordon not embezzled the securities,interest is simply a proxy for a lost opportunity.see davis,at lost interest translates into lost opportunities,as it reflects the victim inability to use his or her money for a productive purpose.the district court award of prejudgment interest reflects the productive purposes for which a profit maximizing entity like cisco uses its cash reserves 
gordon second argument,however,has merit.while the district court appropriately included prejudgment interest for the embezzled cash and the terayon and cabletron shares,both of which cisco completely liquidated,the court abused its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest for the other securities.as cisco acknowledged,it had no intention of completely liquidating the other securities from the date of their taking to the date of judgment.indeed,it was for this reason that the district court determined that the date of the loss for the other securities was the date of the misappropriation.because it is too speculative to conclude that cisco would have liquidated these securities and placed the cash proceeds in an interest bearing account or used them for some other productive purpose,prejudgment interest on these securities can not constitute an actual loss to the victim.the district court award of prejudgment interest for these embezzled stocks goes beyond making cisco whole and is therefore unauthorized under the mvra.see smith,at.
we therefore conclude that the district court abused its discretion with regard to its award of prejudgment interest on all securities excluding the terayon and cabletron shares.
iii.conclusion 
congress passed the mvra to make victims of crime whole.mindful of this overarching objective,we are also cognizant of congress desire that the restitution process be expedient and reasonable,with courts resolving uncertainties with a view toward achieving fairness to the victim.we thus hold that the district court restitution analysis for the embezzled terayon shares,including its fairly sophisticated date of the loss calculations,was not an abuse of discretion nor did the district court abuse its discretion in declining to account for the brokerage house commissions or in awarding restitution for costs incurred by cisco during its participation in the criminal investigation.finally,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding cisco prejudgment interest in regards to the embezzled cash and shares of the companies terayon and cabletron the district court did,however,abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest for the other embezzled securities.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.each party to bear its own costs.
i concur in the majority opinion,with the exception of parts ii,and ii,as to which i dissent.
congress did,no doubt,want to help make victims of crimes whole when it enacted.however,congress also hoped to avoid creating a system that would,essentially,turn criminal sentencing hearings into complicated,prolonged trials of the normal civil variety.see c b.therefore,congress did not provide that a victim could simply recover the damages that would,or might,be available in a typical civil case.rather,when it came to defining the nature of restitution in the property area,congress provided that if an offense resulted in damage to or loss or destruction of property,and if mere return of the property would be impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,the miscreant should pay an amount that represented the value of the property on the date of loss,or on the date of sentencing,whichever was greater,less the actual value of the part of the property that was returned.id.b.
no doubt,courts can massage and explicate the date of loss concept,but no authority supports doing what the district court did here.see hughey united states,d scope and amount of restitution limited by language of statute authorizing issuance of restitution order gamma tech,at affirming restitution order that set victim loss as of time of overpayment on contracts procured through illegal kickbacks.indeed,when interpreting identical language of an earlier criminal restitution statute,in a case where the victims had purchased diamonds at an earlier time and were then fraudulently induced to send them to the defendant to sell,we stated 
the vwpa grants the sentencing judge substantial discretion over the entire process leading to an ultimate restitution order.as part of the process,the judge must decide in a particular case,whether the imposition of the order will unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.here,the district court determined the amount of restitution based upon evidence presented at trial and in a presentence report showing the value of the diamonds at the time they were initially purchased by the victims while the district court has discretion in ordering restitution,the award must be within the statutory framework.because the amount of restitution ordered in this case was based neither on the value of the diamonds on the date of loss,nor on their value at the date of sentencing,the restitution order was beyond the authority granted by the statute.although valuing the diamonds as of the date of loss or sentencing may present a difficult determination for the district court,the choice of two possible dates of valuation is stated unambiguously in the vwpa.we must therefore remand to the district court for valuation of the diamonds on one of those two dates.
united states angelica,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
it seems to me that when an item is stolen from someone,that is the date upon which the person lost it.the concept that he lost it on some other date to be determined in the future,perhaps many years later,does not take account of the normal use of language.usually we think of something as lost when it has been parted with or when it has gone out of our possession.that is the date that we suffer our loss.
of course it can be argued that if the person had kept the item it would have been worth a lot more a few years later,or a lot less,or at some point more and at a later point even less,but that is decidedly not the date that the property was lost it is not the date that congress selected.congress selected the date that the loss truly occurred that is when the property was lost to the victim.
nor am i able to accept the proposition that the property is not lost until the victim knows that it is gone.when a diamond is stolen from a victim jewelry box,or a share of stock from his portfolio,it is lost to him,whether he knows that or not.surely the date that he loses the piece of property should not depend upon the sophistication of his inventory process,or upon his memory of precisely where it ought to be at some precise time.it is undoubtedly lost on the date it is taken from him,regardless of how quickly he discovers that.
finally,the thought that a district court can choose to adopt the complex system of deciding loss that was adopted by the district court in this case,or can choose to adopt some other view of when a loss takes place,does not help very much.discretion in the legal world is not the unfettered right to do whatever you like.we have always been admonished that,at the very least,the asymptotes bounding judicial discretion are composed of a proper assessment of the facts and the law.see,koon united states,d cooter gell hartmarx,d retail flooring dealers of,beaulieu of,llc,cir montrose chem.of cal.am.motorists ins,cir united states schlette,cir olvera giurbino,cir saying that it has discretion but must exercise it in a particular way.thus,a judge who does not wish to engage in the complex exercise approved of here will have to try it out it in order to see if it can be discretionarily rejected he may even have to consider other more complex possibilities.that,again,is far from calculating the values on one of the two easily determined discreet dates selected by congress 
in addition,i see no basis for considering prejudgment interest to be a part of criminal restitution where an item of property was taken,and we are referred to no case where that has been done.in fact,absent other facts,it is rank speculation to say that if a person had the asset,whatever it was,he would have kept it,or earned interest on it,or earned interest on the equivalent of its value.
in fact,every similar case that i have discovered deals with a situation where the property taken was money,and that money was being loaned at a given interest rate or was contained in an interest bearing account or instrument when it was taken.see,united states morgan,cir contractual interest on credit card charges united states smith,cir defendant falsified loan applications and subsequently defaulted on inadequately secured loans see also united states shepard,cir money stolen from account virgin islands davis,cir fraudulently acquired certificates of deposit united states hoyle,cir student loan fraud united states patty,cir bank loan fraud united states rochester,cir restitution included outstanding balance and accrued interest on bank loan united states simpson,cir affirming a restitution award that included interest on some victims losses from fraudulent investment schemes where swindler had,inter alia,misrepresented guaranteed rate of return united states stephens,cir restitution order for past due child support payments may include prejudgment interest where state law mandates that interest be paid on delinquent child support obligations.indeed,where the misappropriated property,although cash or cash equivalent,was not interest bearing property,other circuits have determined that restitution does not properly include prejudgment interest because a criminal penalty does not bear interest,and the courts were hesitant to infer additional criminal penalties beyond those specifically provided by statute.see united states rico,cir reversing order to pay prejudgment interest on amount ordered to be paid as restitution for criminal kickback scheme united states sleight,cir same in a true case,the interest can be s
