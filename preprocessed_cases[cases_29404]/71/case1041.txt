the district court,in an order dated december,december order appointed lead plaintiff and lead counsel.the pslra creates a rebuttable presumption that the most adequate the court must appoint as the lead the person or group that meets the following three requirements a has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to the published notice b in the determination of the court,has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class and c otherwise satisfies the requirements of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.a b iii i.the pslra further provides that the lead plaintiff shall,subject to the approval of the court,select and retain counsel to represent the class.id.a b v.after applying two separate methods to determine the plaintiff with the largest financial stake in the litigation,the court appointed cohen and new jersey carpenters as plaintiffs.the district court appointed milberg llp and girard gibbs as counsel,finding u pon review of each firm resume,and given each firm experience with similar actions,these firms were the most qualified counsel for this case.

discussion 
cohen petition for writ of mandamus 
we have authority to issue a writ of mandamus under the all writs act.however,the remedy of mandamus is a drastic one and only exceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power will justify invocation of this extraordinary remedy.bauman dist.court,cir quoting kerr dist.court,d.although we determine de novo whether the writ should issue,we must be firmly convinced that the district court has erred.dist.court,cir.
we decide whether to issue the writ under the factors laid out in bauman,analyzing whether the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law the district court error is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules and the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of the first impression.bauman,at.no single bauman factor is determinative in every case nor must all five factors be present to grant the writ,at.
a.the bauman factors 
we will begin by analyzing the district court opinion for clear error,as this factor is highly significant and failure to show clear error may be dispositive of the petition.cole dist.court,cir fund,motorcar parts accessories,cir.the clear error standard is significantly deferential and is not met unless the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.concrete pipe prods.constr.laborers pension trust,d see also degeorge dist.court,cir applying this standard of review to a district court statutory interpretation.
the depies group argues that the district court acted within its discretion because the pslra leaves the lead plaintiff selection of counsel subject to the approval of the district court.they contend that the district court disapproved cohen selection of kgs and,because of that disapproval,and because the pslra does not explicitly provide procedures for the district court to follow after disapproving the lead plaintiff choice of counsel,the district court acted within its authority by itself selecting class counsel.the district court appears to have relied on a similar justification for its decision in its january order this argument is untenable.although it can not be contested that the district court had the authority to reject cohen choice of lead counsel,it does not follow that having done so it had the authority to select lead counsel of its own choosing.this argument misses the fundamental point that the pslra unambiguously assigns this authority to the lead plaintiff.
when a statute speaks with clarity to an issue,courts must apply the clear meaning of the statute.estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d.we have already explained that the pslra provisions on selection of lead plaintiff and lead counsel,although containing many requirements,are neither overly complex nor ambiguous.cavanaugh,at.here we address only the pslra mandate that t he most adequate plaintiff shall,subject to the approval of the court,select and retain counsel to represent the class.a b v.this provision clearly identifies the most adequate plaintiff as the actor that select s and retain s class counsel.although this power is subject to court approval and is therefore not absolute,it plainly belongs to the lead plaintiff.see see also in re cendant,cir holding that the pslra is clear that the power to select and retain lead counsel belongs to the lead plaintiff,and the court role is confined to deciding whether to approve that choice a
