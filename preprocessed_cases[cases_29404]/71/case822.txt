a jury convicted james frith,of two securities law violations out of charges for operating his registered without enough money in its reserve accounts.his convictions,the result of financial shortfalls on a single day in,were the culmination of a broader,charade during which frith manipulated millions of dollars on his firm books and filed false reports with regulators to conceal the true financial status of his firm.the district court sentenced frith to months in prison and ordered that he pay restitution of roughly million.
on appeal frith challenges both his sentence and the restitution order.he argues that the district court miscalculated the sentencing guidelines range based on losses attributable to noncriminal conduct and improperly applied enhancements.he also contends the restitution order was based on losses from relevant conduct rather than the offenses of conviction,which is not a permissible basis for restitution.
we affirm the district court loss calculation and application of the guidelines.frith guidelines range was based on properly applied enhancements and losses attributable to his crimes of conviction and relevant criminal conduct.we remand,however,for limited proceedings pursuant to united states paladino,cir because frith was sentenced prior to the supreme court decision in united states booker,d and the district judge applied the guidelines as mandatory.we vacate the restitution order and remand for further proceedings.restitution must be based on the offense of conviction,not relevant conduct,and in this case the government did not link the restitution amount to the specific conduct for which frith was convicted.
background 
james frith was the sole shareholder of chicago partnership board cpb,a firm that matched buyers and sellers of limited partnership interests.federal securities law requires firms like cpb to keep at least in a net capital account and enough in a special reserve account to cover the debts owed to customers.to assure investors and regulators of its compliance,cpb had to file monthly reports with the national association of securities dealers nasd,a private body empowered by the securities and exchange commission to oversee the activities of.
sometime in the,cpb began having difficulty maintaining its net capital and special reserve requirements.frith manipulated millions of dollars on cpb books to hide the shortfalls.he personally assumed debts cpb owed to its customers by having cpb write him checks for the amount of the debt and executing liability assumption agreements.once cpb had the debt off its books,the amount needed to satisfy its special reserve requirements decreased correspondingly.frith then would write cpb a check for the same almost the same amount he put some of the money into his other companies which made it appear as though frith had infused capital into cpb.
this activity came to an end in late.regulators caught cpb without enough money in its net capital and special reserve accounts on september,and shut it down by early december.cpb customers and creditors lost millions.during ensuing bankruptcy proceedings,clients recovered some of what they were owed,but the securities investor protection corporation sipc,which guarantees customers claims with failed brokerage firms up to much the same way the federal deposit insurance corporation guarantees bank deposits up to,had to make up much of the shortfall.it kicked in some to make good on its guarantees.the bankruptcy estate also received a payout from cpb fidelity insurer and a payout from continental casualty,the malpractice carrier for cpb auditor.these proceeds went to compensate cpb clients for their losses.
a grand jury indicted frith on counts eighteen counts of making false statements in filings to regulatory authorities,a,a one count of willfully violating net capital requirements on or about september,c,one count of willfully violating special reserve requirements on or about september,c,two counts of making false statements to a bank,and one count of bank fraud.the case proceeded to a jury trial and frith was convicted on just two of the counts willfully violating net capital and special reserve requirements on september.
the district court applied the guidelines as was before the supreme court decision in sentenced frith to months in prison.frith offense level was primarily dictated by the court calculation of the loss amount.see the court calculated the loss by adding the paid by the sipc,the paid by cpb fidelity insurer,and the paid by the malpractice carrier for cpb total serving as a proxy for the losses to cpb clients.see j.this loss of more than million put frith at offense level.the court then increased frith offense level to after finding the offense involved more than minimal planning,b a substantially jeopardized the safety and soundness of a financial institution,b and that frith was an organizer or leader,c,abused a position of trust,and obstructed justice.the guidelines range for offense level,criminal history category i applicable to frith was months.noting that even the low end of the guidelines seemed harsh,the district judge sentenced frith to months and ordered restitution in the same amount as the guidelines loss calculation,approximately million.
ii.discussion 
calculation of the guidelines range 
frith argues on appeal that the district court miscalculated the amount of loss in determining his offense level under.loss amount for purposes of the guidelines must be calculated on the basis of the conduct of conviction and relevant conduct relevant conduct must be criminal or unlawful conduct,though it need not have been charged.see united states schaefer,cir.conduct underlying an acquitted charge may be included as long as that conduct is proved by a preponderance of the evidence.united states watts,d.
frith argues the district court loss calculation was based entirely on noncriminal conduct.he asserts that his alteration of cpb books and the payouts he took for himself were not criminal in and of themselves.filing false reports with regulatory authorities and operating in violation of the net capital and special reserve requirements is criminal conduct,but according to frith,did not cause any loss.he applies the same logic to attack the enhancement for substantially jeopardizing the safety and soundness of a financial institution,b a,claiming he did nothing of a criminal nature to jeopardize the safety and soundness of cpb.
we review calculations of loss under the guidelines for clear error,united states berheide,cir,and application of the guidelines de novo,united states ellis,cir.the guidelines define loss as the value of the money,property,or services unlawfully taken.cmt.loss is not always a precise calculation reasonable estimates will suffice for purposes of the guidelines.cmt.and,as we have noted,where losses are attributable to relevant conduct,the relevant conduct must be criminal or unlawful conduct.schaefer,at see also united states solis,cir united states dove,cir united states shafer,cir united states jain,cir united states dickler,cir.also,to calculate loss for purposes of,the guidelines call for consideration of losses attributable to all acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or general scheme of wrongdoing.a.
most of the million in losses found by the district court are attributable to relevant conduct that was part of frith scheme to operate cpb without enough money on hand to comply with the applicable net capital and special reserve requirements of the securities laws.frith was charged with,though ultimately not convicted of,filing eighteen false reports with regulatory authorities during and misstating the true financial status of cpb.besides being illegal themselves,the false reports covered up the fact that frith was operating his in violation of laws designed to protect his clients.for seventeen months in and frith operated his business by criminally deceiving regulatory authorities and the public.when authorities finally shut cpb down,there was not enough money to pay clients what they were owed.the sipc and fidelity insurer payments were made to c
