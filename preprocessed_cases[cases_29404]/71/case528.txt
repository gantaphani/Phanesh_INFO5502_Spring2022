opinion of the court 
a number of shareholders of novacare,now known as nahc,novacare or company appeal from the dismissal of their consolidated amended complaint the complaint by the district court pursuant to rule b,federal rules of civil procedure,and the private securities litigation reform act pslra,et.they also appeal from the court granting of novacare motion for judicial notice.undergirding this appeal are b,a and a of the securities and exchange act of the exchange act,b,a and a,and rules and promulgated thereunder,and.
the district court applied an inquiry notice standard to determine when the limitations period begins to run in a securities fraud action.appellants contend that the court should have applied an actual notice standard.we have adopted an inquiry notice standard in the context of a case brought under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.see mathews kidder,peabody,cir.we have not,however,decided the precise standard in the context of a securities fraud claim.we do so now and conclude that the district court did not err in applying this standard and dismissing,as,the majority of appellants contentions.we also decide that the large number of other issues raised by appellants were properly decided by the district court and affirm its judgment of dismissal in all respects.
novacare,a national provider of physical rehabilitation and employee benefits management services,operated in three industry segments care services,consisting of physical rehabilitation services outpatient services,comprising physical rehabilitation and occupational health services proh as well as orthotic and prosthetic services o p and employee benefits management services,through a subsidiary,novacare employee services,nces.the company experienced substantial growth from its inception in by the end of the fiscal year ending june,novacare claimed the nation highest market share in the care and orthotic and prosthetic rehabilitation markets.it was also the nation second largest provider of outpatient physical rehabilitation and occupational health services,and,through nces,was the second largest employee services provider.
traditionally,care services had been novacare core business,and in fiscal,it still accounted for approximately of the company net revenues and of its operating income.by the beginning of the relevant period in may of,novacare common stock,listed on the new york stock exchange,traded generally in the range of to per share.
the future of the care services business was about to change,however.for many years,nursing homes had been reimbursed for therapy services on a,subject to guidelines designed to ensure that costs were reasonable.on may,the health care financing administration hcfa issued preliminary regulations implementing the balanced budget act of the bba.the regulations drastically altered the method of reimbursement by medicare and medicaid to care providers of contract therapy services,switching from reimbursement on a cost basis to reimbursement based on a per diem and specific fee schedule structure.approximately one week following the issuance of the hcfa guidelines,novacare executives collectively sold nearly shares of novacare stock.one of the executives was defendant foster,who sold roughly million in shares on may.
following implementation of the hcfa guidelines,novacare reported increasingly diminished revenues for its care services segment in each quarter of the fiscal year.the balanced budget act impact on novacare care business eventually led to a significant decline in the company stock price listing.it then issued a warning in its annual report 
due to the extensive nature of the reimbursement changes specified by the bba,the uncertainty regarding the application of fee schedules and an annual cap on medicare part b services,the effect these changes may have on the demand for services and management inability to predict what portion of the pps and fee schedule rates that novacare will be able to receive based on negotiated term of service contracts with its customers,the company is unable to determine the impact that the bba will have on its financial position on results of operations.
on september,after the company announced expectations of significant declines in first quarter earnings as a result of unanticipated delays in the transition to the new reimbursement system,the company stock dropped by approximately per share from to.by april,novacare was trading at.notwithstanding the new statute materially adverse effect on the company financial condition,the company did not adjust the value of goodwill as an asset of the care division in the financial statements on the securities and exchange commission sec form for the fiscal year the form or on the sec forms for the first and second quarter of the fiscal year the quarter and quarter,respectively.
from april onwards,novacare began to implement a series of restructuring plans to retire its bank debt and improve its capital structure,and this ultimately resulted in the sale of all of the company operating lines of business.on april,the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its orthotic and prosthetic business to hanger orthopedic group,for million.on may,novacare announced that it had agreed to divest its care services business to chance murphy,for only nominal consideration.
on may,foster,mclane and healy renegotiated their employment contracts,providing for transaction and retention bonuses tied to the sale of nces,the sale of proh,and the earlier of either the liquidation of the company or june.
on august,the board of directors of novacare announced that it had approved a proposal to sell the proh division and the company shares in nces to satisfy the company outstanding debentures,and to reinvest or to liquidate and distribute to stockholders any remaining proceeds the restructuring plan.on august,novacare filed with the sec,and mailed to its shareholders,proxy materials announcing a special meeting for the shareholders to vote on the restructuring plan the proxy statement.the proxy statement estimated that the proceeds available for distribution in the event of a liquidation would range from to per common share.on september,the company announced that it had entered into an agreement,subject to shareholder approval of the restructuring plan,to sell its shares in nces to an investment group at per share,amounting to approximately million.on september,the company filed and sent additional proxy materials,which included an opinion letter by wasserstein assessing the fairness of the nces transaction.
on september,the company filed an sec form for the fiscal year.the company did not reassess its goodwill in light of the restructuring plan or adjust the value of goodwill as an asset in the form financial statements.
the shareholders of novacare approved the restructuring plan on september.on october,the company announced that it had agreed to sell the proh division to select medical corporation select medical for approximately million in cash and debt assumption.
on november,the company filed its form with the sec,releasing its financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year.this form disclosed the following developments 
a hanger had claimed there was a million shortfall in novacare calculation of the o p division working capital,for which novacare was responsible pursuant to the sale agreement working capital guarantee 
b novacare was writing off assets that it had retained from the care services business,and that between the and the working capital guarantee that it provided to chance murphy,the company would incur roughly million in losses related to the care services business 
c novacare had placed more than million in escrow in support of the guarantee to the nces investors for four years of gross profits from a services agreement with the proh business,a guarantee on which novacare was required to perform when select medical declined to enter into the agreement and 
d the company had to hold in escrow million of the sale proceeds from the proh sale,and pay million in transaction costs and other liabilities,so novacare would receive only million in cash proceeds from select medical.
app.at.the form also revealed that as a result of the foregoing developments,the estimated liquidation value now ranged from to per share.on november,the first day of trading following the release of form,novacare stock price dropped to per share.on november,novacare disclosed that there would be no liquidated dividend,and that the company held insufficient funds to satisfy its outstanding debt.
because of the broadband attack launched by the appellants before us,it is necessary to set forth,in considerable detail,the comprehensive nature of the district court proceedings,and the seven separate contentions of reversible error asserted in this appeal.
on august,jack brady filed a complaint against novacare,a certain number of its officers and directors,and wasserstein perella.the complaint asserted that defendants had misrepresented novacare divestiture of its four operating businesses during.it alleged claims under b,a and a of the exchange act and the rules thereunder on behalf of stockholders who purchased novacare stock from may,through november,or who were eligible to vote on a restructuring plan in september.brady published notice of the action in accordance with the pslra,a.
on september,chris pietrafitta filed a complaint against the same defendants and also pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc,alleging claims arising from the impact of the bba on novacare care services business.the district court consolidated all pending actions,appointed lead plaintiffs and approved the selection of lead plaintiff counsel.
on february,appellants filed a consolidated and amended complaint,incorporating the allegations of six previously filed complaints.on march,the district court granted plaintiffs leave to file a further amendment to correct certain misstated allegations in the consolidated complaint.
count i of the complaint asserted rule claims against the novacare defendants.the plaintiffs alleged that the novacare defendants engaged in a course of conduct from may,to november,in which they knowingly or recklessly issued materially false and misleading financial statements and failed to disclose significant terms of various asset sales in order to artificially inflate and maintain the price of novacare common stock.
the district court categorized the claims contained in count i into six groups a failure to adjust the goodwill of the care services division in light of the bba impact b failure to disclose that proceeds from the sale of the o p division would be reduced because of overstated working capital c failure to disclose that proceeds from the sale of the care division would be reduced because of i overstated working capital and ii uncollectible accounts receivable d failure to disclose that proceeds from the sale of the nces division would be reduced because i the purchaser of proh would not enter into an employment services contract with nces,nor assume the company guarantee of the contract and ii novacare had placed funds in escrow to support the guarantee of the employment services contract e failure to disclose that proceeds from the sale of the proh division would be materially reduced because i the company would lose the funds escrowed in support of the financial representations in the sales agreement due to the overstatement of the proh working capital and accounts receivable and ii the company would place million in escrow in support of the financial representations and would incur million in transactions costs and liabilities and f failure to adjust the company goodwill despite the planned sale of all operating assets under the restructuring plan.
count ii of the complaint asserted rule claims against pwc,averring that pwc issued materially false and misleading audit reports for novacare and forms.
count iii of the complaint asserted rule claims against wasserstein for issuing a materially false and misleading fairness opinion regarding the nces transaction in the proxy materials.
count iv of the complaint asserted a claims against the individual defendants,as control persons of the company during the time of the alleged underlying violations of rule and rule.
count v of the complaint asserted rule claims against all of the defendants except pwc for issuing proxy materials with materially false or misleading statements regarding claims b through e of count i of the complaint as listed above.
on april,the novacare defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and a motion for judicial notice of certain press releases and sec filings referred to in the complaint,other sec documents filed during the relevant period,and novacare published stock price throughout the alleged class periods.
on october,the district court issued a memorandum and order dismissing the consolidated amended complaint under rule b.in re nahc sec,master file,hereinafter.op.the district court concluded that appellants claim arising from the impact of the bba on novacare services business was under the relevant statute of limitations most of appellants other claims under b of the exchange act failed to plead any misrepresentations and that appellants remaining b claims were either based on alleged misrepresentations that were immaterial as a matter of law,or were not alleged to have been made with the requisite scienter.furthermore,the district court held that appellants claims under a of the exchange act failed to plead material misrepresentations or transactional causation and that appellants claims under a of the exchange act were not viable in the absence of sufficiently pleaded claims under b or a.the district court therefore entered an order which dismissed the complaint.furthermore,the court denied appellants the opportunity to further amend their complaint,determining that any further efforts to amend would be futile.this appeal followed.

this appeal requires us to determine whether the district court properly dismissed appellants consolidated complaint alleging various violations of the securities and exchange act of the district court initially determined that appellants overstatement of goodwill claim,located in count i of the complaint,was because appellants were on inquiry notice for more than one year prior to the filing of their claim.
before the district court,appellants asserted that the novacare appellees knowingly overstated the value of their care services business by failing to write down goodwill in the financial statements presented in novacare annual and quarterly reports filed in fiscal and.appellants further alleged that this overstatement was a violation of generally accepted accounting principles.the district court determined that this claim was because appellants were on inquiry notice of the claim for more than a year before actually filing it.
in lampf gilbertson,d,the court determined that claims arising under b of the exchange act are governed by the limitations rule set forth in e of the exchange act no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section,unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.e.allegations regarding the impact of the bba on the goodwill of novacare care services division were first asserted by appellants in their consolidated complaint dated september,thus,to the extent that appellants were on notice of the alleged overvaluation of goodwill prior to september,this claim of fraudulent misrepresentation is.
appellants argue that the district court improperly applied an inquiry notice standard to determine when the limitations period begins to run in a securities fraud action,and instead should have applied an actual notice standard.they primarily rely on the language of berry valence,cir,in which the court stated 
plaintiffs contend that lampf established an actual discovery standard for triggering the statute of limitations.lampf does appear unequivocal on this point the period,by its terms,begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation.at.moreover,in applying section e limitations period to actions under section b,lampf explicitly chose a provision requiring actual discovery over other provisions allowing inquiry notice.in contrast to section e,section of the securities and exchange act of stipulates that actions under that act must be brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.the supreme court in lampf acknowledged the difference,and was clear about its choice t he various periods contained in the and acts differ slightly in terminology.to the extent that these distinctions in the future might prove significant,we select as the governing standard for an action under b the language of e of the act.at.
berry,at emphasis omitted.
although,the above passage indicates that court preference for an actual notice standard when confronted with a securities fraud situation,the berry court did recognize that c ourts can impute knowledge of public information without inquiring into when,or whether,individual shareholders actually knew of the information in question.id.at.
this is an open question in this court.we have yet to determine when the limitations period begins to run in a securities fraud action,although other courts of appeals,and district courts within this judicial circuit,have generally applied an inquiry notice standard,coupled with some form of reasonable diligence requirement in determining whether a plaintiff securities claims are timely filed.recently,we adopted an inquiry notice test for securities fraud claims in a rico context.see mathews,at.we are not inclined to follow the analysis of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,and accept the approach followed by the other courts of appeals and the district courts in this judicial circuit 
to the extent a securities fraud plaintiff was on inquiry notice of the basis for claims more than one year prior to bringing the action,his or her claim is subsequently by the requisite statute of limitations.
under the inquiry notice standard,the period begins to run when the plaintiffs discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the basis for their claim against the defendant.gruber price waterhouse,citing hobson wilson.whether the plaintiffs,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have known of the basis for their claims depends on whether they had sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to place them on inquiry notice or to excite storm warnings of culpable activity.id.at.the test for storm warnings is an objective one,based on whether a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have discovered the information and recognized it as a storm warning.mathews,at.plaintiffs need not know all of the details or narrow aspects of the alleged fraud to trigger the limitations period instead,the period begins to run from the time at which plaintiff should have discovered the general fraudulent scheme.in re prudential ins.sales practices,quoting mccoy goldberg.
once on inquiry notice,plaintiffs have a duty to exercise reasonable diligence to uncover the basis for their claims,and are held to have constructive notice of all facts that could have been learned through diligent investigation during the limitations period.gruber.at citing maggio gerard freezer ice,cir mosesian peat,marwick,mitchell,cir robertson seidman seidman,cir cook avien,cir.
the district court correctly applied the inquiry notice test in determining that appellants claim that novacare had overstated the value of its care services business was.the court reasoned that appellants were on inquiry notice of that claim no later than june,when novacare filed a form announcing the completion of the sale of the care services business for nominal consideration.this announcement was the culmination of a series of disclosures that put appellants on notice that novacare care services business was in trouble.these disclosures included a press release in september,and quarterly reports in november and february,indicating a material decline in the revenues and earnings of that business.then,beginning in early may,novacare issued a series of specific disclosures which revealed that the care services business had no valuable goodwill 
on may,novacare issued a press release stating that it was writing off the goodwill of its care services business.
on may,novacare filed a form explaining that it was writing off goodwill because it had concluded that it will be unable to recover its investment in assets in the care services segment.
in the may,form novacare also disclosed that it was considering abandoning the care services business entirely.
on may,novacare issued a press release disclosing that it had agreed to sell the entire care services business to chance murphy for a nominal amount.
nahc appellees brief at.
thus,the district court concluded,that by june,when novacare completed the sale of its care services business for nominal consideration,appellants,as reasonable stockholders,were at least on inquiry notice of their claims and,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered the basis for the claims within one year.op.at.the district court is correct in its analysis.appellants conceded in their complaint by april,the financial markets had discounted the care services segment entirely,and novacare sic common stock reflected the valuation of novacare sic other lines of business.app.at.this,coupled with novacare repeated disclosures that it was writing off the goodwill and selling the business for nominal consideration,constituted storm warnings sufficient to place appellants on inquiry notice that the previous valuations of goodwill had been overstated in derogation of gaap.op.at.
once the existence of storm warnings has been adequately established the burden shifts to the plaintiffs to show that they exercised reasonable due diligence and yet were unable to discover their injuries.mathews,at.if plaintiffs do not investigate the storm warnings,they are deem ed on inquiry notice of their claims.id.at.appellants did not allege any facts in their complaint to show why,in the exercise of due diligence,they could not have discovered the overstatement of goodwill prior to september.however,they now contend before this court that because novacare did not separately report the value of goodwill for each acquisition novacare made during its rapid expansion,appellants could not have been able to assess appellees failure to record losses in the value of its intangible assets.appellants brief at.
appellants argument fails for a number of reasons.first,appellants allege that the overstatement of goodwill arose from the bba impact on novacare entire care services business,not from any particular acquisition.second,there is no reason to believe that if appellees individually recorded the of goodwill of individual acquisitions,the problem would have been disclosed to appellants any sooner.novacare wrote off all care services goodwill in may.third,appellants claim is seriously undermined by their own admission that the financial markets had discounted the care services business entirely by april.finally,appellants can not bolster their cause by arguing the difficulty of discovering the alleged fraud.this court has previously held that excus ing appellant lack of inquiry because,in retrospect,reasonable diligence would not have uncovered their injury would,in effect,discourage investigation mathews,at.
therefore,because the claim regarding the overstatement of the care services goodwill was not asserted until september,this action was not commenced within the limitations period.consequently,the district court did not err in dismissing appellants claims as.
appellants contend also that the district court erred when it dismissed appellants remaining b allegations against novacare for failure to state a claim dismissed appellants a claims against novacare for failure to demonstrate materiality and transactional causation dismissed appellants b claims against pricewaterhousecoopers llp because they were and they failed to allege any material misrepresentations in their statements dismissed appellants b and a claims against wasserstein perella,because any alleged misrepresentation was immaterial as a matter of law improperly took judicial notice of certain documents filed during the relevant period and abused its discretion in denying appellants leave to amend.
the district court did not err in dismissing appellants remaining b allegations against the novacare appellees for failure to state a claim.
to state a valid securities fraud claim under rule,a plaintiff must first establish that defendant,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,made a materially false or misleading statement or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading.see in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the plaintiff must additionally establish that the defendant acted with scienter and that plaintiff reasonable reliance on defendant misstatement proximately caused him injury.see in re phillips petroleum sec,cir.
oran stafford,cir.
in addition,a party asserting a claim under the federal securities laws must meet the heightened pleading standard set forth under the pslra,enacted in to restrict abuses in securities litigation.first,the pslra requires a party alleging a rule violation to specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.in re advanta.sec,cir quoting b.second,the pslra requires that a securities fraud complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.id.at quoting b.
appellants initially attempt to attack the district court dismissal of their b claims by arguing that the court applied too stringent a standard when reviewing their allegations.appellants contend that rule b,federal rules of civil procedure requires that a relaxed pleading standard applies to securities fraud actions brought under the pslra.appellants brief at.we do not agree.
we have recognized that c omplaints alleging securities fraud must also comply with rule b,which provides in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.malice,intent,knowledge,and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.advanta,at quoting rule b,federal rules of civil procedure.
we have held that rule b provision allowing state of mind to be averred generally conflicts with the reform act requirement that plaintiffs state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter in that sense,we believe the reform act supersedes rule b as it relates to rule actions.id.at internal citations omitted.the standard applied by the district court here was correct.
in an extremely thorough discussion,the district court dismissed appellants b claims against novacare.we accept the reasoning and conclusion set forth in its opinion.op.at.
in addition to their rule contentions,appellants argue that the proxy materials distributed by the novacare appellees on august,and september,violated a and rule because they had misrepresented the liquidation values of novacare.they further allege that the proxy materials failed to disclose fully the extent of bonuses that the company executives had negotiated for themselves.
rule,promulgated by the sec pursuant to section a of the exchange act,provides,in pertinent part that 
no solicitation subject to this regulation shall be made by means of any proxy statement which,at the time it is made,is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading 
to prevail on a a claim,a plaintiff must show that a proxy statement contained a material misrepresentation or omission which caused the plaintiff injury and that the proxy solicitation itself,rather than the particular defect in the solicitation materials,was an essential link in the accomplishment of the transaction.cathcart,cir citing mills,d.
here,too,we agree with the district court reasoning set forth in its opinion and its conclusion 
under the heightened pleading standard of the pslra,the complaint in a section a action must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,all facts with particularity on which that belief is formed.see b.as explained above,plaintiffs have failed to allege particularized facts to support the allegation that the statements regarding the following issues were materially false when the novacare defendants issued the proxy materials the o p divestiture the divestiture of the company care services division the nces divestiture and the proh divestiture.thus,i conclude that the plaintiffs section a claims with regard to these issues will be dismissed.
in addition to their claim against the novacare appellees,appellants assert rule claims against pwc which allege that pwc failed to reassess the care services goodwill in novacare form and the goodwill of the company in novacare form as required under gaap and generally accepted auditing standards gaas and pwc issued an unqualified audit report for the and forms that were materially false and misleading.both of these allegations were properly dismissed.
considering appellants claim regarding the,under an inquiry notice standard,appellants,as reasonable stockholders discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the basis for their claim against the pwc appellees by june,when novacare filed a form announcing the completion of the sale of the care services business for nominal consideration.see gruber price waterhouse.for the same reasons as discussed earlier,because the claim regarding the overstatement of goodwill in the form was not asserted until september,it is pursuant to the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims.
appellants claim regarding the alleged misstatement of goodwill in the form was also properly dismissed.as previously mentioned,under b,a private cause of action arises when purchasers or sellers can identify a false representation of material fact or omission that makes a disclosed statement materially misleading.burlington,at.however,a fact or omission is material only if there is a substantial likelihood that it would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information available to the investor.basic levinson,d.the proxy materials filed with the sec on august,disclosed the impact of the proposed liquidation of the company.this disclosure rendered immaterial any subsequent misstatement regarding the goodwill of the company in the form because it did not alter the total mix of information available to appellants.the district court did not err in dismissing appellants claims against pwc.
appellants also assert b and a claims against wasserstein which allege that wasserstein fraudulently omitted material information regarding the loss of the million escrow for the nces employment guarantee from the opinion letter included in the proxy materials dated septe
