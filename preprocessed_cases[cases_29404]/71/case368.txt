before us are two petitions for a writ of mandamus brought by huff asset management,llc,et the huff petitioners and eminence capital,llc,et the class action petitioners and,together with huff petitioners,the petitioners.both petitions seek to vacate a settlement agreement of a forfeiture action among the united states and john rigas,timothy rigas,and other members of the rigas family that establishes a million fund to compensate victims of a fraud perpetrated in part by john rigas and timothy rigas.both petitions are based on the crime victims rights act of cvra or the act.
because the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the settlement agreement,we deny both petitions.

at the may hearing,various objectors,including the petitioners herein,were heard and the following colloquy,inter alia,occurred 
the court tell me what the government should do now that they have not done and how long it would take and what impact that would have on the sentence of the rigases.
attorney for class action petitioners your honor,there is no question that hiring the claims administrator tomorrow and sending out notice to determine who the victims are and how to allocate those funds would delay the sentencing set for june.but i think the government 
the court how long would it delay it months 
assistant united states attorney years.
attorney for class action petitioners i think,your honor,it would certainly delay the matter for months.
the court yes.that unacceptable.that is unacceptable.you would have to satisfy me that that type of a delay was necessary to ensure compliance with the statute and fairness to the victims and would be of sufficient value to run the risk of this whole global settlement coming apart.
