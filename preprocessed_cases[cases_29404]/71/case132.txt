this appeal presents the recurring issue of statutory interpretation that arises when express terms in one provision of a statute are arguably in tension with language in another provision of the same statute.the supreme court recently encountered a similar issue when it interpreted a provision in the patient protection and affordable care act in burwell king.in the pending case,the tension occurs within the whistleblower protection provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank,title ix,a,stat,which added section to the exchange act of,codified at.the relevant administrative agency,the securities and exchange commission sec or commission,has issued a regulation endeavoring to harmonize the provisions that are in tension.
plaintiff appellant daniel berman appeals from the december,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york gregory woods,district judge,dismissing on motion for summary judgment his suit against defendants appellees llc and wpp group usa.see berman llc,cv ghw sn,wl.we conclude that the pertinent provisions of dodd frank create a sufficient ambiguity to warrant our deference to the sec interpretive rule,which supports berman view of the statute.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the statutory and regulatory provisions.section,added to the exchange act by dodd frank,is captioned securities whistleblower incentives and protection.subsection b provides the incentives by directing the sec to pay awards to individuals whose reports to the commission about violations of the securities laws result in successful commission enforcement actions.see b.subsection h provides the protection by prohibiting employers from retaliation against employees for reporting violations.id.h.
this appeal concerns the relationship between the definition of whistleblower in section and one subdivision of the provision prohibiting retaliation,which was added by a conference committee just before final passage.subsection a,the definitions subsection of section,contains subsection a,which defines whistleblower to mean any individual who provides information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the commission id.a emphasis added.subsection h,the retaliation protection provision,contains subsection h a,which provides 
a in general 
no employer may discharge,demote,suspend,threaten,harass,directly or indirectly,or in any other manner discriminate against,a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the whistleblower 
i in providing information to the commission in accordance with this section 
ii in initiating,testifying in,or assisting in any investigation or judicial or administrative action of the commission based upon or related to such information or 
iii in making disclosures that are required or protected under the sarbanes oxley act of et,this chapter,the exchange act,including section m of this title,section m of the exchange act,section e of title,and any other law,rule,or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley,public,stat,which is by subdivision iii of subsection h a of dodd frank,includes several provisions concerning the internal reporting of securities law violations or improper practices.
for example,section of sarbanes oxley requires the sec to issue rules requiring an attorney to report securities law violations to the chief legal counsel or chief executive officer of the company.see.section of sarbanes oxley added to the exchange act section m,requires the sec by rule to direct national securities exchanges and national securities associations to require audit committees of listed companies to establish internal company procedures allowing employees to submit complaints regarding auditing matters.this section is not codified.section a of sarbanes oxley prohibits a publicly traded company from retaliating against an employee who provides information concerning securities law violations to,among other,a federal regulatory or law enforcement agency,a member of congress,or a person with supervisory authority over the employee.a.
this appeal concerns the arguable tension between the definitional subsection,subsection a,which defines whistleblower to mean an individual who reports violations to the commission,and subdivision iii of subsection h a,which,unlike subdivisions i and ii,does not within its own terms limit its protection to those who report wrongdoing to the sec.on the contrary,subdivision iii expands the protections of dodd frank to include the whistleblower protection provisions of sarbanes oxley,and those provisions,which contemplate an employee reporting violations internally,do not require reporting violations to the commission.
in statutory terms,the issue presented is whether the whistleblower definition in subsection a of dodd frank applies to subdivision iii of subsection h a.in operational terms,the issue is whether an employee who suffers retaliation because he reports wrongdoing internally,but not to the sec,can obtain the retaliation remedies provided by dodd frank.
the sec believes he can.in,using its authority to issue rules implementing section,see j,the sec promulgated exchange act rule,f,which provides 
a definition of a whistleblower.
you are a whistleblower if,alone or jointly with others,you provide the commission with information pursuant to the procedures set forth in f a of this chapter,and the information relates to a possible violation of the federal securities laws including any rules or regulations thereunder that has occurred,is ongoing,or is about to occur.a whistleblower must be an individual.a company or another entity is not eligible to be a whistleblower.
to be eligible for an award,you must submit original information to the commission in accordance with the procedures and conditions described in f,f,and f of this chapter.
b prohibition against retaliation.
for purposes of the protections afforded by section h of the exchange act h,you are a whistleblower if 
i you possess a reasonable belief that the information you are providing relates to a possible securities law violation or,where applicable,to a possible violation of the provisions set forth in a that has occurred,is ongoing,or is about to occur,and 
ii you provide that information in a manner described in section h a of the exchange act h a.
iii the protections apply whether or not you satisfy the requirements,procedures and conditions to qualify for an award 
echoing section a of dodd frank,subsection a of exchange act rule defines a whistleblower as a person who provide s the commission with specific information.f a.however,subsection b of the rule,headed protection against retaliation,provides,in subdivision b ii that,for purposes of the retaliation protections of dodd frank,a person is a whistleblower if the person provide s specified information in a manner described in the retaliation protection provisions of dodd frank,which includes the in subdivision iii to the reporting provisions of sarbanes oxley.id.f b ii.those provisions,as explained above,protect an employee who reports internally without reporting to the commission.
as the sec explained in its release accompanying issuance of exchange rule,the statutory protections of dodd frank apply to three different categories of whistleblowers,and the third category described in subdivision iii of subsection h a includes individuals who report to persons or governmental authorities other than the commission.securities whistleblower incentives and protections,release,at,wl june,emphasis added.
so the more precise issue in the pending appeal is whether the arguable tension between the definitional section of subsection a and subdivision iii of subsection f h a creates sufficient ambiguity as to the coverage of subdivision iii to oblige us to give chevron deference to the sec rule.see chevron,natural resources defense council.
the pending lawsuit.plaintiff appellant daniel berman was the finance director of defendant appellee llc neo from october to april.he was responsible for neo financial reporting and its compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap,as well as internal accounting procedures of neo and its parent,defendant appellee wpp group usa,wpp.neo is a media agency that provides a range of digital and direct media services.
in january,berman sued neo and wpp,alleging that he was discharged in violation of the whistleblower protection provisions of section of dodd frank and in breach of his employment contract.according to the allegation of the complaint,while employed at neo,he discovered various practices that he alleged amounted to accounting fraud.he also alleged that these practices violated gaap,sarbanes oxley,and dodd frank,and that he had reported these violations internally.a senior officer at neo became angry with him,and he was terminated as a result of his whistleblower activities in april.in august he reported his allegations to the wpp audit committee.
while employed at neo and for about six months after he was fired,berman did not report any allegedly unlawful activities to the sec.in october,after the limitations period on one of his sarbanes oxley claims had ended,he provided information to the commission.
defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was referred to magistrate judge sarah netburn.she filed a report recommendation r r recommending that berman was entitled to be considered a whistleblower under dodd frank because of the retaliation protection of subdivision iii of subsection h a,unrestricted by the definition of whistleblower in subsection a.however,the r r also recommended that the retaliation claims be dismissed for legal insufficiency,without prejudice to amendment,and that the contracts claims be dismissed with prejudice.
the district court,disagreeing with the magistrate judge,relied on the definition of whistleblower in subsection a and ruled that subsection h a,including subdivision iii,provided whistleblower protection only to those discharged for reporting alleged violations to the commission.the district court dismissed the dodd frank claims because berman had been terminated long before he reported alleged violations to the sec.the district court also rejected the contract claims and dismissed the entire complaint.see berman,wl,at.berman appeal challenges only the dismissal of his dodd frank claim.
discussion 
the statutory interpretation issue posed by this case is not as stark,and hence not as easily resolved,as that encountered in somewhat similar cases in scialabba cuellar de osorio,for example,the express language of one clause of a subsection of a statute was contradicted by express language in another clause of the same subsection.see id.at t he two halves of h face in different directions.in church of the holy trinity united states,application of the express terms of a statute to the facts of a case yielded a result so unlikely to have been intended by congress that the supreme court did not apply those terms see id.at declining to apply to a church contract with a british pastor a prohibition on contracting to import an alien to perform labor of any kind.
closer to our case is the issue the supreme court recently confronted in burwell king.there,four words of one provision expressly provided that income tax subsidies were available to those who purchased health insurance on exchanges established by a state,and the argument made to the court was that the operation of the entire statute would be undermined if tax subsidies were not also available to those who purchased health insurance on exchanges established by the federal government.a divided court accepted that argument and interpreted the affordable care act as a whole to provide income tax subsidies to those who purchased health insurance on federal exchanges.
the interpretation issue facing the supreme court in king was far more problematic than the issue we face here.in king the issue was whether the statutory phrase established by the state should be understood to mean established by the state or by the federal government.in our case,the statutory provision relied on by the appellees and our dissenting colleague contains the phrase provide to the commission,but the issue is not whether that phrase means something other than what it literally says instead,the issue is whether the statutory provision applies to another provision of the statute,or,more precisely,whether the answer to that question is sufficiently unclear to warrant chevron deference to the commission regulation.
in our case there is no absolute conflict between the commission notification requirement in the definition of whistleblower and the absence of such a requirement in both subdivision iii of subsection h a of dodd frank and the sarbanes oxley provisions incorporated by subdivision iii.an employee who suffers retaliation after reporting wrongdoing simultaneously to his employer and to the sec is eligible for dodd frank remedies and those provided by sarbanes oxley.subdivision iii assures him the latter remedies,and his simultaneous report to the sec assures him that he will not have excluded himself from dodd frank remedies.indeed,it was the possibility of simultaneous complaints to both the employer and the commission that persuaded the fifth circuit to insist that the commission notification requirement be observed by all employees who seek dodd frank remedies for whistleblower retaliation.see asadi energy usa,cir 
although the simultaneous reporting example avoids an absolute contradiction between the commission reporting requirement of the whistleblower definition and subdivision iii incorporation of sarbanes oxley remedies,a significant tension within subsection nevertheless remains.applying the commission reporting requirement to employees seeking sarbanes oxley remedies pursuant to subdivision iii would leave that subdivision with an extremely limited scope for several reasons.
first,although there may be some potential whistleblowers who will report wrongdoing simultaneously to their employer and the commission,they are likely to be few in number.some will surely feel that reporting only to their employer offers the prospect of having the wrongdoing ended,with little chance of retaliation,whereas reporting to a government agency creates a substantial risk of retaliation.
second,and more significant,there are categories of whistleblowers who can not report wrongdoing to the commission until after they have reported the wrongdoing to their employer.chief among these are auditors and attorneys.
auditors are subject to subsection of the exchange act,which is one of the provisions of sarbanes oxley,expressly by subdivision iii.subsection b b requires an auditor of a public company,under certain circumstances,to inform the appropriate level of the management of illegal acts,unless they are inconsequential.see b b.subsection b requires an auditor to report to the board of directors if the company does not take reasonable remedial action after the auditor report to management.see id.b.significantly to our case,subsection b b permits an auditor to report illegal acts to the commission only if the board or management fails to take appropriate remedial action.see id.b b.thus,if subdivision iii requires reporting to the commission,its express to the provisions of sarbanes oxley would afford an auditor almost no dodd frank protection for retaliation because the auditor must await a company response to internal reporting before reporting to the commission,and any retaliation would almost always precede commission reporting.
attorneys are subject to both section of sarbanes oxley,u,and the sec standards of professional attorney standards,and subdivision iii any other law,rule,or regulation subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.subsection requires attorneys to report material violations of the securities laws to the chief legal counsel or chief executive officer ceo of a public company,and subsection requires attorneys to report such violations to the audit or other appropriate committee of the board of directors if the counsel or ceo does not appropriately respond to the attorney internal reporting.again significantly to our case,the sec rule of its attorney standards contemplates an attorney reporting to the commission only after internal reporting,see d,explicitly recognizing that by reporting internally first an attorney does not reveal client confidences or secrets or privileged or otherwise protected information related to the attorney representation of the issuer,id.b.like auditors,attorneys would gain little,if any,dodd frank protection if subdivision iii,despite sarbanes oxley provisions protecting lawyers,protected only against retaliation for reporting to the commission.
thus,apart from the rare example of simultaneous or nearly simultaneous reporting of wrongdoing to an employer and to the commission,there would be virtually no situation where an sec reporting requirement would leave subdivision iii with any scope.
in light of these realities as to the sharply limiting effect of a commission reporting requirement on all whistleblowers seeking the sarbanes oxley remedies promised by dodd frank for those who report wrongdoing internally,the question becomes whether congress intended to add subdivision iii to subsection h a only to achieve such a limited result.to answer that question we would normally look to the legislative history of subdivision iii to learn what congress,or the relevant committee,had sought to accomplish by adding subdivision iii.see,vincent v.the money store,cir.
unfortunately that inquiry yields nothing.what became subdivision iii of subsection h a was not in either version of dodd frank that was passed by the house and the senate prior to a conference after these versions went to conference,the house conferees prepared a conference base text to serve as the basis for resolution of differences by the conference committee.
subdivision iii first saw the light of day in that conference base text when it was added to follow subdivisions i and ii of subsection h a,both of which had been in the senate version.unfortunately,there is no mention of the addition of subdivision iii,much less its meaning or intended purpose,in any legislative materials not in the conference report nor the final passage debates on dodd frank in either the house or the senate.the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference explains only that t he subtitle subtitle b of title ix further enhances incentives and protections for whistleblowers providing information leading to successful sec enforcement actions,at.subdivision iii is,like judge friendly felicitous characterization of the alien tort act,a kind of legal lohengrin no one seems to know whence it came.itt vencap,cir,abrogated on other grounds by morrison national australia bank.
other courts confronting the issue of whether the arguable tension between subsection a and subdivision iii of subsection h a warrants chevron deference to exchange rule have reached conflicting results.the fifth circuit in asadi,at,and the district court decision that asadi affirmed,asadi energy usa,llc,civ.action,wl,both ruled the subsection a definition of whistleblower controlling.three other district courts have followed asadi.see verfuerth orion energy systems,banko apple,d,wagner bank of america,cv rbj,wl,at.july.
on the other hand,a far larger number of district courts have deemed the statute ambiguous and deferred to the sec rule.see somers digital realty trust,no.emc,wl,at.may,yang navigators group,d,khazin td ameritrade holding.sdwq mca,wl,at,azim tortoise capital advisors,llc,khv,wl,at,ahmad morgan stanley,d,rosenblum thomson reuters mkts.llc,d,murray ubs securities,llc,wl,at may,ellington giacoumakis,d,genberg porter,d,nollner southern baptist convention,d,kramer trans lux,sru,wl,at,egan tradingscreen,civ,wl,at may.thus,although our decision creates a circuit split,it does so against a landscape of existing disagreement among a large number of district courts.
like all these courts,we confront both the definition of whistleblower in subsection a,which extends whistleblower protection only to employees who report violations to the commission,and the language of subdivision iii,which purports to protect from retaliation for making reports required or protected by sarbanes oxley,reports that are made internally,without notification to the commission.we recognize that the terms of a definitional subsection are usually to be taken literally,see antonin scalia and bryan garner,reading law,ordinarily,judges apply definitions with rigor,and,pertinent to this case,usually applied to all subdivisions literally covered by the definition,but we have also recognized that mechanical use of a statutory definition is not always warranted.see in re air cargo shipping services antitrust litigation,cir.scalia and garner too have stated,definitions are,after all,just one indication of meaning a very strong indication,to be sure,but nonetheless one that can be contradicted by other indications.scalia and garner.the issue here,however,is not whether to read the words of the definitional section literally,but the different issue of whether the definition should apply to a subdivision of a subsection that uses the defined term.
in deciding whether sufficient ambiguity exists in dodd frank to warrant deference to the sec rule,we note,but are not persuaded by,the arguments that any reading would render some language of dodd frank superfluous.berman contends that if subdivision iii is subject to the commission reporting requirement by virtue of subsection a,then most of subdivision iii would be superfluous because the sarbanes oxley protections purportedly incorporated would have no effect.the sec argues that if the definition of whistleblower applies to all three subdivisions of subsection h a,then the commission reporting requirement,expressly stated in subdivisions i and ii,would be superfluous.neo contends that if subdivision iii does not require an employee to report violations to the commission,then the sec reporting requirement in subsection a would be superfluous.
all these arguments ignore the realities of the legislative process.when conferees are hastily trying to reconcile house and senate bills,each of which number hundreds of pages,and someone succeeds in inserting a new provision like subdivision iii into subsection h a,it is not at all surprising that no one noticed that the new subdivision and the definition of whistleblower do not fit together neatly the definition speaks of reporting to the commission,but subdivision iii incorporates sarbanes oxley provisions,which contemplate internal reporting,without reporting to the commission.subdivisions i and ii,which were included in the senate version of dodd frank before the conferees met,fit precisely with the whistleblower definition.subdivision i explicitly requires reporting to the commission,and subdivision ii concerns assisting action of the commission,whereas the terms of subdivision iii do neither 
when the conferees,at the last minute,inserted subdivision iii within subsection h a,did they expect subdivision iii to be limited by the statutory definition of whistleblower in subsection a,or did they expect employees to be protected by subdivision iii whenever they report violations internally,without reporting to the commission the texts leave the matter unclear,and no legislative history even hints at an answer.
ultimately,we think it doubtful that the conferees who accepted the insertion of subdivision iii would have expected it to have the extremely limited scope it would have if it were restricted by the commission reporting requirement in the whistleblower definition in subsection a.if we had to choose between reading the statute literally or broadly to carry out its apparent purpose,we might well favor the latter course.however,we need not definitively construe the statute,because,at a minimum,the tension between the definition in subsection a and the limited protection provided by subdivision iii of subsection h a if it is subject to that definition renders section as a whole sufficiently ambiguous to oblige us to give chevron deference to the reasonable interpretation of the agency charged with administering the statute.unlike the situation confronting the supreme court in king,where the agency administering the disputed provision,the internal revenue service,was deemed to lack relevant expertise,king.at,obliging the court itself to resolve the ambiguity,see,the sec is clearly the agency to resolve the ambiguity we face.therefore,also unlike king,we need not resolve the ambiguity ourselves,but will defer to the reasonable interpretive rule adopted by the appropriate agency.
under sec rule b,berman is entitled to pursue dodd frank remedies for alleged retaliation after his report of wrongdoing to his employer,despite not having reported to the commission before his termination.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.on remand,the district court will have an opportunity to consider the r r recommendation to dismiss,without prejudice to amendment,for lack of a sufficient allegation of a termination entitled to dodd frank protection,and any other arguments made by the defendants in support of their motion to dismiss.
reversed and remanded.
the majority and the securities and exchange commission sec have altered a federal statute by deleting three words to the commission from the definition of whistleblower in the dodd frank act.no doubt,my colleagues in the majority,assisted by the sec or not,could improve many federal statutes by tightening them or loosening them,or recasting or rewriting them.i could try my hand at it.but our obligation is to apply congressional statutes as written.in this instance,the alteration creates a circuit split,and places us firmly on the wrong side of it.see asadi energy usa,llc,cir.i respectfully dissent.
persons who report certain violations of the securities laws are protected from retaliation under at least two federal statutes.sarbanes oxley protects employees who blow a whistle to management or to regulatory agencies dodd frank protects whistleblowers,defined as persons who report violations to the commission.a.dodd frank has a longer statute of limitations,doubles the collectible,and requires no administrative exhaustion.the plaintiff in this case reported the violation to his employer,and did not report it to the securities and exchange commission,and he is therefore protected from retaliation under sarbanes oxley only.but the sec and the majority perceive a hole in coverage,or an insufficiency of remedy,and are patching.
the statutory provisions relevant to this case are few.the dodd frank act defines the word whistleblower in one sentence,and provides that this definition shall apply anywhere else i n this section 
a definitions 
in this section the following definitions shall apply 
whistleblower 
the term whistleblower means any individual who provides,or or more individuals acting jointly who provide,information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the securities and exchange commission,in a manner established,by rule or regulation,by the commission.

h a emphases added.
reading the definition and the substantive provision together clearly answers two questions who is protected and what actions by protected individuals constitute protected activity.asadi,at.as the fifth circuit put it,the answer to the first question is a whistleblower.id.quoting h a no employer may discharge a whistleblower emphasis added.and,just as easy,the answer to the latter question is any lawful act done by the whistleblower that falls within one of the three categories of action described in the statute.id.quoting h a.
berman alleges that he made disclosures that are required or protected under the sarbanes oxley act of,h a in particular,he alleges that he reported a securities law violation to his employer.but he does not allege facts that make him a whistleblower as that term is defined in dodd frank.nor could he he concedes that before his termination,he never reported anything to the securities and exchange commission.a.
the majority hardly disputes that my reading and the reading given in asadi is the more natural reading of the statute.but the majority extends deference to an sec regulation that alters the unambiguous definition of whistleblower to include anyone who reports a securities law violation in a manner described in h a,f b,including those who report a securities violation to their employer only.according to the majority,there is arguable tension,op.at,between the definition and the substantive provisions,and that is deemed enough for the sec interpretation to survive under chevron.i would apply the unambiguous statutory text.
a.the majority assumes its own conclusion,claiming that subdivision iii of h a purports to protect employees from retaliation for making reports required or protected by sarbanes oxley.op.at emphasis added.that is a bad misreading,tantamount to a misquotation.dodd frank provisions do not mention this generic employee.instead,the statute lists three ways that a whistleblower may take protected activity in one case,by making disclosures protected under sarbanes oxley,see h a iii.and whistleblower is a defined term.so subdivision iii only protects someone who makes a protected disclosure under sarbanes oxley,and also satisfies dodd frank definition of whistleblower.if the statute used the word employee,op.at,berman might have a claim.he does not because the phrasing is a coinage of the majority.
the majority asks who but employees could be discriminated against by an employer in the terms and conditions of employment op.at.my answer a whistleblower.congress apparently agrees.see h a no employer may discriminate against a whistleblower in the terms and conditions of employment.
the generic employee is nevertheless protected in the sarbanes oxley provision.see u.a a company may not discriminate against an employee because of lawful whistleblowing activity emphasis added.the majority ignores the distinction congress drew in the two statutes.
b.the majority claims repeatedly that the issue presented is whether the whistleblower definition in subsection a of dodd frank applies to subdivision iii of subsection h a.op.at see also id.at.to answer that question,the majority looks here,there and to the statutory text.but the definitions section is unambiguous in this section the following definitions shall apply.u.a emphasis added.and all of the relevant statutory provisions in this case appear i n this section that is,section of title of the.accordingly,when congress used the word whistleblower in h a,it mean t any individual who provides information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the commission.a.
the thing about a definition is that it is,well,definitional.
