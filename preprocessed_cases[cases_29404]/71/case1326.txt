facts and procedural background 
expo power systems,distributes power systems and battery acid containment products.plaintiff and respondent ken cotton owns one third of the shares of expo.defendants and appellant douglas frazier and his wife toni frazier own two thirds of expo shares.cotton was expo primary sales person.revenues increased from million in to million in.during this time,expo paid substantial royalties to the fraziers for the use of a patent that cotton believes is actually owned by expo.expo leased office space in a building that was owned by the fraziers and incurred a debt of for tenant improvements.expo revenues did not continue to increase.by,expo could no longer pay rent,and as a result,the fraziers were unable to pay the mortgage on their property.a sale of the property with the bank cooperation extinguished all of the obligations of expo,the fraziers,and cotton.the fraziers and cotton had a falling out,and cotton began working for a competitor.
on october,cotton filed a complaint against expo,the fraziers,and the fraziers management company and diversified investments group,llc.the complaint alleged that the fraziers had breached fiduciary duties to cotton by diverting expo assets for their own purposes.cotton sought a constructive trust,an accounting,declaratory relief,and dissolution of expo.
on november,cotton filed a shareholder derivative action against the same defendants alleging similar causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,accounting,and imposition of a constructive trust.the cases were deemed related and assigned to department of the los angeles superior court,the honorable paul gutman presiding.cotton company,donlee consulting corporation,filed an action against expo and the fraziers for breach of contract,open book account,and money loaned based on unpaid consulting fees and loan payments.
on december,defendants filed a notice of election pursuant to section to purchase cotton shares of expo.on january,defendants filed a motion requesting a stay of dissolution in order to fix the value of cotton shares,appoint appraisers,and set bond as required by section.defendants argued that substantial litigation would be avoided,because the value of expo would be appraised,including the value of cotton derivative claims,and purchased by the fraziers.judge gutman transferred the motion to department,the honorable dzintra janavs presiding.
on april,judge janavs confirmed the appointment of three appraisers and ordered expo to pay the costs of the appraisal the parties stipulated to give the appraisers authority to request evidence in aid of the appraisal.
in november,the appraisers provided a report to the court in which they expressly declined to value cotton claims on behalf of expo or donlee consulting corporation claims against expo.the appraisers did not believe their authority included a evaluation of claims in litigation,or if it did,they concluded it would be wasteful to cause the parties to bear the expense of an evaluation that would be followed by a binding judicial resolution of the same claims.
the report further stated,the measure of fair market value of an ongoing business is ultimately what a reasonable buyer,acting freely and without duress,would pay for the property in question and what amount a reasonable seller,also acting without duress,would accept.it is the judgment of the panel that no reasonable buyer would increase whatever amount he would otherwise pay for the business to obtain the benefits of the disputed claims in litigation.if anything,a reasonable buyer might place a relatively high valuation on the expense and burden of litigation as well as the risk of loss on claims against the company.accordingly,in the real world,a potential buyer might reduce whatever amount he would otherwise pay.the panel has not attempted to consider a quantification of any such increase or reduction.the panel has concluded that it would not attempt to place any increase in value to reflect any valuation of the claims in this litigation.
the appraisers expressed their concern that the fraziers purchase of cotton shares for a value exclusive of the claims in litigation should not be a device to extinguish the claims and artificially eliminate whatever value they had.therefore,the panel recommended any order permitting the fraziers to purchase cotton shares be conditioned on an assignment by expo to cotton of the right to pursue the claims asserted in the litigation.
the report concluded that the value of expo shares,exclusive of the claims in litigation,was nominal,whether valued on a liquidation basis or as a going concern in liquidation.based on the foregoing discussion,the panel concludes that the fair appraised value of expo power systems,exclusive of the claims in litigation advanced on i
