at issue is an order entered against parties to a securities pyramid or ponzi scheme,requiring the principal and his two companies,jointly and severally,to disgorge millions of dollars that the district court found to be gains from their having defrauded numerous investors.the defendants are wallenbrock associates wallenbrock and citadel capital management group,citadel,business entities that were organized and controlled by larry osaki,the managing general partner of wallenbrock and a percent owner of citadel collectively the defendants another is van ichinotsubo,an employee of both companies who solicited investors on their behalf and invested million in wallenbrock we affirm the district court disgorgement order.
factual and procedural 
from at least to october,the defendants raised nearly million from thousands of investors through the fraudulent sale of unregistered promissory notes the defendants misrepresented to investors that they were using the proceeds of the notes,matched by wallenbrock,to purchase accounts receivable of malaysian latex glove manufacturing companies and that the investments would yield returns of percent every days.the defendants told investors that there was little or no risk in the wallenbrock investments and emphasized the safety of profits.in fact,the defendants did not purchase such receivables but instead used the investors funds to engage in a ponzi scheme and invest in speculative business ventures 
wallenbrock first deposited the investors million in osaki wallenbrock checking account.the defendants then used million of these funds to pay investors their returns,maintaining the illusion that the defendants were actually making the investments as represented.of the remaining million,the defendants spent million to cover operating expenses for both citadel and wallenbrock,including expenses such as office space and payroll for over employees of both companies,and million to pay for various wallenbrock operating expenses and osaki personal expenses wallenbrock also spent million to fund over companies on citadel behalf,of which citadel was obligated to repay wallenbrock million plus percent annual interest the remaining million was still in osaki wallenbrock checking account as of december.
in january,the sec brought a civil enforcement action against the defendants alleging violations of the,registration and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws the district court granted the sec request for an asset freeze and temporary restraining order enjoining future violations,and appointed a receiver on february.in may,the defendants consented to a preliminary injunction.after we affirmed the district court denial of the defendants motion to dismiss in sec wallenbrock,cir,the defendants,in february,settled with the sec by consenting to entry of a permanent injunction against future violations.the injunction order authorized the district court to determine the amounts of disgorgement,plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties to be imposed on the defendants as a result of the conduct alleged in the commission complaint.the injunction order also precluded the defendants from denying or arguing that they did not violate the federal securities laws in the manner set out in the commission complaint,but did not preclude defendants from presenting evidence as to whether and what amount of disgorgement,prejudgment interest and civil penalties are appropriate.
in december,the district court granted the sec motion for disgorgement.the court found that osaki and ichinotsubo operated a ponzi scheme through wallenbrock and citadel,repaying to investors million of the million raised and spending million of the investor funds for their own benefit.in its order,the court imposed disgorgement against wallenbrock,osaki and citadel,jointly and severally,of million the entire proceeds from the scheme less amounts paid to investors plus prejudgment interest of million,minus any disgorgement payments made by ichinotsubo disgorgement against ichinotsubo of the amount he received from the proceeds of the scheme plus prejudgment interest of and a civil penalty of each against osaki and ichinotsubo pursuant to d c and d b iii the defendants have appealed only the district court calculation of disgorgement assessed against each of them.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to and,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we review the district court order of disgorgement for abuse of discretion.sec first pac.bancorp,cir.
iii.discussion 
the defendants argue that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to deduct million in wallenbrock and citadel business and operating expenses from the disgorgement amount.they also contend that wallenbrock loaned million to citadel for business investment,which the district court improperly included as disgorgeable gain.finally,the defendants claim that wallenbrock received million from business operations unrelated to income from defrauded investors,that the district court should not have ordered disgorged.each of these arguments lacks merit.
determining gains and unjust enrichment 
as we made clear in first pacific bancorp,the district court has broad equity powers to order the disgorgement of gains obtained through the violation of federal securities laws.at see also sec colello,cir to order disgorgement,the district court need find only that the defendant has no right to retain the funds illegally taken from the victims.disgorgement is designed to deprive a wrongdoer of unjust enrichment,and to deter others from violating securities laws by making violations unprofitable.first pac.bancorp,at citing hateley sec,cir.the district court also has broad discretion in calculating the amount to be disgorged.see,sec first jersey,cir.a disgorgement calculation requires only a reasonable approximation of profits causally connected to the violation,first pac.bancorp,at internal citation omitted,and the amount of disgorgement should include all gains flowing from the illegal activities.sec cross fin.
the essence of the defendants scheme was to obtain investors money under false pretenses in order to fund the defendants speculative business ventures.rather than put their own money at risk,the defendants benefitted from the use of investors money to spend at the defendants to cover operating expenses,invest in companies,pay personal expenses or to pay fake returns to investors to perpetuate the fraud.sec great lakes equities,reasoning that where a defendant use of fraudulently obtained funds is to defray obligations of the wrongdoer,the wrongdoer is benefitted by those expenditures.given these circumstances,all million obtained from investors was an gain that unjustly enriched the defendants.
business and operating expenses 
it follows that it would be unjust to permit the defendants to offset against the investor dollars they received the expenses of running the very business they created to defraud those investors into giving the defendants the money in the first place.sec tlc invs.trade,d,concluding that expenses in carrying out a fraudulent scheme are hardly appropriate or legitimate deductions internal citation and quotation omitted.
this is not the case of a partially legitimate company misdirecting or misappropriating revenues.for example,if an investor buys stock through a licensed broker who then skims off some or all of the profits generated by the stock,either through dividends or upon resale,the broker is enriched by the amount skimmed.under some circumstances,the broker might be entitled to offset expenses customarily incurred in the purchase and sale of such stock if the investor would have had to pay for such expenses in any legitimate transaction.for example,in sec thomas james,the district court ordered the defendants including a brokerage firm to disgorge the illegal profits reaped by their manipulation of the market to charge excessive markups in the initial aftermarket of four initial public offerings in assessing disgorgement,the court deducted certain business expenses,such as commissions,telephone charges a
