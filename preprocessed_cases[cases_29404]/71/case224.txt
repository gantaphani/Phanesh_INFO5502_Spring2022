joseph contorinis appeals from his conviction by a jury before judge sullivan for conspiracy to commit securities fraud and insider trading and from the district court forfeiture order in the amount of million.appellant claims error in i a jury instruction that allegedly did not adequately convey the definition of material,nonpublic information ii the admission of evidence of contemporaneous trades by individuals who received inside information from the same source as appellant and iii the amount of the forfeiture order entered by the district court.we hold that the district court properly instructed the jury on the definition of material,nonpublic information and acted within its discretion in admitting evidence concerning the trades by other individuals.however,we conclude that the court erred in ordering appellant to forfeit gains acquired by his employer but not by him.we therefore affirm appellant conviction but vacate the forfeiture order and remand for further proceedings.
background 
given the jury verdict,we view the evidence and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the government.united states chavez,cir.
during the relevant time period,appellant was employed,with michael handler,as a manager of the jeffries paragon fund fund.the fund invested in companies in the retail and personal products sectors.as portfolio managers,handler and appellant made investment decisions but did not control disbursements of profits.
sometime in,appellant met and befriended nicos stephanou,who became an investment banker in the mergers and acquisitions group at ubs in.thereafter,appellant and stephanou spoke on the telephone often,sometimes as much as times a month.stephanou regularly provided confidential information to several friends.these tippees included a california employee of a semiconductor company,an individual working in an business in new york,and two individuals living in cyprus.
on september,albertsons grocery store chain abs announced that it was exploring options to increase shareholder value,including a possible sale of the company.appellant then purchased a large amount of abs stock on behalf of the fund.on the same day,stephanou was assigned to a team at ubs that was to represent a potential purchaser of abs.stephanou testified that he informed appellant of his role,and that appellant asked stephanou to keep him informed about the deal.
subsequently,on november,stephanou received information suggesting that it was then more likely than not that an acquisition of abs would occur.stephanou conveyed that information to appellant and his other friends.on the same day,appellant purchased shares of abs on behalf of the fund.he testified that this purchase was motivated by a worse than expected earnings report by abs.stephanou other tippees also purchased shares around this time.
on december,stephanou learned that the likelihood of the deal had been drastically reduced.nevertheless,appellant purchased shares of abs the following morning.he testified that he believed that offers at the end of the bidding period,december,the next day,would increase the stock price.appellant became unavailable for a few hours,and handler began to sell abs stock.handler testified that he sold the stock because he mistakenly believed the bidding period was over.when appellant became available,appellant continued to sell.the fund sold the vast majority of its position in abs on december,closed out its long position on december,and then briefly went short.appellant made the lion share of these trades.the other tippees also closed out their positions in abs during the same time frame.
on december,stephanou was told that the deal was back on and could be announced on the.that day stephanou purchased shares of abs,and several of his tippees did as well.two days later,stephanou was involved in a conference call discussing the details of the proposed transaction.immediately following that call,stephanou spoke with appellant,and the fund purchased over million of abs the next day.
stephanou testified that he learned on december that the deal was going to happen and would be announced later in the week.phone records showed that stephanou spoke with appellant several times over the next two days.the fund purchased over shares of abs between december and.on december,several media outlets reported that talks had broken down and that the deal was unlikely to occur.stephanou testified that he repeatedly relayed information about the deal to appellant.phone records showed several calls between the two during this time.until the media reports,the details looked positive,but ultimately it was determined that antitrust concerns in the chicago market would hold the deal up.stephanou then advised appellant that the transaction was not going forward.the next day,december,stephanou sold his position in abs,shorted the stock,and advised appellant and the other tippees of the moribund status of the deal.the fund also sold all of its stock in abs,and the other tippees did the same.however,media reports in the morning of december stated only that the deal was uncertain,but not necessarily dead.only after the markets closed on december,and stephanou,his other tippees,and the fund had sold all their abs shares,did abs announce that talks about the sale had been terminated.abs stock dropped in price significantly the next morning.
in late december and into early january,stephanou received reports that the acquisition of abs was back on track.in response,he purchased abs stock on january.he also informed appellant that the deal was gaining traction and that a transaction would likely be announced in the coming weeks.on that day,appellant purchased approximately million shares of abs stock for the fund.stephanou other tippees also bought abs stock at this time.in his testimony,appellant attributed the purchase to a belief that comments by the ceo of one of the purchasers implied that abs would be acquired.on january,appellant purchased additional shares of abs.then,on january,the new york post announced that negotiations had reopened and the fund purchased another shares,bringing its holdings to over million shares.the fund sold shares two days later but then repurchased them the following day.finally,the sale of abs was announced on january and the fund sold its entire abs holdings that day,reaping a net profit of approximately million through its december and january trades.stephanou testified that,beginning in september,and ending in january,he had kept appellant informed of the status of the deal and expected date of the announcement.
prior to trial,appellant objected to evidence about the trades of stephanou other tippees.in denying appellant motion to exclude that evidence,the court stated that it had considered the parties arguments concerning district court opinions in united states marcus schloss.excluding evidence of trades by others,and united states ballesteros gutierrez,d admitting such evidence,and concluded that the reasoning in ballesteros was more fitting in this case.the court found that the trading patterns of the other tippees were probative because they tended to show that the trades of the tippees were more consistent with the sharing of inside information than with independent investment decisions.based on the balancing done in ballesteros,the court saw no reason to exclude the evidence under rule but stated that it was open to a limiting instruction.no such instruction was requested.
appellant also objected to the jury charge on the basis that the court definition of material,nonpublic information did not adequately explain when confirmation of publicly known or rumored information can be considered material and nonpublic.
the jury found appellant guilty of conspiracy and insider trading on the counts relating to the trades made on december and january.appellant was sentenced to months imprisonment and was ordered to forfeit approximately million the profits made by the fund on appellant trades in his capacity as agent of the fund.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
a jury instructions 
we review jury instructions de novo to determine whether the jury was misled or inadequately informed about the applicable law.henry wyeth,cir.
as pertinent here,the crime of insider trading required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that stephanou had a duty to ubs not to convey material,nonpublic information about deals in progress to outsiders,see dirks sec,d,and that appellant received such material,nonpublic information in breach of that duty and used the information to trade relevant securities,see id.that stephanou had the requisite duty is not contested.however,appellant testified that he never received any information from stephanou about deals stephanou was working on and that appellant trades in abs were based solely on information available to the public or professional investors like himself.
although appellant denial of receiving any information from stephanou no doubt reduced the importance of the definition of material,nonpublic information in the jury deliberations if it found appellant to be lying,the chances of an acquittal would be low the government still had to prove that the information stephanou claimed to have given appellant was material and nonpublic.appellant claims that the definition of material,nonpublic information given in the district court instructions was erroneous.
the pertinent instruction read 
information is nonpublic if it was not available to the public through such sources as press releases,securities and exchange commission filings,trade publications,analysts reports,newspapers,magazines,rumors,word of mouth or other sources.in assessing whether information is nonpublic,the keyword is available.if information is available in the public media or in sec filings,it is public.however,the fact that information has not appeared in a newspaper or other widely available public medium does not alone determine whether the information is nonpublic.sometimes a corporation is willing to make information available to securities analysts,prospective investors,or members of the press who ask for it even though it may never have appeared in any newspaper publication or other publication.such information would be public.accordingly,information is not necessarily nonpublic simply because there has been no formal announcement or because only a few people have been made aware of it.for example,if ubs policy was to give out certain information to people who ask for it,that information is public information.whether information is nonpublic is an issue of fact for you to decide.
on the other hand,the confirmation by an insider of unconfirmed facts or rumors even if reported in a newspaper may itself be inside information.a tip from a corporate insider that is more reliable or specific than public rumors is nonpublic information despite the existence of such rumors in the media or investment community.whether or not the confirmation of a rumor by an insider qualifies as material nonpublic information is an issue of fact for you to decide.
within the particular context of the purchase and sale of securities,material information is information which a reasonable investor would have considered significant in deciding whether to buy,sell,or hold securities,and at what price to buy or sell.
appellant argues that this jury instruction did not properly inform the jury because it failed to include the following language,or variations thereon 
a generalized confirmation of an event that is fairly obvious to investors knowledgeable about the company or the particular security at issue here albertsons or albertsons stock is not material information.in order to be nonpublic and material,information must be different from general discussions in the marketplace at the time.even if an event,like a corporate merger,may be important,information about that event is not material unless it contains something beyond what already was known to the public from news articles,analyst reports,or otherwise,and the additional information likely would have been significant to a reasonable investor.a generalized confirmation of an event that is fairly obvious to market participants who are knowledgeable about a company is not material information.likewise,speculative information is not material.the mere fact that some discussion has taken place on matters that may or may not occur is not material unless it goes beyond speculation and relates to existing facts.
in appellant view,the critical omission in the instructions given by the court was the lack of language indicating that general confirmation of an event that is fairly obvious to knowledgeable investors is not material,nonpublic information.conversely,he objects to the court instruction that stated,t he confirmation by an insider of unconfirmed facts or rumors even if reported in a newspaper may itself be inside information.we disagree.
we first discuss materiality and nonpublic status as separate concepts.information is material when there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would find it important in making an investment decision.see united states cusimano,cir citing basic levinson,d.to be material,information must alter the total mix of information available.id.of course,information is public if it is available to the public through sec filings,the media,or other sources.see sec mayhew,cir.as the district court instructed the jury,information is also deemed public if it is known only by a few securities analysts or professional investors.this is so because their trading will set a share price incorporating such information.
while the concepts of materiality and nonpublic status refer to different things,there is considerable overlap for purposes of insider trading analysis.the content of a piece of information may be of importance in affecting the share price but so that it does not alter the mix of available information and is therefore not deemed to be material.conversely,the same information,if previously unknown to the public,may alter substantially the mix of information and thus be deemed very material.information also comes in varying degrees of specificity and reliability,and the extent to which a newly reported item of information alters the total mix may depend on the specificity or reliability of that information.see id.at.
in elkind liggett myers,cir,we held that a tip stating that an upcoming earnings report would reflect lower sales was not material where that fact was already common knowledge among analysts and the company had previously stated that a decline in sales was expected.id.at.however,we indicated that if the tip had included additional details,such as the expected amount of the decrease,it would have been material.id.
similarly,a tip that provides additional reliability to existing information about the status of a transaction based on the source access to inside information may be material because it lessens the risk from uncertainty.see mayhew,at.
insiders often have special access to information about a transaction.rumors or press reports about the transaction may be circulating but are difficult to evaluate because their source may be unknown.a trier of fact may find that information obtained from a particular insider,even if it mirrors rumors or press reports,is sufficiently more reliable,and,therefore,is material and nonpublic,because the insider tip alters the mix by confirming the rumor or reports.id.
we conclude that the district court instructions adequately conveyed the applicable standards.the charge informed the jury that for information to be material it must be considered significant by reasonable investors.it conveyed to the jury that material,nonpublic information is information that either is not publicly available or is sufficiently more detailed reliable than publicly available information to be deemed significant,in and of itself,by reasonable investors.
to the extent that appellant suggested charges focused entirely on the content of reports or tips,excluding from consideration the reliability of the source,they misstated the law.see united states abelis,cir holding that defendant bears the burden of showing that the requested instruction accurately represented the
