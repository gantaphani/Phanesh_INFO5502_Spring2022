introduction 
lead plaintiff new mexico state investment council,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated plaintiffs,appeals the district court grant of defendant ernst young ey motion to dismiss.the claims against ey stem from a securities class action complaint against broadcom corporation broadcom,certain broadcom officers and directors,and broadcom auditor ey collectively,defendants,for a fraudulent billion stock options backdating scheme.plaintiffs specifically allege that ey,as broadcom auditor,knew of,or recklessly disregarded,broadcom fraudulent backdating actions yet issued unqualified audit opinions attesting to the validity of broadcom financial statements.the district court granted ey motion to dismiss,finding the consolidated amended class action complaint complaint failed to adequately plead scienter against ey.
plaintiffs contend on appeal that the complaint contains factual allegations sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.ey argues dismissal was proper and,in the alternative,the district court judgment should be affirmed based on plaintiffs failure to sufficiently plead loss causation,a ground the district court explicitly did not reach 
procedural history and background 
procedural history 
this case finds its roots in a large accounting fraud related to stock option backdating.broadcom,a semiconductor company with revenues in excess of billion in,fraudulently overstated its net earnings,and understated its compensation expense,by more than billion between and due to improper accounting of backdated stock options.
in october,plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint on behalf of all persons who purchased broadcom class a common stock between july,and july.the complaint seeks damages under section b of the securities exchange act of,b,and securities exchange commission rule for defendants fraudulent accounting practices,alleging they caused broadcom stock price to be artificially inflated.
defendants moved to dismiss.the district court heard oral argument in february and granted defendant ey motion to dismiss,stating i think the allegations are deficient on actual knowledge of the defendant,and i think there a little bit of a heavier burden of allegations on accountants on the question of scienter.plaintiff has failed adequately to plead scienter as against ey.
the complaint 
the lengthy complaint includes nearly pages of allegations that ey,as broadcom auditor,was complicit in a stock option backdating scheme involving options to purchase over million shares of broadcom stock between and.broadcom used stock options as part of a compensation package for officers,directors,and key employees.the recipient of the option was given the opportunity to purchase a certain number of shares of company stock at a given price on or after a predetermined date broadcom option plan provided for a vesting schedule of four years,meaning an employee could only exercise his or her option over a period.
backdating of options is akin to betting on a horse race after the horse has already crossed the finish line.backdating of options occurs when a company officers or directors responsible for administering the stock option plan monitor the price of the company stock and then award a stock option grant as of a certain date in the past when the share price was lowest,thus locking in the largest possible gain for the option recipient.
a backdated option is not in and of itself improper under the law or accounting principles.see edward goodman life income trust jabil circuit,cir.however,when a company chooses to issue such in the money options so called because the options represent an immediate paper profit,accounting principles require the company to record an expense for the profit,treated as compensation to the option recipient over the vesting period.if the company does not properly record the options,then the company reported net income is overstated for each of the years the options vest,potentially deceiving the market and investors.
the restatement and ey opinion 
broadcom engaged in an improper stock option backdating scheme that required the company to restate its financial statements in january for fiscal years to the restatement.the restatement acknowledged that broadcom had improperly accounted for billion in income,largely due to improper option backdating.additionally,every financial statement,and quarterly and annual report issued during the time period covered by the restatement,was false and misleading.as a result,broadcom agreed to a civil penalty of million in connection with a sec civil securities fraud investigation,and various broadcom officers and directors face civil and criminal charges.
the crux of plaintiffs claim is that ey,in its role of auditor issuing the unqualified opinion,knew of,or was deliberately reckless in not knowing,that the opinion was materially false and misleading due to broadcom stock option backdating scheme.the opinion covered three years of broadcom financial statements,stating that the financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the consolidated financial position of broadcom corporation at december,and,and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december,in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.the opinion also stated that ey had performed the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas.
allegations against ey 
plaintiffs allegations that ey had the required scienter for a fraud claim,namely that ey knew,or was deliberately reckless in not knowing,about the fraudulent option backdating,are as follows 
ey knew the material consequences of a may backdated option grant that would have resulted in a million charge to broadcom financial results but,despite violations of gaas,signed off on the grant without obtaining documentation 
ey knew that several significant option grants were approved on dates when broadcom compensation committee was not legally constituted due to the death of one of the two committee members 
ey presided over corrective reforms in to prevent and detect any future instances of improper stock option awards without questioning the integrity of broadcom accounting for options granted prior to the corrective reforms 
ey knew that there was insufficient documentation for nearly half of the billion in backdated option grants in violation of gaas 
ey knew that broadcom internal controls were weak and failed to expand the scope of its audit procedures as required under gaas and 
ey was deliberately reckless in ignoring a number of red flags that should have alerted them to the potential for material misstatements related to compensation.
the complaint includes additional details with respect to each of the above allegations,and plaintiffs argue that these detailed allegations,both individually and collectively,support a strong inference that ey had the necessary scienter to survive a motion to dismiss.

allegations of scienter 
to adequately plead scienter,a securities fraud complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b a.a complaint can plead scienter by raising a strong inference that the defendant possessed actual knowledge or acted with deliberate recklessness.zucco partners,llc digimarc,cir.contrary to the district court comment that scienter allegations against accountants or auditors carry a little bit of a heavier burden,this court has previously advised against developing separate rules of thumb for each type of scienter allegation.south ferry lp,killinger,cir.
a securities fraud complaint will survive a motion to dismiss under rule b only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,at.thus,a court reviewing scienter allegations under the private securities litigation reform act of pslra must consider the complaint in its entirety.id.at.the court must determine whether all of the facts alleged,taken collectively,give rise to a strong inference of scienter,not whether any individual allegation,scrutinized in isolation,meets that standard.id.at.finally,when determining whether the pleaded facts give rise to a strong inference of scienter,the court must take into account plausible opposing inferences.id.this inquiry is inherently comparative.id.a court must compare the malicious and innocent inferences cognizable from the facts pled in the complaint,and only allow the complaint to survive a motion to dismiss if the malicious inference is at least as compelling as any opposing innocent inference.see id.at see also metzler,at.
under tellabs and ninth circuit law,we conduct a inquiry for scienter first,we determine whether any of the allegations,standing alone,are sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter second,if no individual allegation is sufficient,we conduct a holistic review of the same allegations to determine whether the insufficient allegations combine to create a strong inference of intentional conduct or deliberate recklessness.zucco,at.arguing that ey was,or should have been,aware of significant accounting problems within audit years covered by its opinion,plaintiffs allege scienter based on three specific points when ey was faced with circumstances that would compel a reasonable auditor to further investigate and disclose broadcom backdating of options a large grant of options on may,for which ey was given no documentation options granted in during a period when broadcom compensation committee did not have a quorum due to the death of one of its members and ey direct involvement in with corrective reforms to broadcom prior options practices.
we hold that these factual allegations were each sufficient to support an inference of scienter by ey.while a holistic review is therefore unnecessary,these primary allegations certainly support an inference of scienter when viewed collectively with other claims that ey received no documentation for many option grants,knew broadcom internal controls were weak,and ignored other red flags.
ey knowledge of the may backdated option grant 
plaintiffs most detailed allegations of scienter involve a series of events surrounding a large stock option grant on may,when broadcom compensation and options committee allegedly granted over seven million options to various senior officers.at the time,this was the single largest grant of stock options in broadcom history.the choice of the may date for the option grant was suspect because,on that day,not only was the price of broadcom stock at its lowest point for the entire month of may,but also the lowest closing price since october and,as it turns out,until october.
by july,ey started to question the timing of the may grant,as broadcom stock price had risen from per share on may,to a high of per share in july.plaintiffs allege that ey knew by july that broadcom had not yet allocated the grants to its employees,as required under gaas,but failed to investigate.accordingly,ey issuance of the unqualified opinion including the accuracy of broadcom financials represented a material misstatement.
the complaint points to emails sent on july.broadcom manager of financial reporting informed broadcom cfo that she was experiencing resistance from ey and that t he basic concern is the measurement date of these grants.the manager of financial reporting also informed the cfo that the auditors could require us to record compensation expenses that could be over million based on the price and the current price later that day,broadcom cfo informed the ceo that ey was requesting documentation,which did not exist,for the may grant,and that ey was making noise that the company will have to take a million compensation charge.
concern over the measurement date of the grant was based on a specific gaap standard.the reporting of expenses associated with stock options is governed by an opinion by the accounting principles board entitled accounting for stock issued to employees.accounting principles board,opinion apb under apb,if the options had an exercise price lower than the fair market value of the stock as of the measurement date,the company would have to recognize a compensation expense over the option vesting period or the period of time the employee performed services for the company.the expense would be equal to the difference between fair market value as of the grant date and the exercise price.apb.
critical to this rule is the option measurement date.this term refers to the date on which the fair market value of the option is determined.the measurement date is the first date on which both of the following are known the number of options that each individual employee is entitled to receive,and the option or purchase price.apb b.frequently,the measurement date is the date the option is granted to the employee.id.there are instances where the measurement date can be more complicated to measure,such as an option grant conditioned on some other event occurring,such as a promotion or assuming a new position.see in re cnet networks,d.when a company,under proper guidance of the board of directors and executives,chooses to award a block of options to various employees,the measurement date can not be established until the exact recipients and their respective number of options are identified.id.at citing apb b.
plaintiffs allege that ey violated gaas by failing to verify whether broadcom may option grant was in violation of gaap and apb.gaas standards provide,in part 
t he accountant may become aware of matters that cause him or her to believe that interim financial information,filed or to be filed with a specified regulatory agency,is probably materially misstated as a result of a departure from generally accepted accounting principles.in such circumstances,the accountant should discuss the matters with the appropriate level of management as soon as practicable if,in the accountant judgment,management does not respond appropriately to the accountant communication within a reasonable period of time,the accountant should inform the audit committee,or others with equivalent authority and responsibility of the matters as soon as practicable.
public company accounting oversight board pcaob,interim auditing standards au.gaas also requires an auditor to maintain independence in mental attitude during an audit,to obtain sufficient evidence to afford a reasonable basis for its opinion,and for financial statements subject to audit to be presented in accordance with gaap.see au,pcaob,auditing standards as.
the ey audit team,led by partners blythe and stump,allegedly engaged in an intense discussion but no follow up with broadcom executives,and eventually capitulated to broadcom cfo on july,ultimately relying on a single conversation with him that the option grant was properly accounted.plaintiffs claim that the cfo told ey that,on may,the options committee had authorized a fixed number of options to be granted and approved a program establishing a set guideline matrix for calculating the number of options awarded to each employee.plaintiffs allege that the cfo oral representation was not sufficient to satisfy gaap,and that ey neither received nor relied on any documents from broadcom before ey on the may grant,thereby violating gaas.
in further support of ey wrongdoing,plaintiffs point to another email,sent on september,by broadcom manager of financial reporting to its cfo,acknowledging that ey granted broadcom flexibility with respect to the may grant,and that g oing forward,we can expect much greater scrutiny by the auditors on our option granting process.
as a result of these events,plaintiffs argue ey had actual knowledge that the may option grant did not comply with gaap and that ey own audit did not comply with gaas and because the broadcom options had a vesting period,the consequences of the may grant caused material misstatements in broadcom audited financial statements in fiscal years,years expressly covered in the opinion.
typically,pleading sufficient facts to support a strong inference of scienter by an outside auditor is difficult because outsider auditors have more limited information than,for example,the company executives who oversee the audit.further,an auditor exercises complex and subjective professional judgments that courts are not ideally positioned to second guess.in re countrywide fin.sec,d.in examining allegations of scienter,courts have looked at a range of factors for potential red flags,including the interaction of auditors with company executives and the breadth and scope of the auditor deviation from gaap or gaas.see in re enron,derivative erisa,d.
the red flag doctrine guides the gaap and gaas inquiries the more facts alleged that should cause a reasonable auditor to investigate further before making a representation,the more cogent and compelling a scienter inference becomes.in re countrywide,d at see also dsam global value fund altris software,cir.scienter requires more than a misapplication of accounting principles.the plaintiff must prove that the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all,or an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.in re software toolworks,cir quoting miller pezzani in re worlds of wonder sec.litig,cir.
when assessing gaap violations in connection with auditor scienter,the violations should generally be more than minor or technical in nature and constitute widespread and significant inflation to contribute to a strong inference of scienter.in re daou systems,cir.while a violation of gaap,standing alone,is not sufficient,allegations of recklessness have been sufficient where defendants failed to review or check information that they had a duty to monitor,or ignored obvious signs of fraud.novak kasaks,cir.
with respect to allegations of gaas violations and how an audit is conducted,a lleging a poor audit is not equivalent to alleging an intent to deceive.ezra charitable trust tyco int l,cir.rather,just as with gaap,the more likely an auditor would have discovered the truth if a reasonable audit had been conducted,the stronger the scienter inference.in re countrywide,d at.
against this backdrop,we consider the factual allegations that ey failed to further investigate the may option grant.ey had knowledge that the grant was,at a minimum,suspicious in not only its timing but its relative size.it was the largest option grant in the company young history and the potential million impact on broadcom earnings was material.despite this knowledge as reflected in the specific email exchanges recited in the complaint,ey apparently did not take steps to verify the accuracy of the grant,then or later.this failure to investigate such a large grant was not minor or technical in nature,and it is hard to imagine how a reasonable auditor,confronted with the same set of circumstances,would fail to obtain some documentation to verify broadcom executive claim of a guideline matrix program being put in place on that very day.ey apparently accepted management at its word,never received requested documentation,and issued an unqualified opinion on the accuracy of broadcom financial statements.these circumstances are sufficient to support an inference that ey knew,or should have known,the may options were not legitimate.see in re.sec,d,vacated on other grounds by simpson,cir finding necessary scienter in denying a motion to dismiss,stating that it was a logical inference that because the auditor objected to some transactions,it knew that the transactions and the accounting of them were improper and t he fact that it also allowed some of them to be reported improperly shows that the auditor acted with deliberate recklessness in failing to properly audit the transactions.
ey fails to suggest a more compelling innocent inference from the circumstances alleged in the complaint.while it may be true that broadcom lied to ey audit partners about the creation of the guideline matrix,and broadcom may have even drafted fraudulent documents in support of the guideline matrix,nonetheless ey never received or reviewed any documents,real or fraudulent.
ey would lead this court to believe that its failure to further investigate amounts to,at most,negligence.however,an auditor,in fulfilling duties of public trust,should take a long hard look at a transaction of million,roughly a quarter of broadcom reported revenue in of billion.this complaint alleges more than negligence.ey,as broadcom auditor,owes its ultimate allegiance to the company creditors and stockholders,as well as to the investing public.see united states arthur young.by offering an unqualified or clean audit opinion,as ey did in its opinion,ey provided the highest level of assurance.in re ikon office solutions,cir.accountants will qualify their opinion where discrepancies are identified in a client financial statements.id.
ey relies on public employees retirement ass of deloitte touche,cir,where the court held generally that failing to review documentation may not be enough to support a strong inference of scienter.however,the facts at issue in that case are distinctly different from this case.in public employees,the documents were secret side letters that contradicted joint venture agreements.the auditors were,however,provided letters attesting wrongly otherwise.the court noted,w ith perfect hindsight,one might posit that defendants should have required stronger evidence of control from the company.id.but the point remains that the auditors had already asked for and received some documentation they could not be blamed for failing to see secret side letters purposely kept hidden.furthermore,when the auditor discovered the company had been lying,the company,two days later,announced it had misstated its revenues.id.at.here,there were no secret letters ey noticed there could be a significant issue with the option grant ey asked for documentation,but when none was received,ey still signed off.
finally,ey wrongly claims that the opinion has no connection to the may option.as noted previously,the opinion expressly covered the financial statements.because broadcom options vested over a period,the option grant would have been accounted for in the fiscal years,resulting in two years of overlap between the fraudulent options grant and ey audited financial statements.
ey argues plaintiffs can not show a concrete connection between the auditors who performed the audit in and those who issued the opinion in other words,that plaintiffs can not rely on a roving scienter across the relevant time period.however,ey can not insulate itself from accountability for multiple years of approved financial statements with a right hand,left hand defense.clearly,with any doubts,ey could limit its opinion to the years for which it is confident in the audit.ey,despite serving continuously as broadcom auditor from until,during which it attested to the accuracy of broadcom financial statements for the multiple years noted in the opinion,can not now disclaim those prior opinions simply because the same individuals were not involved.
option grants approved when compensation committee was not legally constituted 
plaintiffs second argument is that the complaint pleads sufficient facts to support a strong inference of scienter based on ey failure to audit option grants allegedly awarded on dates when broadcom compensation committee lacked authority to act because the committee was not legally constituted
