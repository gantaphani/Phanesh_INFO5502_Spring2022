opinion of the court 
this bankruptcy appeal requires us to construe b,which provides for the subordination of any claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.the appeal arises out of a chapter bankruptcy petition filed by appellee telegroup.appellants baroda hill investments,leheron corporation,and kimble john winter claimants or appellants are shareholders of telegroup who filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking damages for telegroup alleged breach of its agreement to use its best efforts to ensure that their stock was registered and freely tradeable.claimants appeal from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court order subordinating their claims against the bankruptcy estate pursuant to b.
claimants argue that b should be construed narrowly,so that only claims for actionable some type of fraud or other illegality in the issuance of occurred at the time of the purchase or sale of stock would be deemed to arise from that purchase or sale.put differently,in claimants submission,a claim must be predicated on illegality in the stock issuance to be subordinated under b.since the actionable conduct in this case telegroup breach of contract occurred after claimants purchase of telegroup stock,claimants contend that the district court erred in subordinating their claims.
telegroup would read b more broadly,so that claims for breach of a stock purchase agreement,which would not have arisen but for the purchase of telegroup stock,may arise from that purchase,even though the actionable conduct occurred after the transaction was completed.telegroup further argues that subordinating appellants claims advances the policies underlying b by preventing disappointed equity investors from recovering a portion of their investment in parity with bona fide creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.
we agree with telegroup,and hold that a claim for breach of a provision in a stock purchase agreement requiring the issuer to use its best efforts to register its stock and ensure that the stock is freely tradeable arises from the purchase of the stock for purposes of b,and therefore must be subordinated.accordingly,we will affirm.
the relevant facts are undisputed,and can be succinctly summarized.appellant leheron corporation,sold to telegroup the assets of certain businesses that it owned in exchange for shares of telegroup common stock and a small amount of cash.as amended on june,the stock purchase agreements required telegroup to use its best efforts to register its stock and ensure that the shares were freely tradeable by june.on february,telegroup filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition,and on june,appellants filed proofs of claim against the bankruptcy estate alleging that telegroup breached its agreement to use its best efforts to register its stock.claimants sought damages on the theory that had telegroup performed its obligation under the contract,they would have sold their shares as soon as telegroup stock became freely tradeable,thereby avoiding the losses incurred when telegroup stock subsequently declined in value.
telegroup filed objections to these claims,asking the bankruptcy court to subordinate the claims pursuant to b,which provides that any claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of common stock shall have the same priority in the distribution of the estate assets as common stock.the bankruptcy court filed a written opinion and order subordinating appellants claims,holding that because appellants claims would not exist but for their purchase of telegroup stock,the claims arise from that purchase for purposes of b.the district court affirmed,and claimants filed this appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to a,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.because the district court sat below as an appellate court,this court conducts the same review of the bankruptcy court order as did the district court.see in re envtl.energy,cir.as the relevant facts are undisputed,this appeal presents a pure question of law,which we review de novo.see id.
section b of the bankruptcy code provides 
for the purpose of distribution under this title,a claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor,for damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security,or for reimbursement or contribution allowed under section on account of such a claim,shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security,except that if such security is common stock,such claim has the same priority as common stock.
in this case,the question is whether appellants breach of contract claim is a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security of the debtor.id.claimants concede that the securities that they purchased from telegroup are common stock.therefore,if their claims arise from the purchase of that stock,then under b their claims would have the same priority as common stock,and would be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors.
the question of the scope of b presents this court with a matter of first impression.those courts that have considered the issue appear divided on how broadly the phrase arising from the purchase or sale of a security should be construed.compare,in re amarex,holding that under b,a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the security issuance,with in re nal fin.group,holding that claims for breach of the debtor agreement to use its best efforts to register its securities arise from the purchase of those securities,for purposes of b.
in construing b,we begin,as we must,with the text of the statute.see robinson shell oil,d the first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.the inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
claimants argue that their claims do not arise from the purchase or sale of telegroup common stock because a claim aris es from the purchase or sale of a security only if the claim alleges that the purchase or sale of the security was itself unlawful.according to claimants,a claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of a security if it is predicated on conduct that occurred after the purchase or sale.see in re amarex,holding that a claim for breach of a partnership agreement,because it is based on conduct that occurred after the issuance and sale of the partnership units,does not arise from the purchase or sale of those units in re angeles,holding that claims for breach of fiduciary duty do not arise from the purchase or sale of limited partnership interests where the wrongful conduct occurred after the sale of those interests see also in re montgomery ward holding,wl,at,at,holding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase,sale or issuance of the instrument.since the actionable conduct in this case includes telegroup alleged breach of contract,in claimants submission the claim does not arise from the purchase or sale of debtor stock,and therefore should not be subordinated under b.
telegroup responds that claims arising from the purchase or sale of a security under b include claims predicated on conduct.see in re geneva steel,cir holding that claims alleging that the debtor fraudulently induced the claimants to retain securities they had purchased from the debtor arise from the purchase or sale of those securities,for purposes of b in re granite partners,holding that claims that debtor fraudulently induced claimants to retain debtor securities arise from the purchase or sale of those securities see also in re lenco,holding that claims for erisa violations arose from the purchase or sale of debtor securities.
telegroup contends that appellants claims arise from the purchase or sale of telegroup common stock because they allege a breach of the purchase agreement whereby claimants acquired shares of telegroup stock,which required telegroup to use its best efforts to register its stock.see in re nal fin.group,holding that claims for breach of debtor agreement to use its best efforts to register its securities arise from the purchase of those securities,for purposes of b see also in re betacom of phoenix,cir holding that a claim for breach of a provision in a merger agreement arises from the purchase or sale of the debtor securities in re int l wireless communications holdings,disapproving angeles and amarex,supra,and holding that claims against the debtor for breach of a supplement to a share purchase agreement arise from the purchase or sale of those securities in re kaiser group int l,holding that claims for breach of a merger agreement arise from the purchase or sale of debtor securities.therefore,in telegroup submission,the bankruptcy court correctly subordinated appellants claims pursuant to b.
we conclude that the phrase arising from is ambiguous.for a claim to aris e from the purchase or sale of a security,there must obviously be some nexus or causal relationship between the claim and the sale of the security,but b language alone provides little guidance in delineating the precise scope of the required nexus.on the one hand,it is reasonable,as a textual matter,to hold that the claims in this case do not arise from the purchase or sale of telegroup stock,since the claims are predicated on conduct that occurred after the stock was purchased.on the other hand,it is,in our view,more natural,as a textual matter,to read arising from as requiring some nexus or causal relationship between the claims and the purchase of the securities,but not as limiting the nexus to claims alleging illegality in the purchase itself.in particular,the text of b is reasonably read to encompass the claims in this case,since the claims would not have arisen but for the purchase of telegroup stock and allege a breach of a provision of the stock purchase agreement.
although we believe that telegroup reading of b is the more comfortable reading of the provision as a textual matter,we acknowledge that the language arising from is nonetheless susceptible to claimants construction.because the text of b is ambiguous as applied to the claims in this case,we turn to the provision legislative history and the policies underlying the provision,to determine whether the claims arise from the purchase of telegroup stock,and therefore must be subordinated.
both the house report on the bankruptcy revisions and the report of the commission on bankruptcy laws,whose proposed legislation was largely adopted by the enactment of the bankruptcy code,suggest that in enacting b,congress was focusing on claims alleging fraud or other violations of securities laws in the issuance of the debtor securities.see report of the committee on the judiciary,bankruptcy law revision,at,code cong.admin.news at,a difficult policy question to be resolved in a business bankruptcy concerns the relative status of a security holder who seeks to rescind his purchase of securities or to sue for damages based on such a purchase should he be treated as a general unsecured creditor based on his tort claim for rescission,or should his claim be subordinated report of the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states,doc,pt,at commenting that the proposed provision subordinates claims by holders of securities of a debtor corporation that are based on federal and state securities legislation,rules pursuant thereto,and similar laws.
in enacting b,congress relied heavily on a law review article written by professors john slain and homer kripke,the interface between securities regulation and the risk of illegal securities issuance between securityholders and the issuer creditors.see,at summarizing the argument in the article and stating that t he bill generally adopts the position id.at the argument for mandatory subordination is best described by professors slain and kripke.in re betacom of phoenix,cir congress relied heavily on the analysis of two law professors in crafting the statute.in re granite partners,any discussion of section b must begin with the law review article authored by professors john slain and homer kripke.
slain and kripke argued that claims of shareholders alleging fraud or other illegality in the issuance of stock should generally be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors,conceptualizing the issue as one of risk allocation.see generally elizabeth warren,bankruptcy policy,chi,b ankruptcy policy becomes a composite of factors that bear on a better answer to the question,how shall the losses be distributed.slain and kripke argued that t he situation with which we are concerned involves two risks the risk of business insolvency from whatever cause and the risk of illegality in securities issuance.slain kripke,supra,at.
analyzing the first of business and kripke observed that the absolute priority rule allocates this risk to shareholders.under the absolute priority rule,stockholders seeking to recover their investments can not be paid before provable creditor claims have been satisfied in full.id.at see generally consol.rock prods.du bois.holding that stockholders can not participate in a plan of reorganization unless creditors claims have been satisfied in full case los angeles lumber prods.same see also caplin marine midland grace trust,d douglas,dissenting discussing the history of the absolute priority rule.
the rationale for the absolute priority rule rests on the different packages purchased by stockholders and general creditors 
in theory,the general creditor asserts a fixed dollar claim and leaves the variable profit to the stockholder the stockholder takes the profit and provides a cushion of security for payment of the lender fixed dollar claim.the absolute priority rule reflects the different degree to which each party assumes a risk of enterprise insolvency 
slain kripke,supra,at see also warren,supra,at an almost axiomatic principle of business law is that,because equity owners stand to gain the most when a business succeeds,they should absorb the costs of the business to the full amount of their investment.thus,argued slain and kripke,the absolute priority rule allocates to stockholders the risk of business insolvency,and no obvious reason exists for reallocating that risk.slain kripke,supra,at.
analyzing the second risk of illegality in the issuance of and kripke argued that this risk,too,should be born by shareholders.it is difficult to conceive of any reason for shifting even a small portion of the risk of illegality from the stockholder,since it is to the stockholder,and not to the creditor,that the stock is offered.id.at.slain and kripke therefore concluded that shareholder claims alleging illegality in the issuance of stock should be subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors.
the focus of the article suggests that congress considered claims alleging fraud or other illegality in the issuance of securities to be at the core of claims that aris e from the purchase or sale of a security for purposes of b.see slain kripke,supra,at for present purposes it suffices to say that when the basis of the stockholder disaffection is either the issuer failure to comply with registration requirements or the issuer material misrepresentations,one or more state or federal claims may be made.indeed,the title of their article the interface between securities regulation and the risk of illegal securities issuance between securityholders and the issuer creditors indicates that slain and kripke were primarily concerned with actionable conduct occurring in the issuance of the debtor securities,as opposed to conduct.
this focus in the legislative history on fraud or other illegality in the securities issuance supports claimants argument that their claims do not arise from the purchase or sale of telegroup stock because the actionable conduct the breach of telegroup agreement to use its best efforts to register its stock occurred after the sale was completed
