background 
forbes was tried three times on charges related to accounting fraud at cuc and cendant,with the first two trials each resulting in a deadlocked jury.following the third trial,on october,forbes was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,in violation of,and two counts of making false statements in sec filings,in violation of a.the trial court sentenced forbes principally to months in prison and ordered him to pay billion in restitution.this court affirmed forbes conviction on direct appeal and his petition for certioriari was denied.forbes,app x at,cert.denied,at.
the government primary witness at trial was cosmo corigliano,who took the reins as cfo at cuc in.it is undisputed that accounting fraud took place during corigliano tenure.he testified pursuant to a plea that forbes and bell,corigliano predecessor as cfo at cuc,initiated the accounting fraud and that corigliano merely carried it out after bell departure because i t was impractical to correct it or stop it at that point because the company would not have been able to hit the numbers that the investment community was expecting.corigliano further testified that bell directed him to commit the accounting fraud and gave him instructions on how to do so.
bell did not give any material testimony at any of forbes trials he was called as a witness for the defense at the third trial but invoked his fifth amendment privilege for every question asked of him.during the first trial,forbes counsel submitted declarations stating that bell counsel had informed them that,if granted immunity,bell would testify that he did not commit any fraud at cuc,that corigliano testimony about bell involvement was inaccurate,and that there were legitimate explanations for the accounting done during bell tenure as cfo.the government declined to immunize bell and the trial court denied forbes motion to compel the government to grant bell immunity in order to overcome his anticipated assertion of privilege 
according to forbes,the statute of limitations on claims against bell with regard to the accounting fraud ran in april.on october,forbes moved for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure the newly discovered evidence that forbes identified was the newly available testimony of bell.forbes motion relied on the aforementioned declarations of his attorneys from to support his argument that bell would testify and that his testimony would exculpate forbes.the government opposed the motion,arguing that forbes had not satisfied any of the requirements for obtaining a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.indeed,despite forbes efforts to contact bell through his counsel,bell declined to provide an affidavit in support of forbes rule motion 
the district court denied forbes rule motion without a hearing or granting leave to conduct a deposition the district court found that forbes had not demonstrated that bell testimony is newly available,because he has not made a credible proffer that it is available at all.united states forbes,awt,slip op.at.the court further held that even if bell testimony were newly available,this court decision in owen,made clear that forbes is not seeking to proffer any evidence that falls within the definition of newly discovered evidence.id.citing at.forbes timely appealed 
discussion 
we review for abuse of discretion a district court denial of a rule motion for a new trial.see united states sessa,cir,cert,denied,d.a district court abuses or exceeds the discretion accorded to it when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its decision though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir footnotes omitted.
relief under rule based on newly discovered evidence may be granted only upon a showing that the evidence was newly discovered after trial facts are alleged from which the court can infer due diligence on the part of the movant to obtain the evidence the evidence is material the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching and the evidence would likely result in an acquittal.owen,at citing decisions from the third,fifth,sixth,seventh,eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuits.
newly discovered as a matter of law 
relying on our decision in owen,the district court denied forbes motion for a new trial on the basis of his failure to satisfy the first element of the standard,finding that bell testimony was not newly discovered after trial.in owen,edgar owen and two codefendants,paul samuels and mark baroody,were charged with various crimes in connection with a marijuana distribution conspiracy.at.at their joint trial,each defendant exercised his right not to testify and the jury convicted all three defendants on all counts.id.at.at samuels sentencing hearing,he stated that owens did have anything to do with the crimes in question.id.at.the district court granted owen motion for a new trial pursuant to rule,reasoning that because owen could not have forced samuels to relinquish his fifth amendment privilege during the trial,the testimony constituted newly discovered evidence.id.at.
this court reversed,holding that samuels testimony was not newly discovered within the meaning of rule.we noted that nearly every circuit to address the issue had concluded that when a defendant is aware that his codefendant could provide exculpatory testimony but is unable to obtain that testimony because the codefendant invokes his privilege against prior to and during trial,the codefendant postconviction statement exculpating the defendant is not newly discovered evidence within the meaning of rule.id.at.we thus join ed the majority of circuits to have addressed the issue and held that rule does not authorize district courts to grant new trials on the basis of such evidence since it is not newly discovered,but merely newly available.id.at.
the basis for our decision in owen was the plain text of rule.we explained that o ur holding that previously known,but newly available,evidence is not newly discovered within the meaning of rule is rooted in the plain meaning of the rule text.id.at.we focused in particul
