we confront here two intricate variations on a standard invocation of a limitations defense to federal securities claims.the general scenario is distressingly familiar shareholders of a company allege that the corporate officers systematically inflated earnings,concealed losses,and treated the company books as works of fiction.the shareholders further allege that their natural company outside this massive fraud through perfunctory audits and certified financial statements that they knew or consciously avoided knowing were materially false and misleading.
the district court ruled that all the federal securities claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.see cape ann investors,llc lepone,d.we conclude that this ruling is partially correct and partially incorrect.as to the federal securities claim asserted by the original plaintiff,the primary issue is whether management letters from the accounting firm effectively placed this plaintiff an investor who held a seat on the company board of directors and the audit committee on inquiry notice of possible fraud.given our inability to resolve that highly nuanced issue based solely on the face of the amended complaint,we vacate the lower court order of dismissal in pertinent part and remand for further proceedings.as to the claims asserted by the remaining shareholders,we reach a different result.because those plaintiffs and their claims lacked a sufficient identity of interest with the original complainant and its claims,federal rule of civil procedure c does not apply the claims are not entitled to relate back to the date when the suit was first filed and,accordingly,the claims are.we therefore affirm that portion of the district court ukase.
background 
we glean the facts from the amended complaint,stripped of any rhetorical gloss.aulson blanchard,cir.we then trace the travel of the case and offer a roadmap for our exploration of the instant appeal.
a.the facts.
at the times relevant hereto,nutramax products,nutramax or the company was a delaware corporation that maintained its principal offices in gloucester,massachusetts.the company shares were traded on the nasdaq stock exchange.donald lepone served as its chief executive officer,robert burns as its chief financial officer,and noreen gottfredsen as its controller.
nutramax fiscal year ran from october through september.like all corporations,it issued annual financial statements within ninety days after the close of each fiscal year.for each of the years here in,and represented that these financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company independent auditor,deloitte touche llp deloitte,placed its imprimatur on each of these financial statements.in so doing,deloitte expressly certified that it had conducted its audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards gaas nutramax financial statements had been prepared in accordance with gaap and fairly presented the company financial position and operational results in all material respects and deloitte could provide reasonable assurances,based on its audits,that the financial statements contained no material misrepresentations.
in connection with its presentation of audited financial statements,deloitte wrote an annual management letter to the audit committee designated by nutramax board of directors.those letters contained comments that deloitte deemed pertinent to management assessment of the financial condition of the company and the reliability of its accounting systems.in the management letter submitted under date of november,deloitte concluded that certain deficiencies in the company internal control structure constituted reportable conditions.specifically,that letter highlighted a number of weaknesses in nutramax inventory control and valuation procedures,identified a variance in an inventory account,pointed out of various expenses,and noted that the company had failed to earmark adequate reserves for bad debts.deloitte nonetheless certified the financial statements without any substantial qualification.much the same pas de deux occurred the following year.on november,deloitte wrote to nutramax audit committee identifying reportable conditions involving inventory control and valuation,but proceeded to certify the company financial statements for fiscal without substantial qualification.on both occasions,deloitte representatives assured the audit committee that the reportable conditions did not denote material weaknesses in nutramax reporting systems and,therefore,did not pose a significant risk of skewing the company financial statements.moreover,deloitte assured the audit committee that,as required by gaas,its audit for each of these years would provide reasonable assurance of detecting irregularities or illegal acts by nutramax management and employees.
in,nutramax board of directors installed a new chief operating officer coo.it did not take him long to note glaring inadequacies in the company accounting procedures and internal controls.suspecting that the books and records contained serious irregularities,the coo recommended that the board engage outside counsel to conduct a full investigation into the company accounting records,systems,and procedures.the board complied,and the law firm designated by the board engaged a team of forensic accountants.in the spring or summer of amended complaint is vague as to the exact investigators concluded that nutramax management had failed to write down worthless inventory,improperly accrued expenses,booked bogus journal entries,and incorrectly adjusted the accrual dates on various receivables.as a result,a myriad of accounts required multimillion dollar adjustments.
the denouement occurred on august,when nutramax publicly announced that it had ousted lepone and burns,delayed the release of an earnings report for the third quarter,and decided that it would be necessary to restate its financials for certain previous years.in the wake of this announcement,the price of nutramax common stock plummeted.nutramax subsequently wrote down its assets by over and restated its net worth from a positive figure of to a negative figure of.on october,nasdaq delisted the company.on november,deloitte withdrew its audit reports for the,and fiscal years less than six months later,nutramax filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter.see.
b.the proceedings below.
on august,cape ann investors,llc cape ann,a major nutramax shareholder,sued lepone,burns,gottfredsen,and deloitte in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.cape ann complaint charged that the three former officers had systematically falsified nutramax financial statements by inflating earnings,refusing to write off outdated inventory,and manipulating the company accounting records to misrepresent its financial performance and condition.the complaint further charged that deloitte had facilitated the former officers fraudulent misconduct by conducting perfunctory audits of the company that fell far short of gaas.cape ann alleged that the defendants malfeasance violated both federal securities law,see securities exchange act of,sec rule,and state law.
at this point,we shift our focus momentarily to nutramax chapter reorganization.in the course of that is pending in bankruptcy court established the nutramax litigation trust the trust.the trust became the assignee of several sets of claims.only one such set is of interest here all claims by persons who held nutramax common stock prior to the bankruptcy filing and who either voted to approve the reorganization plan or elected thereafter to assign their claims to the trust.by voting in favor of the reorganization plan,cape ann became a participant in the trust.since cape ann position is distinct from that of the other shareholders who have assigned their rights to the trust,we emulate the district court,see cape ann,d at,and refer to cape ann by name while referring to the other electing shareholders as the new plaintiffs.
on march,the trust filed an amended complaint that,inter alia,sought to substitute the trust for cape ann as the named plaintiff in the securities fraud action and to add claims assigned to it by the new plaintiffs deloitte moved to dismiss the amended complaint,asserting,inter alia,that the federal securities claims were by the applicable statute of limitations.following briefing and oral argument,the district court granted the motion.id.at.
the district court decision sets the stage for our discussion of the issues on appeal.to begin with,the court recognized that cape ann claims and the new plaintiffs claims had to be analyzed differently.turning first to cape ann,the court emphasized that,unlike an ordinary investor,it had a presence on the company board of directors and audit committee during and.on this basis,the court concluded that a reasonable director in cape ann shoes,a director who had received deloitte and management letters would have realized the need for an immediate investigation if not in,certainly by.id.at.based on this conclusion,the court ruled that cape ann which had not brought suit until august,had missed the statute of limitations its federal securities claim.id.at.
turning to the federal securities claims brought by the new plaintiffs,the district court rejected the trust argument that those claims related back to the date on which cape ann had filed the original complaint.id.at.apparently concluding that the limitations period for the new plaintiffs began to run no later than november,the date on which deloitte withdrew its audit reports,the court determined that these claims,first asserted on march,had emerged too late.id.at.having found all the federal claims,the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims,see supra note,and dismissed those claims without prejudice to their renewal in an appropriate forum.this timely appeal ensued.
c.the anatomy of the appeal.
although this appeal originally encompassed all the federal securities claims,the former officers recently bought their peace,and we approved a stipulation dismissing the case as to them.see fed.b.consequently,the appeal proceeds only with respect to the remaining defendant deloitte.
in the pages that follow,we examine whether the district court erred in assessing the timeliness of the plaintiffs federal securities claims against deloitte.because the district court dismissed the claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,we afford plenary review,giving credence to all factual averments limned in the amended complaint and indulging all reasonable inferences therefrom in the plaintiffs favor.aulson,at.if the facts contained in the complaint,viewed in this favorable light,justify recovery under any applicable legal theory,we must set aside the order of dismissal.sec sg,cir.where,as here,an order of dismissal is predicated on the statute of limitations,we will affirm only if the pleader allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is.lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.
ii.the legal landscape 
rule claims must be commenced within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d.in this case,deloitte concedes that suit was brought within three years of the alleged violation.our focus,then,is on the date of discovery.
with respect to a rule violation that involves fraudulent concealment,the interval does not begin to run until the time when the plaintiff in the exercise of reasonable diligence discovered or should have discovered the fraud of which he complains.cooperativa de ahorro y credito aguada kidder,peabody,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.this formulation is not,and the circumstances of each case must be explored independently.when telltale warning signs augur that fraud is afoot,however,such signs,if sufficiently portentous,may as a matter of law be deemed to alert a reasonable investor to the possibility of fraudulent conduct.see mathews kidder,peabody,cir collecting cases.
we have dubbed such signs storm warnings,and have established a process for handling a defendant claim that such precursors should have sufficed to put investors on inquiry notice.maggio gerard freezer ice,cir.the first step in the pavane requires a reviewing court to ascertain whether,when,and to what extent,storm warnings actually existed in a given situation.because sufficient storm warnings would lead a reasonable investor to check carefully into the possibility of fraud,this step necessarily entails a determination as to whether a harbinger,or series of harbingers,should have alerted a similarly situated investor that fraud was in the wind.id.the next step requires the court to assay whether,once sufficient storm warnings were apparent,the investor probed the matter in a reasonably diligent manner.id.this issue lends itself to a more individualized inquiry that focuses on the particulars of each investor situation.see id.
when the defendant in a securities fraud case pleads the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense,the plaintiff normally has the burden of pleading and proving facts demonstrating the timeliness of her action.see builders supply river hill coal venture,cir cook avien,cir.if,however,a defendant seeks to truncate the limitations period by claiming that the plaintiff had advance notice of the fraud through the incidence of storm warnings,then the defendant bears the initial burden of establishing the existence of such warnings.mathews,at.only if the defendant succeeds in this endeavor must the plaintiff counter with a showing that she fulfilled her corresponding duty of making a reasonably diligent inquiry into the possibility of fraudulent activity.maggio,at.
as this discussion makes plain,the existence vel non of storm warnings has important ramifications for determining when the statute of limitations in a rule case begins to run.the multifaceted question of whether storm warnings were apparent involves issues of fact.id.in the archetypical case,therefore,it is for the factfinder to determine whether a particular collection of data was sufficiently aposematic to place an investor on inquiry notice.marks cdw computer,cir see also builders,at emphasizing that this sort of factual question may be determined as a matter of law only when the underlying facts are either admitted or undisputed.so too the related question of whether a particular plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in the face of such warnings.maggio,at kennedy josephthal,cir.
there is one lingering question.in cooperativa,we left open the question of whether the statute of limitations begins to accrue on the date that sufficient storm warnings first appear or the later date on which an investor,alerted by storm warnings and thereafter exercising reasonable diligence,would have discovered the fraud.at.in the case at hand,this difference is potentially meaningful.we turn,then,to that question.
a number of considerations drive us to choose the latter answer.first,we believe that the purpose of the discovery rule is to afford a suitable degree of protection to plaintiffs who have exercised reasonable diligence consistent with the information available to them.depending on the individual circumstances,a reasonably diligent investigation following the receipt of storm warnings may consume as little as a few days or as much as a few years to get to the bottom of the matter.given the wide range of possibilities,we think it is fair that the limitations period begin to accrue only at the point when the rule violation reasonably could have been discovered.
second,and perhaps more importantly,we look to the principles underlying the limitations period.as the tenth circuit noted in sterlin biomune,cir,the proper administration of a discovery rule must strike a delicate balance between the staunch federal interest in requiring plaintiffs to bring suit promptly once they have been apprised of their claims thus securing repose for deserving defendants and the equally strong interest in not driving plaintiffs to bring suit prematurely,that is,before they are able,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,to discover the facts necessary to support their claims.it makes no more sense to reconcile this balance in a way that causes the limitations period to begin to run before a reasonably diligent investor has had an adequate opportunity to discover the facts underlying the alleged fraud than it would to reconcile it in a way that allows an investor to dawdle endlessly after sufficient storm warnings are apparent.in the end,a limitations period that begins when a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered the fraud treats both plaintiffs and defendants.
this interpretation of the limitations standard has metamorphosed into the majority view.see,rothman gregor,cir morton mkt.gustafson dairy,cir sterlin,at marks,at byelick vivadelli,d,see also berry valence,cir predicting that the ninth circuit,were it to adopt the inquiry notice rule,would subscribe to the sterlin court approach this consensus has become particularly evident since lampf.in etching the bounds of the limitations period,the lampf court explained that equitable tolling is both unnecessary and fundamentally inconsistent with the limit because this period,by its terms,begins after discovery of the facts constituting the violation.at.from this,we can extrapolate a standard that starts the limitations clock only when a plaintiff,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered her cause of action.accord sterlin,at.we hold,therefore,that following the receipt of sufficient storm warnings,a plaintiff cause of action is deemed to accrue on the date when,exercising reasonable diligence,she would have unearthed the fraud.
iii.the original claim 
we now determine where cape ann federal securities claim falls in this taxonomy.the critical date is august,year before cape ann brought suit.the question,then,is whether it can be said,as a matter of law,that cape ann should have discovered the fraud before that date.
the district court apparently say apparently because the court opinion is not explicit on this the sequential and management letters amounted to sufficient storm warnings,and,therefore,put cape ann on inquiry notice of the alleged fraud no later than november of.cape ann,d at.noting that the management letters were directed to the audit committee of the nutramax board,and that a cape ann representative held a seat on that committee,the court reasoned that those letters should have led cape ann,as a fiduciary of nutramax,to recognize the need for an immediate investigation which,the court surmised,would have uncovered the fraudulent scheme.id.we test this hypothesis.
distilled to bare essence,deloitte can prevail at this procedural stage only if the trial court properly concluded that the management letters amounted to storm warnings for a shareholder who like cape ann held a seat on the company board of directors and audit committee that cape ann failed to exercise reasonable diligence in the face of those portents and that,had cape ann investigated,it would have discovered the fraud prior to august.
the fate of a motion to dismiss under rule b ordinarily depends on the allegations contained within the four corners of the plaintiff complaint.here,however,the management letters were neither attached to the amended complaint nor incorporated by reference therein.we nonetheless conclude that it was proper for the trial court to consider those letters in ruling on deloitte motion to dismiss.
the key fact is that the amended complaint contained extensive excerpts from,and references to,these letters.when the factual allegations of a complaint revolve around a document whose authenticity is unchallenged,that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under rule b.beddall state bank trust,cir see also james moore et,moore federal practice ed.explaining that courts may consider u ndisputed documents alleged or referenced in the complaint in deciding a motion to dismiss.both sides agree that this principle is controlling here.
the significance of this ruling is readily apparent.it is undisputed that cape ann held a seat on nutramax audit committee,and that deloitte addressed the management letters to that committee.on that basis,the district court correctly assumed,for the purposes of its rule b analysis,that cape ann knew or should have known about this correspondence.it follows logically that the substance of those missives may be incorporated into the objective prong of the maggio test.constructora maza,banco de ponce,cir incorporating facts known to or ascertainable by creditor into resolution of objective prudent business person standard.this leaves us with the following legal question would deloitte management letters necessarily have placed a reasonable investor on inquiry notice concerning the possibility of fraud 
for present purposes,the import of the management letters lies in the reportable conditions identified therein,but those references can not be considered in a vacuum.there are countervailing considerations here.in the first place,the letters themselves contained specific reassurances that the reportable conditions did not represent material weaknesses in the company reporting systems.in the second place,deloitte gave nutramax a clean bill of financial health notwithstanding the contents of the management letters it certified nutramax and consolidated financial statements without any significant qualification.and,finally,the amended complaint alleges that deloitte provided cape ann with independent assurances that tended to palliate the import of the reportable conditions.for example,the amended complaint alleges that deloitte offered reassurances that it had adjusted each of its audits to respond to the risks posed by the problems it had discovered in nutramax internal controls.moreover,deloitte represented that,in addition to providing reasonable assurances of detecting irregularities and illegal acts,its audits had focus ed on areas that were material to nutramax consolidated financial statements,even if those areas were not considered to be high risk.the complaint further alleges that after deloitte issued its management letter,cape ann representative asked deloitte whether the letter raised any cause for concern and was assured that it did not.given this steady stream of comforting words,we are not persuaded that the management letters necessarily placed cape ann on inquiry notice of the possibility that fraud was afoot.
it is,of course,true that cape ann,qua fiduciary,received other unsettling information between november of and august of,the coo discoveries and the board decision to engage outside counsel and authorize a forensic audit.but on the present record,we are unable to say with the requisite level of certainty that the newly appointed coo had discovered the fraud and so advised the board by the end of july even though the amended complaint acknowledges that the fraud had been uncovered by.and,moreover,to the extent that these developments may have comprised storm warnings,they simultaneously put cape ann on notice that a thorough investigation was in progress.cape ann hardly can be faulted,as a matter of law,for awaiting the results of that investigation before jumping to the conclusion that management was cooking the books.jarrett kassel,cir allowing plaintiffs benefit of reasonably diligent investigation conducted on behalf of another jensen snellings,cir suggesting that limitations period did not begin to accrue until plaintiffs received results of investigation.in short,the complaint,on its face,permits the inference that nutramax board neither knew of nor fully appreciated the true state of nutramax finances,much less deloitte role in the situation,until after august.
we also reject the district court conclusion that,as a matter of law,cape ann failed to exercise reasonable diligence.while the fact that an investor is a director and a member of the company audit committee is plainly relevant to an evaluation of the investor diligence,fiduciary status,in and of itself,is not dispositive of the reasonable diligence issue 
while the existence of a fiduciary relationship is one factor which a court should consider in determining whether the plaintiff has exerted due diligence,a mere allegation that such a fiduciary relationship existed is not necessarily determinative.we must also consider other factors,including the nature of the fraud alleged,the opportunity to discover the fraud,and the subsequent actions of the defendants.
builders,at accord rowe marietta,rejecting summary judgment predicated,in part,on plaintiff status as a director and his receipt of storm warnings in that capacity.we hold,therefore,that cape ann status as a fiduciary does not justify an irresistible inference that it acted in willful disregard of a known risk.from the information contained in the amended complaint,it is a jury question as to whether cape ann acted with reasonable diligence 
drawing all reasonable inferences in cape ann favor,we do not think that a court could conclude,on the bare bones of the amended complaint,either that the management letters amounted to storm warnings or that those communications inexorably placed cape ann on inquiry notice.by like token,it can not be said,as a matter of law,that cape ann failed to exercise diligence commensurate with its knowledge.given these conclusions,we must vacate the order of dismissal insofar as that order pertains to cape ann rule claim see,rothman,at marks,at olcott.flood,cir.we fully appreciate that this is a close case on the facts,but we review a rule b disposition de in this instance we do not think that the amended complaint itself offers a sufficient basis for dismissal.
we add two brief observations designed to assist the district court on remand.first,we note that deloitte has questioned whether cape ann federal securities claim should be dismissed on the ground that the allegations set forth in the amended complaint were insufficiently specific.the district court did not address this asseveration,and we take no view of it.
we also note that courts generally refer to the law of the state of incorporation,rather than the law of the forum state,to determine the duties of corporate directors.william knepper dan bailey,liability of corporate officers directors,at ed.in light of this tenet,we encourage the district court to take a closer look at whether delaware law,rather than massachusetts law,should be applied to ascertain the scope of cape ann fiduciary duty for purposes of a maggio analysis.we leave open the possibility,however,that a formal ruling will prove unnecessary.see,royal bus.group,realist,cir declining to make such a ruling when choice of law will not affect the outcome.
iv.the added claims 
we turn next to the new plaintiffs federal securities claims.although the viability of this set of claims also hinges on temporal considerations,our evaluation traverses a much different analytical path.
the new plaintiffs first asserted their claims in the amended complaint,filed march.they did not argue in the district court that the limitations period was still open on that date by failing to advance such a theory below,they have forfeited the right to raise it on appeal.see teamsters union local superline transp,cir if any principle is settled in this circuit,it is that,absent the most extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not squarely raised in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.mccoy mit,cir similar.
this leaves the new plaintiffs with the argument that they urged below.that argument depends upon rule c of the civil rules,which states in pertinent part 
an amendment of a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted if the party to be brought in by amendment a has received such notice of the institution of the action that the party will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits,and b knew or should have known that,but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party,the action would have been brought against the party.
c.the new plaintiffs take the position that,under this rule,their federal securities claims relate back to august,date on which cape ann filed its original,thus,come within the prescriptive period.we find this argument unpersuasive.
at the outset,we acknowledge that the new plaintiffs argument is theoretically available.although the text of rule c seems to contemplate changes in the identity of defendants,we have recognized that the rule can be applied to amendments that change the identity of plaintiffs.see allied int l,int l longshoremen ass n,cir discussing potential applicability of the rule to an amendment substituting a fresh plaintiff for the original one see also.advisory committee note emphasizing that rule c extends by analogy to amendments changing plaintiffs.in theory,then,the benefits of rule c are within the reach of new plaintiffs.
in practice,however,relation back is far from automatic.rule c is not an open invitation to every plaintiff whose claim otherwise would be to salvage it by joining an action.rather,the rule strikes a carefully calibrated balance.properly construed,it allows some claims that otherwise might be dismissed on the basis of procedural technicalities to prosper while at the same time keeping the door closed to other claims that have been allowed to wither on the vine.see nelson county of allegheny,cir see also moore federal practice,supra,a.to separate wheat from chaff,we have laid down three separate requirements applicable to plaintiffs who seek succor under rule c 
t he amended complaint must arise out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading there must be a sufficient identity of interest between the new plaintiff,the old plaintiff,and their respective claims so that the defendants can be said to have been given fair notice of the latecomer claim against them and undue prejudice must be absent.
allied int l,at.
we ordinarily review a trial court decision to grant or deny motions under rule c for abuse of discretion,id.at.it is,however,settled beyond peradventure that an error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.see united states keene,cir in re grand jury subpoena,cir.here,the district court rejected the new plaintiffs claim that they were eligible for relation back principally on the ground that they and their claims lacked a sufficient identity of interest with the original plaintiff and its claims.cape ann,d at.this was a quintessentially legal determination,made on undisputed facts,and thus engenders de novo review.
the guideposts for evaluating whether two parties possess a sufficient identity of interest to permit relation back are not.as to defendants,identity of interest typically means that parties are so closely related in their business operations or other activities that the institution of an action against one serves to provide notice of the litigation to the other.singletary.dep t of,cir citing charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the substitution of such parties after the applicable statute of limitations may have run is not significant when the change is merely formal and in no way alters the known facts and issues on which the action is based.staren am.bank trust,cir.the identity of interest requirement reflects this line of thought it ensures that the old and new plaintiffs are sufficiently related so that the new plaintiff was in effect involved in the proceedings unofficially from an early stage.leachman beech aircraft,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
that formulation is not readily transferrable to plaintiffs.nevertheless,it suggests that when a new plaintiff attempts to enter a pending action under the aegis of rule c,courts should require substantial structural and corporate overlap to ensure that the defendant is not called upon to defend against new facts and issues.this,then,should be the focal point of the identity of interest requirement a new plaintiff.
the case law runs along these lines.see moore federal practice,supra,c collecting cases.some concrete examples may prove helpful.courts have found a sufficient iden
