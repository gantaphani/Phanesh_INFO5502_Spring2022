opinion of the court 
this appeal marks the second time that we address the underlying dispute between the parties.the controversy relates to the landmark rockefeller center in midtown manhattan and arises out of the proxy solicitation in connection with the acquisition of rockefeller center properties,rcpi by a consortium of investors,including david rockefeller,whitehall street real estate limited partnership v whitehall and its affiliates,various divisions of the goldman sachs group,goldman sachs,and three individuals associated with those entities the proxy statement painted a bleak financial picture of rockefeller center and included management recommendation to approve the merger.one month after the shareholders of rcpi voted to approve the merger,the new owners of rockefeller center,the investor group,sold approximately of the property to the national broadcasting company and its parent,the general electric company,for million.
plaintiffs,the shareholders of rcpi the shareholders,contend that the investor group fraudulently omitted from the proxy statement and other supporting materials the fact that rcpi had been negotiating the sale with prior to the proxy vote and that rcpi had formed an intent to consummate the sale during those negotiations,thereby running afoul of the federal securities laws.as a result of the allegedly fraudulent omissions,the shareholders contend that they were deceived into relinquishing their ownership rights and that they could have realized more value from their investments.the investor group moved to dismiss the shareholders second consolidated amended class action complaint second amended complaint.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the second amended complaint.the matter comes before us on the shareholders appeal of the dismissal.
we agree with the district court insofar as it held that the shareholders had failed to meet the heightened pleading requirements of securities fraud actions set forth in rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and the private securities litigation reform act of b the reform act.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
although prior decisions have set forth the facts of this case in some detail,the present appeal arises out of the shareholders second amended complaint which contains several new allegations not before the court in its prior ruling.see,in re rockefeller center properties.securities litigation,cir charal investment,rockefeller,d.therefore,we review the factual background,accepting the allegations in the second amended complaint as true and considering the documents incorporated by reference therein.see in re burlington coat factory securities litigation,cir a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b may be granted only if,accepting all well pleaded allegations in the complaint as true,and viewing them in the light most favorable to plaintiff,plaintiff is not entitled to relief a document integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment.citations omitted.
rockefeller center or the property is comprised of several commercial and retail buildings in a large midtown manhattan complex.the shareholders contend that the rockefeller family exercised ownership and control over the property through a network of related entities.second amended complaint,at.prior to,the rockefeller group,rgi owned the property through its control over two partnerships,rockefeller center properties and rcpi associates the partnerships rcpi was a real estate investment trust reit created in for the purpose of funding the partnerships with a billion loan.rcpi obtained the funds for the loan through an initial public offering of million shares at a price of per share,resulting in proceeds of million.the remainder of the funds came from two offerings of convertible debentures.rcpi secured its billion loan by receiving two mortgages on the property.
despite the substantial capitalization in,rockefeller center,rcpi,and the partnerships soon confronted mounting financial difficulties by the fall of,rcpi realized that it would be unable to honor upcoming debenture payments without additional financing.to avoid default,rcpi turned to goldman sachs and whitehall for an additional cash infusion of million under the terms of the financing,goldman sachs agreed to loan million to rcpi,and whitehall provided for the issuance of million more in debentures.in return,both goldman sachs and whitehall obtained equity interests in rcpi by partial assignments of the rockefeller center mortgage,and goldman sachs received a seat on rcpi board of directors 
the shareholders assert that several aspects of the financing agreement made it disadvantageous for rcpi.first,the financing included a provision requiring rcpi to pay directly to goldman sachs any funds falling within the definition of excess cash,at.according to the shareholders,the provision further jeopardized the liquidity of rcpi.id.because the provision required mandatory prepayment from rcpi net cash flow,the proceeds from any subsequent sale of equity or assets of rcpi would be applied first to pay down the reit outstanding debt to goldman sachs.id.at 
in addition,the agreement contained an provision intended to protect goldman sachs equity interest.the provision meant that any subsequent bidder competing with goldman sachs for an outright purchase of rcpi would have to exceed goldman sachs own bid by over per share.id.at.
rcpi financial problems did not end with the additional cash infusion of million in late.in particular,the partnerships continued to experience severe cash flow difficulties.on may,the partnerships suspended all interest payments due on the mortgage loan to rcpi and filed petitions for relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code.in turn,rcpi came to the realization that it would not be able honor its own obligations under the debentures without the interest payments from the partnerships,which led it to consider a number of recapitalization alternatives.
rcpi exploration of financing alternatives triggered a bidding war that resulted in various types of recapitalization proposals from many different bidders.as this court noted previously,three groups emerged from the pack of bidders with the most promising proposals.see in re rockefeller,at.one group was led by samuel zell,a real estate investor based in chicago,and included who,at that time,was a tenant of approximately of the property the zell group.another group was led by gotham partners,who already held of rcpi outstanding shares.third,the investor group entered the mix as a bidder.
in the initial stages of the bidding,the zell group arguably established an early lead.on august,rcpi entered into an agreement with the zell group evidenced by a letter of intent,which provided an immediate million loan to enable rcpi to meet its upcoming obligations to goldman sachs the letter of intent paved the way for a more formal combination agreement between the zell group and rcpi on september.the zell group proposed a million capital contribution to acquire a equity interest in a new entity that would purchase the existing assets of rcpi.the remaining interest in the entity would be reserved for rcpi shareholders.the zell group plan also contemplated refinancing million of rcpi outstanding debt.the agreement did not preclude rcpi from terminating the combination agreement in favor of a superior proposal.
as the bidding commenced,the partnerships filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court on september,in which they agreed to relinquish ownership of rockefeller center to rcpi.second amended complaint,at.thereafter,the bidding for rcpi steadily escalated.the intensity was marked by increasing offers for the purchase of all outstanding shares of rcpi,in conjunction with various debt refinancing plans or rights offerings on october,goldman sachs and the investor group offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of rcpi for per share in cash.according to the shareholders,the offer was fundamentally different from all the prior recapitalization proposals,as the shareholders would no longer have a continuing equity interest in the reit.in connection with the offer,the investor group stated it would capitalize the acquiring entity with equity of million dollars.id.at.
throughout the course of bidding,rcpi board communicated with prospective bidders as it evaluated incoming proposals.for instance,on september,when asked if it had any plans to sell any or all twelve of the buildings at rockefeller center,goldman sachs responded that,no,goldman sachs does not have any such plan.id.at emphasis in original.
on october,the zell group enhanced its recapitalization proposal by reducing the size of its proposed ownership of the new entity,increasing the rights offering to rcpi shareholders,and agreeing to pay million directly to goldman sachs for its consent to the plan.according to the shareholders,the rcpi board never responded to this enhanced proposal.allegedly hamstrung by the provisions of the goldman sachsled financing,the zell group made one final proposal on october,an offer of billion,mostly in cash,to buy the mortgage loan from rcpi.the zell group estimated that its final proposal would amount to buying out rcpi shareholders at a price between and per share,depending upon the outcome of negotiations or litigation with goldman sachs relating to various terms and conditions of the goldman sachs financing.id.at.once again,the shareholders contend that rcpi never responded to the zell group bid.
finally,on november,rcpi board of directors agreed to a merger with the investor group in which all of rcpi outstanding shares would be acquired for a price of per share in light of its determination that the investor group bid was financially superior to the other offers,rcpi board terminated the combination agreement with the zell group.the merger with the investor group was contingent on the approval of rcpi shareholders,and the agreement provided that in the event of rejection by the shareholders,rcpi could elect to make a million rights offering to its shareholders at a price not less than per share the rights offering.
rcpi filed a preliminary proxy statement with the sec in december.on february,rcpi filed its final proxy statement and distributed it to the shareholders along with the company letter and notice of special meeting to vote on the investor group proposal.the letter to the shareholders was signed by linneman,chairman of rcpi board,and scarlata,president and ceo of rcpi.
the shareholders contend that several aspects of the proxy statement were misleading in varying degrees.first,the board emphasized that it has unanimously approved the merger agreement,has determined that the merger agreement is fair to and in the best interests of rcpi and its stockholders and recommends that you vote for approval and adoption of the merger agreement.app.at emphasis in original.rcpi assessment of fairness and its recommendation of approval were echoed in an opinion letter from painewebber,attached to the proxy statement.see id.at.
second,the proxy statement painted an unmistakably bleak financial picture for rcpi.in rcpi discussion of the background of the merger,id.at,the company detailed the late,early downturn in the commercial real estate market,the liquidity problems of rcpi,and the bankruptcies of the partnerships.in the section entitled recommendation of the board,the proxy statement explicitly set forth the risk of rcpi own bankruptcy in the event that recapitalization was not forthcoming.id.at.in this regard,it is worth noting that the board recommendation characterized the zell group and gotham proposals as carrying substantial risk that the consummation of the proposals might not occur or might be significantly delayed as a result of legal challenges brought by the whitehall group.id.at.the proxy statement also detailed the risks to the shareholders in the event that they retained an interest in rcpi,including the dependence on a single asset,the continued significant cash flow deficits expected to be generated by the property and the highly leveraged condition of rcpi or its successor at least in the years immediately following such transaction.id.at.
third,as to the rights offering,in the event that the shareholders rejected the investor group proposal,the proxy statement cautioned the shareholders against any undue reliance on it.if the shareholders rejected the investor group bid,any alternative including the rights offering might require either the whitehall group consent,potentially protracted litigation or the commencement of a chapter case by rcpi.id.at.furthermore,the company warned that if rcpi stockholders do not approve the merger agreement,rcpi could be subject to substantial uncertainties.id.
fourth,the shareholders aver that rcpi misleadingly characterized the investor group plans for the new entity the investors currently intend that,following the merger,at least million in new debt financing would be raised and that a portion of the proceeds thereof would be used to repay the indebtedness outstanding under the floating rate notes and the current coupon convertible debentures the investors expect that newco will own and operate the property consistently with past practices but may increase expenditures and make such other changes as deemed appropriate by the investors.id.at.although these statements tend to imply that the investor group plans contemplated new debt financing in accordance with past practices,the same section of the proxy statement expressly hedged that contemplation the investors financing plans may change in light of changes in market conditions and other considerations.
fifth,the shareholders contend that the proxy statement contained misleading estimates of the value of rockefeller center.in its opinion letter,painewebber noted that it did not conduct an independent appraisal of the property,relying instead on one performed by douglas elliman in.that appraisal valued the rockefeller center complex at billion.plaintiffs contend,however,that the proxy statement omitted the appraisal observation that rockefeller center would likely be worth more if divided and sold as separate pieces and that analysts had expected the commercial real estate market to rebound in.
finally,the proxy statement contained several statements describing the relationship between and rcpi.at the time,nbc was leasing approximately of rockefeller center to house its offices and broadcast studios.see rockefeller,d at.the proxy statement described a transaction in september in which nbc lease was modified to add a guarantee on the lease by ge,so that rcpi could obtain lease financing.rcpi disclosed this transaction on its january,schedule filing with the sec.in addition,the proxy statement revealed that if the proposed acquisition by the investor group failed,rcpi would entertain the possibility of a credit lease financing arrangement with ge.ge role in the background of events was also mentioned in connection with its participation in the zell group.according to the shareholders,these statements were misleading and incomplete in that they failed to disclose alleged negotiations between the reit and relating to the outright purchase of its corporate office space from rcpi.
after reviewing the proxy materials,the shareholders approved the investor group bid to acquire rcpi on march.about a month later,on april,the investor group formally entered into an agreement with for the sale of that portion of rockefeller center already occupied by in return for million.according to the shareholders,it was not until rcpi april,amendment to its schedule filing with the sec that it disclosed the sale to.
in their second amended complaint,the shareholders allege three separate violations of the federal securities law.count one of the second amended complaint alleges that the investor group violated section a of the securities exchange act,a,and rule promulgated thereunder.in pertinent part,section a states 
it shall be unlawful for any person in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,to solicit any proxy or consent or authorization in respect of any security other than an exempted security registered pursuant to section of this act.
rule accordingly prohibits solicitation by means of any proxy statement or form of proxy containing any statement which,at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it is made,is false or misleading with respect to any material fact,or which omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or misleading 
count two of the second amended complaint alleges that the investor group violated section b of the securities exchange act,b,and rule promulgated thereunder.section b states 
it shall be unlawful for any person t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
rule b clarifies that i t shall be unlawful for any person t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading the shareholders claim under rule alleges not only misrepresentations and omissions,but also the investor group failure to update information that became misleading in light of the alleged negotiations between rcpi and.
count three of the second amended complaint alleges that certain individual defendants violated section a of the securities exchange act,which provides that e very person who controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.
at the pleading stage,the elements necessary to allege a violation pursuant to each of the three statutes differ in some respects.for instance,we have held that in order to state a violation under rule,plaintiffs must allege that defendants acted with the requisite state of mind.see in re westinghouse securities litigation,cir in re burlington,at.scienter is not,however,a necessary element in alleging a section a claim.see general electric by levit cathcart,cir in re nahc.securities litigation,cir.both statutes explicitly require a allegation that the purported misrepresentations or omissions at issue were material.see in re rockefeller,at.as to the shareholders claim pursuant to section a,it is that controlling person liability is premised on an independent violation of the federal securities laws.see shapiro ujb financial,cir controlling person liability can exist only if primary liability has been established as to another defendant here,the dismissal of the b claims against ujb made it impossible to hold the individual defendants liable under a.as such,derivative claims under section a depend on proof of a separate underlying violation of the exchange act.in re nice systems.securities litigation,d,citations omitted.
notwithstanding these differences in the essential elements of the three statutory claims brought by the shareholders,all three sound in fraud and require,therefore,allegations of fraudulent misrepresentations or omissions as the case may be.see in re burlington,at the first step for a rule plaintiff is to establish that defendant made a materially false or misleading statement or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make a statement not misleading.in re westinghouse,at plaintiffs claims under section b of the exchange act and under sections and of the securities act all require among other things,that plaintiffs allege a material misstatement or omission.emphasis in original.
the linchpin of the shareholders core theory of fraud at issue in all three of their their allegation that members of the investor group had engaged in negotiations with regarding a sale of the space occupied by nbc and that the investor group had,in fact,formed an intent to sell a portion of rockefeller center to prior to the shareholders vote.the shareholders allege that these critical omissions from the proxy statement were misleading in and of themselves,which,in turn,rendered other affirmative representations fraudulent.thus,the shareholders must,at a minimum,present allegations supporting their theory of fraud in order to survive a motion to dismiss.
in that regard,the shareholders identify seven distinct events that they contend properly substantiate their claim that the investor group had engaged in sale negotiations with and had,in fact,formed an intent to sell to,of rockefeller center 
around february,the shareholders claim that goldman sachs suggested to that if was willing to pay upwards of million dollars for capital lease treatment,depreciation rights and a purchase option of percent of fair market value in,it should simply buy the space it leased at rockefeller center.second amended complaint,at.the shareholders assert that the purported negotiations for the sale of this portion of the rockefeller center continued throughout february and march.
on march,the evening before the proxy vote,the shareholders allege that sheridan sheckner,of goldman sachs,spoke with charlie schoenherr,of ge capital,and lawrence rutkowsky,of nbc,and stated that an outright purchase of the leased property by would remove at least seven of the eleven open negotiating points between them.the parties agreed to negotiate further,and scheduled a meeting for the following afternoon id.at.
the shareholders also contend that a wall street journal article the wsj article published after the sale to supports their claims of fraud.the may,article reported that over the past two years ge and nbc had been in discussions with every party that had had an opportunity to gain control of the property,and that they began negotiating with defendants rockefeller and goldman sachs in november.the article quoted michael sherlock,an executive vice president of nbc,as stating everything you can imagine was at one point,over the past year,under negotiation.id.at.
similarly,the shareholders point to a june,new york daily news article the ny daily news article written by rich cotton,another executive vice president of nbc,stating that nbc had explored the transaction since and that t his purchase would give the potential new owners of the center million in new capital.id.at.
the shareholders also assert that a february,draft letter agreement between the partnerships and,when read together with the april,sale agreement between the investor group and,substantiates the fraudulent omissions and misrepresentations they allege.id.at.the february,draft letter was allegedly transmitted by the partnerships,at the behest of goldman sachs,and permitted to assume control of certain systems at rockefeller center,including the heating,ventilation,air conditioning,elevator,and window washing systems.the april,sale agreement,specifically refers to the earlier draft letter,from which the shareholders deduce that sale negotiations must have taken place before the proxy vote.
the shareholders also contend that several statements made during bankruptcy proceedings relating to the partnerships establish that sale negotiations between the investor group and had been underway before the proxy vote.at a may,hearing,the shareholders allege that counsel for the partnerships stated there has been,as has been reported in the press,a significant development that in fact had been the topic of discussions for several weeks and that is the proposed transaction between the reit designee and nbc that will result in nbc acquiring substantially all of the space that it presently leases in rockefeller center for a purchase price of some million.id.at.furthermore,counsel for rgi acknowledged that some time ago there had been some consideration of doing a transaction with and there were other strings to that transaction that caused rgi and its shareholders to decide not to do the transaction.id.at 
finally,the shareholders contend that in a may,letter to the new york state department of law,the investor group represented that the february,plan of reorganization contemplates that rcpa the partnerships shall transfer fee title to certain units including its reversionary rights to nbc,and transfer fee title to all remaining units then owned by rcpa to rcpi id.at emphasis in original.
as noted earlier,this appeal marks the second time that this court has addressed the shareholders action.in our first encounter,the shareholders appealed the dismissal of their first consolidated amended class action complaint.the district court had converted the investor group motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment and ruled,in separate decisions,on the two claims then before it.specifically,as to the sale negotiations claim,the district court found that the shareholders had failed to offer any proof that defendants knew of the details of the sale to at the time of the proxy statement or the shareholders vote,or that the information would have been material to a reasonable investor.see in re rockefeller,at.furthermore,as to the shareholders claim that the investor group had omitted information about the existence of air rights,the district court also found those omissions to be immaterial.id.at.at that time,this court affirmed the grant of summary judgment on the air rights claim,but held that the district court had improperly converted the motion to dismiss the sale negotiations claim into one for summary judgment.accordingly,the court vacated and remanded the case.the court also noted that the parties had briefed and argued their positions prior to the court recent decision in in re advanta corporation securities litigation,cir.therefore,the court remanded the case to afford the parties an opportunity to consider the impact of in re advanta.
on remand,the district court granted the shareholders motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.see rockefeller,d at.the second amended complaint focused on the shareholders allegation pertaining to the sale negotiations,but also added a number of factual allegations and the claim under section a of the securities exchange act.shortly thereafter,the investor group moved to dismiss the second amended complaint.the shareholders responded by filing a motion to strike the investor group motion contending that the district court had already considered the futility standards when ruling on their motion to amend the first amended complaint.therefore,the shareholders argued that the district court had implicitly determined that the second amended complaint satisfied the heightened pleading requirements of rule b and the reform act.
the district court addressed both of the motions before it on march.first,the court held that in considering the shareholders motion for leave to amend,it relied principally on rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,which counsels that leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.a rockefeller,d at.since it had not considered the futility standards,the district court denied the shareholders motion to strike 
the district court then performed a thorough review of the allegations in the second amended complaint.in particular,it addressed each of the seven events offered by the shareholders as proof that sale negotiations were underway before the proxy vote and that the investor group had formed an intent to consummate the sale with during those negotiations.the district court found that none of the allegations in the second amended complaint met the heightened pleading requirements of rule b and the reform act,b.having failed to meet these threshold pleading requirements,the district court granted the investor group motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.the shareholders appeal followed.
the district court had jurisdiction over this securities fraud action pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the district court final order pursuant to.our review of the district court order and its interpretation of the federal securities laws is plenary.see oran stafford,cir we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal of the amended complaint for failure to state a claim,accepting plaintiffs factual allegations as true we also have plenary review over the district court interpretation of the federal securities laws.in reviewing the dismissal of the shareholders second amended complaint,we apply the same standards applied by the district court.see official committee of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.
the shareholders claims require us to revisit the relevant standards applicable to motions to dismiss in the context of securities fraud actions brought under the federal securities laws.as some of our recent decisions have illustrated,the analysis requires more than mere reference to the conventional standard applicable to motions under rule b.
the applicable inquiry under rule b is.courts are required to accept all allegations in the complaint as true and to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see scheuer rhodes,d,overruled on other grounds,harlow fitzgerald,d allegheny general hospital philip morris,cir.the inquiry is not whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail in a trial on the merits,but whether they should be afforded an opportunity to offer evidence in support of their claims.see scheuer,at.dismissal under rule b is not appropriate unless it appears beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.see lafferty,at citing conley gibson,d.
nevertheless,we have also held that courts are not required to credit bald assertions or legal conclusions improperly alleged in the complaint.see in re burlington,at.similarly,legal conclusions draped in the guise of factual allegations may not benefit from the presumption of truthfulness.see in re nice systems,d at.
independent of the standard applicable to rule b motions,rule b imposes a heightened pleading requirement of factual particularity with respect to allegations of fraud.rule b states in all averments of fraud or mistake,the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.b as we have noted in previous decisions,t his particularity requirement has been rigorously applied in securities fraud cases.in re burlington,at citations omitted.although rule b falls short of requiring every material detail of the fraud such as date,location,and time,plaintiffs must use alternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.in re nice systems,d at.the imposition of a heightened pleading requirement in fraud actions serves important objectives rule b heightened pleading standard gives defendants notice of the claims against them,provides an increased measure of protection for their reputations,and reduces the number of frivolous suits brought solely to extract settlements.in re burlington,at citations omitted.
while we have acknowledged the stringency of rule b pleading requirements,we have also stated that,in applying rule b,courts should be sensitive to situations in which sophisticated defrauders may successfully conceal the details of their fraud.id.where it can be shown that the requisite factual information is peculiarly within the defendant knowledge or control,the rigid requirements of rule b may be relaxed.id.nevertheless,even when the defendant retains control over the flow of information,boilerplate and conclusory allegations will not suffice.plaintiffs must accompany their legal theory with factual allegations that make their theoretically viable claim plausible.id.emphasis in original.
in order to state a viable claim pursuant to rule,rule b requires a plaintiff to plead a specific false representation or omission of material fact knowledge by the person who made it of its falsity ignorance of its falsity by the person to whom it was made the intention that it should be acted upon and that the plaintiff acted upon it to his damage.shapiro,at citations omitted see also in re westinghouse,at citations omitted.with regard to the showing of specificity,the court has held that rule b requires plaintiffs to identify the source of the allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation or omission.see klein general nutrition,cir the complaint fails to attribute the statement to any specific member of gnc management.b requires,at a minimum,that the plaintiff identify the speaker of allegedly fraudulent statements.citations omitted.
thus,rule b requires,at a minimum,that plaintiffs support their allegations of securities fraud with all of the essential factual background that would accompany the first paragraph of any newspaper story that is,the who,what,when,where and how of the events at issue.in re burlington,at citing dileo ernst young,cir.
in addition to rule b,plaintiffs alleging securities fraud must also comply with the heightened pleading requirements of the reform act,b,b.specifically,b of the reform act requires plaintiffs to 
specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed 
in in re advanta,we reviewed the legislative history of the heightened pleading requirements of the reform act and noted that 
the purpose of the act was to restrict abuses in securities litigation,including the practice of filing lawsuits against issuers of securities in response to any significant change in stock price,regardless of defendants culpability the targeting of deep pocket defendants the abuse of the discovery process to coerce settlements and manipulation of clients by class action attorneys.
at citing conf,at,reprinted in,in light of these concerns,we found that by enacting the current version of the reform act,congress expressly intended to substantially heighten the existing pleading requirements.id.at a doption of a strong inference standard will substantially heighten the barriers to pleading scienter,a result congress expressly intended.
procedurally,the importance of the reform act to the present appeal is that the heightened pleading requirement of b imposes another layer of factual particularity to allegations of securities fraud.the particularity described in b extends that of rule b and requires plaintiffs to set forth the details of allegedly fraudulent statements or omissions,including who was involved,where the events took place,when the events took place,and why any statements were misleading.see,at,reprinted in,in response to criticism that courts of appeal have interpreted rule b in different ways,creating distinctly different pleading standards among the circuits,congress intended to adopt a uniform and stringent pleading requirement.see also in re advanta,at this language echoes precisely.b and therefore requires plaintiffs to plead the who,what,when,where and how the first paragraph of any newspaper story.citations omitted.
with these heightened pleading requirements in mind,the district court performed a detailed analysis of the shareholders allegations.specifically,the court outlined each of the seven critical events alleged by the shareholders in part,supra,and applied the requirements of rule b and b.the shareholders principal contention on appeal is that the district court erred in its interpretation of these events and in failing to draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in its favor.we agree that the facts alleged by the shareholders failed to meet the applicable pleading requirements and begin our analysis with a review of the critical events alleged by the shareholders.
the february goldman sachs statement 
the shareholders claim that sometime in february,an employee of goldman sachs suggested to that if was willing to pay upwards of million dollars for capital lease treatment,depreciation rights and a purchase option of percent of fair market value in,it should simply buy the space it leased at rockefeller center.second amended complaint,at.at the outset,even if accepted as true,this vague allegation falls far short of substantiating sale negotiations between the investor group and,let alone an intent to consummate the sale.the fact that an employee of goldman sachs suggested this alternative does not even indicate that negotiations actually commenced.the district court correctly noted that the allegation establishes no more than that someone at goldman sachs had considered a sale as an alternative.it does not establish that responded in any meaningful way,that goldman sachs advised the investor group to pursue a sale,or that the investor group formed an intent to sell a portion of the rockefeller center.
in addition,the allegation lacks the requisite specificity required by both rule b and the reform act.in klein,the court held that rule b requires,at a minimum,that the plaintiff identify the speaker of allegedly fraudulent statements.at.although the shareholders argue that the identification of goldman sachs employees involved in the pertinent deals elsewhere in the second amended complaint is sufficiently specific to inform the allegation above,that view is inconsistent with rule b and the reform act.because the allegation fails to identify the speaker,there is no indication that the speaker had the authority to speak on behalf of goldman sachs or that the employee was in regular contact with the investor group.
the statement of sheridan sheckner 
the shareholders allege that on march,sheridan sheckner of goldman sachs spoke with representatives of ge capital and nbc.in that discussion,sheckner allegedly mentioned that an outright purchase of the leased property by would resolve seven of the eleven open negotiating points between them.although the shareholders are able to identify the speaker and the audience,this event,too,is insufficient to support the shareholders claims.
first,the statement merely reflects sheckner own consideration of a sale.it does not reveal any consideration by the investor group of that alternative,or any adoption by the investor group of sheckner contemplations.the statement does not in any way substantiate the shareholders belief that the investor group had formed an intent to sell a portion of rockefeller center to.
second,the alleged discussion is more revealing as to what was actually being discussed at the time.because an outright purchase is clearly identified as an alternative,the discussions were focused on something other than a that had progressed to the point where eleven negotiating points had been identified.the shareholders themselves concede that the primary focus of the negotiations was a modified lease agreement and that as late as january,ge had no intention of consummating a sale the participants discussed a deal between the investor group and that was a cross between the bondable lease nbc had discussed with in august and the terms of deal as part of the zell group.was interested in gaining control of some of the operation systems at its leased premises as well as the right to depreciate its lease payments expressed no interest in becoming a part owner of the whole center,and had only a minimal appetite for any equity investment in the investor group.second amended complaint,at emphasis added against this backdrop,sheckner statement can not be interpreted as a part of ongoing negotiations to sell a part of rockefeller center or as evidence of the investor group intent to consummate a sale.rule b and the reform act require the shareholders to identify specific negotiations dedicated to a sale and to come forward with particular allegations of the investor group purported intent to consummate a sale.sheckner statement fails to meet these requirements.
the wsj article 
according to the shareholders,the may,wsj article stated that over the past two years ge and nbc had been in discussions with every party that had had an opportunity to gain control of the property,and that they began negotiating with defendants rockefeller and goldman sachs in november.second amended complaint,at.the article also quoted michael sherlock,an executive vice president of nbc,as saying everything you can imagine was at one point,over the past year under negotiation.id.
the court agrees that the shareholders fail to explain how the article tends to show that the investor group and were negotiating a sale prior to the shareholder vote.rockefeller,d at.presumably,the patently imprecise concept of everything you can imagine would encompass a sale,but because the negotiations over the past year included everything,there is no indication whatsoever when the lease negotiations morphed into negotiations for a sale.the only thing that the wsj article establishes is that sometime before may,sale negotiations occurred however,the article,even if accepted as true,does not state with the requisite specificity that sale negotiations commenced prior to the shareholders vote on march.
the daily news article 
on june,rick cotton of nbc published an article which stated 
in,a seismic event occurred rockefeller center went bankrupt.nbc,in considering ways to provide for its studio and office needs,had discussions with various investors to find a solution that would benefit rockefeller center,nbc and new york city.after examining many alternatives,nbc began to consider the possibility of purchasing our current space at rockefeller center this purchase would give the potential new owners of the center million in new,capital

the daily news article lacks the requisite particularity in the same way as the wsj article.cotton article establishes that at some point after the bankruptcy of the partnerships,nbc considered a number of alternatives for providing for its corporate needs.only a fter examining many alternatives,nbc began to consider the possibility of purchasing the space that it had been leasing.again,exactly when nbc began considering a purchase is unclear.cotton article is just as consistent with the notion that began considering a purchase after the acquisition of rcpi by the investor group.and,the daily news article says nothing about the investor group or its intentions.
the february,draft letter the april,sale agreement 
according to the shareholders,the agreement evidencing the sale of a portion of rockefeller center to itself supports their claims.they assert that the april,sale agreement provided for a payment by of the purchase price,to be paid to the successor owner in the manner contemplated by the reorganization plan.second amended complaint,at emphasis in original.furthermore,the shareholders contend that the sale agreement referred to a draft letter of february,in which nbc assumed control over heating,ventilation,air conditioning,elevator,and window washing systems of the space it occupied.the shareholders argue that since the partnerships had filed a second amended joint plan of reorganization on february,same plan referred to in the sale agreement investor group must have contemplated the sale at that time.also,because the sale agreement incorporated by reference the february,letter agreement,the sale must have been in consideration at that time as well.
the district court held that the term contemplated in the sale agreement does not refer to the subject of negotiations between the investor group and when the second amended reorganization plan was filed,but rather to the manner of payment of sale proceeds as set forth in that plan.we agree,and find no plausible interpretation fitting the shareholders description.the phrase a payment to be paid to the successor owner in the manner contemplated by the reorganization plan is a clear statement of how the parties to the sale intend to structure the payment,that is,as set forth in or contemplated by the reorganization plan.this is nothing more than an assurance given by the parties to the sale that the million payment would be in accordance with the requirements of the prior reorganization plan.that assurance does not support the shareholders view that the sale itself was somehow in contemplation in february,when the second amended reorganization plan was filed.the absence of any independent indication of a potential sale to in the reorganization plan supports the district court interpretation.
with regard to the incorporation by reference of the february,letter agreement,we agree that it also fails to substantiate the shareholders claims.first,the sequence of events does not logically flow to the conclusion that the shareholders advocate.the fact that negotiated for some autonomy over physical plant systems in february does not mean that sale negotiations were underway at that point.in fact,it seems to point to the contrary conclusion,namely that as lessee they desired more control.a subsequent sale simply indicates that the negotiations progressed along a continuum,starting with alternative lease options and advancing to arrangements contemplating more control in the hands of.thus,the incorporation of the february,letter agreement in the april,sale agreement fails to show that the investor group had engaged in sale negotiations with before the date of the proxy vote,march.
statements of counsel at the bankruptcy hearing 
the shareholders point out that at a may,hearing relating to the bankruptcy proceedings of the partnerships,counsel for the partnerships stated that there had been discussions for several weeks,pertaining to the proposed transaction between the reit designee and nbc.second amended complaint,at.furthermore,counsel for rgi stated that some time ago there had been some consideration of doing a transaction with id.at.the shareholders also contend that the bankruptcy court itself expressed surprise at the sudden announcement of the sale to and queried whether the disclosure statement in some way might have been inadequate or inappropriate.id.at.from these statements,the shareholders conclude that the investor group must have been negotiating the terms of the sale with before the proxy vote.furthermore,the shareholders believe that the revelations made at the bankruptcy hearing support their claim that the investor group had,in fact,formed an intent to consummate the sale.neither of those two conclusions are justified by these statements.
first,the statements regarding the timing of negotiations relating to the sale to are unspecific.several weeks before may,and some time ago lack the sort of precision necessary to meet the requirements of rule b and the reform act.the statements shed no definitive light on the issue of exactly when negotiations began or when the investor group formed the intent to consummate the sale.as the district court noted,several weeks before may,the date of the bankruptcy hearing,could be interpreted to include only the period after the shareholders is,the six weeks between march,and may.therefore,there is nothing in either of the statements that even remotely suggests that negotiations relating to the sale definitively commenced during a time when the investor group would have been obligated to disclose such negotiations.
as to the statement of counsel for rgi,the shareholders attempt to manufacture an inference of fraud by noting that david rockefeller was also a principal of rgi.but as the district court appropriately noted,rgi is not a defendant in this case,and the precise issue before the bankruptcy court involved the disclosure obligations of the partnerships their creditors in the chapter proceedings,not the duties of the investor group with regard to the proxy solicitation.merely because david rockefeller was a principal of rgi does not transfer the disclosure obligations of rgi to the investor group.the statements simply do not address who was negotiating,when the negotiations took place,and what exactly was on the table in february.the conclusion that the shareholders reach is supported only by speculations and inferences that are not justified under the set of facts alleged.
this last point also puts the statement of the bankruptcy court into perspective.the shareholders invoke the phrases inadequate or inappropriate and disclosure statement,implying that the disclosures in the investor group proxy statement must also have been insufficient.it bears repeating that the court statement was made in the context of the partnerships bankruptcy proceedings.furthermore,the obligations alluded to by the court pertain to the disclosure obligations of the partnerships,not the investor group,in the bankruptcy proceedings.again,those obligations are wholly distinct from the investor group disclosure obligations in the context of its proxy solicitation.in short,the shareholders have taken these statements out of their proper context.more importantly,the shareholders allegations fail to substantiate any actual ongoing negotiations between and the investor group before the proxy vote,an intent on the part of the investor group to consummate the sale,or any fraudulent misrepresentation or omission concerning the same.
the letter to the new york state department of law 
shortly after the bankruptcy hearing described above,rcpi wrote to the new york state department of law on may,primarily for the purpose of requesting that a letter received in would remain valid as to the upcoming transfer of title to pursuant to the sale.the shareholders highlight one line in the may letter the partnerships have filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy code and the proposed plan of reorganization contemplates that the partnerships shall transfer fee title to certain units including its reversionary rights to nbc,and transfer fee title to all remaining units then owned by the partnerships to rcpi.app.at.because the partnerships filed their second amended reorganization plan on february,and because the may letter states that that plan contemplates the transfer to nbc,the shareholders conclude that sale negotiations must have been underway at least as early as february.
again,the shareholders have taken this statement out of context,resulting in a tortuous misinterpretation.most importantly,the shareholders interpretation contradicts their discussion of the bankruptcy proceedings above,in which the shareholders concede that the first time that the issue of the sale arose in the bankruptcy court was at the may,hearing.therefore,it would have been impossible for the february,plan of reorganization to address the sale because,as far as the bankruptcy court was concerned,there was no such sale until may.and,as the proceedings before the bankruptcy court evidenced,the partnerships plan of reorganization was not a static set of simple steps.the plan was fluid,subject to uncertainties and disputes,and flexible enough to accommodate a sale of a portion of rockefeller center consummated after the shareholders vote.thus,the statement that the plan of reorganization contemplates the sale to is completely consistent with the overall intent of the may,letter to convince the department of law that the recently consummated sale to did not contravene the plan of reorganization and,consequently,that the department of law should extend its position.
in fact,the only plausible chronology of events is delineated by the shareholders own allegations a plan of reorganization was,in fact,filed with the bankruptcy court in february at some point after the proxy vote,the investor group and agreed to the sale of a portion of rockefeller center this disclosure was made to the bankruptcy court on may,at which time the bankruptcy court satisfied itself that the sale to was consistent with partnerships second amended disclosure statement and plan of reorganization and on may,rcpi requested that the new york state department of law approve the sale by seeking to extend the effect of the letter to the deal.the fact that the shareholders misinterpret statements made throughout the course of these events does not change the fact that their allegations do not substantiate their core claim of the investor group had engaged in negotiations relating to the sale prior to the proxy vote and that the investor group had formed an intent to consummate that sale during those negotiations.
having reviewed all of the critical factual events alleged by the shareholders,we agree with the district court that the shareholders have failed to support their claims of fraud with the factual particularity required by rule b and the reform act,b.
notwithstanding the district court thorough,examination of all of the shareholders allegations of fraud,the shareholders contend that the district court erred in two additional respects.
first,the shareholders argue that the district court ignored the rule b standard,requiring courts to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.this argument ignores the impact of the reform act.in in re advanta,we noted that a lthough the reform act established a uniform pleading standard,it did not purport to alter the substantive contours of scienter.under the heading requirements for securities fraud actions,the act expressly characterizes subsections b and b b and b as imposing pleading requirements.at emphasis added.similarly,in oran,this court stated that b oth the pslra and federal rule of civil procedure b impose heightened pleading requirements on plaintiffs who allege securities fraud.at emphasis added.these decisions clarify that rule b and the reform act impose independent,threshold pleading requirements that,if not met,support dismissal apart from rule b thus,in in re burlington,the court acknowledged that a complaint could pass muster under the traditional rule b analysis and still fail on rule b grounds.at we conclude,therefore,that while dismissal on rule b alone would not have been proper,the dismissal on rule b grounds was.in addition,the sanction of dismissal for failure to satisfy either of the heightened pleading requirements of the reform act is provided for in b a.see in re advanta,at failure to meet the reform act requirements will result in dismissal of the complaint.stated another way,unless plaintiffs in securities fraud actions allege facts supporting their contentions of fraud with the requisite particularity mandated by rule b and the reform act,they may not benefit from inferences flowing from vague or unspecific that may arguably have been justified under a traditional rule b analysis.
second,the shareholders assert that the district court erred in taking a piecemeal approach in analyzing their factual allegations and ignoring the purportedly reasonable inference that it would have reached had it viewed their allegations under the totality of the circumstances.in essence,the shareholders argue that if all of the critical events they allege are viewed as a whole,in conjunction with other allegedly suspicious coincidences,then the reasonable inference is that the investor group had commenced negotiations for the sale of a portion of rockefeller center prior to the proxy vote and had formed an intent to consummate that sale.according to the shareholders,the suspicious coincidences include the suspect timing of the sale just one month after the proxy vote and the fact that the purchase price paid by,million,correlates almost perfectly with the amount of debt financing that the investor group intended to obtain,as disclosed in the proxy statement,million.
the shareholders argument lacks merit for several reasons.as we have held before,fraud allegations should be analyzed individually to determine whether each alleged incident of fraud has been pleaded with particularity.see in re westinghouse,at see also in re nice systems,d at.if,after alleging a number of events purportedly substantiating a claim of fraud,none of those events independently satisfies the pleading requirement of factual particularity,the complaint is subject to dismissal under b a.while it is true that in other securities fraud contexts,the court has endorsed a variant of the totality of circumstances approach,those occasions are reserved for cases presenting unusually suspicious circumstances.for instance,in the context of insider trading claims,the court has consistently held that it will not infer fraudulent intent from the mere fact that some officers sold stock during a time when plaintiffs allege they possessed material,information.see in re advanta,at in re burlington,at.nev
