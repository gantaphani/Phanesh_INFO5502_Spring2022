ii.background 
a.the second amended complaint 
this is in part a shareholder derivative suit.plaintiff sues on its own behalf,and derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant rap technologies,doing business as loan vibe rap technologies.plaintiff is a private equity firm that finances and restructures companies.the nominal defendant,rap technologies,develops and distributes computer software.rap technologies shareholders include plaintiff,percent pless,percent allegra,percent and mayor,percent.
the operative pleading is a second amended complaint dated may.plaintiff alleges as follows.pless developed a mortgage presentation software program,loan vibe,designed for use in the mortgage loan industry.rap technologies was incorporated in january to develop the loan vibe software program.the loan vibe software program is rap technologies primary asset.pless became rap technologies chief executive officer and director.mayor and allegra were the primary investors in rap technologies at the time of its formation.mayor is also the managing member of defendant aim,which is in the business of internet web hosting.pless,mayor,and allegra held themselves out to the public as members of rap technologies board of directors.doyle had been a rap technologies employee and then an independent contractor.she is currently working for pless,mayor,and aim.
shortly after rap technologies incorporated,pless,mayor,and allegra found themselves in need of capital to develop the loan vibe software program.they formed a plan to fraudulently induce third parties to invest in rap technologies.they intended to use the funds to exploit the loan vibe software program for their own financial gain to the exclusion of their investors.pless approached plaintiff.the second amended complaint does not specify the persons employed by plaintiff who were approached by pless.pless represented to plaintiff that the loan vibe software program had great economic potential any investor in rap technologies would become a partner in its growth in exchange for plaintiff financial backing,it would have the right to appoint directors to rap technologies board further,plaintiff would be entitled to participate in rap technologies management and control,including efforts to develop,market,and exploit the loan vibe software program.plaintiff,in reasonable reliance on the foregoing representations,agreed to invest in rap technologies.
on april,plaintiff entered into a contract,the strategic relationship agreement,with rap technologies.the strategic relationship agreement sets forth the parties obligations to each other.the purpose of the agreement was to initiate and further a working relationship between plaintiff and rap technologies.plaintiff was to provide rap technologies with capital and restructuring services.in return,plaintiff would receive an equity interest in rap technologies.rap technologies was to,among other things,provide to plaintiff a copy of the loan vibe software program including codes and trade secrets.further,rap technologies was obligated to provide to plaintiff a full list of the investors in the loan vibe software program.the strategic relationship agreement stated in part,robert pless agrees to provide any and all services required to fulfill any agreement that is signed on behalf of rap technologies and any other duties that may arise in the course of business.pless signed the strategic relationship agreement in the following manner rap technologies,signature by robert pless title president ceo.plaintiff invested more than in rap technologies.rap technologies was obligated to repay plaintiff with interest.
in or around april,plaintiff named its managing member,evans,and its secretary,conrad,to rap technologies board of directors.pless served as the third rap technologies director.by agreement among the parties,rap technologies directors were conrad,evans,and pless.also on april,date the parties entered into the strategic relationship technologies entered into a contract with defendant,integrated tech,integrated.integrated is not a party to this appeal.integrated agreed to provide program development,service,training,and general computer programming support work for the loan vibe software program.
on november,plaintiff learned pless had misappropriated funds from rap technologies.on or about november,evans and conrad,as a majority of rap technologies directors,terminated pless as chief executive officer and director.also,on november,evans notified integrated that pless should have no access to rap technologies property.as noted,integrated and rap technologies had an agreement to develop the loan vibe software program.integrated had possession of rap technologies property.on november,evans and conrad demanded pless return all rap technologies property in his control.as of the date of the filing of the second amended complaint,pless had not complied with the demands of conrad and evans.on or about november,mayor agreed to provide pless with.the was to allow pless to meet his personal obligations.in return,pless agreed to divert payments from rap technologies clients to aim.as noted above,mayor is the managing member of aim.thereafter,pless caused funds due to rap technologies to be diverted to aim.further,integrated has refused to grant rap technologies or plaintiff access to the loan vibe software program.instead,integrated has continued to provide defendants with program development,service,training,and general programming support work for the loan vibe software program.according to the second amended complaint defendants had entered into additional web hosting agreements with other entities,thereby diverting the loan vibe software program these entities refused plaintiff access to the loan vibe software program defendants have diverted the loan vibe software program to their own use defendants have refused to provide rap technologies with access to the loan vibe software program defendants are exploiting the loan vibe software program for their own financial gain to the detriment of plaintiff and rap technologies and plaintiff was contractually entitled to a return on the investment in rap technologies resulting from the april,strategic relationship agreement.however,rap technologies has not paid interest to plaintiff and does not have the ability to do so.
with respect to the capacity in which the defendants acted,the second amended complaint alleges at the time pless,mayor,and allegra conspired to defraud plaintiff these defendants were acting as the officers and directors of rap technologies moreover,at the time that pless,with the assistance of and in concert with defendants mayor,aim,and allegra converted rap technologies money and property,including the loan vibe program,pless was both the chief executive officer and a director of rap technologies.in addition,plaintiff alleges at all times mentioned herein,defendants,and each of them,were the agent,employee and representative of each and every other defendant,and in doing the things hereinafter alleged,each was acting within the course and scope of such agency,service and representation and directed,aided and abetted,authorized or ratified each and every unlawful act omission hereinafter alleged.
plaintiff second amended complaint asserts causes of action for fraud,conspiracy to defraud,negligent misrepresentation,fiduciary duty breach,intentional interference with contractual relations,conversion,and declaratory relief.more specifically,it is alleged pless either fraudulently or negligently induced plaintiff to invest in rap technologies.plaintiff further alleges pless,mayor,and allegra,as rap technologies directors,allegedly breached their fiduciary duties by usurping the loan vibe program for their own personal benefit.further,plaintiff alleged defendants intentionally interfered with the strategic relationship agreement between plaintiff and rap technologies.additionally,pless,doyle,allegra,mayor,and aim allegedly converted rap technologies property.plaintiff sought declaratory relief as to the parties rights and ownership interests in and to the loan vibe software program.
b.the arbitration clause of the strategic relationship agreement 
the strategic relationship agreement between plaintiff and rap technologies contains an arbitration clause which states any dispute or other disagreement arising from or out of this consulting agreement shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association and the decision of the arbitrator s shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof.arbitration shall occur only in los angeles,ca.the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by california law as applied to residents of the state of california relating to contracts exercised in and to be performed solely within the state of california.in the event any dispute is arbitrated,the prevailing party as determined by the arbitrator s shall be entitled to recovery of that party reasonable attorney fees incurred as determined by the arbitrator s.
defendants motion to compel arbitration 
on june,defendants moved to compel arbitration.defendants asserted all of plaintiff claims arose out of the business relationship founded on the april,strategic relationship agreement and therefore were governed by that contract arbitration clause.defendants presented evidence pless was a shareholder of rap technologies and he had signed the april,strategic relationship agreement.further,there was evidence mayor and allegra were also rap technologies shareholders.finally,evidence was presented integrated did not object to the motion to compel arbitration.
plaintiff opposed the motion to compel arbitration.plaintiff argued defendants were not signatories to the april,strategic relationship agreement they were not beneficiaries thereof they were not agents of rap technologies therefore,defendants could not enforce the arbitration provision and even if defendants could invoke the arbitration provision,it was narrowly crafted and did not embrace the present disputes.in any event,plaintiff argued,the nonsignatory defendants had waived any right to invoke the arbitration filed their motion more than seven months after this action was commenced.evans presented a brief one and page declaration which states in part i was principally involved with mayor and pless in the negotiation and drafting of the strategic relationship agreement,which includes a arbitration clause by including the arbitration provision in the strategic relationship agreement,my intent was to provide a mechanism by which to resolve disputes between my company,the p laintiff herein,and rap technology,the other signatory to the strategic relationship agreement,concerning the performance and interpretation of the strategic relationship agreement.at no time during our negotiations in or about april did either mayor,pless or myself consider or discuss whether the arbitration provision would apply to claims that either p laintiff or rap technologies might have against third parties that had engaged in tortious conduct that result ed in damage to or destruction of my company or rap technologies.moreover,at no time during our negotiations in or about april did we consider or discuss whether the strategic relationship agreement was designed to benefit any person other than plaintiff and rap technologies.
the trial court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration.the trial court was persuaded by two ninth circuit court of appeals research national environmental services,supra,at pages,and mediterranean enterprises,ssangyong,supra,at pages.the trial court found plaintiff claims did not arise from or out of the strategic relationship agreement in that they did not require interpretation of the strategic relationship agreement they did not require an examination of performance under that contract and all of the allegations had to do with defendants alleged conversion of the loan vibe software program,rap technologies principal corporate asset.therefore,the trial court ruled plaintiff causes of action were not subject to arbitration.the trial court further ruled as a result of the court analysis regarding the scope of the arbitration provision at issue,the court need not reach the questions of whether defendants may rely upon the arbitration provision and whether defendants have waived any right to rely thereon through dilatory and conduct.because the scope of the arbitration clause language is not broad enough to encompass plaintiff claims herein,the court denies defendants motion to compel arbitration and to stay this litigation.the trial court also did not rule on defendants evidentiary objections.as a result,those objections have been waived.sharon arman,cal th,fn,d,disapproved on another point in aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,fn,d,summary judgment goodale thorn cal,trial city of long beach farmers merchants bank th,d summary judgment fibreboard paper products east bay union of machinists d.trial.
iii.discussion 
a.the united states arbitration act 
the arbitration clause specifically provides,the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by california law as applied to residents of the state of california relating to contracts exercised in and to be performed solely within the state of california.therefore,the limited preemptive aspects of the united states arbitration act,title united states code section et,do not apply.volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior,d cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d.although this case is not subject to the limited preemptive effect of the united states arbitration act,california law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the federal arbitration statutes including the presumption in favor of arbitrability.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d.
b.the arbitration agreement extends to the present dispute 
the question before us is whether the strategic relationship agreement arbitration clause extends to the dispute described in plaintiff second amended complaint.whether there is an agreement to arbitrate the present controversy turns on the language of the arbitration clause.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d valsan partners limited partnership calcor space facility,th,d.there is no dispute as to the language of the arbitration clause.as will be noted,there is no relevant conflicting extrinsic evidence as to its terms.we thus conduct a de novo review of the arbitration clause.hotels nevada,llc bridge banc,llc th,d dream theater,dream theater th,d coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.
code of civil procedure section provides in part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists italics added.this language is mandatory.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d cole antelope valley union high school dist.th,d.there is no public policy requiring persons to arbitrate disputes they have not agreed to arbitrate.victoria superior court cal d,bono david th,d medical staff of doctors medical center in modesto kamil th,d.however,california has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.given that strong public policy,any doubt as to whether plaintiff claims come within the arbitration clause must be resolved in favor of arbitration.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d hayes children leasing ncr th,d.the court of appeal has held,this strong public policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.citation.bos material handling,crown controls d.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d accord,izzi mesquite country club d.the burden is on the plaintiff,the party opposing arbitration,to show that the arbitration clause can not be interpreted to cover the claims in the second amended complaint.buckhorn jude heritage medical group th,d coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.
in considering the language of the strategic relationship agreement arbitration provision,we apply the ordinary rules of contract interpretation.hotels nevada,llc bridge banc,llc,supra,th at,d in re tobacco cases i th,d.the supreme court has held the fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.citations.a contract provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.trb investments,fireman fund ins.cal th,d.in victoria superior court,supra,cal d at page,the supreme court explained in determining the scope of an arbitration clause,t he court should attempt to give effect to the parties intentions,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made citation.weeks crow d.
as noted,in response to the motion to compel arbitration,pless declared that the parties to the april,strategic relationship agreement did not intend the arbitration clause to apply to tort claims plaintiff or rap technologies may have against third parties.plaintiff contends,without citation to authority,that we must consider the extrinsic evidence as to the parties intentions.we disagree.when the contractual language is clear,there is no need to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties intentions the clear language of the agreement governs.trb investments,fireman fund ins,supra,cal th at,d,people shelton cal th,d.
as noted above,the arbitration agreement between plaintiff and rap technologies provides in pertinent part any dispute or other disagreement arising from or out of this consulting agreement shall be submitted to arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association and the decision of the arbitrator s shall be enforceable in any court having jurisdiction thereof.italics added.plaintiff agreement to arbitrate a ny dispute or other disagreement with rap technologies is plain,clear,and very broad.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d.as division three of the court of appeal for this appellate district held in coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at page,d it is clear that the parties agreed to arbitrate any problem or dispute that arose under or concerned the terms of the agreement.that contractual language is both clear and plain.it is also very broad.in interpreting an unambiguous contractual provision we are bound to give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used by the parties.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,and.we interpret any problem or dispute to mean just what it says.the language a ny dispute or other disagreement extends beyond contract claims to encompass tort causes of action.lewsadder mitchum,jones templeton,d.crofoot blair holdings d.
the question then becomes whether plaintiff fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claims brought on its own behalf against rap technologies former officers,directors,and employee reasonably can be characterized as arising from or out of the april,strategic relationship agreement.we further consider whether the causes of action brought on rap technologies behalf,for fiduciary duty breach,interference with contractual relations,and conversion,can likewise be said to arise from or out of the april,strategic relationship agreement.the courts of appeal have construed arbitration clauses similar to the present provision to broadly encompass tort claims having their roots in the contractual relationship between the parties.in berman dean witter,d,division two of the court of appeal for this appellate district considered an action for negligence and fiduciary duty breach arising out of a broker purchase transaction pursuant to a customer securities brokerage agreement.the arbitration clause of the agreement stated,any controversy between the parties arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration italics added.id.at.the court of appeal concluded the phrase any controversy arising out of or relating to this contract is certainly broad enough to embrace tort as well as contractual liabilities so long as they have their roots in the relationship between the parties which was created by the contract.citations.id.at.the court of appeal held that when the securities broker ordered margin purchases of currency futures on the brokerage account,those transactions arose out of and were related to the brokerage agreement therefore,any dispute concerning those purchases arose out of and were related to the agreement.ibid.
similarly,in izzi mesquite country club,supra,d at pages,the court of appeal for the fourth appellate district,division two,considered a fraudulent concealment,statutory and fiduciary duty breach,and negligence class action brought by condominium purchasers against the sellers.the arbitration clause in izzi was spread over two sentences of a paragraph labeled as an attorney fee clause.but the late associate justice marcus kaufman carefully parsed out the controlling arbitration provisions in the clause thusly the arbitration clause at issue in this matter provides that a ny such dispute shall be settled by arbitration italics added.the words a ny such dispute are obviously delimited by the language in the preceding sentence,any action instituted between seller and buyer in connection with this agreement italics added.id.at.justice kaufman described the pertinent legal issue as follows defendants petition to compel arbitration thus required the trial court to determine whether plaintiffs tort claims for fraudulent concealment,negligence,and breach of statutory and fiduciary duties arose in connection with the parties agreement for purchase and sale of the condominium.ibid.the court of appeal held the factual basis for plaintiffs tort claims in this case persuades us the arbitration clause applies to such claims and the court erred in concluding otherwise.in the first place,defendants alleged tort liability for failure to disclose that buyers of condominiums would be subject to assessments to pay for curbs,gutters,sewers,flood control structures and the like would have its roots in the relationship created by the purchase and sale contract containing the arbitration clause.see berman dean witter,supra,d at.indeed,plaintiffs entire complaint is predicated on the very claim that vital information was intentionally withheld by defendants in the communications between the parties leading up to that agreement.in this regard,the complaint specifically alleges that if plaintiff class members had been aware of the existence of the facts not disclosed by defendants,they would not have entered into the contract.izzi mesquite country club,supra,d at.
and in coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at pages,d,division three of the court of appeal for this appellate district held the plaintiff tort claims against the defendant were not beyond the scope of an arbitration clause in a service agreement.the parties had entered into a service agreement whereby defendant,a managed health care services provider,would reimburse plaintiff for specified health care services supplied to patient members.id.at,d.the service agreement arbitration clause provided,any problem or dispute arising under this agreement concerning the terms of this agreement shall be arbitrated.id.at,fn,d.the plaintiff alleged defendant discriminated against it,a small hospital in a less affluent community,by refusing to renegotiate contractual reimbursement rates that were too low.at the same time the defendant renegotiated with large hospitals in more affluent neighborhoods.id.at,d.the court of appeal held the trial court erred in refusing to grant defendant petition to compel arbitration.our division three colleagues reasoned coast plaza complaint centers around and is clearly based upon the reimbursement rates provided for in the service agreement and blue cross alleged refusal to renegotiate them in a manner satisfactory to coast plaza.it is alleged that such refusal to renegotiate was the result of blue cross intent and purpose of discriminating against and eventually eliminating smaller hospitals in less affluent communities.coast plaza also complains that coast plaza had prospective economic relationships with future blue cross patients and their referring physicians.coast plaza claims these relationships with blue cross subscribers were disturbed when blue cross declined to renegotiate more favorable rates than those set forth in the service agreement.coast plaza complains that because it was forced to terminate the service agreement with blue cross,coast plaza now no longer has access to blue cross patients.these claims unquestionably have arisen under the service agreement and are inextricably related to its terms and provisions.certainly,the fact that coast plaza complaint consists of alleged tort causes of action,rather than contractual claims that are directly based on the provisions of the service agreement,does not assist coast plaza argument.it has long been the rule in california that a broadly worded arbitration clause,such as we have here,may extend to tort claims that may arise under or from the contractual relationship.id.at,d,fns.omitted.
in this case,plaintiff alleges defendants defrauded it out of its investment in rap technologies and any financial return on its moneys invested in the loan vibe software program.plaintiff further asserts defendants harmed rap technologies by diverting the loan vibe software program to their own use for their own financial gain.as noted,the second amended complaint alleges the loan vibe software program was rap technologies principal asset.none of defendants is a named party to the strategic relationship agreement.but the strategic relationship agreement is the basis for plaintiff contractual obligations to rap technologies and,by extension,to defendants.it is undisputed defendants are rap technologies former officers,directors,and employees.the strategic relationship agreement established and governed plaintiff relationship with rap technologies.the first and second causes of action allege defendants conspired to and did fraudulently induce plaintiff to invest in rap technologies in other words,to enter into the strategic relationship agreement.the third cause of action alleges pless negligently represented the facts that induced plaintiff to invest in rap technologies that is,to enter into the strategic relationship agreement.the fourth,fifth,and sixth causes of action allege injury to rap technologies.specifically,it is alleged defendants induced plaintiff to invest via the strategic relationship agreement in rap technologies,then absconded with the loan vibe software program,and exercised dominion and control over it for their own financial gain.thus,it is alleged,pless,mayor,and allegra breached their fiduciary duties and loyalty obligations as officers and directors to rap technologies.as alleged,defendants plan to abscond with rap technologies principal asset,the loan vibe software program,and to convert it to their own use,hinged on the strategic relationship agreement.in other words,the strategic relationship agreement was the vehicle for investment in the loan vibe software program and that transaction permitted defendants alleged scheme to succeed.in addition,defendants allegedly interfered with the contractual rights and obligations existing between rap technologies and plaintiff,which existed because of the strategic relationship agreement.this caused rap technologies to be unable to perform its obligations under the strategic relationship agreement.if plaintiff and rap technologies had never entered into the strategic relationship agreement,the present disputes would never have arisen.the second amended complaint is predicated on the claim that but for defendants fraudulent inducement and deceit,plaintiff would never have entered into the strategic relationship agreement.moreover,the second amended complaint alleges pless,mayor,and allegra were acting as rap technologies officers and directors when they participated in the fraudulent conspiracy pless was both a director and chief executive officer of rap technologies when he converted its principal asset,the loan vibe software program and the defendants were all acting as agents,employees,and representatives of each other and were acting within the course and scope of such agency,employment,and representation,when they engaged in the asserted misconduct.we conclude a ny dispute or other disagreement necessarily extends to the present controversy.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at,d lewsadder mitchum,jones templeton,supra,d at.crofoot blair holdings,supra,d at.therefore,the arbitration agreement extends to the disputes alleged in plaintiff second amended complaint.
as previously explained,the trial court relied on two ninth circuit court of appeals decisions as the basis for denying the motion to compel arbitration.it is appropriate to examine each decision in some detail.the first case relied upon by the trial court was mediterranean enterprises,ssangyong,supra,at pages.in mediterranean enterprises,the parties executed an agreement to form a joint venture.the plaintiff was invited to bid on a saudi arabian construction project.it was expected the defendant would act as the contractor on the saudi arabian project.the arbitration clause stated,any disputes arising hereunder or following the formation of joint venture shall be settled through binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement,with arbitration to take place in seoul,korea.mediterranean enterprises,ssangyong,supra,at.when the contemplated joint venture was never formed,the plaintiff filed suit in federal district court for contract and fiduciary duty breach inducing and conspiracy to induce a contract breach quantum meruit and conversion.
in mediterranean enterprises,a ninth circuit panel limited the scope of the arbitration clause to disputes concerning interpretation or performance under the contract.the ninth circuit panel explained we interpret arising hereunder as synonymous with arising under the agreement.the phrase arising under has been called relatively narrow as arbitration clauses go.sinva,merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith.in in re
