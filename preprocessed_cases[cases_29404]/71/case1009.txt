background facts and prior proceedings 
gateway officers and transactions 
gateway is a manufacturer and seller of personal computers.in,weitzen was gateway president and chief executive officer ceo,todd was its chief financial officer cfo,and manza was its controller.in addition to maintaining its own internal accounting systems,gateway retained pricewaterhousecoopers pwc as its outside accounting and auditing firm.
todd was responsible for gateway financial reporting,which included reviewing and signing financial reports.todd also reviewed press releases,made accounting decisions,and managed gateway relationships with outside auditors and investors.manza was the company cpa.his responsibilities included booking transactions and preparing financial statements,such as gateway q quarterly and k yearly reports.
todd and manza signed the management representation letter to pwc,which claimed that gateway quarterly financial statements were a fair presentation of gateway financial position,and that they were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.also in the third quarter of,weitzen and todd represented in a conference call with analysts that gateway was experiencing accelerating revenue growth.weitzen also participated in preparing a press release claiming that gateway had accelerated revenue growth.
in,the personal computer market was weakening substantially,yet gateway continued to claim record earnings and revenue growth.skeptical,the sec began investigating whether weitzen,todd,or manza had misrepresented gateway financial condition during the second and third quarters of in order to meet wall street analysts expectations.in the sec view,weitzen,todd,and manza had misrepresented gateway financial status in order to cover a million gap in the third quarter between the analysts expectations and its actual revenue.three transactions are at issue in this appeal 
a.the lockheed transaction 
in the third quarter of,gateway recorded million in revenue from a sale of fixed assets to lockheed martin.contrary to gateway customary practice of selling personal computers,the sale was mostly comprised of ibm and sun servers.the essence of the transaction was that lockheed would acquire the equipment for million,and gateway would lease it back from lockheed.the deal was to be cash neutral for lockheed.
the parties agree that this was an unusual transaction because gateway normally sold its own computers to consumers from its inventory,whereas this was a transaction involving fixed assets manufactured by other companies.gateway booked the sale of the fixed assets as gross revenue.thereafter,the million transaction was publicly reported as gross revenue in gateway form q report,the earnings release,and in a conference call with analysts.
at trial,the parties disputed whether gateway booking of the transaction as revenue violated gaap.they also clashed over whether the booking was at odds with the policy disclosed in gateway form k report,in which gateway indicated that sales would be included as gains or losses in net income,whereas product sales and services would be recorded as gross revenue.what no one disputes is that absent the million in revenue booked by gateway from the lockheed transaction,gateway would not have met analysts quarterly expectations.
b.the venserv transaction 
gateway earnings in also included million derived from an incomplete sale of computers to venserv,booked as revenue.the sale was incomplete because,according to a referral agreement,venserv was not required to pay gateway for the computers until gateway referred enough customers to venserv to buy them.because gateway had not yet referred the requisite number of customers to venserv,the sale could not properly be recorded as revenue.none of the parties presently disputes the fact that the venserv sale was improperly booked.
c.the aol transaction 
in the third quarter of,gateway and aol contractually changed the timing of when fees were payable by aol to gateway.prior to the change,aol agreed to pay a fee to gateway whenever a buyer of a gateway computer registered with aol.under the modified agreement,the aol fees were payable as soon as a gateway computer was shipped to a customer,permitting gateway to book revenue upon shipment.while the transaction itself was not improper,it gave gateway a revenue boost of million.the sec claimed that weitzen misrepresented gateway growth as accelerated in the conference call with analysts and in a press release when he did not disclose that the revenue was based in part on this unusual,transaction,rather than on ordinary sales growth.
ii.prior proceedings 
on november,the sec filed a civil enforcement complaint alleging that weitzen,todd,and manza had violated various securities antifraud and reporting provisions under the securities act of,et,and the securities exchange act of act,et.on may,the district court granted weitzen motion for summary judgment as to the antifraud provisions of section b,b,and rule,b the rule prohibition against making misrepresentations to auditors,and control person liability under section a,a.

i.the section b and rule verdict against todd and manza 
section b of the act provides 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
b.rule further delineates that it is unlawful 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud,
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading,or 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
liability under section b and rule therefore requires evidence of a material misrepresentation,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,with scienter,by means of interstate commerce.sec dain rauscher,cir citing sec rana research,cir.for a misrepresentation to be material,there must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.

the jury found todd and manza liable for securities fraud under section b and rule.only the material misrepresentation and scienter elements of the claimed b violations are disputed on appeal.we reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law because substantial evidence supports the jury verdict concerning todd and manza.
a.the lockheed transaction 
material misrepresentation 
the district court granted todd and manza motions for judgment as a matter of law,reasoning that the sec expert,professor arnold,did not cite a specific gaap provision prohibiting the booking of revenue from the sale of fixed assets,and that manza had disclosed this unusual transaction to pwc.the sec argues that substantial evidence supports the jury verdict because professor arnold and other witnesses testified at trial that todd and manza misrepresented the financial statements for the lockheed transaction by knowingly recording the revenue improperly under gaap,and by failing to disclose a material change in gateway accounting practices.
we recognize that gaap tolerate s a range of reasonable accounting treatments,leaving the choice among alternatives to management.thor power tool comm r of internal revenue.fraudulent accounting decisions are not merely the difference between two permissible judgments,as flexible accounting concepts do not always or perhaps ever yield a single correct figure.in re glenfed.sec,cir en banc,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in ronconi larkin,cir see also lovelace software spectrum,cir explaining that gaap encompasses a wide range of acceptable procedures,such that an ethical,reasonably diligent accountant may choose to apply any of a variety of acceptable accounting procedures when that accountant prepares a financial statement citation omitted.
here,the parties presented competing expert testimony concerning the propriety of gateway accounting treatment of the lockheed transaction.todd and manza justified their treatment of the lockheed transaction by relying on gaap statement of financial accounting concept,which defines revenue as inflows or other enhancements of assets or an entity or settlements of its liabilities or a combination of both from delivering or producing goods,rendering services,or other activities that constitute the entity ongoing major or central operations.according to the defense,because gateway ordinarily sold computer equipment as part of its central operations,gateway could properly recognize the revenue even though it was generated by the sale of a fixed asset rather than the sale of inventory.
on the other hand,substantial evidence was presented to the jury that enabled it to properly find that gaap did not permit gateway to book the lockheed transaction as it did.the sec expert testified at trial that,based on his reading of concept,it was inappropriate to consider the sale as revenue generating because no company sells its fixed assets on a regular basis unless it liquidating.additionally,the defense expert conceded that in his entire career as an auditor he had never seen a sale recorded as revenue.
assessing expert witness credibility is within the province of the jury.see,dorn burlington santa fe,cir if two contradictory expert witnesses can offer testimony that is reliable and helpful,both are admissible and it is the function of the finder of fact,not the trial court,to determine which is the more trustworthy and credible.citation and alterations omitted.here,the jurors were presented with competing expert testimony about the propriety of the accounting treatment,and they were at liberty to choose which testimony they found more credible.
moreover,technical compliance with gaap does not preclude a finding that an accounting treatment was a material misrepresentation.see,united states sarno,cir adherence to gaap would obviously qualify as weighty exculpatory evidence it does not,however,necessarily shield one from liability.citing united states weiner,cir monroe hughes,cir same.regardless of whether gateway accounting treatment of the lockheed transaction technically complied with gaap,there was evidence to support a finding that booking the transaction as revenue was nonetheless materially misleading to investors.the sec proffered the testimony of other witnesses at trial who claimed that it was unreasonable to record the transaction as revenue.for example,mclaughlin,a partner from pwc,testified that there was no basis to record a sale of fixed assets as revenue in gaap.foote,a pwc manager,testified that she was surprised,shocked that the transaction was recorded as revenue.manza himself,while stating that he eventually grew comfortable with the idea,also testified that if he were cfo,he would not have recognized the transaction as revenue generating.other gateway employees bird,head of gateway consumer division richard,a gateway manager and paustian,a gateway cpa all testified that they would not have recognized the proceeds of the lockheed transaction as revenue.collectively,this testimony constitutes substantial evidence that the jury was entitled to credit in reaching its verdict.see united states reyes,cir holding that the witnesses cumulative testimony,viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution,was sufficient to support the jury finding of material omissions and misstatements citing united states gonzalez torres,cir.
furthermore,evidence was also introduced showing that gateway internal policies,which had been disclosed to investors,were violated.for example,there was evidence that booking the lockheed transaction as revenue was contrary to gateway accounting policy of recording sales as gains or losses,rather than as revenue.gateway accounting policy for fixed assets was stated in its form k report,and neither todd nor manza disclosed a change to that policy in gateway q report.for these reasons,we conclude that the jury relied on substantial evidence in finding a material misrepresentation concerning improper and misleading accounting for the lockheed transaction.
the district court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish scienter as to todd and manza because pwc was informed of the unusual lockheed transaction.however,evidence was introduced showing that todd instructed manza not to tell pwc that gateway had recognized the million as revenue after manza had voiced concerns that the auditors would go for it and that todd and manza did not tell pwc that gateway had already recognized the million as revenue when they informed pwc of the lockheed transaction or seek an opinion from pwc concerning whether the lockheed transaction could properly be booked as revenue.thus,while pwc learned about the lockheed transaction in a timely manner,it only learned that the transaction had been treated as revenue component in january,after the numbers had been posted and reported in gateway q report.moreover,once it learned about how gateway had treated the lockheed transaction,pwc did not go for it,and gateway ultimately restated the transaction.
a jury could reasonably find that todd and manza actions delayed pwc discovery that million had been recorded as revenue until after the release of the numbers,and that the failure to disclose the accounting treatment in the fall of for this unusual transaction was a significant departure from the standards of ordinary care and presented a danger of misleading buyers and sellers as to gateway actual financial status.considering the foregoing evidence,we conclude that there was substantial evidence for the jury to find at least recklessness,and therefore scienter,on the part of todd and manza.
b.the venserv transaction 
the parties now agree that revenue from the venserv transaction was improperly recognized in the third quarter of.because gateway sale of computers to venserv was incomplete,it was improper to record the million in revenue for the sale.the issue before us on appeal is whether there was substantial evidence to permit a jury to find that todd acted with scienter when the transaction was improperly recorded.we conclude that there was.
generally,a gaap violation is insufficient,without more,to support a finding of scienter.in re software toolworks,cir see also in re daou,cir w hile scienter can not be established by publishing inaccurate accounting figures,even when in violation of gaap,significant violations of gaap standards can provide evidence of scienter.citation omitted.
here,there is additional evidence in the record that todd understood that the venserv transaction was not a complete sale,and therefore acted recklessly by improperly recording revenue that they knew was not yet realized.todd knew the terms of the venserv agreement and that it was not yet a complete sale.the referral agreement outlined the terms of the transaction,and specified that the sale would be considered incomplete until a sufficient number of customers were referred to venserv by gateway.even though todd did not directly admit at trial that he signed the referral agreement,he acknowledged that the signature on the referral agreement could have been his,and the jury was able to compare the signature on the referral agreement with other examples of his signature in order to determine that he signed the agreement.see,united states.jenkins,cir.the jury could also reasonably conclude that todd knew and agreed with the terms of the referral agreement.
indeed,evidence was introduced showing that todd knew that gateway was obligated to refer customers to venserv.
other evidence suggested that todd knew that the venserv sale was not complete.he was informed that,to fill a gateway order,gateway had removed computers allegedly sold to venserv from a separated area of gateway warehouse used to store venserv purchases.he also approved the immediate booking of the revenue from the venserv sale even though venserv was given a extension to pay for the computers.because there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that todd knew that the venserv sale was incomplete,but was nevertheless included in gateway quarterly revenue,the jury could properly infer at least recklessness on todd part.accordingly,we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that todd acted with scienter as to the improper treatment of the venserv transaction.
ii.todd and manza rule liability for improper reporting to accountants 
the sec contends that todd and manza violated rule by signing and submitting to pwc the management representation letter for the third quarter of,which falsely stated that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap.
rule a provides that n o director or officer of an issuer shall,directly or indirectly m ake or cause to be made a materially false or misleading statement to an accountant.to be liable,one must knowingly make false statements.united states goyal,cir l iability under rule requires that a false statement to an auditor be made knowingly.knowledge requires that the defendant was aware of the falsification and did not falsify through ignorance,mistake,or accident.id.at quoting reyes,at.
the trial court granted todd and manza motions for judgment as a matter of law on the rule claim because it concluded that neither todd nor manza knew that the management representation letter to pwc that they signed was false.
the sec urges us to find that the district court impermissibly grafted a scienter requirement onto the rule by requiring todd and manza to know that they were falsely signing the management representation letter.the district court properly applied a knowing standard,which the sec fails to distinguish from intent to mislead.see,united states watkins,cir explaining that mere knowledge of falsity does not suffice to prove intent to mislead.the sec acknowledges that the rule does not create a strict liability regime.rather,the sec seeks to impose a standard closer to negligence or reasonableness.however,we can not relax the standard from the statutory command,as it would impose liability on a broader range of conduct than congress intended.see goyal,at n.accordingly,while we acknowledge that the district court applied the appropriate rule the requirement that the defendants knowingly submit false reports we disagree with the district court application of the rule to the facts of this case.there is sufficient evidence that todd and manza had scienter with respect to the section b violations,and therefore knew that the management representation letter they signed was false,in violation of rule.therefore,we reverse as to this claim.
iii.weitzen motion for summary judgment 
the sec contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of weitzen because there were genuine issues of material facts as to weitzen direct liability under section b and rule the court applied the wrong legal standard for determining control person liability under section a and the court erred in applying rule.
a.the section b and rule claims for securities fraud 
the sec contends that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether weitzen misrepresented gateway revenue growth in the third quarter of as accelerated.the sec argues that weitzen failed to publicly disclose in an analysts conference call and an earnings press report that gateway ability to meet analysts revenue growth expectations was based largely on the lockheed and aol transactions.only the material misrepresentation and scienter elements of the sec claim are in dispute in this appeal.we agree with the sec that there are genuine issues of material fact,precluding summary judgment,as to these elements.
material misrepresentations 
the sec contends that weitzen made material misrepresentations in the conference call with analysts and the earnings press report by characterizing gateway growth as accelerated,when the reality was that gateway only met financial analysts expectations because of the lockheed and aol transactions the lockheed transaction resulted in gateway booking million in revenue from the sale of,branded computers and servers to lockheed.the aol transaction resulted in a revenue increase of million to gateway based on a change in the way aol paid fees to gateway.
generally,whether a public statement is misleading,or whether adverse facts were adequately disclosed is a mixed question to be decided by the trier of fact.fecht price,cir see also durning first boston,cir stating that adequacy of disclosure is normally a jury question.accordingly,resolving an issue as a matter of law is only appropriate when the adequacy of the disclosure is so obvious that reasonable minds could not differ.durning,at accord tsc,northway.
information regarding a company financial condition is material to investment.reyes,at citing sec murphy,cir surely the materiality of information relating to financial condition,solvency and profitability is not subject to serious challenge.moreover,how officers and directors of a public corporation describe revenue growth to investors is important.see ronconi larkin,cir.we have explained,
the statement that sales growth was accelerating,is material and descriptive of historical fact,rather than forward looking.the statement that growth is accelerating means that a graph of sales against time shows a concave line.prospective investors deciding whether a business is doing well look at whether sales revenue is flat,increasing,or declining,and if it is increasing or declining,whether the change appears to be accelerating or flattening out.sales that are not only growing,but growing faster and faster,matter to an investor.
id.at see also united states ebbers,cir holding that a gap closing program that included as revenue several new largely items not previously counted in revenue,violated section b because investors would not have been alerted to the fact that revenue as previously calculated was actually down.
here,a rational trier of fact could find that weitzen misled investors by publicly describing gateway growth as accelerated without simultaneously disclosing the unusual nature of the lockheed and aol transactions.there is evidence in the record showing that weitzen participated in the gap filling program that led to the two transactions.weitzen testified that he understood where the individual business units were and what they were going to try to do to close the gaps.these two gap fillers were unusual sources of revenue for gateway.the lockheed transaction was unusual because it was a sale of fixed assets,whereas gateway mainly sold computers to consumers from its inventory.the aol revenue was also atypical because it was from a advanced payment based on a change in the terms of the contract between gateway and aol.
the record further demonstrates that weitzen understood that the transactions were significant and that the revenue gap would not have been closed without them.weitzen testified that he understood that the lockheed transaction,which was cash neutral to lockheed,involved an unusually large sale of it hardware,and that he was not aware of any large inventory sales at the end of the quarter that were used for gap filling.weitzen also thanked aol president who acknowledged that the revised aol contract deal would allow gateway to take top line rev enues for providing gateway with favorable accounting treatment.it helping us.viewed in the light most favorable to the sec,a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer from these facts that the two unusual transactions were the primary reason why gateway met analysts expectations,and that they did not fall within gateway traditional core business model of selling to consumers.
despite his understanding of the true nature of the lockheed and aol transactions,however,weitzen publicly stated in the conference call with analysts that gateway was experiencing accelerating revenue growth and further explained that gateway growth in,compared to,demonstrated that w e had acceleration of revenue growth.weitzen also substantially participated in preparing gateway press release for the third quarter of,which claimed that gateway had accelerated revenue growth.weitzen contrasted gateway financial success with the rest of the industry,which was facing troubling news.gateway purported success was at least impliedly attributed to gateway strong growth in sales to consumers,small business sales,and the strategy,all of which were emphasized in public statements.however,weitzen did not disclose that but for the unusual and large lockheed and aol transactions,gateway would not have met analysts revenue expectations,and would have been experiencing the same troubling news as others in the business.
the fact that gateway would not have met analysts expectations without booking the unusual lockheed and aol transactions as revenue could lead a reasonable juror to find that gateway revenue was not growing faster and faster as a characteristic of accelerated growth.if gateway had not met analysts expectations or weitzen had disclosed the true source of the revenue,the investing public would have been alerted to the lesser rate of growth for gateway traditional sources of revenue.under the circumstances,a rational trier of fact could conclude that weitzen omitted material information regarding the lockheed and aol transactions,which misled investors into believing that gateway was experiencing a higher rate of growth based on its public business model than it was achieving in fact.
based on the foregoing facts,a rational juror could conclude that weitzen acted at least recklessly when he did not disclose the unusual sources of revenue that enabled gateway to meet analysts revenue expectations.the record suggests that weitzen knew that the lockheed and aol transactions were unusual,events used to meet the quarterly revenue targets.the record further demonstrates that weitzen understood that without the lockheed and aol transactions,gateway would not meet the analysts quarterly expectations.this is sufficient to create an issue of fact as to whether weitzen at least acted recklessly and thus with scienter when he claimed that gateway financial growth was accelerated.
accordingly,we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether weitzen made material misrepresentations when he stated in a press release and in a conference call with analysts that gateway was achieving accelerated growth while failing to disclose the unusual,significant sources of the revenue derived from the lockheed and aol transactions,and whether weitzen acted with scienter.thus,summary judgment was inappropriate on the section b and rule claims.
b.the section a claim for control person liability 
the sec asserts that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether weitzen was a control person for purposes of finding liability under section a of the act,a.it also maintains that the district court erred in ruling that weitzen met his burden of establishing a goodfaith defense of relying on others,and that he did not induce fraud when he reported misleading information about gateway financial condition.we agree.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning weitzen control over gateway.moreover,because weitzen substantially participated in the preparation of the press release,his knowledge that he misrepresented the nature of the transactions vitiates his defense at the summary judgment stage of this litigation.
the act provide
