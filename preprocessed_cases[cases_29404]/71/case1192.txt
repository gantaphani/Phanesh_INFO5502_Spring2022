after a steel manufacturer sought bankruptcy protection,an investor charged that company fraud deceived him into than securities.for purposes of distribution priority,the bankruptcy code subordinates claims arising from the purchase or sale of a debtor security.this language,courts have universally held,covers claims alleging fraud in the inducement to purchase or sell such a security.in this appeal,we are confronted with the question whether it also reaches claims alleging fraud in the retention of a security.we conclude that it does 
background 
the undisputed facts are set out in the published decision of the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel.see allen geneva steel in re geneva steel.we restate only the relevant points here.
in,geneva steel company filed a petition in bankruptcy court seeking to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the petition listed,among other debt,two public bond issues,the first issue coming due in,the second in.under the terms of geneva proposed reorganization plan,all bondholders,regardless of the maturity date of their bonds,were grouped into a single class.each member of the class would receive common stock in the reorganized company.classes subordinate to the bondholders would receive nothing.
a trustee for each of the two bond issues submitted proofs of claim for the bondholders,including richard allen,who held notes due in.allen,on his own initiative,filed a proof of claim,alleging that company fraud caused him to retain his debt securities.accompanying his proof of claim was a letter from allen to geneva chief executive officer.it stated that he had retained his notes,much to his detriment,because company officials remained silent in the face of growing financial difficulties.
geneva moved to disallow allen claim as redundant to the claim filed on his behalf by the trustee.allen objected,asserting that his claim rested on principles of fraud,not upon his ownership of the bonds.the bankruptcy court ruled that to the extent allen claim is based on his bonds,it duplicates the trustee claim and is therefore disallowed and to the extent it is based on fraud,it is subordinate to the claims of both bondholders and general goods and services creditors,since it is a claim,under section b of the code,for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security.b.
geneva later amended its reorganization plan to create a new class of creditors those whose claims were subordinated pursuant to section of the code.claims in this category,which include only allen,receive no distributions.
the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed the bankruptcy trial court ruling,and allen appeals.the order subordinating his claim is a final order.see adelman fourth bank trust,in re durability,cir.we exercise jurisdiction under d.
ii.history and policy behind section b 
early treatment of investor claims in bankruptcy 
in adopting section b congress did not write on a clean slate.kenneth davis,the status of defrauded securityholders in corporate bankruptcy,duke.american and british courts have struggled for more than a century to referee battles between a bankrupt creditors and its defrauded investors.id.early cases in both countries tended to side with the creditors,supported by the theory that a company capital reserves represented a trust fund for payment of corporate debts.id.at.by the early,courts began questioning the trust fund theory in favor of one that focused more narrowly on creditor reliance.under this view,only creditors who could show actual reliance on a particular shareholder contribution warranted a superior claim to the capital invested by that shareholder.id.at.by the,american courts routinely allowed investors to rescind their equity purchases,allowing investors not only to litigate their fraud claims but arming them,as well,with various procedural devices to ensure that creditors could not move ahead in the distribution line.id.at.
b.the oppenheimer decision and its criticism 
in,the united states supreme court put its weight behind the rule allowing investor participation on a par with general creditors.called upon to review the liquidation of a bank,which had fallen into receivership,the lower court had rejected a shareholder rescission claim.it ruled that the shareholder could not receive any distribution until after all creditors were paid in full.the supreme court reversed,finding no statutory basis to support the appellate court priority scheme hence the court refused to subordinate the shareholder claim.oppenheimer harriman bank trust.
although oppenheimer was not,strictly speaking,a bankruptcy case,the high court subsequently declined to review two cases challenging whether its ruling applied in bankruptcy.see robert stark,reexamining the subordination of investor fraud claims in bankruptcy a critical study of in re granite partners,am,discussing oppenheimer and the court refusal to decide whether its principle extended to bankruptcy cases.for their part,lower courts relied on oppenheimer in continuing to treat defrauded investors in bankruptcy cases no differently from general creditors.id.at discussing cases.
this tropism toward shareholder participation came to a dramatic halt in with the release of a report authored by the commission on the bankruptcy laws,a blue ribbon panel created by congress to recommend comprehensive changes to the bankruptcy code.see davis,duke at.the commission report in turn embraced an influential article written by law professors john slain and homer kripke.see john slain homer kripke,the interface between securities regulation and the risk of illegal securities issuance between securityholders and the issuer creditors.
slain and kripke criticized the favorable treatment that bankruptcy courts were extending to shareholder fraud claims.their argument rested on the bargain and reliance interests formed by creditors and.they pointed out that allowing to become effectively treating these two classes as though they were investors the best of both worlds a claim to the upside in the event the company prospers and participation with creditors if it fails.it also dilutes the capital reserves available to repay general creditors,who rely on investment equity for satisfaction of their claims.giving shareholder claims the same priority as creditor claims,reasoned slain and kripke,eliminates this safety cushion.id.at see also stark,am.at discussing the position.
c.the enactment of section b 
in enacting the bankruptcy code of,congress found the slain and kripke position compelling.as the report accompanying the house version of the bill noted,congress generally adopt ed the position tailoring section b in a manner that it considered administratively more workable,at,reprinted in.its intent was to subordinate in priority of distribution rescission claims to all claims that are senior to the claim or interest on which the rescission claims are based,reprinted in.
effective november,the bankruptcy reform act inserted the subordination principle first articulated by slain and kripke into bankruptcy law.the language of the statute,altered only slightly since its enactment,reads 
for the purpose of distribution under this title,a claim arising from rescission of a purchase or sale of a security of the debtor or of an affiliate of the debtor,for damages arising from the purchase or sale of such a security,or for reimbursement or contribution allowed under section on account of such a claim,shall be subordinated to all claims or interests that are senior to or equal the claim or interest represented by such security,except that if such security is common stock,such claim has the same priority as common stock.
iii.interpreting the language of the statute 
thus,if a claim usually alleging some sort of fraud or similar injury falls within the reach of the statute,it is treated on an inferior or equal basis with the security from which the claim arose.that is,a fraud claim arising from the purchase or sale of a security is treated not as a general unsecured claim but rather as a claim below or equivalent to the rights afforded by the underlying security.see stark,am.at explaining operation of statute.in,congress amended the statute to make clear that fraud claims springing from the purchase or sale of common stock are treated on the same level as common stock.all other claims are subordinated to their underlying security.this adverse treatment carries serious implications for investors,because a chapter reorganization plan,as is the case here,may deny distributions to entire classes of inferior security interests.id.
joining three separate,dependent clauses,the statute subordinates three types of claims an actual attempt to rescind a purchase or sale of a security issued by the debtor or one of its affiliates a claim for damages arising from a purchase or sale of such a security and a claim for reimbursement or contribution for a purchase or sale of such a security under section of the code.
the parties agree that allen bonds are securities within the meaning of section b.they further agree that his claim is neither an effort to rescind the purchase of his securities nor to seek reimbursement or contribution for their purchase.they dispute only whether his proof of claim falls within the second category of subordinated it is a claim for damages arising from the purchase or sale of a security.id.to resolve this dispute,we must decide whether fraud that causes an investor to hold rather than sell his securities arises from the purchase or sale of those securities.
rules of statutory construction 
we begin,as we do any instance of statutory construction,with the language of the statute.yankee atomic.land,cir.a statute clear and unambiguous on its face must be interpreted according to its plain meaning.id.an a mbiguity exists when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.norman singer,statutes and statutory construction,at ed.if a statute is ambiguous,a court may seek guidance from congress intent,a task aided by reviewing the legislative history.united states simmonds,cir.ambiguous text can also be decoded by knowing the purpose behind the statute.singer,statutes and statutory construction,at.
b.the language of section b is ambiguous 
although allen and geneva each claim that the language of section b is plain and unambiguous,they nonetheless arrive at starkly different interpretations.arguing for a narrow construction,allen says that the phrase arising from the purchase or sale of such a security refers back to the first clause of the statute,which speaks of rescinding the purchase or sale of the debtor security.he insists that the simplest and least strained means of interpreting the statute is to require a direct nexus to what he calls the original purchase or sale of the security.aplt br.at.by contrast,geneva interprets the statute more broadly,pointing out that allen damages,assuming he was defrauded,can only be measured by establishing the price at which he could have sold geneva bonds had he been given accurate information.unavoidably,then,his damages are causally connected to his purchase and sale of the debt securities.appellee br.at.
we conclude,at least with respect to fraudulent retention claims like allen,that the language of section b is ambiguous.in reaching this conclusion,we rely on the acute and thorough analysis provided by the bankruptcy court in in re granite partners.
a hedge fund seeking chapter protection,debtor granite partners,through its trustee,moved to subordinate various investors fraud claims under section b.the investors charged that they were deceived into retaining their investments by the debtors fraud.they claimed that because their fraudulent retention claims alleged independent torts,the claims did not arise from the purchase or sale of the debtor securities and therefore should be treated as general unsecured claims.id.at.
the bankruptcy court agreed with the investors contention that the phrase arising from requires some causal connection between the initial security purchase or sale and the fraud.id.at.but,suggested the court,that such a causal connection is required does little to shed light on the disputed statutory language,which lends itself to two different interpretations,both of them reasonable 
a literal reading implies that the injury must flow from the actual purchase or sale a broader reading suggests that the purchase or sale must be part of the causal link although the injury may flow from a subsequent event.since the fraudulent maintenance claim can not exist without the initial purchase,the purchase is a causal link.
id.in the opinion of that court,such an interpretive condition defines ambiguity reasonably persons,said the court,could interpret section b in either the broad or narrow sense,and hence,the section is ambiguous.id.
we agree.we can not discern the scope of section b by examining only the text of the statute.
legislative history 
the legislative history behind section b is helpful but not dispositive.on the one hand,as we mentioned above,it is clear that congress embraced professors slain and kripke theory of risk allocation,namely,that general creditors assume a different type of risk with respect to the debtor insolvency than do investors.and not only are general creditors unable to share in the potential benefits flowing from company success,they rely on the equity cushion created by the investors capital contributions for payment.while slain and kripke focused primarily on shareholder rescission claims,their larger concerns sprang from what they termed the disaffected stockholder efforts to recapture his investment from the corporation.slain and kripke.at,quoted in re granite partners,at.
on the other hand,it is equally true that neither congress nor slain and kripke discussed or even mentioned fraudulent retention claims.at least one commentator speculates,moreover,that the term rescission claims,which appears in both the statute and its legislative history,reflects congress use of a shorthand reference to both rescission and damage claims based on fraud in the inducement.stark,am.at.this commentator argues that the lack of any reference to fraud in the retention was not oversight congress,he says,simply held a narrow vision of the problem it sought to address when it drafted and voted on section b,a vision that suggests it had no intent of subordinating fraudulent retention claims.id.at.were it otherwise,he adds,congress could easily have drafted the statute to subordinate all investor fraud claims,including fraud in the retention claims,if that was congress intent.id.at.
we do not share the certitude by which this commentator views the legislative history.like the text of the statute itself,we believe that it is indeterminate and indeed susceptible to opposing interpretations.
policy objectives 
it is here,in examining the statute purposes and objectives within the larger context of bankruptcy law,that we find the most compelling reasons for subordinating allen retention claim.again we rest heavily on the reasoning set out in granite partners.that court seized on what for investors is the unfortunate reality behind section b its language,its legislative history,and most important,its embodied legislative policy choices,reflect strong congressional disapproval of investor fraud claims in bankruptcy.with that principle firmly in mind,granite partners found no good reason to distinguish fraudulent inducement claims from fraudulent retention claims.nor do we.put simply,creditors stand ahead of the investors on the receiving line.in re granite partners,at 
two separate but related policy reasons convinced the granite partners court to treat retention claims no differently than inducement claims 
first,from the creditors point of view,it does not matter whether the investors initially buy or subsequently hold on to their investments as a result of fraud.in either case,the enterprise balance sheet looks the same,and the creditors continue to rely on the equity cushion of the investment.
second,a fraudulent retention claim involves a risk that only the investors should shoulder.in essence,the claim involves the wrongful manipulation of the information needed to make an investment decisi
