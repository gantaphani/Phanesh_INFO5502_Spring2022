ii.background 
rubin created the trust on february,and named himself as trustee.the principal asset of the trust was percent ownership of stock in brown wholesale electric.rubin had two sons,brown and ross,both of whom worked for brown wholesale electric.brown and ross were also officers,directors,and minority shareholders of brown wholesale electric.over time,rubin executed amendments to the trust.the ninth amendment dated march,gave percent of the stock to brown and percent to ross.in the tenth amendment dated october,to the trust,rubin reduced brown gift to percent of the stock and increased ross gift to percent of the stock.ross is the sole residuary beneficiary of the trust.
paragraph of the tenth amendment to the trust provides in part specific gifts as soon as administratively possible following the death of trustor,trustee shall distribute the following gifts c trustor interest in ownership of the preferred and common stock of brown wholesale electric company shall be allocated and distributed outright to trustor two sons,with ten percent thereof allocated and distributed to lorrin brown,and ninety percent thereof allocated and distributed to ross brown.in the event either such beneficiary shall not survive to the date of distribution,such beneficiary share shall be added to the residue of the trust estate and distributed pursuant to paragraph below.
on july,ross filed a petition for the appointment of a conservator of the person and estate of rubin.on september,labow was appointed conservator of rubin person and estate.on october,labow filed a petition to have herself appointed as successor trustee.labow asserted that rubin could no longer serve as trustee and the named successor trustees declined to accept the appointment.the october,petition alleged rubin is unable to handle his own personal care and his own financial affairs and can not act in any fiduciary capacity.the trust assets consisted of rubin residence and his shares in brown wholesale electric the value of the entire corporation was in excess of million and no bond was required because there were no cash or other liquid assets.labow requested,in lieu of bond the court order that said stock shall not be assigned,transferred,alienated,or encumbered without a court order and that a legend describing such restriction be prominently imprinted on the certificates evidencing such stock held by the trust.in a supplemental petition filed november,labow advised the court that the successor trustees,benjamin felton and first interstate bank,refused to serve due to substantial litigation over the conservatorship,as well as assets of the living trust which had been designated as charitable remainder trusts by rubin.on december,the probate court appointed labow as the successor trustee of the trust as restated in the ninth amendment dated march.the december,order provides that labow is not required to file a bond the stock could not be transferred without a prior court order and a legend stating the restriction should appear on the stock.
on january,labow filed a first account current and report of successor trustee.labow also requested the settlement of accounts and payment of fees an increase in bond to a release and substitution of surety and for the authority to make interim monthly payments to trustee.labow reported the trust had income of during the reporting period the charitable remainder trust litigation had been settled and approved by the probate court the business of which the conservatee,rubin,owned percent of the stock was subsequently sold for million and the payments were made to the conservatorship estate and then transferred to the trust.according to labow account and report as trustee,the interest of the stock in brown wholesale electric company owned by the within trust and recovered for the benefit of the trust and trustor has been valued at,which represents the value after the sale of the assets,the payment of corporate debts,and the receipt of liquidating dividends.on march,the probate court issued an order settling the first account current and report of labow and granting the petition as requested.
on april,ross and brown filed an ex parte application to instruct labow to distribute the sums of and to them respectively once in and again in if their father,rubin,was still alive.the application was based on evidence that rubin assets in the trust were valued in excess of million and gifts had been made to others including evelyn joseph,his long time companion.the brothers argued that their father valued transfer of the assets and the distribution would be consistent with his wishes.they also argued that labow did not oppose the distribution.labow declared a gift of the to rubin niece,sandy wolf,had already been made rubin living expenses are less than his annual income and would remain constant for the rest of his life and there were sufficient assets in the trust to satisfy the gifts to joseph.on april,the probate court instructed the trustee to make the and distributions to ross and brown.
on november,brown filed an amended petition to set aside the tenth amendment to the rubin brown living trust for determination of nonademption of a specific gift of stock under the trust and for removal of labow as successor trustee.on the first day of trial,brown abandoned his challenge to the validity of the tenth amendment to the trust.the november,amended petition alleged that rubin died on november.the amended petition further alleged brown was a beneficiary of a specific gift of the trust originally dated february,and restated on march,rubin executed a tenth amendment to the trust on october,the eleventh amendment to the trust on january,and the twelfth amendment to the trust on april,rubin was declared incapacitated and under a conservatorship of his person and estate from july,until his death and as a result of his incapacity,the eleventh and twelfth amendments to the trust were revoked by court order on november.it was alleged that the main asset of the trust was the stock of brown wholesale electric which was sold by the conservator and successor trustee,labow,in january.on january,labow while acting as secretary of brown wholesale electric with ross acting as president executed a certificate of election to wind up and dissolve the corporation.a fourth account filed with the probate court on november,valued the trust assets at million.brown contended that sale of the stock changed the intent of the ninth amendment to the trust which gifted percent of the stock to brown wholesale electric stock to him.citing probate code section and estate of packham d,brown asserted that there had not been an ademption of the specific gift of stock to him which occurred during the conservatorship.
brown also requested that labow be removed as trustee.brown argued that labow violated her duties to avoid conflict and to deal impartially with the beneficiaries of the trust.brown contended labow violated the loyalty duty by violating the december,order not to sell the stock without prior permission of the probate order labow had decimated the specific stock gift to him labow reallocated millions of dollars to ross,the remainder beneficiary as a minority shareholder he was not afforded the opportunity to oppose the liquidation or the consequences to the shift of his specific gift to the remainder of the trust estate and that labow be surcharged.
labow responded to brown amended petition as follows.labow argued that ross and joseph were major beneficiaries of the trust brown interest was comparably smaller being percent under the ninth amendment or percent under the tenth amendment and shares of stock in brown wholesale electric were owned by the trust and thus were under the management and control of the trustee.labow contended that she never sold the shares of stock of brown wholesale electric in any capacity including as conservator or as a successor trustee of the trust.labow asserted that the assets of brown wholesale electric were sold in pursuant to an agreement negotiated and approved by its board of directors.the board consisted of ross,brown,and ray sullivan.labow further contended that the asset sale of brown wholesale electric as opposed to a stock sale was at the direction and with his full knowledge.it bears emphasis in,rubin,was the subject of the september,probate conservatorship order.rubin was never declared competent prior to his death in november.four years after the assets were sold,brown wholesale electric was liquidated and dissolved.
labow contended that section does not apply to this case because the express language of the statute limited its application to sales by a conservator.according to labow,section is inapplicable because there was no sale her participation in the asset sale of brown wholesale electric was as the trustee of the trust and as a secondary officer of the corporation section does not apply to trusts the statutes in section et and specifically,section,have no application to trust law which has no provision on the subject the holding of estate of packham,supra,d at page.predates california conformity to the uniform probate code and estate of packham only applies in cases where there is a guardianship.
labow asserted an ademption occurred because rubin,who objected to the conservatorship,clearly expressed an intent to sell brown wholesale electric and retire rubin had shown an intent to decrease brown interest in the stock of brown wholesale electric with the ninth and tenth amendments to the trust in favor of joseph by increasing her gift and ross by increasing his share of the stock and making him the sole residual beneficiary of the trust and the and distributions to ross and brown do not conclusively demonstrate an intent of nonademption but merely established the brothers failed disclose to the probate court the existence of the tenth amendment to the trust.
labow argued that she should not be removed as the trustee because she is a registered professional conservator and fiduciary.labow denied that she had breached her fiduciary duties under sections,or.labow asserted the trust was revocable pursuant to section,in her capacity as a trustee her sole duty was to benefit rubin as trustee,she impartially administered the trust in the best interests of all persons and preserved all trust property as trustee,she did not assign,transfer,alienate,or encumber the stock in brown wholesale electric but voted to sell the assets and dissolve the corporation brown participated as an officer,director,and shareholder in the sale of the corporation assets as trustee,labow recovered the value of the conservatee stock for the inter vivos trust as liquidating dividends as trustee,labow reported the sale and liquidation to the probate court in january the probate court approved the sale of assets and liquidation in march as trustee,labow did not violate any court order and reported her activities to the probate court which approved and confirmed her action and brown did not suffer any losses or damages requiring a surcharge.
on june,the probate court issued an order quashing the acceptance by brown of ross code of civil procedure section statutory compromise offer.the circumstances of this controversy arose after ross and joseph,jointly served brown with a statutory compromise offer on march.the offer provided for a payment free of estate taxes in consideration for a dismissal with prejudice of all petitions,including actions against labow a stipulation as to the validity of the tenth amendment to the trust and the ademption of the specific gift of stock a full release of all parties and their attorneys from liability and each party bearing its own costs and fees.the statutory settlement offer was set to expire on march.according to william holcomb,counsel for ross,katerina smith,brown attorney,made certain oral counter proposals.holcomb declared that,on march and,he spoke to smith by telephone.holcomb advised smith that ross would not accept the.holcomb further declared that he spoke with smith twice by telephone on march,for almost an hour.during those conversations,holcomb advised smith that ross no longer agreed to the terms contained in the statutory settlement offer.holcomb explained that the statutory settlement offer was void.holcomb advised smith that ross would only settle the lawsuit if brown agreed to a global settlement containing new terms which were not in the statutory offer.smith agreed to talk to brown.on april,brown sent a written acceptance of the offer by letter to holcomb,which had been filed with the court.on april,ross filed an ex parte application to quash acceptance of the offer.the probate court granted ross motion to quash the acceptance of the statutory settlement offer on may.on june,brown filed a mandate petition challenging the probate court may,order.the petition was denied on june.brown superior court june,nonpub.order.
labow testified that,after she was appointed conservator,rubin remained incompetent until his death.labow believed rubin was not competent to handle his financial affairs.labow testified that she and rubin had a conversation where he affirmed his desire to sell the business so he could enjoy life.according to labow,rubin told her that the desire to sell had existed prior to the institution of the conservatorship.rubin also told labow the plan to sell had been started prior to the sale.labow believed rubin maintained the capacity to be able to tell her an overall direction in terms of the business.labow did not differ with rubin on the sale because it seemed logical.in response to a deposition question concerning the eleventh and twelfth amendments to the trust which the trustee sought to set aside,labow testified that she did not consult rubin about the amendments.according to labow without being rude to rubin,you do ask the loon whether you should do something.i had already come to the conclusion that rubin did know what he was doing.labow also testified at her deposition that when she voted the shares of trust concerning the election to wind up and dissolve brown wholesale electric,she was acting as the conservator and not the trustee.labow testified that she did not recall whether she was the trustee in january.labow testified i mean to be honest i do differentiate greatly between my role as conservator and my role as trustee at trial,labow testified that she voted the shares as the trustee because she would not have had the right to do so as the conservator.labow understood her duties were to carry out rubin intent as expressed in the original trust and as amended by the ninth and tenth amendments.
ross testified that he has been an inactive member of the state bar since.in,ross managed the three hawaii branches of brown wholesale electric.in,sometime after rubin had a stroke,ross returned from hawaii.ross became concerned that rubin was making decisions which were not in the best interests of brown wholesale electric.brown wholesale electric was rubin number one priority.rubin questionable decisions caused ross to file the petition to institute a conservatorship.ross served as conservator until labow was appointed in that capacity.nothing occurred after the petition was filed to change ross opinion as to the propriety of instituting conservatorship proceedings.the conservatorship remained in place until rubin death.after the conservatorship was in place,ross was the president and chief executive office and a minority shareholder of brown wholesale electric.ross continued to run brown wholesale electric at labow request after she was appointed conservator.although ross was a board member,he never attended any board meetings.this was because there were never any board meetings to attend.the corporate minutes reflect that in,rubin was authorized to sell brown wholesale electric.ross signed the minutes but did not remember that if had done so.ross did not know what rubin intentions were prior to july,the date the conservator petition was filed,about selling brown wholesale electric.in july,ross obtained information from a third party that rubin was about to sell brown wholesale electric or buy another business.when deposed,ross testified that rubin had been considering selling brown wholesale electric.when asked the basis for his deposition testimony,ross testified,what the attorney told me.immediately after his deposition testimony was read at trial,ross was asked,so the only basis for your knowledge then in that regard of what your father wanted to do is something an attorney told you right ross responded,only in the case of selling the business.
after the conservatorship was in place,ross and rubin had discussions about selling brown wholesale electric.rubin wanted ross to sell brown wholesale electric so that rubin could enjoy the fruits of his labor.rubin did not tell ross to sell the assets of brown wholesale electric as opposed to selling the stock or any variation of such a potential transaction.ross did not learn about the tenth amendment to the trust until the present litigation commenced in.however,ross admitted that he signed a declaration in february.ross declaration admitted that the tenth amendment to the trust called for a specific percent stock gift to brown.ross stated that rubin never discussed anything about the trust.nor did rubin discuss any personal matters with ross.
the terms of the asset sale of the corporation were negotiated by ross in.the buyers dictated the terms of the asset only sale.the sale took place in and the windup of brown wholesale electric was completed in or.according to ross,labow wore two hats,conservator and trustee.ross testified the decision to sell the business had nothing to do with the conservatorship.it had to do with the trusteeship because that was the thing my dad wanted,to sell the business.and so i agreed to sell the business because that what my dad wanted.
c.the probate court decision 
in the statement of decision,the probate court found that the tenth amendment was a valid document.the probate court ruled the stock gifts were adeemed.the ademption occurred because there was a distribution after the corporation was dissolved and liquidated but before rubin death within the meaning of sections and.the probate court also ruled section does not apply to this case because labow did not participate in the sale of the assets of brown wholesale electric as a conservator the stock was not owned by rubin but was owned by the trust labow participated in the asset sale as a trustee and neither the uniform probate code nor the uniform trust code provide an exception to ademption caused by a trustee.
the probate court also found that labow had not breached a fiduciary duty as trustee and should not be removed labow duties as the trustee of a revocable trust were controlled by section and were owed solely to the conservatee,rubin labow acted reasonably and in good faith as a trustee,subd.b and labow actions were reasonable.as evidence of labow reasonableness,the probate court cited the asset sale,liquidation,and dissolution of the corporation was in compliance with california law brown signed the documents related to the transactions she was concerned with litigation over gifts which had been made to the university of california at los angeles under eleventh and twelfth amendments to the trust she needed money to resolve the litigation and to provide for rubin care during his lifetime and she consulted with managers and other professionals.the probate court also found pursuant to section labow did not have a duty as a conservator and could not be held liable for her failure to propose any actions pertaining to the doctrine of substituted judgment.
the probate court entered its order concurrently with the statement of decision.this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
introduction 
this case concerns the loss of a specific gift of stock to a beneficiary of a revocable trust after the trustor was declared incompetent.the primary asset of the trust was percent ownership of the stock of brown wholesale electric.the matter is more complicated because the loss of the gift resulted from an asset sale as opposed to a stock sale of a closely held corporation.the asset sale followed by a dissolution of the corporation as opposed to an outright stock sale resulted in the dissipation of the value of stock at the time of rubin death.it is undisputed that the stock was the primary asset of the conservatorship estate.labow was also appointed as successor trustee of the revocable trust after she had been appointed rubin conservator.labow,while acting as trustee and an officer and director of brown wholesale electric,participated in the asset sale,which resulted in the loss of stock value by the time of rubin death.although the issues were litigated in the probate court,in his briefs on appeal,brown has not asserted that labow should be removed as the trustee or she should be surcharged for any conduct.thus,any arguments in that regard have been waived.tiernan trustees of cal.state university colleges cal d,fn,johnston board of supervisors of marin county cal d,disapproved on another point in bailey county of los angeles cal d.
b.the ademption issue 
in estate of mason cal d,the california supreme court explained an ademption as follows ademption of a specific legacy is the extinction or withdrawal of a legacy in consequence of some act of the testator equivalent to its revocation,or clearly indicative of an intention to revoke.the ademption is effected by the extinction of the thing or fund bequeathed,or by a disposition of it subsequent to the will,which prevents its passing by the will,from which an intention that the legacy should fail is presumed.citations.see also estate of resler cal d,estate of creed d.section,subdivision a states,except as otherwise provided in this section,if after the execution of the instrument of gift specifically given property is sold or mortgaged by a conservator or by an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal,the transferee of the specific gift has the right to a general pecuniary gift equal to the net sale price of,or the amount of the unpaid loan on,the property.
labow,joseph,and ross contend that section is inapplicable to this case.their argument is as follows.in their view,section is only relevant only when there is a sale of the specific gift by a conservator but not a trustee.an ademption occurred in this case because there was no sale of stock by labow in her capacity as conservator rather,there was an asset sale by labow in her capacity as trustee of an intervivos trust.labow,joseph,and ross acknowledge section prohibits a conservator from causing an ademption.but they argue no comparable statutory trust provision prevents a trustee from causing an ademption of an incompetent person specific gift.for the reasons stated below,we disagree with the contention of labow,joseph,and ross no ademption occurred in that there was no sale by a conservator but merely an asset sale by a trustee.rather,we conclude that no ademption occurred in this case because there was only a change in form and there was no substantial evidence that rubin intended for the gift to brown to fail.our decision is premised on controlling california supreme court authority,estate of mason,supra,cal d at pages,and its progeny,which have not been statutorily abrogated.
we begin by analyzing california ademption law as it has developed since january.california decisional authority regarding ademption of specific gifts of incapacitated persons evolved in the context of adult guardianship proceedings.in,the legislation converted all adult guardianships into conservatorships.stats,ch,former.the rationale of the replacing adult guardianships with conservatorships was to reduce the stigma attached to elderly persons being labeled mentally incompetent who were in need of assistance in managing their personal and financial affairs.see union bank superior court th,d law with official comments june cal.law revision com.thus,we cite california case law which refers to adult guardians of incapacitated persons.
under california ademption law,the guardian or conservator of a person,who is not competent,can not cause an ademption of a specific gift when the incapacitated individual dies without regaining competency.estate of mason,supra,cal d at.in mason,mary mason devised her home to robert fairbank,her grandson.ibid.after making her will,mason became mentally incapacitated and a guardian,security pacific bank,was appointed.ibid.the guardian,with court approval,sold the home and kept the proceeds of the sale in a separate account which was then used to support the mason who remained incompetent until her death.ibid.the supreme court concluded,if the testator has disposed of the property and it can not be traced to any other property in the estate,there is an ademption.id.at.however,when the specific property has been disposed of by a guardian during a period of incapacitation from which the testator does not recover,there is no ademption of the specific property when the only change is in form.id.at.if the guardian of a mentally incapacitated person sells property subject to a testamentary instrument,the beneficiary will receive the proceeds of the sale in the absence of proof that the testator intended an ademption.id.at.the supreme court explained the rationale for this rule thusly the reasons for refusing to find an ademption upon the guardian sale are the incompetent testator lacks intent to adeem citation and the opportunity to avoid the effect of an ademption by making a new will.citations.a contrary rule would allow the guardian,by changing the form of guardianship property,to determine the distribution of the estate.citation.id.at.
this rule prohibiting ademption by the actions of a guardian of an incapacitated person is also illustrated in two of mason court of appeal opinions.the first opinion is estate of packham,supra,d at pages.in estate of packham,elisabeth packham devised an interest which she might own at the time of her death in a residence or a sum equal to the net proceeds of the sale of the home.id.at.the precise interest to be devised was described as follows in packham will,any interest in the residential real property known as amador avenue,atherton,california,which i may own at the time of my death,or a sum equal to the net proceeds of sale of any said interest occurring during the administration of my estate.ibid.a bank was appointed as packham guardian after she was found to be incapacitated.packham did not regain competency prior to her death.ibid.during the time packham was incapacitated,the guardian sold the residence,which sale was confirmed by the court.ibid.as a result,packham niece received neither the residence nor the proceeds from the sale.relying on mason,the court of appeal in packham held the guardian sale of the residence while packham was incapacitated did not result in an ademption.id.at.therefore,packham niece was entitled to the sale proceeds.
the second of mason decision,to discuss ademption of property of an incapacitated person is estate of ehrenfels d.in her will,camille ehrenfels,bequeathed a specific gift of standard oil stock as presently constituted to the beneficiaries with a provision that if the shares changed by splitting or otherwise,the legacies would be satisfied with the changed shares.id.at.after ehrenfels executed the will,the stock split.two years later,ehrenfels was found to be incapacitated and a guardian,virginia williams,was appointed.id.at.williams,with court approval,subsequently exchanged the split standard oil stock for shares in a mutual fund.id.at.ehrenfels,the testatrix,died without regaining competency.ibid.
in estate of ehrenfels,the court of appeal described the supreme court analysis in estate of mason,supra,cal d at page,thusly in mason,however,it was held that in the absence of proof that the testator intended an ademption,the sale of property specifically bequeathed in the testator will by the guardian of the estate of the testator during an incompetency from which the testator does not recover does not adeem the specific bequest.see also estate of packham,d.in mason the court was concerned with the manner of satisfying a specific bequest where the guardian had sold the specifically devised property and had consumed a substantial amount of the proceeds from this sale to support the incompetent testatrix until her death.under such a factual situation the supreme court concluded that the devisee of the specifically devised property was entitled to have his devise satisfied in full from the residue of the decedent estate.in re estate of ehrenfel,supra,d at.the court of appeal concluded the holding in the mason and packham cases to the effect that when the guardian of a mentally incompetent testator has sold property which is the subject of a specific gift in his ward will,the beneficiary is awarded the proceeds of the sale has been followed by cases in other jurisdictions.these cases were cited with approval in mason.citations.in re estate of ehrenfels,supra,d at.
in terms of the remedy available to a beneficiary of a bequest of property by an incapacitated person which has been sold,the court of appeal in estate of ehrenfels explained in mason the supreme court speaking of the ademption of a specific bequest noted that an ademption takes place when the specific property has been disposed of by the testator and can not be traced to other property in the estate.italics partly added.in page,wills boweparker,the authors,citing some of the cases in the other jurisdictions relied upon in mason,state that it is generally held in the united states that the sale,collection,and the like by the guardian does not adeem a specific devise or legacy and that the devisee or legatee takes the proceeds as far as they can be traced.italics added.it is apparent that mason does not prohibit the guardian of a person who has become incompetent after making his will from selling,exchanging or reinvesting,pursuant to lawful authority,property which is the subject of a specific devise or legacy under the will.while the guardian act in so doing does not adeem the specific devise or legacy it relegates the devisee or legatee to taking the proceeds of the sale as far as they can be traced.in re estate of ehrenfel,supra,d at.
no california cases have directly addressed the ademption issue when stock is bequeathed and the corporation is subsequently dissolved,which occurs after the testator becomes incapacitated.three out of state decisions that have addressed the similar issues have held that no ademption occurs upon dissolution of a corporation.mitchell mitchell,no guardianship but bequest of stock not adeemed by the dissolution of the corporation and continuance of enterprise as personal business where the testator interest remained substantially the same buder stocke,a guardian liquidation of corporation did not adeem bequest of stock owned solely by testator pope hinckley,no ademption where dissolution of new jersey corporation followed by formation of a connecticut corporation and testator rights in new entity dependent on rights in first company.no decision reaches the conclusion asserted by labow,joseph,and ross that an ademption occurs under circumstances similar to this case.
here,rubin executed a revocable trust giving a specific stock gift to brown.on or around november and january,after rubin was adjudicated to require the assistance of a conservator,the directors,the officers,the shareholders,and the successor trustee,labow,adopted resolutions approving the liquidation and dissolution of brown wholesale electric the sale of assets and re
