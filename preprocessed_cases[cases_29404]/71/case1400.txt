the people of the state of california,through relator the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights ftcr filed a quo warranto action against commissioner henry duque of the public utilities commission puc,contending duque must be removed from office pursuant to public utilities code section subdivision a,because he formerly held stock in a corporation that was regulated by the puc.the trial court agreed and ruled duque had forfeited his office.duque now appeals claiming the judgment must be reversed because section,subdivision a,is unconstitutional,and the statute,by its terms,did not apply to his conduct.we agree with the second of these arguments and reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on april,former governor pete wilson appointed duque a commissioner on the puc.the position is a constitutionally mandated office in december,governor wilson reappointed duque to a full term.his appointment was confirmed by the state senate.duque term of office ended on january.
while duque was a commissioner,his personal investment account was managed by his stockbroker,michael golub.golub made investment decisions for duque pursuant to a power of attorney without seeking input from duque.when duque became a commissioner,he told golub he could not own stock in companies that were regulated by the puc.
on may,golub purchased stock in nextel communications,a wireless communication carrier,and allocated shares to duque account.at the time of the purchase,duque believed that wireless carriers such as nextel were regulated by the federal communications commission fcc,and not by the puc.golub had a similar understanding.duque disclosed his ownership of the nextel stock in his and statements of economic interests.
in fact,while states are precluded from regulating the rates charged by wireless carriers,see,subd.c a other aspects of nextel business were and are regulated by the puc.three months after duque acquired his stock,nextel and all other phone companies in california filed a joint petition seeking an allocation of phone numbers in the area code.the puc,with duque voting in dissent,adopted an allocation plan.duque voted against the interests of nextel and the other petitioning parties.
in february,the puc noticed rulemaking proceedings to establish consumer protection rules applicable to telecommunication companies.the rules would apply to all communication companies,including nextel.
in march,the puc approved an interconnection agreement between pacific bell and nextel.the agreement was part of a larger consent item agenda that included several similar agreements.all the agreements were approved en masse.
on august,duque received a phone call from todd wallack,a reporter for the san francisco chronicle,who had reviewed duque statements of economic interests.wallack questioned duque ownership of nextel stock,asserting it was a regulated company whose stock duque was not permitted to own.duque contacted the general counsel of the puc to ask him whether nextel was regulated by the puc.the general counsel did not call back.
duque believed that wallack sounded knowledgeable.he decided to sell his stock because there was,at a minimum,a perception of conflict.on august,duque directed his stockbroker to sell his remaining nextel stock.duque earned almost as the result of his ownership of the stock.
on october,respondent ftcr sought permission from the california attorney general to file an action against duque.the attorney general granted permission in an opinion dated november.see.
in january,ftcr,acting in the name of the people of the state of california,filed a quo warranto action against duque under code of civil procedure section et.ftcr contended that duque had forfeited his office as a commissioner under section,subdivision a,because he formerly owned a prohibited financial interest in nextel.
in july,ftcr filed a motion for summary judgment arguing it was entitled to prevail as a matter of law.the judge hearing the motion denied it,ruling that section,subdivision a,does not provide for the removal from office of a c ommissioner for a voluntary acquisition of stock.however,the judge ruled nextel was in fact subject to regulation by the puc.
the case then proceeded to a court trial.at the conclusion of the trial,the court issued a statement of decision ruling duque had forfeited his office under section,subdivision a,because he had voluntarily owned stock in a company that was regulated by the puc.the court ruled specifically that duque had not been dishonest and that he had not acted in bad faith.instead,the court ruled that duque had shown poor judgment because he had not done everything,which can reasonably be expected of a public utility commissioner to do in order to avoid a conflict of interest.the court ordered duque to pay a fine,and ruled he must pay ftcr attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
this appeal followed.while the matter was being briefed,we granted duque petition for writ of supersedeas and stayed the court judgment pending our resolution of the appeal.
ii.discussion 
duque contends the judgment must be reversed because section,subdivision a is unconstitutional,and the section,by its terms,did not apply under the facts of this case.since we do not reach constitutional issues unless absolutely required to do so,santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,we turn to the second,and we believe,dispositive argument.
section,subdivision a,states a public utilities commissioner may not hold an official relation to nor have a financial interest in a person or corporation subject to regulation by the commission.if any commissioner acquires a financial interest in a corporation or person subject to regulation by the commission other than voluntarily,his or her office shall become vacant unless within a reasonable time he or she divests himself or herself of the interest.
our interpretation of this language is guided by well settled rules of construction.in construing a statute we ascertain the legislature intent in order to effectuate the law purpose,fair employment housing com.cal d.we must look to the statute words and give them their usual and ordinary meaning.dafonte,cal th,d.the statute plain meaning controls the court interpretation unless its words are ambiguous.kobzoff los angeles county medical center cal th,d.
the language used in section,subdivision a,is reasonably clear.the first sentence states that commissioners are precluded from owning an interest in any company that is subject to regulation by the puc.here,the trial court ruled,and the evidence fully supports the conclusion,that duque held an interest in a corporation that was regulated by the puc.it is undisputed that duque held nextel stock.nextel,as a wireless carrier,was and is subject to regulation by the puc.indeed,duque himself participated in a decision in which the puc asserted its right to regulate certain aspects of the wireless communication business.see in re mobile telephone service and wireless communications th.
the second sentence of section,subdivision a,then states that if a commissioner comes to possess an interest in a regulated company other than voluntarily or in other words involuntarily he or she must divest himself or herself of that interest within a reasonable time.if the commissioner fails to do so,his or her office shall become vacant.here the trial court held,and the parties both agree,that duque held his interest in nextel voluntarily.since the forfeiture language set forth in section,subdivision a,applies only when a commissioner acquires an interest in a regulated company other than voluntarily,the statute,by its terms,did not apply under the facts of this case.
this application of section,subdivision a,highlights a critical gap in the language of the statute.while section,subdivision a,states that commissioners may not possess an interest in a regulated company,and provides a remedy for the involuntary acquisition of such an interest,the statute does not describe what occurs when a commissioner voluntarily acquires an interest in a regulated company the pivotal issue presented here
