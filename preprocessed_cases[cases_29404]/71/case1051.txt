judith hatfield hatfield appeals the decision of the united states district court for the central district of california district court granting a motion to dismiss in favor of halifax plc and hbos plc the halifax appellees on statute of limitations grounds.hatfield allegations stem from a june,transaction in which halifax building society hbs,of which hatfield was a member,was converted into a publicly traded company called halifax plc halifax.hatfield claims that she,and similarly situated individuals,were deceived into believing that,upon completion of the transaction,they would be entitled to free shares in halifax,which they never received.the district court found that hatfield claims,brought years after her causes of action arose,were barred by california statutes of limitations,which are four years or less for each of hatfield claims.on appeal,hatfield argues that this action is governed by the english statute of limitations as provided by the choice of law provision in the transfer agreement between hbs and halifax and the limitations period was tolled by the filing of a previous class action in new jersey state court,making this action timely.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the district court decision concerning the untimeliness of hatfield action,but only with respect to hatfield individually and members of the putative class who are california residents.
background 
hatfield was a member of hbs,a united building society.in january,hbs sent a voting packet and a transfer document to its nine million existing members,including hatfield,informing them that the building society was converting into a publicly traded company called halifax.the transfer document provided that,if the conversion was approved,each qualifying member would receive free shares in halifax.the transfer document also outlined the conditions for member qualification,including the requirement that a member needed to have a registered address in the united kingdom or a permitted territory.the united states was not considered a permitted territory.approximately members,including hatfield,who resided in santa barbara,california,had registered addresses in the united states,which disqualified them from receiving the free halifax shares.on february,a majority of hbs members,including hatfield,voted in favor of the conversion.the conversion then took place on june,at which point the qualified members rights to the free shares vested.the disqualified members received no shares.
on june,hatfield,along with three other former hbs members who failed to qualify for the free shares,filed a putative class action in new jersey superior court new jersey state court action naming both halifax and hbos plc,which in became the sole owner of halifax,as defendants.the complaint primarily alleged that the plaintiffs were wrongfully deprived of their right to share in the proceeds of the sale of hbs.
on september,the new jersey state court dismissed the entire action.on december,the new jersey appellate division upheld the dismissal as to hatfield,who resided outside of new jersey at the time of the conversion,because the court did not have general jurisdiction over the halifax appellees,but it reversed the dismissal as to claims brought against halifax by the only named plaintiff who was a new jersey resident at the time of the transaction.hyams halifax plc,no,wl,at.
on december,the same day on which the new jersey appellate division issued its decision affirming hatfield dismissal from the new jersey state court action,hatfield filed substantially the same putative class action against the halifax appellees in the united states district court for the central district of california the district court action.hatfield purported to represent herself and all other similarly situated plaintiffs who were wrongfully deprived of their right to share in the proceeds of the sale of hbs.the putative class was not limited to california residents.
on october,the halifax appellees moved to dismiss hatfield complaint,claiming that the district court action was barred by the applicable california statutes of limitations.in response,hatfield argued that,because the choice of law provision in the transfer agreement specified that the agreement would be governed by and construed under english law,the claims were subject to a statute of limitations starting from the conversion date.hatfield further claimed that the filing of the new jersey state court action,which was undertaken within the english limitations period,tolled the running of the statute of limitations,making the district court action timely.the halifax appellees argued that the choice of law provision does not apply to hatfield claims because she was not a party to the contract and there is no indication that the parties to the agreement intended that the choice of law provision would allow hatfield to take advantage of the longer english statute of limitations.
on april,the district court dismissed the action,holding that hatfield claims were barred by the california statutes of limitations,which are four years or less for each of hatfield causes of action.hatfield halifax plc,no,slip op.at.the district court refused to apply the english statute of limitations,despite the choice of law provision,reasoning that hatfield was not a party to the transfer agreement and that absent an express statement of intent,a standard choice of law provision will not be interpreted as covering a statute of limitations.the district court further held that,even if the limitations period applied,hatfield action was late by years since neither the new jersey state court action nor the subsequent appeal tolled the limitations period.
discussion 
choice of law 
at the outset,the halifax appellees argue that hatfield can not enforce the choice of law provision because she was not a party to the transfer agreement.hatfield correctly replies that there is a provision in the transfer agreement that specifically permits members,such as herself,to enforce the contract.the transfer agreement provides that 
each of such qualifying investing members,qualifying borrowing members,investing members,borrowing members,the officers of the society or scb members,as the case may be,shall be entitled severally to enforce his rights in respect of any of those rights against the society or the successor as if he had been a party to this agreement.
emphasis added.under either english or california law,as an express beneficiary,hatfield has the right to enforce a contract made expressly for her benefit,here,the relevant transfer agreement.cal.a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.the intent of the contracting parties to benefit expressly that third party must appear from the terms of the contract.kaiser eng rs,grinnell fire prot,d.hatfield was clearly a beneficiary to the transfer agreement such that,under california law,she can enforce the choice of law provision.
the halifax appellees argue that,even if hatfield is a beneficiary to the transfer agreement,there is no indication that the parties intended to allow hatfield to take advantage of the statute of limitations established under english law.in determining the enforceability of a choice of law provision in a diversity action,a federal court applies the choice of law rules of the forum state,in this case california.see signal mci telecomms,cir.if the parties state their intention in an express clause,california courts ordinarily will enforce the parties stated intention frontier oil rli ins,th,d.here,the text of the transfer agreement,which provides that the agreement shall be governed by and construed under english law,could not be clearer.
once it determines the parties intention,a california state court will next analyze whether the chosen jurisdiction has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction or any other reasonable basis for the choice of law provision exists.hughes elecs.citibank,th,d.if either one of these tests is met,then a california court will enforce the provision unless the chosen jurisdiction law is contrary to california public policy.see also hambrecht quist venture partners am.med.int l,th,d,if california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the issue,the choice of law shall not be enforced,for the obvious reason that in such circumstance we will decline to enforce a law contrary to this state fundamental policy.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,a california court would enforce the transfer agreement choice of law provision because england has a substantial relationship to the parties and permitting the parties to extend the statute of limitations is not contrary to california public policy.the fact that halifax is a united kingdom company is sufficient to establish a substantial relationship between england and the parties,such that there is a reasonable basis for applying the english choice of law provision.see hambrecht quist,d at finding that the parties to a contract have a substantial relationship with the chosen state if one or more of them is incorporated there.moreover,under california law,a choice of law provision also incorporates the governing law statute of limitations.a standard provision,one which incorporates the law s of a specified jurisdiction includes the chosen state statutes of limitations.id.at see also boracchia biomet,no,wl,at,under california law,a contract choice of law provision will identify what state substantive law,including the statute of limitations,will be applied.
furthermore,there is no basis in the record to conclude that applying the longer english limitations period would violate california public policy.see hambrecht quist,d at in general,california courts have permitted contracting parties to modify the length of the otherwise applicable california statute of limitations,whether the contract has extended or shortened the limitations period.although there is a general public policy interest in preventing the prosecution of stale claims,that policy is not.indeed,section of the california code of civil procedure permits waivers of the california statute of limitations defense provided that such a waiver is in writing and does not extend the limitations period for more than four years at a time.thus,california appears willing to subordinate its interest in disposing of stale claims to the parties desire to have a forum in which to litigate their disputes.accordingly,the enforceability of the english choice of law provision encompasses the english statute of limitations as well.
the halifax appellees argue that the parties to the transfer agreement never intended the choice of law provision to include the english statute of limitations.in support of their argument they cite to a federal securities law case,des brisay goldfield,cir,for the proposition that l imitations periods are usually considered to be related to judicial administration and thus governed by the rules of local law,even if the substantive law of another jurisdiction applies.as this is a diversity action,california law,not federal law,controls,and the english statute of limitations is,therefore,applicable.
alternatively,the halifax appellees also argue that,even if the english choice of law provision encompasses the english statute of limitations and can be enforced by hatfield,it applies only to hatfield contract claims and not to her fraud or other tort claims.the california supreme court has held that a valid clause,which provides that a specified body of law governs the agreement between the parties,encompasses all causes of action arising from or related to that agreement,regardless of how they are characterized,including tortious breaches of duties emanating from the agreement or the legal relationships it creates.nedlloyd lines superior court,cal th,d.all of hatfield claims,including her tort claims,relate to the halifax appellees alleged failure to fulfill the promise of free shares.that promise was contained in the transfer document,but not delivered on.all of hatfield claims are,therefore,governed by the english statute of limitations.
having determined that the english statute of limitations applies,it is necessary to determine what law governs tolling.even if the english statute of limitations applies,hatfield action is not timely unless the limitations period is tolled.normally,when a foreign jurisdiction limitations period is found to apply,that jurisdiction tolling laws will also apply.see restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.f the majority rule is that the forum will apply the tolling provision of the state referred to by its borrowing statute.uniform conflict of act if the statute of limitations of another state applies to the assertion of a claim in this state,the other state relevant statutes and other rules of law governing tolling and accrual apply in computing the limitation period.because we hold that hatfield claims are governed by the english statute of limitations,the tolling law to be applied would be that of english law.
however,although hatfield has raised and argued the issue concerning application of the foreign law statute of limitations,neither side has mentioned the issue of england tolling law,despite having the opportunity to do so.see stuart united states,cir we realize that we may consider foreign law materials at any time,whether or not submitted by a party but,a bsent special circumstances,parties should present issues of foreign law in their appellate briefs at the latest.citations omitted,rev on other grounds,d.moreover,neither party,aside from some passing references in hatfield brief,discusses the tolling issue or provides the court with any meaningful information.
as a result of the failure of the parties to provide any materials,california law provides that by default a court will look to california tolling law.under california choice of law rules,a california court will apply its own rule of decision unless a party litigant timely invokes the law of a foreign state.hurtado superior court,cal d.although this court could undertake an independent investigation of english law,we are not experts on such law.moreover,by citing only california tolling law,the parties have acquiesced in the application of that law.see interpool char yigh marine panama,cir where no authority,or insufficient authority,is presented by the parties about foreign law,a court may conclude that the parties have acquiesced in the application of the law of the forum.dp aviation smiths indus.aerospace def,cir affirming district court decision to apply washington law despite the agreement english choice of law provision where the complaint and answer did not mention the potential application of english law the order did not refer to english law both parties argued washington law and neither party urged the application of english law or cited a conflict with washington law in briefing to the district court.
hatfield individual claims 
under california law,hatfield individual claims were equitably tolled by the timely filing of her nearly identical class action in new jersey state court.equitable tolling under california law is a judicially created doctrine that operates to suspend or extend a statute of limitations in order to ensure that a limitations period is not used to bar a claim unfairly.see addison state,cal d,t he equitable tolling doctrine fosters the policy of the law of this state which favors avoiding forfeitures and allowing good faith litigants their day in court.three factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether to apply equitable tolling under california law timely notice to the defendant in the filing of the first claim lack of prejudice to the defendant in gathering evidence to defend against the second claim and good faith and reasonable conduct by the plaintiff in filing the second claim.collier city of pasadena,d,see also mayes leipziger,cir finding that california equitably tolls its statutes of limitation during the pendency of an earlier case provided there is timely notice,and lack of prejudice to the defendant,and reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff quoting retail clerks union local hub pharmacy,cir as with other general equitable principles,application of the equitable tolling doctrine requires a balancing of the injustice to the plaintiff occasioned by the bar of his claim against the effect upon the important public interest or policy expressed by the limitations statute.lantzy centex homes,cal th,d,quoting addison,at.
the doctrine applies here where the new jersey state court action was filed within the english statute of limitations,thus providing the halifax appellees with timely notice of hatfield claims there is no showing that the halifax appellees were prejudiced in gathering evidence to defend these claims because the two actions were substantially similar and hatfield timely filed the district court action on the same day that the new jersey appellate division upheld the dismissal of her new jersey state court action.
moreover,california courts have permitted a plaintiff to take advantage of tolling based on the filing of a prior class action.in becker mcmillin construction,d,for example,a plaintiff homeowner,although not a named plaintiff in the earlier class action,was permitted to bring a subsequent individual action despite the fact that the statute of limitations had run.although the case was decided under a tolling rule discussed further infra,the california court of appeal held that the equities demand that tolling be permitted because the substantive class and individual claims were sufficiently similar to give the defendant notice of the litigation for purposes of applying the tolling rule.id.at emphasis added.
the halifax appellees argue that filing the new jersey state court action on the last day of the limitations period demonstrates hatfield attempt to circumvent california statute of limitations.hatfield motivation for filing her first action on the last day of the limitations period is irrelevant to an analysis concerning the application of equitable tolling,which focuses on a plaintiff good faith and reasonable conduct in filing a second action.here,hatfield acted in a good faith belief that the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the new jersey state court action.furthermore,hatfield filed the new jersey state court action within the limitations period established by english law,and she filed the district court action on the day that tolling ceased.such timely filing,even if done on the last day,is not evidence of bad faith or forum shopping.moreover,this bad faith argument is hardly persuasive considering that if hatfield had filed in california first,the halifax appellees would have had to contend with two class actions instead of just one.
the halifax appellees also argue that an action dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction can not be the basis for equitable tolling.they provide no california cases supporting this proposition,and there is no reason why a california state court would not apply equitable tolling here.see valenzuela kraft,cir finding in a title vii case that the defendant argument that equitable tolling is not available because the action the plaintiff relies on to establish tolling was filed in a court without subject matter jurisdiction is unpersuasive,reasoning that t he purpose of the statute,the notice to defendant,and the diligence demonstrated by the plaintiff determine the availability of tolling,not the presence or absence of subject matter jurisdiction and courts in other jurisdictions have equitably tolled statutes of limitations based on actions mistakenly filed in courts without personal jurisdiction,amended by cir.although the usual scenario in which california has applied equitable tolling involves a situation where the plaintiff possesses several legal remedies and reasonably and in good faith pursues one of them to try to prevent further damages,hu silgan containers,th,d,this in no way implies that california would not apply equitable tolling here.furthermore,none of the factors used in deciding whether equitable tolling applies is affected by the fact that the new jersey state court action was filed in a court that lacked personal jurisdiction.
the class action claims 
while there is no california precedent directly on point,based on closely analogous precedent,we see no reason why california equitable tolling doctrine would not also apply to the claims of its unnamed putative class members who,like hatfield,are california residents.first,the california supreme court has indicated a general agreement with tolling in the class action context,going so far as to cite with approval the supreme court decision in american pipe construction utah,d.see jolly eli lilly,cal d.in american pipe,the supreme court held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.at.in jolly,at,the california supreme court noted with approval the two major policies that underlie the american pipe tolling rule,the first of which is most relevant here.that policy protects the class action device because,without it,potential class members would be induced to file protective actions to preserve their claims,thus depriving class actions of their ability to secure efficiency and economy of litigation.id.at quoting american pipe,at.in jolly,despite the endorsement of american pipe,the court rejected its application under the facts of that case id.at.
the halifax appellees argue that this court recent decision in clemens daimlerchrysler,cir,bars hatfield class action.the clemens panel,applying california law,refused to allow american pipe tolling in a case where a plaintiff sought to use a class action filed in one jurisdiction to toll an action later filed in another a action.the plaintiff in clemens,relying on american pipe,argued that the limitations period should have been tolled by the filing of a similar class action in illinois,of which the plaintiff was a class member.id.at.the clemens court reasoned that,although i n some instances,a plaintiff can rely on the filing of a prior class action to vindicate the right in question and toll the statute in the event that the class is not ultimately certified,california has not adopted such american pipe tolling where the class action was filed in a foreign jurisdiction.clemens,at concluding that california interest in managing its own judicial system counsel s us not to import the doctrine of tolling,under american pipe,into california law.other courts have,under state law,similarly refused to adopt tolling,reasoning that u nless all states simultaneously adopt the rule of class action tolling,any state which independently does so will invite into its courts a disproportionate share of suits which the federal courts have refused to certify as class actions after the statute of limitations has run.see,portwood ford motor,finding that the adoption of class tolling in illinois would encourage plaintiffs from across the country to bring suit here following dismissal of their class actions in federal court.
although the clemens decision would foreclose application of american pipe here,it does not dictate a similar rejection of california equitable tolling doctrine,especially as it applies to california own residents.although the two types of and american to some extent,see becker.at,and even though california courts have treated them at times as interchangeable,they are not congruent.the halifax appellees themselves concede that the equitable tolling applied to individual actions is distinct from american pipe tolling.they cite newport dell,no,wl,at,a case decided shortly after clemens,which stated that t he tolling discussed in american pipe and crown is a species of legal tolling,not equitable tolling.thus,by the halifax appellees own admission,clemens,which only rejected the application of american pipe tolling in a action,does not affect the application of california equitable tolling doctrine,which covers situations beyond those covered by american pipe.see mcdonald antelope valley cmty.coll,cal th,d,california equitable tolling may apply where one
