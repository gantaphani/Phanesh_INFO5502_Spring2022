this is the consolidated appeal of two criminal defendants,john aptt and douglas murphy,who were convicted in on various counts of conspiracy,fraud,and money laundering.from march to may,aptt ran an investment business,financial instruments corporation.starting in the summer of and until the two had a in,murphy was his man.the company took in almost million from investors by promising them exorbitant returns,including periodic double your money offerings bearing a staggering interest rate.they actually did pay the promised returns to earlier investors,thus instilling confidence in the company and spurring further investment.according to the company business plan,the high returns were made possible because of aptt exemplary business judgment,and because financial instruments had the mechanisms in place to keep it in touch with developments as they happen,thus making it possible to seek investment opportunities and potential on a global scale.trial ex,at.unfortunately for the later investors,though,the more immediate reason for financial instruments group prodigious success was that it paid former investors with later investors money,in a classic ponzi scheme.
early in,some of aptt promotional materials attracted the attention of donald deagle,an attorney in the enforcement division of the securities and exchange commission.deagle brought aptt in for an informal discussion in which he told aptt that financial instruments activities constituted an offer to sell an unregistered security,and that appt would need to work with a securities lawyer if he wanted to make a legal offering.deagle also intimated that given the high yields aptt was promising,and given the small amount of seed money about with which he was starting,aptt must be contemplating a ponzi scheme.deagle explained to aptt what a ponzi scheme was,and warned him that such a scheme would be illegal.though he had in fact already raised more than from investors,aptt assured deagle that he was not operating a ponzi scheme,that he had not yet made any sales,and that the process was so complicated that he intended to give up the whole idea of offering an investment.based on those misrepresentations,the sec dropped its investigation.
but aptt did not do as he had promised.instead,he continued to solicit investments in financial instruments at an pace,still with no real business activity to generate the profits needed to repay investors.he knew that he had to find a source of profits quickly,and brought on murphy in the summer of to help him do so.
in october of,aptt continued solicitations came to the attention of deagle,and he again met with aptt.this time aptt was represented by counsel,bob lees,who assured deagle that aptt violations to that point had been a result of a misunderstanding.the sec again agreed not to pursue an enforcement action,but only because aptt and his attorney assured deagle that all sales activity would stop until lees had been able to perform the due diligence necessary for a legal offering.lees also promised that,if there were any further compliance problems,he would withdraw as aptt attorney and notify deagle of his withdrawal.lees testified at trial that both before and after the october meeting with the sec,he discussed with murphy his initial contact at financial instruments the need for all investor activity to cease pending such an investigation,with no objection from murphy.as a result of his due diligence investigation,lees concluded in early that because neither the company nor aptt could pass due diligence,the freeze on soliciting new investment would have to remain in place until aptt could find a legitimate joint venturer who could qualify to make the offering.
but aptt and murphy could not afford to stop solicitations.with debts to investors constantly coming due and no legitimate source of profits,to do so would be to default on,and potentially to be liable for,hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt.to avert this crisis,financial instruments made another double your money offering in december of,in flagrant violation of the instructions of both the sec and lees.
but that was merely a stopgap measure,not a permanent solution to the company problems.in a memo apparently written to aptt in early,murphy and his brother bruce,a disbarred attorney,proposed the following solution they would migrate the business to a new corporate shell untainted by the sec investigation,and then go back into the capital markets with enough disclosure to keep regulators at bay for,debt.trial ex.at.the funds thus acquired would be used to retire the most onerous of the company existing debts and acquire some profitable assets.according to their estimates,if the company could solicit million in new investments at an interest rate,it could pay off million in existing debt and still repay new investors so long as it was able to get a return of around on the remaining million.
in early,the three began to execute the memo proposed plan.behind the back of lees,they formed several new corporate entities to be vehicles for further offerings.while they kept working with lees on the possibility of a joint venture,murphy contacted another securities lawyer named peter adolph,without mentioning the company troubles with the sec,about the possibility of making an unregistered offering under an exemption for commercial paper.throughout and until the company finally closed in the spring of,financial instruments made various debt and equity investment offerings through the new entities.
in a vain attempt to generate the income to cover its spiraling debt,financial instruments sank roughly million of the raised funds into costa rican investments that murphy had identified as promising,and murphy continued to research other projects elsewhere in central and south america.to run the costa rican operation,aptt turned to a carpenter and friend by the name of david gallegos,with whom he had worked on several construction projects in colorado.the operation attempted to make the astronomical profits that were needed through two principal activities first,it attempted to capitalize on a housing shortage in costa rica by building and luxury housing units and providing financing for the buyers.second,it purchased a small company named prestel that allowed consumers to purchase telephone service on credit,paying in installments.both projects were abysmal failures.while the company built a total of about housing units,none were sold prior to its liquidation,and indeed the company lacked clear title to many of the properties.prestel also failed to generate significant income because many of its customers simply stopped making their payments.
thanks to an anonymous tip that the company was running a massive ponzi scheme,the sec finally brought a civil enforcement action against financial instruments in early.as a result,the federal court for the district of colorado entered an injunction against the company continued operation,and transferred control to a lawyer for liquidation.that liquidation recovered only about million of the million in outstanding debt to investors.
the sec subsequently referred the matter to the attorney office for criminal prosecution.john aptt and bruce murphy pleaded guilty to counts of mail fraud and money laundering in violation of and doug murphy went to trial.he had been somewhat less directly involved with the sale of securities than the other two,dealing with investors only when others were out of the office,and his involvement in the scheme ceased when he was fired in the summer of after a heated exchange with aptt.nevertheless,a jury convicted him of conspiracy under,five counts of mail fraud under,two counts of securities fraud under a,and one count of money laundering under.the district court sentenced john aptt to nine years in prison,and douglas murphy to just over eight years.
discussion 
on appeal,aptt and murphy raise two common challenges to the district court sentence.first,they argue that their fraud and money laundering counts should have been grouped together under.second,they claim that the district court wrongly included interest due to investors in the amount of loss caused by the fraud.
in addition to these common challenges,each defendant raises individual grounds for appeal.aptt argues that the criminal activity in this case was not extensive enough to qualify him for the enhancement he received on his fraud offense for being the organizer or leader of criminal activity that involves five or more participants or is otherwise extensive.murphy claims that his conviction should be overturned because one of the key documents showing his involvement in the criminal activity was admitted erroneously in the alternative,he claims that his sentence should be reduced because he was not a manager or supervisor in that criminal activity.we conclude that none of the defendants contentions have merit,and affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects.
because the counts of money laundering were not grouped together with the counts of fraud,defendants offense levels for their money laundering counts for aptt and for murphy were each increased by two on account of the presence of another offense group of only slightly less severity.see.defendants contend that this failure to group,and the resulting increase in offense levels,was error.they point out that the money laundering in this case consisted solely of using the proceeds of fraud the investors money to pay off earlier investors,thus making the company promises appear credible and furthering the fraud on later investors.both crimes,they insist,essentially harmed the same victims the later,unpaid investors,making grouping appropriate under.the district court rejected their legal position.
we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states,cir.whatever the merits of defendants contention from a policy perspective,their recommended approach has been repeatedly rejected in this circuit.united states johnson,cir united states kunzman,cir.the rationale of those both involved ponzi schemes like this that the relevant money laundering guideline focused not on loss to any particular group but on the total volume of money laundered,and the victim of money laundering was not the particular victim of the fraud,but rather society in general.johnson,at kunzman,at.because they measure different types of harm to different victims,the fraud and money laundering offenses can not be grouped.although other circuits have disagreed with this conclusion,we have continued to adhere to our precedent in kunzman.see united states hargus,cir.
defendants raise two arguments in a vain attempt to avoid the result of kunzman and johnson.first,they argue that the sentencing guidelines make it clear that money laundering of fraud proceeds should be grouped with the underlying fraud.that is true,but beside the point.the trial court delayed sentencing until after the guidelines went into effect,intending to give defendants the benefit of the new grouping rules.however,the guidelines also revised the treatment of fraud,larceny,and other economic crimes,resulting in substantially increased offense levels for defendants fraud.this made sentencing under the new guidelines decidedly less favorable to defendants than under the old guidelines.therefore,to avoid an ex post facto problem,the trial court applied the sentencing guidelines in effect when the crimes were committed.see b.under the rule,defendants can not mix and match provisions from various versions of the guidelines in order to produce the lowest sentence having received the benefit of the guidelines lighter sentences for fraud,they are stuck with unfavorable grouping rules.see id.b.
the one exception to this principle is that a subsequent amendment to the guidelines can sometimes be given retroactive effect if the changes are clarifying rather than substantive.id.given the substantial alterations in the new money laundering guideline,which the commission itself described as a replacement guideline,app.c,amend.at supp,we are confident that the guidelines do not qualify for retroactive application.
defendants next argue that kunzman and johnson are distinguishable because in those cases,the defendants never intended to repay investors,instead spending investors capital on personal expenses.here,by contrast,financial instruments did ultimately invest substantial money in costa rica defendants maintain that they hoped that profits would take off,allowing them to make good on their exorbitant promises.but however good defendants intentions may have been,this does not affect the rationale of johnson and kunzman.whether incurred maliciously or misguidedly,the type of harm measured by the fraud guideline loss to victims is simply not the same as that measured by the money laundering guideline volume of laundered funds.see johnson,at.
moreover,we are not persuaded that defendants purportedly good intentions bring them outside the purpose of the sentencing guidelines.it is true that one purpose of the fraud laws is to deter those who fraudulently obtain investor funds never intending to repay.but it is no less fraudulent when businessmen like defendants,foolishly overconfident in their ability to deliver,encourage investors to share their overconfidence by falsely overstating their qualifications,past successes,or current business position.
indeed,it may well be that defendants purportedly good intentions actually exacerbated the situation.a particularly pernicious aspect of this ponzi scheme was the way it took control of its erstwhile masters at any given point,the consequences of stopping the scheme and defaulting,which included civil and even criminal liability,were so grim that defendants were compelled over and over again to bet double or each bet more hopeless than the last.their supposed desire to make good on their promises kept them throwing good money not rightfully theirs after bad.
perhaps paradoxically,the only honest route open to aptt and murphy at the end of was to admit that they had no source of profits and to default on their obligations to investors.instead they chose to clean up financial instruments old sins,by fraudulently securing new rounds of financing with which they hoped to make enough profits to pay off old and new investors alike.had the new investors been apprised of the desperate condition of financial instruments and the speculative nature of its prospects in costa rica,we think it safe to say that most would not have hazarded their funds on defendants confidence that w ith all of us working toward a common goal,we can not be stopped.trial ex.at.however legitimate their ultimate design,defendants brought their conduct squarely within the plain language and the purpose of the guidelines when they chose to pursue that design by fraudulent means.
next,defendants dispute the amount of loss caused by their fraud.we review the district court factual findings on this question for clear error,but the factors a district court properly may consider are reviewed de novo.united states galbraith,cir.the sentencing guidelines provide for an enhancement of anywhere between and levels for fraud,depending on the amount of loss caused.see b.defendants each received a enhancement to their fraud offense level because the amount of loss they caused was above million they contend that they should have received a enhancement instead,because by their calculations the total loss caused was between and million.
the trial court accepted the government conclusion that the total loss to investors was million.the government arrived at that figure as follows it took the total principal received from investors million,and subtracted the amount of principal voluntarily returned million and the amount regained for investors in liquidation million.it thus calculated the total lost principal to be roughly million.to this it added the total promised but unpaid interest million,to arrive at the total loss figure of million.defendants first argue that the district court erred in including unpaid interest in the amount lost.this was not error.as we held in united states lowder,cir,when the defendant fraudulently promises a particular return on an investment,the victims of the fraud are legally entitled to the benefit of their bargain the interest.thus,the proper measure of damages includes any amounts promised but unpaid.
defendants attempt to distinguish lowder by noting that they,unlike the defendant in lowder,intended to repay investors.they cite united states holiusa,cir,in favor of their position.once again,however,we are not convinced that the difference in intention is relevant.under the guidelines,when the intended loss is ascertainable and greater than actual loss,it is used as the amount of loss for sentencing purposes,cmt.holiusa held merely that because pyramid scheme operators necessarily intend to pay back earlier investors,it is not appropriate to count gross receipts from investors as intended loss.at.in so holding,holiusa reaffirmed the rule that unrealized plans to repay do not reduce the loss amount below actual losses.id.at.
entirely in accordance with holiusa,aptt and murphy have been sentenced based on the actual net losses they caused to investors,not intended loss.lowder measure of loss is not a special measure imposed,like punitive damages awards,because a defendant intent or conduct was especially malicious or reprehensible.rather,it rests on the premise that,when a particular return is promised,victims are legally entitled to it.unpaid interest would be included among their actual losses in a breach of contract action,and there is no reason not to include such losses in fraud cases as well.
defendants further argue that the district court should have deducted another million in interest payments that they made,as promised,to early investors in the ponzi scheme.however,this sum was already accounted for.the district court included only unpaid is,total interest promised,minus interest paid.to deduct another million would be double counting.the district court calculation of the loss amount is correct 
aptt raises one further ground for challenging his sentence.the sentencing guidelines impose a enhancement for being a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,where a participant is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,but need not have been convicted.a cmt.the district court accepted the government position that aptt,both murphy brothers,and two other individuals were participants in the fraud offense,and therefore applied the enhancement to aptt fraud count.
one of the two remaining participants was barb willems,the office manager for financial instruments who processed many of the payments to earlier investors.although she quit after being told by doug murphy and her lawyer that financial instruments was a ponzi scheme,she was subsequently persuaded by aptt to return.aptt does not contest her status as a participant.the second was david gallegos,the manager of the costa rican operations.aptt claims that the district court should not have counted david gallegos as a participant for these purposes.on appeal,we review this determination for clear error.see united states cruz camacho,cir.
the trial judge reached his conclusion that gallegos was a participant based on several factors.first,he inferred that gallegos,who held a high position in the company and had frequent conversations with aptt and other participants,knew that the company had no source of profits with which to repay investors.second,gallegos,who had invested in the company,knew that investors were nevertheless being paid,putting him on notice that the company was running a ponzi scheme.he was a criminally responsible participant,therefore,because w ith knowledge that this group had no profits with which to repay investors,gallegos continued to promote the activities of the group.mem.of sentencing hr g statement of reasons,aptt doc.furthermore,the district court noted gallegos admission on that when aptt falsely represented to investors that the houses in costa rica were being built in days and sold very quickly,gallegos did nothing to correct the investors misimpression,even though he knew that in fact no units had been sold and that it had been taking more than three months to complete a building.even if this evidence of gallegos involvement is consistent barely with his being an innocent employee attempting to generate legitimate returns for investors,it is also entirely consistent with gallegos intentionally providing a front of apparently legitimate investment activity with which to attract more fraud victims to feed financial instruments insatiable demand for new capital.we therefore find no error,let alone clear error,in the district court conclusion that gallegos was a participant in the fraud scheme within the meaning of the guidelines.accordingly,we affirm aptt enhancement,and need not consider the district court argument in the alternative that the criminal activity was otherwise extensive.see a.
murphy first individual claim is that his conviction should be reversed because the key document linking him to the conspiracy,government exhibit,should not have been admitted.the document in question is an unsigned,undated memorandum to john from bruce and doug,which was found in financial instruments offices after the company had been shut down.the memorandum refers to a previous letter from aptt hiring the authors as personal consultants,and proceeds to sketch the master plan for continuing to operate while keeping regulators at bay.trial ex.at.the document was a central piece of evidence in the prosecution case the prosecutor closing statements focused heavily on the memo,which the prosecutor called a smoking gun.tr,most of it is recommendation rather than assertion,and was probative not of the truth of the matter asserted,but rather of doug murphy intent to keep the company alive by securing new investment with which to pay off old investors.however,murphy argues that the document attribution of authorship is hearsay it is an statement that he was an author of the document,admitted to prove the truth of the matter,that he was the author.
of course,if the memo is the statement of murphy,then as his own admission,it is admissible into evidence.likewise,if it is the statement of bruce murphy,it is presumably admissible as the statement of a coconspirator.thus,the central problem with the exhibit seems to be that it was not formally authenticated as the work of doug bruce.the district court had wide latitude to consider even inadmissible evidence in determining whether to admit the memo,and presumably could have used the content of the memo as at least one factor in determining whether the memo fell under one of the exceptions to the bar on hearsay.see bourjaily united states,d.on the other hand,we have previously found similar names identifying authorship to be inadmissible hearsay even in the face of circumstantial evidence confirming the identity of the author.see,united states mcintyre,cir united states markopoulos,cir.
whatever the correct resolution of this legal question,however,the trial court was never given a chance to consider whether it should exclude the smoking gun.very early in the trial,after the prosecution had laid a foundation to admit an exhibit and moved for admission of the exhibit into evidence,murphy attorney responded as follows no objection,your honor.also to speed up things,judge,we have a stipulation.all the exhibits are stipulated to.tr.the prosecutor and the judge expressed some surprise,but proceeded with the exhibit in question.later that afternoon,after a recess,the prosecutor said,your honor,based on stipulation from opposing counsel,i would move to admit all exhibits,that is,through,at this time.id.at.murphy counsel specifically asserted that he had no objection,and the the smoking gun were received into evidence.id.
murphy now admits that his attorney did not object to the admission of exhibit,but claims that this court can still review that admission for plain error.however,admission of a stipulated exhibit is not error at all,even if it would not be admissible in the absence of such a stipulation.a defendant is free to waive objections to evidence by stipulation,perhaps to obtain evidence on his own behalf or in return for other concessions from the prosecution.diaz united states.quoting people murray.in such contexts,admitting the stipulated evidence is so far from being error that it would be an impertinence and gross error for a court to interfere with the stipulation.id at.see also united states olano,d noting that deviation from a legal rule is not error,and hence is not reviewable,if the rule has been waived.
perhaps recognizing how damaging this is to his position,murphy now bravely maintains that his attorney did not actually mean to stipulate to the exhibits instead,he was merely signaling,with an inapt choice of words,that he had no objection to their admission.appellant murphy reply br.this reading seems inaccurate.when defense counsel said,all the exhibits are stipulated to,he was not responding to a motion from the prosecution to admit all the exhibits,and his stipulation can not be characterized as a failure to object.instead,it was an active step on his part,inviting the admission of many exhibits not yet before the court at all.later,when the exhibits were actually admitted,the prosecution made it clear that the basis for their admission was a stipulation by the parties,and defense counsel said he had no objection.thereafter the exhibits were admitted without any foundation being laid,and indeed in one case when the prosecutor began to ask questions that might lay a foundation,the trial judge chided,you know,this is just a waste of time.you got all the exhibits in.move.tr.later in the trial,murphy attorney acknowledged that he had stipulated,making any arguments about whether the government was bootstrap ping an exhibit into evidence beside the point.tr.thus,the parties and the court conduct demonstrate that the stipulation was a stipulation not only in name,but also in action and effect.
murphy claims that he is nevertheless entitled to review under united states olano.that opinion distinguishes sharply between waiver,the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,and forfeiture,the failure to make the timely assertion of a right.at.while there is no appeal from violation of a waived right,the violation of forfeited rights may be reviewed on appeal under the limited conditions set forth in olano.id.at.murphy argues that he did not intentionally and in full knowledge relinquish his right to confront the anonymous hearsay declarant who authored the smoking gun.therefore,the stipulation could not be a waiver as that term is used in olano,leaving murphy eligible for review.
we think murphy misconceives the specificity with which one must intend to waive a right under olano.certainly one need not fully comprehend all the consequences of waiving the right.we think a stipulation,which by its very nature signals the intentional relinquishment of any and all rights to challenge the admissibility of the stipulated evidence,is a clear example of waiver if anything is.see united states perez,cir en banc kleinfeld,concurring 
that does not end our inquiry,however,because waiver of particular rights may be governed by heightened standards whether a particular right is waivable whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver whether certain procedures are required for waiver and whether the defendant choice must be particularly informed or voluntary,all depend on the right at stake.olano,at.emphasis added see generally wayne lafave,jerold israel nancy king,criminal procedure a ed,previous edition cited in olano,at.some rights can be waived only personally by the defendant,and only after being fully informed of his rights.see,johnson zerbst.right to counsel brookhart janis,d right to plead not guilty but a lthough there are basic rights that the attorney can not waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client,the lawyer must authority to manage the conduct of the trial.the adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval.taylor illinois,d.thus,some rights are firmly in the domain of trial strategy,and can be waived by counsel even in the face of client disagreement.see jones barnes,d.
the proper question,therefore,is whether and how one can waive the particular right at issue here the right to exclude hearsay under the confrontation clause and the related federal rules of evidence.we recently considered this question in hawkins hannigan,cir.there,the defendant was charged with raping a woman.his counsel stipulated to the admissibility of hearsay evidence pertaining to any description or identification given by the victim,because of the victim ill health and the potentially harmful effects of her live testimony.at.defense counsel understood this evidence to include audiotapes of her interviews with the police,but counsel was apparently unaware that the stipulation would also cover a police officer testimony that the victim had picked the defendant out of a photo lineup.id.
on habeas review,this court determined that defense counsel had validly waived his client confrontation clause rights,and that the stipulation did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.id.at.the panel relied on three circuit court opinions for the proposition that counsel in a criminal case may waive his client sixth amendment right of confrontation by stipulating to the admission of evidence,so long as the defendant does not dissent from his attorney decision and so long as it can be said that the attorney decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.united states stephens,cir,quoted in hawkins,at see also cruzado puerto rico,cir where an accused is represented by counsel,we do not see why counsel,in his presence and on his behalf,may not make an effective waiver of the right of confrontation.wilson gray,cir t he accused may waive his right to cross examination and confrontation and the waiver of this right may be accomplished by the accused counsel as a matter of trial tactics or strategy.here,as in hawkins,there is no evidence that defendant objected to the stipulation by counsel.
the remaining question is how to interpret the requirement that the attorney decision can be said to be a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy.hawkins,at.the cases cited in hawkins focused on the issue of whether the right to confront witnesses was waivable by counsel or only by the defendant personally.thus,their common reference to trial tactics and strategy were meant primarily to locate the decision to stipulate within the domain of trial strategy,where the attorney is to invite subsequent tribunals to consider whether the stipulation was the wisest course of action.elsewhere in the opinion,hawkins makes this clear by saying that a waiver will be valid when done pursuant to a reasonable trial strategy,id.emphasis added,and we have since held that hawkins is satisfied if the attorney appear s to have an objectively reasonable strategy when he or she waives confrontation clause rights.bullock carver,cir.
murphy would have us find his attorney waiver invalid because the attorney did not specifically consider whether to pursue the hearsay objection,but rather overlooked it.we are not convinced that counsel stipulation was so careless.assuming that the smoking gun and other exhibits would have been admitted even without the stipulation,the defense best theory was that they exonerated murphy by showing that he,too,had been duped by aptt.it would be difficult to argue convincingly that the memo exonerates murphy after strenuously objecting to its admission,and even denying that he had written it,in the presence of the jury.and even if the memo admissibility could have been challenged without alerting the jury,it may be that defense counsel determined that the likelihood of successfully excluding the stipulated exhibits was small enough that it would be more advantageous for his client to bolster his credibility by expressing,in the presence of the jury,a willingness to let them see all of the evidence.
but even assuming that murphy trial counsel did overlook the potential hearsay objection,that can not by itself justify holding his waiver invalid.if a timely objection had been made,for all we know,the government could have laid a proper foundation for admission of the memo into evidence.defense counsel oversight if that is what it was had the effect of inducing both the government and the trial judge not to bother with doing so to reverse murphy conviction because exhibit was wrongly admitted would be to allow him singlehandedly to create below the grounds for his triumph on appeal.see united states hardwell,cir a defendant can not invite a ruling and then have it set aside on appeal.
murphy position amounts to a claim that a trial counsel waiver is deficient whenever trial counsel is not fully aware of all the possible legal arguments that could be raised in support of the intentionally abandoned position.requiring this kind of lawyerly omniscience would make effective waivers exceedingly rare,to the detriment of defendants as well as the government.the power to waive rights is an important bargaining chip with which defendants can often gain substantial concessions from the government.but a waiver that is invalid as soon as a party thinks of a new reason for asserting the waived right is no waiver at all.see perez,at kleinfeld,concurring.furthermore,invalidating waivers because of mere oversights would make us into backseat drivers to defense counsel,constantly revisiting whether there were arguments that in our opinion the trial attorney should have raised.
we have no desire to assume this role,and hawkins does not require us to do so.to the contrary,hawkins held that counsel had effectively waived the defendant rights by stipulation despite the attorney apparent confusion about the scope of that stipulation.at.in determining whether the stipulation in this case was objectively reasonable,we are bound to heed the supreme court pointed warning in strickland washington,d,against using hindsight to attorneys tactical decisions.strickland requires us to impose a heavy presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance that is,the presumption that,under the circumstances,the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.at.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,under strickland,we must uphold counsel performance so long as the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy,id.emphasis added under hawkins,we must uphold counsel waiver so long as it can be said that the attorney decision was a legitimate trial tactic or part of a prudent trial strategy,at emphasis added.we see no material difference between these two standards,and conclude that an attorney stipulation to admit evidence is a valid waiver unless the defendant can show that the stipulation constituted ineffective assistance under the strickland test.see bullock carver,at b ecause bullock ineffective assistance of counsel claims fail,his confrontation clause argument based on hearsay to which counsel did not object also fails.wilson,at quoting,with apparent approval,the district court conclusion that a reviewing court can not find a denial of the constitutional right to merely on the basis of an error in trial tactics unless the error is so gross as to constitute a denial of adequate and effective assistance of counsel murray carrier,d holding in the habeas context that inadvertent or ignorant attorney error does not constitute cause excusing procedural default unless it rises to the level of ineffective assistance.
because questions of counsel effectiveness often require development of the facts not in the trial record concerning the attorney preparation and strategy,we have held that in the typical case,they should be raised in a collateral attack under.united states galloway,cir en banc.as murphy acknowledges,the same is true here the record does not show whether counsel for murphy had carefully reviewed the stipulated exhibits,nor does it show whether he hoped to gain any strategic advantages by making the stipulation.nothing in this record convinces us that he did not,but that is a matter best considered together with any other ineffective assistance claims murphy might care to raise on collateral attack.
thus,not reaching any claim of attorney ineffectiveness,we conclude that defense counsel stipulation waived murphy rights and rendered the exhibit admission unreviewable.as the court said in taylor,at,p utting to one side the exceptional cases in which counsel is ineffective,the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer decision to forgo.
the government argued below that both murphy fraud and money laundering offense levels should be enhanced under because he was an organizer or leader in each respective activity,while murphy contended that based on the facts,he should receive no enhancement at all for his role in the offense under guideline.the district court took a middle position,concluding that murphy was a manager or supervisor of the activity.he therefore gave murphy a enhancement on the fraud offenses under b because the fraud involved five or more participants,and a enhancement on his money laundering offenses under c.on appeal,murphy argues that this was error.we review the district court factual findings regarding a defendant role in the offense for clear error,and its legal determinations de novo.see cruz camacho,at united states,cir.
to qualify for an adjustment under guideline,the defendant must have been the organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of one or more other participants,cmt.emphasis added.here,as before,a participant is someone who is criminally responsible for the offense.see,cmt.in fraudulent operations like this one,the emphasized language will often be crucial,because employees who are unaware of the operation fraudulent nature are not criminally responsible participants as a result,managing or supervising their activities does not qualify a defendant for the enhancement.
murphy would have us conclude that the district court overlooked this obvious point from the mere fact that the district court called murphy a manager or supervisor of the activity,instead of a manager or supervisor of other participants.we do not place so much weight on the district court turn of phrase.indeed,another subsection of guideline itself speaks of being an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor in any criminal activity even though it is clear under application note of the guideline that one can do so only by supervising or organizing one or more other participants.thus,there is nothing inappropriate about referring to murphy as a manager or supervisor of the activity,so long as the district court did so on the basis of murphy relationship to one or more participants.the district court explained the basis of its decision as follows 
he was a manager or supervisor because he did recruit a lawyer,he did seek the advice of lawyers,and therefore,he used the lawyers to dress up the scheme in a way which made it appear more legal.
he and his brother authored the crucial memorandum,exhibit,which was the blueprint or operational plan for the conspiracy after january of.
he was an officer of one of these corporations.he traveled to panama and there hired employees,rented space and met with lawyers and bankers.that evidence is ample to demonstrate that he was a manager or supervisor in this criminal activity.
sentencing,murphy vol,at.
it is true that most of the actions cited by the district judge are not themselves clear instances of supervising another participant in the scheme.for instance,recruiting and using the lawyers does not qualify because there is no argument that any of the lawyers were criminally responsible participants.similarly,authoring the master plan for the scheme would not qualify murphy as a manager or supervisor if he only suggested the plan as aptt personal consultant,leaving aptt to supervise its actual implementation.
however,nothing in guideline or its application notes can be read to require direct evidence of supervision or management,which is often in short supply.in its absence,courts regularly rely on circumstantial evidence to discern the nature of the su
