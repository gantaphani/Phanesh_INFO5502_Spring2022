this is the second time the government has appealed the sentence of michael martin,a former healthsouth corporation healthsouth executive,who pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and mail fraud and falsify books and records,in violation of,and falsifying books and records,in violation of b a,b,and,and.in both appeals the parties have agreed that martin advisory guidelines range is to months imprisonment,and that martin substantial assistance to the government warrants a downward departure pursuant to.the hotly contested dispute both times has been over whether the extremely lenient sentence the district court gave is reasonable.
the district court originally sentenced martin to months probation.in the first appeal,this court vacated that sentence for lack of a record capable of meaningful appellate review and remanded for resentencing.united states martin,unpublished.
at the resentencing,the government recommended a downward departure to months imprisonment,which equates to a departure.instead,the district court granted martin a downward departure and imposed a sentence of days imprisonment.the government again appeals.after review,we again vacate martin sentence in its entirety.
factual background 
a factual summary outlining martin fraud is attached to his guilty plea.the investigation report psi also details the massive fraud in this case,and at sentencing,martin withdrew any objection to the psi.thus,the two documents establish these facts.
at all relevant times,healthsouth claimed to be the nation largest provider of outpatient surgery,diagnostic imaging,and rehabilitative healthcare services,with approximately locations across all states.healthsouth common stock was listed on the new york stock exchange.the management of healthsouth provided guidance to the investing public regarding anticipated earnings per share,and in turn,professional securities analysts disseminated to the public their estimates of the company expected performance.if a company,such as healthsouth,announces earnings that fail to meet or exceed analyst expectations,the price of the company stock typically will decline.
from at least until march,a group of healthsouth officers conspired to artificially inflate healthsouth reported earnings and earnings per share,and to falsify reports about healthsouth overall financial condition.the healthsouth officers made,and directed accounting personnel to make,false and fraudulent entries in healthsouth books and records for the purpose of falsely reporting healthsouth assets,revenues,and earnings per share and in order to defraud investors,banks,and lenders.as a result,healthsouth public financial records overstated its financial position cumulatively by billions of dollars from to,and public investors purchased overvalued shares of healthsouth stock,which plummeted from per share to per share when the massive fraud was revealed.
defendant martin was employed by healthsouth from to,and served as its chief financial officer cfo from october until he resigned in march.as early as,martin became aware that healthsouth was not meeting its projections.after martin became cfo in,he began reviewing quarterly preliminary income statements showing healthsouth true and accurate financial results,which showed that healthsouth was not meeting projections made by its chief executive officer ceo,richard scrushy.by martin own admission,at the direction of scrushy,martin falsified numbers to inflate healthsouth stated earnings to meet scrushy projections and wall street expectations.
martin also attended numerous meetings in which members of the accounting department discussed how the financial statements could be altered to meet scrushy projections.martin repeatedly discussed with scrushy the fact that the income statements provided to the securities and exchange commission sec and the investors were inaccurate,and he tried to dissuade scrushy from perpetrating further fraud.martin nevertheless signed healthsouth and forms beginning in and continuing through the third quarter of,with the knowledge that the numbers in the attached financial statements were false and thus the financial statements misrepresented the company financial condition.
as noted earlier,the overstatement of healthsouth financial position in its public records as a result of the massive and prolonged fraud summed to billions of dollars the most direct victims of the fraud were the investing public,healthsouth shareholders,and the company.healthsouth had many shareholders,some of whom invested their life savings in healthsouth stock and saw their investment plummet to pennies per share.a conservative estimate of the stock value loss attributable to martin fraud was or approximately billion.
there were also many other collateral victims of scrushy and martin fraud,including healthsouth employees,particularly those who were terminated and those who had participated in the company stock ownership plan or pension fund employees of contractors who were dependent on healthsouth contracts for income banks and other lenders who loaned money to healthsouth based on falsified financial information and competing health service providers who lost business or financing based on the false information.see united states mcvay,cir.
although many victims suffered devastating losses,healthsouth officers benefitted by receiving huge salaries and bonuses.martin income was over million from just to in in in and in.as detailed later,martin agreed to a million forfeiture,and the district court also imposed a fine,both of which martin immediately paid by check.at the time of the psi in,martin had a net worth of over million.
ii.procedural history 
in march,certain of martin revealed the fraud to federal authorities.martin subsequently met with federal bureau of investigation fbi agents,admitted his role in the conspiracy,and thereafter cooperated substantially with the government.
on april,the government filed a information against martin,charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and mail fraud and falsify books and records,in violation of count one and one count of falsifying books,records,and accounts,in violation of b a,b,and,and count two.the information also included a forfeiture count count three.pursuant to a plea agreement,martin pled guilty to all three counts.
first sentencing in 
the psi indicated that martin offense level was and his criminal history category was i,resulting in a guidelines sentence range of to months imprisonment martin base offense level of was increased to level by these enhancements levels under b s because the fraud loss was over million levels under a because martin was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was extensive levels under for martin abuse of a position of public and private trust levels under b c because his offenses involved sophisticated means and levels under b a because his offenses involved more than minimal planning.martin offense level of was reduced by levels under due to his acceptance of responsibility.
on june,the district court held a sentencing hearing.the government had already filed a motion for downward departure,pursuant to,based on martin substantial assistance.at the sentencing hearing,the government argued that the court should depart down levels to offense level and impose a sentence of months imprisonment the government pointed out that while martin assistance was valuable,martin nevertheless was the most culpable of those who have been sentenced to date that h e was the most senior officer,he had the most authority,and he was involved the longest that he obtained substantial income and status,social status,from this position at healthsouth and that a lesser sentence would not sufficiently deter such conduct.
the district court adopted the psi calculations that martin offense level was,his criminal history category was i,and his guidelines sentence range was to months imprisonment.although the district court granted the government motion,the district court departed levels down to offense level,which yielded a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.although objecting to the extent of the departure,the government asked for a sentence of at least months imprisonment.even with that departure,the district court still imposed no imprisonment.rather,the district court imposed a sentence of months probation with a special condition of months home detention on each of counts one and two,to run concurrently.at the sentencing,martin agreed to a forfeiture of million,and the district court imposed a fine of.the government objected that the extent of the departure was unreasonable.
in its written judgment entered june,the district court checked the box stating that the downward departure was based on motion of the government based on the defendant substantial assistance,and offered no further reasons.the government appealed,and this court vacated and remanded because the district court failed to specify reasons for the extraordinary departure under,and thus the record was incapable of meaningful appellate review.martin.at.
resentencing 
the district court held a resentencing hearing on september,at which the district court again granted the government motion for downward departure based on martin substantial assistance.at that hearing,the government adopted its previous characterization of martin assistance and also acknowledged that martin had continued to assist the government after his first sentencing,including testifying for at least five days at scrushy trial.the government further acknowledged that martin had attempted to dissuade scrushy from pursuing the fraudulent conduct and had been at least minimally successful for some period.
however,the government stressed that martin nevertheless was a leader of the conspiracy that he abused the trust of the investors,bankers,and others who placed him in his leadership position within healthsouth that his conduct was egregious and that he was the most culpable of the defendants to come before the court for sentencing.to balance martin cooperation against the seriousness of his conduct and his relative culpability,the government requested that the district court sentence martin to months imprisonment.this request represented a downward departure of levels from offense level to.thus,the government requested sentence represented a reduction in excess of percent from the low end of martin guideline range 
martin counsel disputed the government position that he was the most culpable of the defendants sentenced or to be sentenced by the court and emphasized his extraordinary cooperation with the government.martin counsel further stressed that he tried to dissuade others from the fraudulent conduct and ultimately resigned,and that he also cooperated with plaintiffs who sued him for his conduct,without any promise of leniency or reduced judgment.
after hearing from the government and the defense,the district court announced its decision to depart downward by levels to an offense level of,which,when combined with martin criminal history category of i,yielded a guidelines range of to months imprisonment,a fine range of to million,and a supervised release term of to years.the district court then sentenced martin to days imprisonment and years supervised release.the district court also reimposed the fine and forfeiture of million,which martin had paid in.
in explaining its reasons for this extraordinary departure under,the district court described martin unhesitating assistance to the fbi,the sec,and healthsouth auditors and shareholders.the district court adopted the government description of martin assistance 
that this defendant assistance enabled the government to swiftly prosecute richard scrushy and several other major participants in the fraud it allowed the government to provide a timely assurance to the financial markets that the illegal conduct had ended and that corrective action was being taken and it allowed healthsouth to reconstruct its books and records and to begin its recovery.
the district court emphasized martin crucial role in the scrushy trial and in the sec civil proceedings,and found martin assistance to have been outstanding,invaluable,and complete,completely reliable,and immediate,even as the government was appealing martin previous sentence.the district court further noted that,while there was no risk of physical injury,martin subjected his financial to imminent jeopardy and would almost certainly incur substantial civil judgments against him as a result of his cooperation.additionally,the district court indicated that it was remarkable that martin continued to cooperate with the government even as the government was appealing his original sentence.as to the extraordinary nature of the assistance,the district court stated as the court found earlier,this is the only time in its history as a judge when this kind of cooperation has been forthcoming from a defendant.
as to the sentencing factors set forth in a,the district court found that the offense conduct was an aberration for an otherwise outstanding citizen that martin had sacrificed his own personal fortune in favor of the victims of the fraud that the conspiracy predated martin participation and that he tried to convince scrushy to abandon the fraudulent course of conduct.the district court further stated,with regard to martin resignation while for purposes of the sentencing guidelines he did withdraw his participation in the conspiracy for purposes of booker considerations,the court finds that he did withdraw from the conspiracy.
the district court stated that it finds that some period of incarceration is necessary to reflect the seriousness of the crime.even though the court recognized this a factor,the court then reasoned that a more lengthy sentence than days would,in the court judgment,promote a disrespect for the law because from the point of view of the government,the man most singularly responsible for this criminal conduct richard scrushy has been found not guilty and will serve no time at all.the court concluded that under those circumstances,to subject this defendant to a lengthy period of imprisonment would not serve as just punishment and would not promote respect for the law.
the district court also determined that martin devastating experience would deter not only martin but others similarly situated from engaging in similar conduct.the court found that a longer period of incarceration would be greater than necessary to achieve the deterrence objectives,and would be unjust.
finally,the district court noted that martin had forfeited million and that martin was also a defendant in several civil lawsuits.the district court stated that a longer period of incarceration might well impede the ability of the plaintiffs in those cases to collect on any civil judgment that they may receive against martin.
the government objected to the departure to days imprisonment as an unreasonable departure from the statutory maximum of years and the low end of the advisory guidelines of months.the government now appeals.
iii.discussion 
even after the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,in fashioning an appropriate sentence,the district court still must correctly calculate first the appropriate advisory guidelines range.united states williams,cir citing united states crawford,cir.the district court then may consider imposing a more severe or more lenient sentence,and this court reviews the ultimate sentence for reasonableness.id.before we conduct a reasonableness review of the ultimate sentence imposed,we first determine whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the guidelines to calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range.mcvay,at quoting williams,at.we review de novo a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,including,and its factual findings for clear error.id.at.
in this case,it is undisputed that martin advisory guidelines range is to months imprisonment.instead,the dispute is over whether the extent of the departure was reasonable and whether the ultimate sentence imposed was reasonable under booker.we first review the principles governing departures,then booker,and finally apply them to martin sentence.
section departures 
here,the district court departed downward based on the government motion.as we have previously explained,o nce it has made a motion,the government has no control over whether and to what extent the district court departs from the guidelines,except that if a departure occurs,the government may argue on appeal that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.id.quoting united states pippin,cir quotation marks omitted.in determining the extent of a departure,the district court must consider the factors set forth in a.id.at.those factors,which are,are the court evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant assistance,taking into consideration the government evaluation of the assistance rendered the truthfulness,completeness,and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant the nature and extent of the defendant assistance any injury suffered,or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance and the timeliness of the defendant assistance.a.
this is not an exhaustive list.the district court may consider other factors,but only if the factors relate to the assistance provided by the defendant.united states crisp,cir i n meting out a substantial assistance departure the court may consider factors outside the a list,but only if they are related to the assistance rendered.united states luiz,cir stating w hen a district court grants a downward departure under,the sentence reduction may be based only on factors related to the defendant substantial assistance united states aponte,cir see also cmt.background indicating that the focus is on the nature,extent,and significance of the defendant assistance to the government,this court has reiterated that district courts are prohibited from considering sentencing factors unrelated to the nature and extent of a defendant assistance in making departures.mcvay,at united states davis,cir further,as explained in mcvay,a defendant may not appeal a district court refusal to make a departure,but if the court departs,we will review the government challenge to the extent of a departure under for an abuse of discretion.mcvay,at.
in addition,even,the extent of a district court departure from the guidelines had to be reasonable.williams united states,d united states blas,cir united states melvin,cir united states pippin,cir.when a sentencing court departed from the guidelines,the reviewing court determined the reasonableness of the departure in light of the statutory factors to be considered in imposing a sentence,as stated in a,and the reasons the district court provided for departing.blas,at melvin,at united states nilsen,cir.
as we all now know,booker made the guidelines advisory.district courts still must correctly calculate the advisory guidelines range,and we review any departures outside that range for reasonableness in light of the a factors and the reasons stated by the district court for departing.see,williams,at.as we recently explained,m oreover,after it has decided the length of departure warranted by the substantial assistance motion,the district court is then obliged to take into account the advisory guidelines range and the sentencing factors set forth in a in fashioning a reasonable sentence.mcvay,at citing booker,at.at first emphasis added.
the a factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense the history and characteristics of the defendant the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment the need to protect the public and the guidelines range,id.at citation omitted,as well as the kinds of sentences available,a the need to avoid sentencing disparities among similar defendants who have been found guilty,a and the need to provide restitution to victims of the offense,a.w hen imposing a sentence falling far outside of the guidelines range,based on the a factors,an extraordinary reduction must be supported by extraordinary circumstances.mcvay,at alteration,citation,and quotation marks omitted.
on appeal,i n reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness,we consider the final sentence,in its entirety,in light of the a factors.united states valnor,cir quoting united states thomas,cir see also united states winingear,cir we do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process rather,we review the final sentence for reasonableness.the party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.united states talley,cir.
further,our r eview for reasonableness is deferential.we must evaluate whether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section a.id.t here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose id.there will also be sentences outside the range of reasonableness that do not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in a and that thus the district court may not impose.crisp,at.
we now turn to martin sentence.
martin sentence 
as noted earlier,the government does not dispute that the district court properly calculated martin guidelines range.nor does the government argue that the district court erred in granting martin a downward departure based on his substantial assistance.indeed,the government argued in the district court and maintains on appeal that martin assistance was extraordinary and merited an extraordinary downward departure,such as a sentence rather,the government argues that the district court departure under and imposition of a sentence are both patently unreasonable given the massive and prolonged fraud perpetuated by martin in conspiracy with other healthsouth officers.
with regard to the extent of the departure,the government points out that while martin cooperation was extraordinary,martin did not voluntarily approach the government and expose the fraud when he learned of it,but instead cooperated only after other revealed the fraud and martin role in it.the government stresses that the district court improperly gave no weight to its recommendation and evaluation of martin cooperation.the government also takes issue with the district court interpretation of a and its consideration of martin cooperation that placed him in financial as opposed to physical jeopardy as a a factor in determining the extent of the departure.the government stresses that the a factor concerns physical,not financial,injury and that in any event the only financial risk to martin was that of civil lawsuits by the victims of his crimes.his exposure to civil liability was not caused by his cooperation in the criminal case.
as to the sentence and the a factors,the government emphasizes that the district court unreasonably overemphasized martin assistance and failed to consider adequately other important sentencing factors,such as the severity of martin offense,his financial gain from the crimes in salary and bonuses,and the need to deter similar conduct by individuals who might consider the risk of a sentence a small price to pay for the possibility of reaping millions of dollars by fraudulent means.
the government also relies on mcvay,wherein this court addressed the government challenge to the same district court extraordinary downward departure in sentencing one of martin.in that case,defendant mcvay guidelines range was to months imprisonment,and the district court downwardly departed levels from an offense level to an offense level to a range of to months imprisonment,and then imposed a sentence of months probation.mcvay,at.as we did in the government prior appeal in martin case,this court vacated mcvay sentence and remanded,inter alia,because the district court failed to provide reasons for the departure,and thus the sentence was incapable of meaningful appellate review.id.at.as a result,this court did not have occasion to decide the permissible extent of the departure or whether mcvay probationary sentence was reasonable.however,the court in mcvay did provide the following guidance about the reasonableness of a probationary sentence under the circumstances of the dollar securities fraud at healthsouth 
we pause to note that,in the absence of truly compelling the face of a dollar securities fraud at the expense of the investing probationary term given to the chief financial officer,senior,and treasurer of the company at the time of the fraud who signed the form with full knowledge of its falsity,is not easily reconcilable with the basic factors enumerated by congress in a,including the need for a sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,and to provide just punishment.
in martin case,we now are squarely presented with the question of whether a departure under for his assistance and an ultimate sentence of days imprisonment for this securities fraud are reasonable.the answer is easy they are not.
the extent of the departure alone is unreasonable in this case.we fully accept the district court determination that martin cooperation was extraordinary and merits a correspondingly extraordinary departure.indeed,the government recognized this fact by recommending only a sentence even though martin guidelines range was months,from to approximately years,and his statutory maximum was years,years on count one and on count two.we also recognize that there is always a range of reasonable choices that district courts are in the best position to make.however,the choice of a guidelines departure under to a months guidelines range was unreasonable where martin crimes yielded an advisory guidelines range of years imprisonment and a potential sentence of years.martin cooperation,while commendable and extremely valuable,is not a card.martin cooperation does not wash the slate clean.yet departing levels to a months range effectively accomplishes that by permitting a sentence of no jail time at all,or days,which is close to none.
the departure was also unreasonable because the district court based the extent of the departure in part on an erroneous interpretation of a.section a permits consideration of whether martin suffered any injury or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance.a.the government argues that only physical injury is encompassed within a and that the district court erred in considering how martin cooperation would help plaintiffs in civil lawsuits against him,and thus determining that his cooperation placed his financial in imminent jeopardy.we need not decide whether a is restricted to physical injury because,at a minimum,the type of injury or risk of injury resulting from cooperation contemplated by a certainly does not include civil liability to the victims of martin fraud.those plaintiffs are entitled to pursue civil lawsuits because of martin fraud and not because of his assistance to the government.thus,the district court misapplication of a also contributed to making the extent of the departure unreasonable.indeed,there is no evidence that martin incurred any injury or faces any danger or risk of injury resulting from his assistance to the government.see a 
turning to the ultimate sentence,the district court sentence is shockingly short and wholly fails to serve the purposes of sentencing set forth by congress in a.martin crimes and the district court punishment are so wildly disproportionate that we readily conclude that the district court sentence is also unreasonable and must be vacated.we explain the many reasons why the district court erred in its consideration of the a factors,and why we,for the second time,must vacate martin sentence.
first,the district court sentence wholly fails to take into account the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the crime.see a,a a.martin knowingly participated in a massive and prolonged fraud,served as a leader in that fraud,financially benefitted substantially from the fraud,and cooperated only after the fraud was revealed.while the district court emphasized martin lack of a criminal record and viewed his fraudulent conduct as an aberration in his otherwise outstanding life,martin criminal history category of i already takes into account his lack of a criminal record.despite this lack of a criminal record,martin offense conduct spanned a period of years,during which martin consistently abused the public trust and played a leadership role in a conspiracy that resulted in over a billion dollars of loss harming thousands of victims.martin crimes are major league economic crimes that harmed not only individual victims but also many institutions and companies.this type and scale of crime is peculiarly corrosive to the economic life of the community,as demonstrated by the deleterious effects the fraud in this case had on the healthcare industry and the securities markets.martin not only participated in this fraud for over three years as healthsouth cfo before finally resigning,he also chose not to approach authorities about the conspiracy until they had learned independently about his criminal conduct.put simply,the sentence imposed by the district court wholly fails to take into account the egregious nature of martin crimes.
the sentence imposed by the district court also utterly fails to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.see a b.because economic and crimes are more rational,cool,and calculated than sudden crimes of passion or opportunity,these crimes are prime candidate s for general deterrence.stephanos bibas,plea bargaining and sentencing after booker,mary.defendants in white collar crimes often calculate the financial gain and risk of loss,and white collar crime therefore can be affected and reduced with serious punishment.yet the message of martin sentence is that criminals stand to lose little more than a portion of their gains and practically none of their liberty.
our assessment is consistent with the views of the drafters of.as the legislative history of the adoption of demonstrates,congress viewed deterrence as particularly important in the area of white collar crime,at,reprinted in.congress was especially concerned that prior to the sentencing guidelines,m ajor white collar criminals often were sentenced to small fines and little or no imprisonment.unfortunately,this creates the impression that certain offenses are punishable only by a small fine that can be written off as a cost of doing business.id.the fact that martin guidelines range was months imprisonment evinces congress attempt to curb judicial leniency in the area of white collar crime.the district court sentence not only fails to serve the purposes of,but even worse,undermines those purposes.
while the district court stated summarily that martin devastating experience will deter others similarly situated from engaging in similar criminality,the district court failed to explain how martin sentence contributes to general deterrence in any way.the district court confidence that this defendant has been effectively deterred from any further criminal conduct emphasis added speaks to the goal of preventing rescidivism,see a c,but not to the general need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.a b.indeed,the congress that adopted the sentencing factors emphasized the critical deterrent value of imprisoning serious white collar criminals,even where those criminals might themselves be unlikely to commit another offense 
it is our view that in the past there have been many cases,particularly in instances of major white collar crime,in which probation has been granted because the offender required little or nothing in the way of institutionalized rehabilitative measures and because society required no insulation from the offender,without due consideration being given to the fact that the heightened deterrent effect of incarceration and the readily perceivable receipt of just punishment accorded by incarceration were of critical importance.the placing on probation of a white collar criminal may be perfectly appropriate in cases in which,under all the circumstances,only the rehabilitative needs of the offender are pertinent such a sentence may be grossly inappropriate,however,in cases in which the circumstan
