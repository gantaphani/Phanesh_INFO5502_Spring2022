background 
deloitte audited adelphia financial statements from through.an engagement partner had overall responsibility for each audit.in deloitte rotated dearlove onto the adelphia account as the engagement partner,heading a team of accountants.
john rigas had founded adelphia in and he and his children were the controlling shareholders in.dearlove and the deloitte team described the audit,like many prior audits of adelphia,as posing much greater than normal risk because adelphia engaged in numerous transactions with subsidiaries and affiliated entities,many of which were owned by members of the rigas family.
in adelphia was one of the largest cable television companies in the united states.it had doubled the number of cable subscribers it served by acquiring several other cable companies late in.although its assets were growing,adelphia debt grew substantially as well.the sec found that prior to 
adelphia,its subsidiaries,and some rigas entities entered as into a series of credit agreements.by,adelphia and the rigas entities had obtained billion in credit in,they tripled their available credit and drew down essentially all of the funds available under the agreements.

ii.analysis 
sec rule e provides the sec may deny,temporarily or permanently,the privilege of appearing or practicing before the sec in any way to any person who is found by the commission to have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.e ii.the rule defines three classes of improper professional conduct for accountants intentional or knowing conduct,including reckless conduct,that results in a violation of applicable professional standards,id.e iv a a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct that results in a violation of applicable professional standards,id.e iv b and repeated instances of unreasonable conduct,each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards,that indicate a lack of competence to practice before the commission,id.e iv b.the only issue here is the validity of the sec determination that dearlove repeatedly engaged in unreasonable conduct.
the applicable professional standards referred to in rule e include both the generally accepted auditing standards gaas and the generally accepted accounting principles gaap.see amendment to rule e of the commission rules of practice.the gaas are approved and adopted by the membership of the american institute of certified public accountants,aicpa codification of statements of auditing standards,and concern the quality of the performance and of the judgment exercised by an auditor,id.the gaas require an auditor to have adequate training and audit proficiency,to maintain independence from the company being audited,and to exercise due professional care.dearlove,sec lexis,at,wl.the gaas also set forth an auditor obligation to plan,supervise,and gather evidence in conducting an audit.id.in contrast,the gaap focus not upon an auditor judgment but upon how specific accounting tasks should be performed.see,interpretation of the fasb,i t is a general principle of accounting that the offsetting of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet is improper except where a right or setoff exists.the gaap include statements published by the federal accounting standards advisory board and by the aicpa.
dearlove argues that in order to establish his conduct was unreasonable within the meaning of rule e iv b,the sec had to hold he violated the common law negligence standard of care,as evidenced by expert testimony.he further argues he was denied due process because the alj refused to postpone the hearing for days.
the sec findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.a steadman sec,d.we may not set aside the sec legal conclusions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a rural coop.ass sec.
we reject dearlove legal argument and conclude the appropriate standard of care in this case is supplied by the gaas therefore,the sec need not have received expert testimony to establish the standard of care or to determine whether dearlove conduct was unreasonable.moreover,we find ample evidence in the record to support the sec conclusion that dearlove engaged in repeated instances of unreasonable conduct that resulted in a violation of professional standards.we also reject dearlove argument that he was denied due process.
this is not the first time we have encountered the application of rule e to an accountant,but it is the first time we have reviewed a decision of the commission sanctioning an accountant conduct as merely unreasonable.in checkosky sec,checkosky ii,we were concerned about the sec equivocation as to whether it could find improper professional conduct where an accountant had acted negligently rather than recklessly or with the intent to defraud.id.at.because it was unclear whether simple negligence could support a violation of rule e and,considering the sec failure to articulate a discernible standard,we instructed the commission to dismiss the proceedings under review.id.at.the sec no longer has the problem we identified in checkosky ii the sec amended rule e to make clear that an accountant need not have engaged in intentional,knowing,or reckless conduct to be in violation of the rule.
dearlove draws our attention to two elements of rule e iv b repeated instances of unreasonable conduct and each resulting in a violation of applicable professional standards.he argues that to conclude one has violated the rule,the sec must determine not only that he violated applicable professional standards but also that his conduct was unreasonable.because one of gaas general standards is that due professional care is to be exercised in the
