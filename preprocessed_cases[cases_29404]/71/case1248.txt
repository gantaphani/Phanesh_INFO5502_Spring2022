this case involves a disciplinary action brought by the national association of securities dealers nasd against michael frederick siegel siegel.from october to june,siegel worked as a registered,general securities representative with rauscher pierce refsnes,rauscher,a nasd member firm.in,nasd department of enforcement filed a complaint with nasd office of hearing officers oho charging that,during his tenure with rauscher,siegel violated nasd conduct rules when four of his and huntington downer the downers and dorothy and barry landry the landrys invested in world environmental technologies,world et,a speculative,company in search of financing.world et eventually failed and the downers and landrys lost their investments.in its complaint,the department of enforcement alleged that siegel violated nasd conduct rules and when he sold away,engaged in private securities transactions on behalf of his clients without providing prior written notice to rauscher,and nasd conduct rules and when he recommended world et to his clients without having any reasonable grounds for believing that his recommendations were suitable.
after a hearing,an oho panel found that siegel had engaged in the violations alleged.the panel imposed a suspension and a fine for the rules violations,and a suspension and a fine for the rules violations.the panel declined to impose restitution and the suspensions were to be served concurrently.see dep t of enforcement michael frederick siegel,no,initial oho decision,reprinted in.the matter was appealed to nasd national adjudicatory council nac.following a remand to the oho panel,see in re michael frederick siegel,no.july,initial nac decision,reprinted in,nac affirmed the panel initial findings,with two modifications.nac ordered siegel to serve his suspensions consecutively and ordered siegel to pay restitution in the amounts of to the downers and to the landrys.see in re michael frederick siegel,no.may,second nac decision,reprinted in in re michael frederick siegel,no,nac supplemental decision,reprinted in j.siegel appealed to the sec,which affirmed nac decision on all counts.in re michael frederick siegel,exchange act release,sec decision,sec lexis,at,reprinted in.
in his petition for review to this court,siegel principal argument is that,because the sec failed to properly assess the cause of the losses suffered by the landrys and downers,the agency decision to uphold nasd awards of restitution was an abuse of discretion.we agree.nasd general principle,which the sec purported to apply in this case,describes restitution as a traditional remedy used to restore the status quo ante where a victim otherwise would unjustly suffer loss and it states that restitution may be ordered when a party has suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of a respondent misconduct.general principle,finra sanction guidelines at principle.the sec completely failed to articulate any meaningful standards governing the level of causation required under principle.
this case involves wealthy and sophisticated customers who were under no press of time to decide whether to invest customers who invested specifically in furtherance of a desire to speculate and a broker who did not profit from his wrongdoing and who has been fined and suspended for his violations.there is nothing in the sec decision to indicate why,in these circumstances,awards of restitution are appropriate under principle.indeed,the sec decision is incomprehensible insofar as it attempts to amplify any meaningful causal connection between siegel putative bad acts and the downers and landrys losses.and the sec has cited no precedent,and we have found none,supporting restitution in a case of this sort.the sec judgment is fatally flawed for two reasons first,the sec judgment is not supported by reasoned decisionmaking.second,the sec cites to no controlling precedent that includes reasoned decisionmaking supporting restitution under principle in a case of this sort.we therefore vacate the restitution order.
we reject siegel remaining challenges.substantial evidence supports the sec findings that siegel violated nasd rules barring selling away and unsuitable recommendations.and the sec did not abuse its discretion in imposing fines and consecutive suspensions for siegel separate violations of rules and rules.
background 
siegel involvement in world et 
siegel has worked as a registered general securities representative since.from october,to june,he was associated with rauscher,a nasd member firm.in early,before siegel joined rauscher,he had several conversations with representatives of world et,where he learned of the company burgeoning efforts to offer antibacterial services to the poultry and swine industries.world et representatives advised siegel that the company was seeking to acquire the formula for a product called that could kill of bacteria,fungi,and viruses on contact.in december,world et purchased the formula via a promissory note.
siegel subsequently agreed to join world et board,to serve as a consultant to the company,and to help it raise the capital necessary to go public.on november,siegel submitted a written request to rauscher compliance department for approval to sit on world et board.the department approved siegel request,but noted that siegel would not be able to effect transactions in securities of world et if the company went public.memorandum from jill ivancevich,compliance department,rauscher pierce refsnes,to michael siegel,reprinted in.
siegel involvement with the downers and the landrys 
siegel began managing investments for huntington and linda downer in.huntington downer was a prominent state legislator and former law firm partner,with experience in state budget and finance matters.huntington downer also had previously invested in speculative oil and gas ventures.the combined net worth of the downers was between million and million.when siegel joined rauscher,the downers transferred their holdings to a rauscher account.over time,the couple afforded siegel significant discretion over their funds,providing him complete authority to do what he wanted.tr.of hearing,reprinted in.the downers acknowledged that they were happy with siegel representation.id.at.
siegel visited the downers at their home in early.the purpose of the meeting,according to siegel,was to bring them up to date on the state of their investments.id.at.the parties discussed personal matters,including huntington downer interest in running for governor and siegel new radio show on investing.they also discussed world et,siegel application to serve on the company board,and the product.siegel gave the downers a sample to use on their cat litter box.at some point during this meeting,huntington downer expressed an interest in investing with world et.siegel advised the downers that they could not invest until the company went public,but huntington downer pressed siegel to contact the company and inquire about investment opportunities.siegel subsequently spoke with world et representatives,who informed him that the downers could invest in world ieq technologies,world ieq,a purported subsidiary of world et.siegel relayed this information to the downers,who asked siegel to obtain the documentation necessary for them to invest.
on november,siegel visited the downers again,this time bringing documents related to the proposed world ieq investment.the paperwork included a subscription agreement and a subscriber prospective offeree questionnaire.siegel did not review these documents prior to delivering them.as he later testified,had he done so,he would have seen that the offering documents were deficient.both documents referenced an investment in a debenture,which is an unsecured bond.neither document,however,included any information on interest rates or repayment terms.moreover,the two documents were inconsistent in the limited investment information they provided.huntington downer promptly signed and returned the documents,but siegel still declined to review the paperwork.he did,however,fax the documents to world et.later,on december,siegel transferred from the downers rauscher account to a world ieq bank account after receiving written authorization from the downers to do so.
within two weeks,world et contacted siegel to notify him that the world ieq investment was no longer viable and that the downers could receive a refund of their initial investment or transfer it to world et.when siegel relayed this information to his clients,huntington downer sought siegel advice on how to proceed.in response to this inquiry,siegel told downer i would rather be in the mother company if i had a choice.id.at.the downers subsequently opted to invest in world et.they never received or signed any new documentation concerning the investment.
in november,dorothy and barry landry opened an account with siegel at rauscher.the landrys had recently sold landry business and were looking to invest.they provided siegel with million in funds and afforded him significant independent investment discretion.in late,siegel met with the landrys to complete the paperwork necessary to open their rauscher account.at that meeting,siegel raised the possibility of investing in world et as something the landrys might be interested in and that they should take a look at.id.at.the landrys expressed interest,which siegel relayed to world et.officials at world et then sent along documentation for the landrys to sign.siegel delivered the offering documents to the landrys,but he did not review them.as with the downers,the documentation was deficient.the papers included a subscription agreement that described the purchase of one debenture unit at,but contained no maturity date for the debenture and no interest rate.world environmental technologies,subscription agreement,reprinted in.
on siegel advice,the landrys held onto the documents to review them over the next few months before making a final investment decision.on february,the landrys directed siegel to transfer from their rauscher account to their joint bank account.six days later,the landrys gave the signed documents and a check to siegel,who sent both to world et.world et negotiated the check,but the landrys never received any documentation confirming their investment.
world et was never approved to be publicly traded.the company made its last payment on the promissory note in october.on august,world et lost its rights to.on february,the texas secretary of state revoked world et corporate charter.
siegel direct involvement with world et included signing a resolution authorizing its acquisition of loaning the company on january,entering into an employment agreement on january,to raise a minimum of million for world et in exchange for cash and company shares and making an additional loan to the company of on march.neither siegel,the downers,nor the landrys ever received any payment from world et.
disciplinary proceedings against siegel 
who trade in securities are subject to the regulations covering national securities associations.during the events relevant to this case,nasd was a registered national securities association and acted pursuant to authority to oversee the activities of its members and associated persons.as we explained in national ass of securities dealers,sec,

section,sets out the commission supervisory duties over all organizations.nasd is a organization by virtue of the fact that it is a registered securities association under.see u.a definition of organization.with respect to adjudications,the commission oversight begins with the obligation of organizations to notify the commission of any final disciplinary sanction imposed on a member or associated person.d.the statute also provides the commission with plenary review powers.e.once notified,the commission may,on its own motion or on the application of any person aggrieved by the association action,review nasd disciplinary action.d section e authorizes the commission to make an independent determination as to whether the violations found by the association occurred,and to change nasd sanctions in whatever ways it deems appropriate.see e.the commission may base its determination on the record compiled by the association,but it is not limited to that record and may adduce additional evidence.
on november,nasd department of enforcement filed a complaint with nasd oho.the complaint alleged that siegel violated nasd conduct rules and when he sold away,i,engaged in private securities transactions on behalf of his clients without providing prior written notice to rauscher,and nasd conduct rules and when he recommended world et to his clients without having any reasonable grounds for believing that his recommendations were suitable.complaint,in re michael frederick siegel,no,reprinted in.

nasd conduct rule,nasd manual.it is well settled that a violation of a nasd rule or regulation also constitutes a violation of conduct rule.sec decision,sec lexis,at,citing in re stephen gluckman,exchange act release july,sec lexis,at.
after an initial hearing,the oho panel found that siegel violated rule,rule,and rule.initial oho decision.the panel imposed sanctions,including a fine with a suspension for selling away rules and,and a fine with a separate suspension for making unsuitable recommendations to the downers and landrys rules and.id.at.the panel allowed siegel to serve his two suspensions concurrently and did not order him to pay restitution to the customers.justifying the latter decision,the panel noted that the downers and the landrys were relatively sophisticated persons,who voluntarily chose to invest in a risky enterprise that siegel earned nothing from the transactions and lost his own money and that the customers were separately pursuing arbitration to recoup their losses.id.at.
siegel appealed to nac.after initially remanding the case to the oho panel to make certain credibility determinations and factual findings,see initial nac decision,nac affirmed the panel initial findings with two modifications.see second nac decision.first,nac ordered siegel to serve his suspensions consecutively rather than concurrently.id.at.second,nac ordered siegel to pay restitution in the amounts of to the downers and to the landrys,less any value the customers received from selling their securities,any residual value in the securities that the customers had not sold,and any restitution that the customers had recovered through other avenues.id.at.the case was then referred to a nac subcommittee to determine whether the restitution amounts should be reduced.see id.after receiving a recommendation from the subcommittee,nac concluded that no offsets were required and ordered siegel to pay restitution to the victims to the downers and to the landrys.see nac supplemental decision.
siegel appealed to the sec,which affirmed nac liability and sanction determinations.sec decision,sec lexis,at.on the rule violation,the sec grounded its analysis on the view that a broker may violate the suitability rule if he fails so fundamentally to comprehend the consequences of his own recommendation that such recommendation is unsuitable for any investor,regardless of individual characteristics.id.at,quoting in re kaufman,exchange act release,sec lexis,at.as noted above,siegel acknowledged that he did not review the offering documents that he conveyed to the downers and the landrys.the commission focused on the flaws in those documents and on siegel concession that the deficiencies in the documents rendered an investment in world ieq and world et unsuitable for any investor.id.at.the commission rested on these grounds,explicitly declining to address whether world et was suitable for the downers and the landrys based upon their personal situations.id.at.
on appeal to this court,siegel contests his liability for having made a recommendation to the downers,as well as each of the sanctions imposed by the sec.

standard of review 
the question of whether siegel recommended an investment to the downers under rule is a facts and circumstances inquiry.sec decision,sec lexis,at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the sec findings of fact are reviewed under the very deferential substantial evidence standard,see dolphin bradbury,sec,internal quotation marks and citation omitted,and are conclusive if a reasonable mind might accept the evidentiary record as adequate to support the agency conclusions.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also.a.under this standard,the reviewing court must consider all relevant evidence however,the court may not find substantial evidence merely on the basis of evidence which in and of itself justified the agency decision,without taking into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.morall dea,quoting lakeland bus lines,nlrb,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the reviewing court may not substitute its own judgment for the agency choice between two fairly conflicting views,even if that court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.see universal camera nlrb.

siegel liability for violating rule with respect to the downers 
in conducting its inquiry into whether siegel recommended world et investments to the downers within the meaning of conduct rule,the sec properly considered the content,context,and presentation of siegel communications,and whether,as an objective matter,siegel communication reasonably could have been viewed as a call to action and reasonably would influence an investor to trade a particular security or group of securities.sec decision,sec lexis,at,quoting nasd notice to members,nasd lexis,at.in concluding that siegel recommended world et to the downers,the sec focused on a number of main factors.id.at.these factors included the close relationship between the downers and siegel,the downers reliance on siegel for investment advice,the nature of the specific conversations between the downers and siegel regarding investments in world et,and siegel initiation of conversations concerning world et with the downers.id.at.on the basis of this evidence,the sec concluded that siegel conduct constitute d a recommendation because it was a call to action that reasonably influenced the downers to invest in world et.id.at.
we have little doubt that the sec conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.siegel contends that he specifically discouraged the downers from investing and only acted as an intermediary with world et at huntington downer insistence.pet.br.at.the sec noted,however,that siegel admit ted that he could have refused this request.sec decision,sec lexis,at.siegel also contends that he declined to review the offering documents that he gave to the downers in an attempt to avoid violating rule prohibition against engaging in a private securities transaction without providing written notice to rauscher,and rule prohibition against unsuitable recommendations,and communicated as much to the downers.see pet.br.at.but this explanation does not speak to the question of whether siegel communications with the downers could be perceived by a reasonable person in the downers position as a suggestion to invest in world et and,thus,raise the specter of a violation of rule.
more importantly,as the sec found,following his initial conversations with the downers,siegel encourag ed the downers to invest in world et after learning they could not invest in the subsidiary company,world ieq.sec decision,sec lexis,at.as the agency notes,a fter siegel informed the downers that it was no longer possible to invest in world ieq,he advised them to invest in world et rather than receive a refund on their world ieq investment,stating that he would rather be in the mother company if he had a choice.id.at.siegel provides no explanation for how this statement can be interpreted as anything other than a suggestion to invest in world et.this interaction alone is sufficient to sustain the sec finding that siegel recommended an investment.
mitigating factors 
siegel contends that the sec failed to appropriately consider certain mitigating factors prior to imposing sanctions.his arguments are unpersuasive and warrant little attention here.the government brief on behalf of the sec more than ably addresses this issue 
siegel argues that nasd sanctions are inappropriate in light of allegedly mitigating factors the sec largely brushed aside.t he commission properly found that a number of siegel claims of mitigation were not supported in the record.the remaining claims fall into two categories those that could not be if they were present in the record and those that,although mitigating and present in the record,are outweighed by aggravating factors 
in the first category of claims are those that the commission refused to credit because doing so would turn ignorance of regulatory requirements into excuses for misconduct or reward for simply complying with such requirements.thus,for example,the commission refused to excuse siegel rule violations based on his purported misunderstanding of the rule.as the commission held,that claim is especially not mitigating because of siegel seventeen years of experience as an associated person and the fact that he has been active as a registered investment advisor,authored a book on investment advice,and served as a local media expert on financial topics.
in addition,the commission refused to consider mitigating siegel assertions that he had no disciplinary history cooperated in nasd investigation never performed any act pursuant to the world et employment agreement did not attempt to create the impression that rauscher sanctioned his activities and did not recruit other registered individuals to sell world et securities.siegel also asserts as mitigating that world et securities have not been found to involve a violation of the securities laws or rules.while these are factors listed in the guidelines as either general considerations applicable to all sanction determinations or considerations not every consideration listed in the guidelines has the potential to be mitigating 
thus,as the commission explained,the presence of any of the factors listed above could justify an increase in sanctions,but their absence is not mitigating because an associated person should not be rewarded for acting in compliance with the securities laws and with his duties as a securities professional.
finally,siegel does point to a number of factors that the commission concluded had some mitigating impact that his acts of misconduct were neither numerous nor made over an extended period of time that a small number of customers were involved that those customers were sophisticated and that he disclosed that he was seeking an appointment to world et board.the commission concluded,however,that the mitigating impact of these factors was outweighed by aggravating factors,particularly siegel reckless failure to take any steps to inform himself about the securities he recommended to his clients.gov t br.at internal citations omitted.
the government discussion of this issue needs no amplification.it is sufficient to say that,on the record here,the sec reasonably addressed mitigating and aggravating circumstances in considering sanctions.we reject siegel arguments to the contrary.
concurrent versus consecutive suspensions 
this case represents the first time that the sec has addressed whether the imposition of opposed to is excessive or oppressive.sec decision,sec lexis,at.as an initial matter,it is important to remember that the agency may impose sanctions for a remedial purpose,but not for punishment.mccurdy sec.thus,the sec must review the sanction imposed by the nasd with due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors,paz i,at quoting e,and ensure that it serve s a remedial purpose,as required by the exchange act.id.at see also e.to justify a sanction as remedial,the agency must do more than say,in effect,petitioners are bad and must be punished.paz i,at quoting blinder,robinson sec.the agency must,at the least,give s ome explanation addressing the nature of the violation and the mitigating factors presented in the record.id.at quoting mccarthy sec,cir.however,beyond mak ing the necessary findings regarding the protective interests to be served by expulsion,the agency need not state why a lesser sanction would be insufficient.paz ii,at quoting mccarthy,at.
as the sec noted,nasd nac concluded that because selling away and suitability violations involve different kinds of misconduct and raise separate and serious regulatory concerns,consecutive suspensions would specifically discourage all types of additional misconduct at issue.see sec decision,sec lexis,at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the sec agree d with nasd that siegel violations are different in nature and raise separate public interest concerns.id.at.thus,the sec imposed consecutive suspensions not to punish siegel,but rather to protect the public from two fundamentally different types of harms.
as the agency noted,t he purpose of nasd conduct rule is to protect investors from unsupervised sales and securities firms from exposure to loss and litigation from transactions by associated persons outside the scope of their employment.id.quoting in re chris dinh hartley,exchange act release july,sec lexis,at.the sec thus found that siegel suspension for the rule violation will protect the public interest by discouraging siegel and others from selling away and from undermining the protections in place at firms.id.the purpose of nasd rule,on the other hand,is to protect customers from potentially abusive sales practices by ensuring that a registered representative has reasonable grounds for believing that his recommendation is suitable.id.the sec accordingly found that the separate suspension for the rule violations will protect the public interest by encouraging siegel and others to take the steps necessary to determine that recommendations that they make to their customers are suitable while also deterring them from putting their own interests ahead of those of their customers.id.at.given the deference due to the sec,we can not say that the agency abused its discretion in finding that consecutive,suspensions were not excessive or oppressive.
siegel contends that the sec erred in focusing on his prior bad acts instead of on the current threat he poses to the investing public.some cases have suggested that undue focus on past actions may raise doubts about the propriety of a sanction.see,johnson sec.there is no rigid rule on this,however,because i t is difficult to imagine how any suspension,remedial or not,could be based on anything but past actions.mccurdy,at.
siegel also argues that,in imposing consecutive suspensions,the agency improperly relied on general deterrence,which is essentially a rationale for punishment,not for remediation.paz i,at.we do not agree that the sec erred in this way.this is not a case in which the sec offered no other rationale whatsoever beyond general deterrence.id.furthermore,general deterrence may be considered as part of the overall remedial inquiry.id.quoting mccarthy,at see also mccarthy,at t he sec has expressly adopted deterrence,both specific and general,as a component in analyzing the remedial efficacy of sanctions.
finally,siegel contends that his lack of a disciplinary record subsequent to the events of this case undermines the remedial efficacy of the suspensions.this argument was not raised before the agency,so we decline to consider it here.see c.
in sum,we hold that the sec did not abuse its discretion in upholding the consecutive suspensions imposed by nac.
restitution 
as noted above,siegel principal argument to this court is that,because the sec failed to properly assess the cause of the losses suffered by the landrys and downers,the agency decision to uphold nasd awards of restitution was an abuse of discretion.there is merit to this claim.
in ordering siegel to pay restitution in excess of,in addition to paying fines and serving consecutive suspensions,both the nasd nac and the sec relied on principle in nasd sanction guidelines.see second nac decision,sec decision,sec lexis,at.principle states,in relevant part 
where appropriate to remediate misconduct,adjudicators should order restitution rescission.restitution is a traditional remedy used to restore the status quo ante where a victim otherwise would unjustly suffer loss.adjudicators may determine that restitution is an appropriate sanction where necessary to remediate misconduct.adjudicators may order restitution when an identifiable person,member firm,or other party has suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of a respondent misconduct,particularly where a respondent has benefitted from the misconduct.
adjudicators should calculate orders of restitution based on the actual amount of the loss sustained by a person as demonstrated by the evidence.orders of restitution may exceed the amount of the respondent gain.restitution orders must include a description of the adjudicator method of calculation.
principle,at emphasis added.
counsel for both parties before this court agreed that,under principle,the sec must demonstrate a causal connection between a broker misconduct and any loss at issue.in other words,siegel can not be made to pay restitution to the downers or the landrys unless the sec shows that siegel misdeeds caused their investment losses.what is unclear,however,is the level of causation that is required before the agency may impose restitution.
there are several ways in which to construe the causation requirement of principle.one possibility would be to find that principle requires nothing more than loose,but for causation.under this standard,the agency would be required to determine whether a loss would not have occurred but for the broker misconduct.as we noted in kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,but for causation is an unwieldy concept 
but for causation may be restrictive in some circumstances see prosser keeton on the law of torts ed.often,however,it is viewed as an expansive theory.see,pryor american president lines,cir describing but for causation as a potentially limitless standard under which eve trespass caused all our woe citing harper james,the law of torts see generally prosser keeton,at noting that the breadth of but for causation may depend on whether it is employed as a rule of inclusion or exclusion.
id.at.recognizing that but for causation may indeed be limitless in assessing whether restitution is due for violations,the sec counsel conceded at oral argument that principle requires more than a showing of but for causation in order to justify restitution.
another possibility is proximate causation,which is normally understood to require a direct relation between conduct alleged and injury asserted.see,holmes sec.investor prot.it is noteworthy that,in its decision ordering siegel to pay restitution,nac appears to assume the applicability of proximate cause as the test required by principle.see second nac decisio n,inquiring whether siegel violative conduct ever ceased to be the proximate cause of the customers losses.
yet another possibility is a substantial factor test of causation.this test is sometimes applied when a contested loss has been brought about by two or more concurrent causes.daniels.hadley mem l.under such a test,the agency would be required to show that a broker violation of nasd rules was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to his clients.id.
last but not least is loss causation,best exemplified by the court decision in bastian petren resources,cir.in bastian,the plaintiffs invested in oil and gas limited partnerships promoted by the defendants.the plaintiffs,who were fully intent on investing in oil and gas companies,alleged that without the defendants misrepresentations and misleading omissions,they would not have made these particular investments,which were worthless by because the entire oil and gas market collapsed in the early.id.at.the court noted 
the plaintiffs alleged that they invested in the defendants limited partnerships because of the defendants misrepresentations,and that their investment was wiped out.but they suggest no reason why the investment was wiped out.they have alleged the cause of their entering into the transaction in which they lost money but not the cause of the transaction turning out to be a losing one 
if the plaintiffs would have lost their investment regardless of the fraud,any award of damages to them would be a windfall 
id.at.the court in bastian held that plaintiffs had not sufficiently pled loss causation because they were not told that oil and gas partnerships are.they knew they were assuming a risk that oil prices might drop unexpectedly and were unwilling to try to prove that anything beyond the materializing of that risk caused their loss.id.at.
siegel argued to the sec and to this court that loss causation is the level of causation that is required before the agency may impose restitution pursuant to principle.siegel points out that the downers and the landrys purposefully intended to pursue speculative investments in world et.according to siegel,the customers lost their investments because of world et failure,not because of siegel failure to review the deficient offering documents.in response to siegel insistence that principles of loss causation should be followed in this case,the sec rejected the reasoning of bastian as inapposite,because that case involved a private action for damages under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws where loss causation was an element of the claim.sec decision,sec lexis,at.
we do not mean to suggest that the foregoing tests of causation are always clear or mutually exclusive.they are not.nor do we mean to suggest that we have exhausted all possible tests of causation in pondering the meaning of principle.and we certainly do not mean to suggest that we know which test of causation offers that best construction of principle.we do not.what we do mean to show,however,is from strict liability and limitless notions of but for are a number of ways in which principle might be construed.this responsibility belongs to the sec,not this court.unfortunately,the sec has offered virtually nothing to explain the applicable test of causation under principle.
as noted above,principle sets forth a causation requirement in the following terms adjudicators may order restitution when an identifiable person,member firm,or other party has suffered a quantifiable loss as a result of a respondent misconduct principle,at emphasis added.in footnote of its opinion,the sec offered the following explanation of this causation requirement 
in requiring that a loss be a result rather than the result of a respondent misconduct,we acknowledge that other factors may bear upon the loss and that any determination as to the propriety of restitution will be based on an analysis of all the relevant facts and circumstances.
sec decision,sec lexis,at,underscoring in original.t his explanation is nonsense,and the two phrases together are not even compatibly nonsensical.allentown mack sales,nlrb.whether a loss is the sole result or one of many results of a broker misconduct is irrelevant to the causation issue raised by siegel.moreover,the second part of footnote does not even reflect an acknowledgment by the commission that principle requires some meaningful causal connection between a broker misconduct and the losses suffered by his clients.rather,in footnote,the commission does no more than assert that it will decide whether to impose restitution on the basis of an analysis of all the relevant facts and circumstances.sec decision,sec lexis,at.this explanation tells neither the reviewing court nor the regulated parties anything about the degree of causal connection that the commission will require between proven misconduct and a loss before imposing restitution,or how the commission intends to measure the substantiality of that connection.this is entirely unacceptable.as the court noted in allentown mack,n ot only must an agency decreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority,but the process by which it reaches that result must be logical and rational.at.
the sec based its decision on the proposition that as between siegel customers,who were placed in unsuitable investments and siegel,who recommended them,equity requires siegel,as the person responsible for the losses,to bear the burden and to return the customers to the position occupied prior to the unsuitable recommendations.sec decision,sec lexis,at.the agency own analysis,however,makes clear that the unsuitability of the recommendations stemmed not from a level of risk associated with the investments that the customers were otherwise unwilling to bear,but rather from the terms of the investment offering documents,which were deficient.tellingly,there is nothing in the sec decision demonstrating that the customers losses came as a result of these document deficiencies.indeed,had the investment paperwork that siegel provided to his clients not been deficient,the downers and the landrys still would have suffered the same losses once world et failed.moreover,in resting its analysis on the deficient offering documents,the sec declined to address whether world et was suitable for the downers and the landrys based upon their personal situations.id.at.
in failing to articulate a comprehensible principle governing the level of causation required by principle,the sec decision borders on whimsical or rests on notions of strict liability.in either event,the decision offers no r
