grant thornton llp,a national accounting firm,appeals the district court interlocutory order certifying this action as a class action to adjudicate the plaintiffs claims against grant thornton in connection with the demise of the first national bank of keystone in keystone,west virginia.grant thornton contends principally that the district court,in finding that the predominance requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b was satisfied,erred in accepting at face value the plaintiffs allegations that the reliance element of their fraud claims could be presumed under a theory without determining whether the plaintiffs had any basis for making the allegations.the district court,concerned about making findings that would overlap with and therefore prejudice issues on the merits,concluded that the plaintiffs assertions alone were enough at the certification stage to justify certifying a class action under rule b.
as more fully discussed below,we conclude that the district court reliance on mere assertions did not fulfill the requirements that the district court take a close look at relevant matters,conduct a rigorous analysis,and make findings in determining whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated that the requirements of rule b have been satisfied.we conclude,however,that the district court did not abuse its discretion,as argued by grant thornton,in its appointment of two of the plaintiffs as lead class representatives.accordingly,we affirm in part and vacate in part the district court certification order,and we remand this case for further proceedings.
until the early,the first national bank of keystone keystone was a relatively small community bank in mcdowell county,west virginia.in,keystone embarked on a growth strategy through which it became a niche lender focusing on subprime mortgage loans,loans extended to higher risk borrowers,and in late,it began buying federal housing authority home improvement loans,pooling them,and selling shares in them to process called loan securitization.to pursue its loan securitization business,keystone entered into financing relationships with other banks,paying higher than normal interest rates.in,keystone began to securitize its own high loans made to highly leveraged borrowers with little or no collateral.during these years,keystone made its highly risky securitization business its principal business.from,when keystone had assets of million,to,keystone business grew almost tenfold.in,keystone was reported to be one of the most profitable community banks in the nation,and by,it reported assets of billion.keystone was listed in american banker june list of the most profitable large community banks,with a whopping return on average assets in.
from until,the office of the comptroller of the currency occ examined keystone books annually,but the examinations proved unsatisfactory to occ because of mutual distrust and the bank resistance to examiners findings.the examinations repeatedly uncovered unsafe and unsound banking practices and regulatory violations,yet occ enforcement actions proved largely ineffective.in may,pursuant to an agreement with the occ to hire an outside auditor,keystone hired the accounting firm of grant thornton llp.grant thornton issued an audit report on april,the audit report,which revealed no problem in keystone statement of assets.the july edition of walker manual of unlisted stocks included a of keystone that identified grant thornton as keystone auditor and that reported summary figures taken from grant thornton audit report.during the period that grant thornton was keystone accountant,grant thornton also participated to some extent in the preparation of keystone call reports,which keystone filed quarterly with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic.these call reports were available to the public on the fdic website.
while occ examinations of keystone generally focused on the credit risk associated with subprime mortgage loan securitizations,it was not until august that occ independently verified that keystone was unable to substantiate million in loan assets,constituting almost of its assets.on september,the occ announced that keystone was insolvent,and it closed the bank.a few months later,the fdic bank insurance fund determined that the keystone failure would cost the fund between and million,making the loss one of the largest in history.a subsequent investigation by the office of inspector general determined that keystone had been suffering heavy losses early in its growth period and that by late keystone had become insolvent.keystone concealed its financial condition by continuing to record loans as assets even after they had been sold to investors as part of a securitized loan pool.the office of inspector general concluded that a lleged fraudulent accounting practices,uncooperative bank management and reported high profitability may have all served to mask the bank true financial condition from occ examiners.
the plaintiffs,who were purchasers of keystone stock during the period after grant thornton issued its audit report on april,and before the occ closed the bank on september,commenced this action to recover damages suffered by reason of the bank failure.the plaintiffs proposed to represent a class of all purchasers of keystone stock during the period.their amended complaint,which alleged four counts of federal securities fraud and seven counts of fraud under state law,named as defendants grant thornton,other accountants,former keystone directors and officers,and other keystone stockholders who allegedly dumped keystone stock based on inside information.
plaintiffs settled their claims with a number of the defendants,including keystone former auditors,keystone outside directors,and certain of the broker defendants.to implement the settlement agreement,the district court certified a class and,after a final fairness hearing conducted on june,approved the class settlement as to the settling defendants.no one objected to the settlement,and it has now become final.grant thornton,however,was not a party to the settlement and has continued to defend this action.
in the complaint counts against grant thornton,the plaintiffs alleged violations of b of the securities exchange act and rule promulgated thereunder,as well as five state counts for fraud,constructive fraud,negligent misrepresentation,aiding and abetting tortious conduct,and civil conspiracy.the plaintiffs alleged that grant thornton participated in falsifying certain material financial information regarding keystone and issued the audit report knowing that at least million of keystone assets did not exist,or at a minimum,recklessly representing that such assets did exist.they also alleged that keystone insiders illegally dumped keystone stock at inflated prices with the participation of certain stockbrokers who,when pitching keystone,relied on,and in some cases provided class members with,the audit report,the in walker manual,the call reports,and the american banker ratings.the plaintiffs purport to represent a class consisting of or more persons who purchased stock between april,the date of the audit report and september,the date when the occ closed keystone.during the class period,these class members engaged in approximately trades of keystone stock involving,in the aggregate,shares.
in their motion to certify the action as a class action under federal rule of civil procedure b,the plaintiffs recognized that the element of reliance in their fraud claims may require individualized determinations.to satisfy commonality and the predominance of common issues,however,they relied on a presumption of reliance that can be made under a theory when shares are purchased in an efficient market.pointing to the allegations of their complaint,they maintained that they adequately alleged that the market for keystone stock did in fact exhibit the five hallmarks of an efficient market,as necessary for a theory.consequently,they claimed that they were entitled to a presumption of reliance,which would permit the district court to find fulfilled the requirement of rule b that common issues predominate over issues involving only individual class members.
by an order dated march,the district court ruled that plaintiffs could maintain this action as a class action under rule b,and it appointed horst bischoff and debra gariety as lead representative plaintiffs.in its order,the court acknowledged that plaintiffs were in fact exposed to differing combinations of omissions and misrepresentations,including some oral,making individual reliance a live issue.to conclude that common issues predominated over individualized ones,as required by rule b,the court relied on a presumption of reliance based on a theory,which requires that the plaintiffs have purchased in an efficient market for keystone stock.in response to grant thornton argument that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the presumption because keystone stock was not in fact traded on an efficient market,the court stated 
this court declines to make a detailed examination here of the efficiency of the market in which keystone shares were traded because it would require the court to make judgments and conclusions regarding the extent and nature of the fraud alleged by the plaintiffs.such determinations,in the absence of the procedural safeguards available at trial or the legal standard of sufficiency for summary judgment,could theoretically prejudice a party the court finds the fact that the plaintiffs have asserted that the keystone market was efficient is enough at the certification stage to find the market efficient.
in response to grant thornton additional argument that rule b could not be satisfied because plaintiffs claims involved the application of laws from several different states,the district court acknowledged that the laws of at least six states would apply but concluded,with little further explanation,that the variation in those laws was minimal.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f,grant thornton requested permission to appeal the district court interlocutory certification order,and on may,we granted that request.this appeal followed.
the underlying principles for certifying a class action are not controverted.a district court may,in its discretion,order that an action proceed as a class action only if it finds that the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure have been satisfied.every class action must satisfy the four requirements of rule a numerosity,typicality,commonality,and adequacy of representation,with the final three requirements tend ing to merge.broussard meineke disc.muffler shops,cir quoting.of the southwest falcon,d.in addition,a proposed class must also satisfy the requirements of one of the three rule b categories.in this case,the plaintiffs requested certification of the class under rule b,which requires the court to find that questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members the predominance requirement,and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy the superiority requirement.rule b predominance requirement is far more demanding than rule a commonality requirement and tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.amchem,windsor,d.the plaintiffs who propose to represent the class bear the burden of demonstrating that the requirements of rule are satisfied.lienhart dryvit,cir.
the claims on which the plaintiffs seek to proceed against grant thornton as representatives of a class are essentially claims under federal and state law.to prove a violation of the federal antifraud provisions of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule promulgated thereunder,a plaintiff must prove that,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,the defendant made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied that proximately caused the plaintiff damages.longman food lion,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the parties agree that the requirements for state common law fraud and negligent misrepresentation have analogous elements.because proof of reliance is generally individualized to each plaintiff allegedly defrauded,see gunnells healthplan,cir,fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims are not readily susceptible to class action treatment,precluding certification of such actions as a class action.see broussard,at andrews v.at t,cir decertifying class in part because the plaintiffs would have to show,on an individual basis,that they relied on the misrepresentations,suffered injury as a result,and incurred a demonstrable amount of damages castano am.tobacco,cir concluding that a fraud class action can not be certified when individual reliance will be an issue.as the supreme court explained in basic,levinson,d,r equiring proof of individualized reliance from each member of the proposed plaintiff class effectively would have prevented plaintiffs from proceeding with a class action,since individual issues then would have overwhelmed the common ones.both the plaintiffs and the district court recognized the barriers to certifying a class action where proof of individualized reliance would have to be proved because such individual issues would then likely overwhelm the common ones and preclude the court from finding satisfaction of the predominance requirement of rule b.
reliance can,however,be treated as a common issue if it is presumed under the theory that the defendants defrauded the the individual long as the plaintiffs purchased their stock in an efficient market.the theory was recognized by the supreme court in basic as a way to litigate class actions.
in basic,the court acknowledged that rule actions include a reliance element and recognized that proof of individualized reliance from each class member effectively would have prevented the plaintiff from proceeding with a class action,given the commonality and predominance requirements of rules a and b.at.but the court held that this barrier could be overcome with a rebuttable presumption of reliance that may be applied through a theory.id.at.quoting the third circuit,basic described the theory as follows 
the fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements the causal connection between the defendants fraud and the plaintiffs purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in the case of direct reliance on misrepresentations.
id.at.quoting peil speiser,cir.the basic court emphasized the difference between modern securities markets,literally involving millions of shares changing hands daily,and the transactions contemplated by early fraud cases id.at.with transactions,the reliance inquiry focuses on the subjective pricing of information before an investor.id.at.in a modern securities market,by contrast,
the market is interposed between seller and buyer and,ideally,transmits information to the investor in the processed form of a market price.thus the market is performing a substantial part of the valuation process performed by the investor in a transaction.the market is acting as the unpaid agent of the investor,informing him that given all the information available to it,the value of the stock is worth the market price.
id.quoting in re ltv sec.persuaded that the market price of shares traded on markets reflects all publicly available information,and,hence,any material misrepresentations,the court concluded that a n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.id.at.the court held that b ecause most publicly available information is reflected in market price,an investor reliance on any public material misrepresentations,therefore,may be presumed for purposes of a rule action.id.at.
application of the reliance presumption is not,however,automatic in all federal actions.to gain the benefit of the presumption,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made public misrepresentations that the misrepresentations were material that the shares were traded on an efficient market and that the plaintiff purchased the shares after the misrepresentations but before the truth was revealed.basic,at.citing levinson basic,cir.
in this case,grant thornton contends that the theory can not be applied to create the reliance presumption because keystone shares were not traded on an efficient market,and grant thornton did not make any public,misrepresentations on which the market could rely.it therefore contends that as a matter of law,the district court erred in applying the presumption of reliance.without that presumption,the plaintiffs must prove individualized reliance and therefore almost certainly can not meet the requirement of b that common questions predominate over questions affecting only individual members.grant thornton also contends that the district court erred by refusing to look beyond the pleadings in determining that the presumption of reliance applied in this case.
in its certification order,the district court recognized that the predominance requirement can be a sticking point in securities class action certifications where fraud is alleged because individual issues of reliance on fraudulent misrepresentations may be such as to undercut a showing of predominance.indeed,the court observed that in this case plaintiffs were in fact exposed to differing combinations of omissions and misrepresentations,including some oral,making individual reliance a live issue.to overcome this barrier to finding predominance under rule b,the district court applied a presumption of reliance through the theory.in determining whether the conditions for application of this theory were satisfied,the court examined the plaintiffs complaint and concluded that the complaint had adequately alleged the elements of a theory,thereby justifying the creation of a presumption of reliance.explaining its refusal to look beyond the complaint,the court stated that it was declin ing to make a detailed examination here of the efficiency of the market in which keystone shares were traded because it would require the court to make judgments and conclusions regarding the extent and nature of the fraud alleged by the plaintiffs.citing eisen carlisle jacquelin,d,for the proposition that no inquiry into the merits of a case can be held at the certification stage,the district court simply relied on keystone allegations in the complaint and based on those allegations found that 
the fact that the plaintiffs have asserted that the keystone market was efficient is enough at the certification stage to find the market efficient the plaintiffs further assert that they all purchased keystone stock during the period when the fraud they allege was perpetrated on the market.accordingly,the plaintiffs have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that they are entitled to a presumption of reliance for their fraud claims under the securities exchange act.
we conclude that,by accepting the plaintiffs allegations for purposes of certifying a class in this case,the district court failed to comply adequately with the procedural requirements of rule.rule b on its face requires the court to find that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members emphasis added.in addition,the rule lists numerous factors for the court to consider in making its findings.if it were appropriate for a court simply to accept the allegations of a complaint at face value in making class action findings,every complaint asserting the requirements of rule a and b would automatically lead to a certification order,frustrating the district court responsibilities for taking a close look at relevant matters,amchem,at,for conducting a rigorous analysis of such matters,falcon,at,and for making findings that the requirements of rule have been satisfied,see.b.moreover,if courts could only consider the pleadings,then parties would have wide latitude to inject frivolous issues to bolster or undermine a finding of predominance.robert bone david evans,class certification and the substantive merits,duke.
when rule c,which originally required certification orders to be made as soon as practicable after commencement of the action,was amended in to require the court to determine class certifications at an early practicable time,the advisory committee on civil rules explained the preexisting and longstanding practice that prompted the change 
time may be needed to gather information necessary to make the certification decision.although an evaluation of the probable outcome on the merits is not properly part of the certification decision,discovery in aid of the certification decision often includes information required to identify the nature of the issues that actually will be presented at trial.in this sense,it is appropriate to conduct controlled discovery into the merits,limited to those aspects relevant to making the certification decision on an informed basis.
advisory committee note to amendments emphasis added.
the eisen decision,upon which the district court relied,does not require a court to accept plaintiffs pleadings when assessing whether a class should be certified.in eisen,the supreme court held that the district court preliminary hearing on the merits of the that the plaintiff was more than likely to inappropriate for the purpose of determining whether a class action could be maintained.at.eisen simply restricts a court from expanding the rule certification analysis to include consideration of whether the proposed class is likely to prevail ultimately on the merits.see castano,at moore federal practice a ed.as the supreme court itself stated in a case,sometimes it may be necessary for the district court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.falcon,at.see also coopers lybrand livesay,d t he class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,while an evaluation of the merits to determine the strength of plaintiffs case is not part of a rule analysis,the factors spelled out in rule must be addressed through findings,even if they overlap with issues on the merits.eisen prohibition against assessing plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits as part of a rule certification does not mean that consideration of facts necessary to a rule determination is foreclosed merely because they are required to be proved as part of the merits.the analysis under rule must focus on the requirements of the rule,and if findings made in connection with those requirements overlap findings that will have to be made on the merits,such overlap is only coincidental.the findings made for resolving a class action certification motion serve the court only in its determination of whether the requirements of rule have been demonstrated.
the district court concern that rule findings might prejudice later process on the merits need not lead to the conclusion that such findings can not be made.the jury or factfinder can be given free hand to find all of the facts required to render a verdict on the merits,and if its finding on any fact differs from a finding made in connection with class action certification,the ultimate factfinder finding on the merits will govern the judgment.a model for this process can be observed in the context of the preliminary injunction practice.courts make factual findings in determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue,but those findings do not bind the jury adjudging the merits,and the jury findings on the merits govern the judgment to be entered in the case.see,of camenisch,d.
at bottom,we agree with the conclusion reached by the seventh circuit when it observed 
the proposition that a district judge must accept all of the complaint allegations when deciding whether to certify a class can not be found in rule and has nothing to r
