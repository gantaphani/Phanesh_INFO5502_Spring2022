as an initial matter,gamco argues that the district court erred in concluding that because vivendi demonstrated that plaintiffs are value investors,vivendi proved gamco did not rely on the integrity of the market in purchasing vivendi securities.gamco br.at.according to gamco,though it,like most value investors,does not believe that the market price necessarily equals,at any given time,the efficient value of a security and thus makes its money by identifying under or securities,halliburton forecloses the conclusion that this fact alone suffices to rebut the presumption vivendi,for its part,suggests that such a showing indeed suffices to rebut the presumption.see vivendi br.at teamsters loc.freight div.pension fund bombardier,cir.the theory involves the rebuttable presumption that investors rely on the market price of securities as an accurate measure of their intrinsic value.quoting hevesi citigroup,cir.
it is true that the district court reasonably found facts that demonstrate that gamco purchasing decisions relied in large part on an independent valuation of the worth of vivendi securities that was separate and distinct from the market price.the district court found that gamco would begin by calculating a private market value pmv for a given security a value that approximated the price that an informed industrialist would be willing to pay for the company,if each of its segments were valued independently in a private market sale.gamco,d at.gamco would then compare this pmv to the public market price.if there was a sufficiently large spread between the pmv and the market price,and if there was evidence of the existence of a catalyst,id.at,or some dynamic that gamco thought was going to help surface value over time,then gamco would generally elect to purchase the security in question.employees at gamco often referred to its pmv as the intrinsic value of the stock,see,and frequently referred to the market price,in contrast,as reflecting the whims of the sometimes irrational market.
though the district court indeed found that gamco does not necessarily consider the market price to be an efficient reflection of the objective value of a security at any given time,however,it explicitly disclaimed any reading of its opinion as suggesting that this fact was sufficient,on its own,to rebut the presumption.see gamco,d at o ne can imagine a case where an investor used the market price of a security merely as a comparator with a private method of valuation,but in which the fraud on the market presumption could not fairly be rebutted,because,but for the material misstatements,that investor would not have transacted in the securities at issue.we thus decline to explicate the contours of halliburton here,further theorize on the presumption,or otherwise address the relevance of the typical value investing model to a rebuttal showing.the district court holding was,instead,based on a much narrower theory that,given the facts in the record,vivendi proved that gamco would have purchased vivendi securities even had it known of vivendi alleged fraud.see halliburton.at observing that a defendant may rebut the presumption by demonstrating,inter alia,that a plaintiff would have bought or sold the stock even had he been aware that the stock price was tainted by fraud kline wolf,cir.noting that the presumption may be rebutted through a showing that plaintiffs did not significantly rely on the integrity of the market or that,even if they had known of the alleged misrepresentation,they would still have purchased the stock gamco argues that this factual conclusion was error,and asserts that i t was clearly erroneous for the district court to find that a sophisticated financial manager would purchase securities in advance of undisclosed adverse information which would have the predic t able impact of causing market prices to decline.gamco reply br.at.our review of the record demonstrates that it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to so conclude as to gamco itself.under that deferential standard of review,we must accept the district court findings of fact unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.souratgar lee,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore need not,and do not,decide whether we would have reached the same factual conclusions as the district court.
first,though gamco repeatedly asserts on appeal that it is all but unthinkable that a sophisticated investor would ever buy a security if he was aware its market price might be tainted by fraud,the idea was not so ridiculous to the chief investment officer of gabelli.asked whether he would buy a stock in a company where he knew the price was inflated as a result of a management fraud,mario gabelli testified that such a purchase was possible,but very unlikely,and clarified that he would assign a probability to such a scenario.he went on to qualify this statement,noting t here would have to be a lot of other circumstances.id.at.the district court largely dismissed gabelli testimony as motivated hairsplitting by an interested witness.gamco,d at.it is thus highly significant that a prominent witness the district court believed was exaggerating the facts in favor of the plaintiffs admitted on the stand that,in the abstract,there was a ten percent possibility that,in a given case,he would buy stock inflated by fraud.such testimony,at minimum,established in contrast to gamco repeated suggestions that gamco had no ironclad policy against purchasing a stock it believed might be inflated by fraud,provided that other circumstances made the deal one worth pursuing.
to that end,the record in this case includes sufficient evidence supporting the district court finding that such circumstances were present here in other words that,even if aware of vivendi liquidity problems and its concealment of those problems,gamco would still have believed the deal it made was a good one.as already noted,the district court reasonably found that the core of gamco investment decisions could be reduced to two questions first,was there a material spread between market price and pmv,and second,was there reason to believe a catalyst would cause the market to recognize this discrepancy in the next two to five years.evidence in the record also supported the district court conclusion that,had gamco known of the liquidity problems at vivendi,such knowledge would not have altered the answers to either of these questions.
as to the spread,andrew rittenberry,the analyst primarily responsible for calculating vivendi pmv in the relevant period,testified that,once he learned of the liquidity crisis at vivendi as the fraud came to light,the knowledge of the liquidity problems had no impact on his pmv calculation,as he believed those problems constituted a issue s omething that could be solved within a year or so.rittenberry also testified that pmv was generally calculated to anticipate the value of the company over the long haul.this testimony further supports the district court factual finding that gamco would not have believed that a problem,especially one that it did not perceive to be as significant as the market ultimately came to believe it was,would affect its calculation of the spread.see noting that,in calculating the pmv,rittenberry projected the business performance of the differen t pieces of the business over a period t he goal in buying a stock is to have it appreciate percent over a period testimony of mario gabelli so the way we think is like a mckinsey thinking out over the next five or ten years.thus,the record supports the district court conclusion that,if gamco had known of the liquidity problems and their concealment,gamco would still have believed vivendi pmv to be materially higher than the public market price.
second,it was also not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that knowledge of vivendi liquidity problems would not have changed gamco belief that a catalyst was likely,its belief that the market price would rise towards the pmv,if not immediately,then over the course of the next several years.such evidence came in various forms.first,gamco continued to buy vivendi securities as the full extent of vivendi alleged fraud came to light.gamco argues that this information is hardly dispositive of whether gamco would have purchased prior to the revelation of the fraud at the same price at which it purchased given that the revelation caused the market price to fall as inflation dissipated.that may indeed be so,but the evidence is specifically relevant to the narrower question whether knowledge of the liquidity problems would have affected gamco belief in the existence of a catalyst.that gamco continued to buy reasonably suggested to the district court that gamco still believed a catalyst to be on the horizon and thus demonstrated that the liquidity problems had not altered,and would not have altered,this conclusion.further,gabelli testified that a change of management was one of the most frequent catalysts on which gamco would rely in purchasing a stock.this testimony further reinforced the district court factual findings had gamco known of the liquidity problems at vivendi notwithstanding whether they had been fraudulently concealed,the potential for a change in management would have seemed even more likely.
in short,evidence in the record supported the district court in concluding that,had gamco known of vivendi liquidity problems,gamco would still have believed,first,that vivendi securities were substantially undervalued by the market and second,that an event was likely to happen in the next few years that would awaken the market to that fact.further,the record provided sufficient evidence to find that gamco would have believed that,even if the liquidity crisis in fact came to light,it would resolve within a short period of time and thus,that even if the market price might go down in the short run,the potential for profit still remained.in other words,whereas one can imagine situations in the abstract where a sophisticated investor,apprised of a fraud,would necessarily conclude that a security was no longer a logical purchase,the district court did not clearly err in concluding,on this record,that in this case,and with regard to this particular fraud,gamco would still have viewed vivendi securities as a profitable investment even if it might have been concerned about the hidden liquidity risks.
gamco counters this extensive evidence by citing,almost exclusively,to testimony of andrew rittenberry,which gamco employs to argue that the district court factual findings were clearly erroneous.asked whether,assuming the information did not affect his pmv calculation,a liquidity crisis would similarly not affect his buy,sell,or hold recommendation,rittenberry replied,n o,not necessarily.the big driver,he continued,is pmv.but the discount to the pmv between the market price and the pmv is a key factor.if there is a liquidity crisis or some type of event like that,you would expect the discount to widen.i mean you would expect the stock to go down.id.when further asked whether he would expect the public market price to go down,rittenberry answered,y es.you would want to buy it in front of that if you thought it was going to go down,you would wait to buy it or buy more or recommend to buy more at that point.id.
pointing to rittenberry testimony,gamco argues that even if it would not have believed the liquidity problems to affect vivendi pmv,and even if it would still have believed it likely the investment would be profitable over the long run,the record renders clearly erroneous the district court finding that it would have purchased vivendi securities had it known of the fraud.this is because,gamco argues,even if it indeed still thought vivendi securities were materially undervalued notwithstanding the crisis,it would have waited until the liquidity crisis came to light and then bought the stock.such a delayed purchase not only would have mitigated the risk associated with the undisclosed liquidity problems as fraud always creates some risk that the underlying calculations are erroneous,but also would have potentially netted gamco a more profitable investment.
it was not clearly erroneous,however,for the district court to find that gamco would indeed have purchased vivendi securities at the price quoted,rather than simply await the potential of a public liquidity crisis.first,both rittenberry testimony and gamco argument rest on the assumption that rittenberry and gamco would have known that the stock price would indeed go down upon revelation of the liquidity crisis.as already noted,however,the district court reasonably found facts demonstrating that rittenberry,or gamco,apprised of the hidden liquidity risks,would not have been so certain.at the time gamco had to make its purchasing decision,even if it had known of the fraud,it would not have been able to see the future.and the record evidence as to how gamco would have approached determining how likely it was that the hidden risks would be exposed in a way that would materially affect the market price does not support gamco position.
thus,rittenberry testified that,when he did find out about the liquidity problems,he believed that they constituted a very concern with minimal imp
