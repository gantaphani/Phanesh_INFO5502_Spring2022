introduction 
in the aftermath of their failed investment in prosper marketplace,prosper,an online money lending service,christian hellum,and david booth plaintiffs filed the instant class action lawsuit against prosper and its corporate officers based on alleged violations of california and federal securities laws.three of the named defendants who served as prosper outside directors,james breyer,larry cheng,and robert kagle collectively,the outside directors filed a demurrer arguing that plaintiffs had failed to plead sufficient facts to establish that the outside directors were liable on any of the three causes of action pled against them pursuant to corporations code section section and title of the securities act of,united states code section title of the securities act 
in seeking demurrer,the outside directors argued that in order to state a cause of action under each of plaintiffs theories of liability,plaintiffs were required to plead facts showing that the outside directors asserted control over prosper,the primary violator,and that plaintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts establishing such control.accepting this contention,the trial court sustained the outside directors demurrer,and entered a judgment of dismissal in their favor.plaintiffs appeal,contending that the judgment of dismissal entered in favor of the outside directors should be reversed because plaintiffs complaint stated a claim under every theory of liability pled under both section and title of the securities act.
we agree with plaintiffs that under one of the many provisions of section establishing liability for specific classes of individuals,presumptive liability is imposed for directors and officers of any corporation that violates specified state securities statutes,regardless of whether the particular officers and directors actually exercised control over the corporation.therefore,the trial court erred in imposing a control requirement where none existed,and in sustaining the outside directors demurrer to this cause of action on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts demonstrating such control.
as for the remaining two theories of liability pled against the outside directors under title of the securities act and a different provision of section,plaintiffs concede as to those claims,they must establish that outside directors were in a position of control.in examining the allegations relating to these separate causes of action,we conclude that plaintiffs complaint alleged sufficient facts demonstrating that outside directors possessed such control.accordingly,we reverse.
facts and procedural history 
prosper,a closely held corporation based in san francisco,california,was formed in march.its sole business was the operation of an online lending program through its website.prosper lending platform functioned like a auction,connecting individuals who wished to borrow money with individuals,like plaintiffs,who wished to purchase loans extended to borrowers.lenders and borrowers were prohibited from dealing directly with one another.they registered on the website and created prosper identities.
potential borrowers could request unsecured loans in amounts between and by posting listings indicating the amount they wanted to borrow and the maximum interest rate they would be willing to pay.prosper assigned borrowers a credit score based on a commercial credit score obtained from a credit bureau,but prosper did not verify personal information,such as employment and income.potential lenders bid on funding all or portions of loans for specified interest rates,which were typically higher than rates available from depository accounts at financial institutions.each loan was usually funded with bids by multiple lenders.after an auction closed and a loan was fully bid upon,the borrower received the requested loan with the interest rate fixed by prosper at the lowest rate acceptable to all winning bidders.
prosper charged an origination fee from each borrower and a servicing fee from each lender.in return,prosper administered the loan program by collecting and distributing payments to the lenders,and by initiating procedures to collect past due loans from borrowers,including the assignment of delinquent loan accounts to collection agencies.
as of october,prosper had initiated approximately million in loans and had over members,including both borrowers and lenders.on approximately october,prosper announced that it would temporarily cease underwriting and selling loan notes on its website.on november,the securities and exchange commission sec imposed a order against prosper pursuant to section of the securities act of.the sec made a number of findings,including that t he loan notes issued by prosper are securities and prosper,from approximately january through october,violated sections a and c of the securities act,which prohibit the offer or sale of securities without an effective registration statement or a valid exemption from registration.
plaintiffs,who purchased loan notes through prosper and who suffered losses,brought this lawsuit against prosper and its corporate officials,including the outside directors,seeking to represent a nationwide class of lenders who participated in prosper online lending program.in plaintiffs second amended complaint sac,the operational complaint for our purposes,plaintiffs alleged violations of state and federal securities laws arising out of the purchase and sale of approximately million of nonexempt,unqualified,and unregistered loan note securities between january,and october.plaintiffs claimed that as of july,approximately million worth of loan notes purchased by lenders had become worthless because the borrowers had not repaid the loans to prosper.
of the seven causes of action alleged in the sac,three were leveled against the outside directors.the third and fourth causes of action alleged that the outside directors violated separate provisions of section.under the pertinent provisions of section,the following persons are jointly and severally liable for selling unqualified securities,with those who have engaged in an unlawful practice every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or,every partner in a firm so liable,every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable,unless the other person who is so liable had no knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.person is defined as including individuals and corporations.
in the third cause of action,plaintiffs sought to hold the outside directors liable under the first provision in section,spelling out liability for every person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or.the third cause of action alleged that the outside directors were liable under this provision because b y virtue of their executive positions,board membership these individuals had the power to influence and control and did influence and control,directly or indirectly,the of the company,including the decision to offer and sell loan note securities in california without qualification or an exemption.
in the fourth cause of action,plaintiffs sought to plead a cause of action under section based solely on the outside directors status as directors of prosper.so framed,the fourth cause of action alleged the outside directors were liable because they fell within the classification of every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable.
in the seventh cause of action,plaintiffs sought to hold the outside directors liable under title of the securities act,imposing joint and several liability upon persons for acts committed by those under their control that violate federal registration requirements.specifically,title of the securities act provides every person,who,by or through stock ownership,agency,or otherwise,or who,pursuant to or in connection with an agreement or understanding with one or more other persons by or through stock ownership,agency,or otherwise,controls any person liable under sections or of this title which deal with false statements or omissions in a registration statement shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person to any person to whom such controlled person is liable,unless the controlling person had no knowledge of or reasonable ground to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability of the controlled person is alleged to exist.plaintiffs once again pled that the outside directors had the power to influence and control prosper,including the decision to offer and sell loan note securities without qualification or an exemption.
the outside directors filed a demurrer to the claims brought against them in the sac.they argued that plaintiffs had failed to allege a single fact showing the outside directors are liable as control persons under section and title of the securities act.original underscoring.thus,they claimed they should be removed as defendants because the conclusory allegations in the sac are insufficient to show control because the only underlying fact on which they rely is the outside directors status as directors.
in plaintiffs opposition to the outside directors demurrer,they argued that the outside directors had urged the application of the wrong legal standard for examining the sufficiency of their fourth cause of action.they contended that the fourth cause of action was viable because under the plain language of section,the outside directors status as directors,standing alone,created joint and several liability to the same extent as the liable corporation without additionally alleging and proving control.however,they acknowledged that under the terms of the statute,joint and several liability will not be imposed if the person alleged to be liable can prove they had no knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of the facts on which the liability is alleged to exist.
as for their third and seventh causes of action,plaintiffs acknowledged that in order to survive the outside directors demurrer,they must plead facts showing that outside directors were in positions of control.nevertheless,plaintiffs argued that the totality of the facts and circumstances outlined in their sac showed that the outside directors were control persons because they had the direct or indirect power to control prosper and they exercised control over the alleged misconduct.
the trial court sustained the outside directors demurrer to plaintiffs sac without leave to amend,and dismissed them from the action.the court found that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under all three causes of action based on plaintiffs failure to allege facts that,if true,would show the outside directors exercised actual power or control over prosper,the primary violator.this appeal followed.

fourth cause of action alleging liability under section for principal executive officers and directors 
as noted,the trial court concluded that each cause of action alleged against the outside directors in plaintiffs sac faltered on the element of the outside directors control over prosper.with respect to the fourth cause of action,the trial court read section as requiring that there needs to be something more than the fact of directorship and something more than behavior in accordance with the responsibilities of directorship.there has to be a control over the activities of the persons directly responsible for the alleged unlawful and actionable acts.in sustaining the outside directors demurrer to the fourth cause of action,the trial court further concluded the language of section means a director who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or.the court believed that any other interpretation would be contrary to fundamental principles of corporate governance,and would lead to an absurd result.
plaintiffs claim the court incorrectly interpreted section by imposing a control requirement where none exists.specifically,they claim that section is not limited to persons who control the issuer,but rather is broadly worded to impose presumptive liability upon directors and executive officers of any corporation that sells unqualified securities,unless they had neither knowledge nor reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of the facts giving rise to the alleged liability.accordingly,plaintiffs claim that nothing in section required them to allege that the outside directors controlled prosper or that the outside directors had any influence over the decision to sell unqualified securities to plaintiffs rather,section expressly imposed presumptive liability on the outside directors simply by virtue of their position with prosper.
accordingly,the question before us is whether the liability of an executive officer or director under section,as pled in the fourth cause of action,is contingent upon pleading and proving that the executive officer or director controlled the primary violator.our review is guided by familiar canons of statutory construction.our fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.if,however,the statutory terms are ambiguous,then we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.day city of fontana cal th,italics added.
section imposes joint and several liability for securities law violations on e very person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or,every partner in a firm so liable,every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable,every person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,every employee of a person so liable who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation,and every or agent who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation,are also liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such person,unless the other person who is so liable had no knowledge of or reasonable grounds to believe in the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.italics added.
we believe the plain language of section means that principal executive officers and directors are presumptively liable for their corporation issuance of unqualified securities,regardless of whether they participated in the transactions at issue,or controlled the issuer.examining the language used in the statute,section defines liability of various participants in a security law violation in separate clauses of the statute,with each description describing a different category of individuals,control persons,partners,principal executive officers and directors.
the outside directors appear indifferent to the important differences between the state and federal statutes that bear on plaintiffs claims,calling the statutes analogous and substantively indistinguishable.however title of the securities act does not provide for specific liability of executive officers or directors,but rather uses general language to create liability for persons who control the primary violator.in contrast,in enacting section,the california legislature used markedly different language,creating liability subject to an affirmative defense for numerous categories of individuals,including principal executive officers and directors of a corporation that is primarily liable.accord,apollo capital fund llc roth capital partners,llc th.
thus,unlike its federal law counterpart,the plain language of section reveals that imposition of joint and several liability under its provisions is not limited to persons who control others who have sold securities in violation of section,as the trial court apparently believed.rather,section is worded in a broad fashion to impose liability on every partner in a firm so liable,every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable,every person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions,and every employee of a person so liable who materially aids in the act or transaction constituting the violation,among others.this structure is suggestive of legislative intent to differentiate section requirements for finding different categories of individuals liable.people youngblood th,we must interpret a statute consistently with the meaning derived from its grammatical structure.
therefore,the trial court erred by giving the statute a labored interpretation inconsistent with the words actually used by imputing the notion of control into the officers and directors clause when there is no mention of control in the language actually used.in construing section officers and directors clause,the court stated,i do see any ambiguity here at all t he statute does refer to directors,but it talks about directors who are so liable,which means a director who directly or indirectly controls a person.significantly,the trial court interpretation of the statute interjects terms that are not included in the actual statutory language.the statute refers to a corporation so liable,not a principal executive officer or director so liable,as indicated by the trial court.see white county of sacramento cal d,the last antecedent rule provides that qualifying words,phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote citations.a court may not read into a statute qualifications or modifications that will materially affect its operation so as to conform to a supposed intention not expressed by the legislature.citations.realmuto gagnard th.
furthermore,i t is an elementary rule of construction that effect must be given,if possible,to every word,clause and sentence of a statute.a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant citations.rodriguez superior court th.therefore,we are also entitled to infer that the provision of section assigning liability to every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable describes a category of persons not already addressed in a prior,specifically worded clause of the statute.
as we have seen,the language of section imposes joint and several liability for securities law violations on e very person who directly or indirectly controls a person liable under section or.this category would certainly encompass officers and directors asserting such control.if the trial court interpretation of section were correct,there would be no need to separately address the presumptive liability of officers and directors,because liability could be predicated on the officer or director actual control,not on his or her status as a corporate official.as a result,to apply a control requirement to officers and directors,would be to render surplusage their specific inclusion in statute.it is a settled axiom of statutory construction that significance should be attributed to every word and phrase of a statute,and a construction making some words surplusage should be avoided.citation.people woodhead cal d.
the parties direct our attention to two unpublished federal cases which directly address the issue before us,reaching different conclusions in openwave systems,fuld wl openwave defendants contended that plaintiff allegations against corporate officers and directors failed to state a claim under section because section,like the control person provision of title of the securities act,required a defendant to have exercised control over the entity operations.openwave,supra,at.the court rejected this argument based on the plain language of the statute.id.at.the court pointed out that the language of section refers to both persons who exercise control and every principal executive officer or director of a corporation so liable openwave,supra,at,original italics.although section was modeled on the federal statutes governing control person liability,this italicized language in section indicated that california expanded liability to include certain persons based on their relationships or connections to the corporation.openwave,supra,at.the court found that where the language of the california and federal statutes differ,as they do here,the court finds no basis for holding that the scope of liability under section is limited solely to control persons as under federal law.openwave,supra,at,fn.omitted.
in so holding,the openwave court relied on the analysis in courtney waring d courtney,since that case interpreted a section of the california franchise investment law containing identical wording to section.openwave,supra,wl at.in courtney,the court held that section imposed joint and several liability on control persons and each person who is a director or a principal executive officer,regardless of whether they may independently be held liable as a control person.courtney,supra,at.openwave agreed with this interpretation,finding courtney is persuasive since that case interpreted identical language,albeit in a different section of the california corporations code.openwave,supra,at.
in contrast to openwave persuasive and thorough analysis,the court in leason berg cir wl leason,considered the liability of a corporate director under federal and state securities claims,and held that i n order to be secondarily liable under section,the defendant must exercise some control over the alleged perpetrator of the fraud.citation.id.at.however,leason failed to offer any persuasive justification for its view.it divines support from sherman lloyd d,but that decision simply acknowledges that section provides a basis for holding an officer and director liable.more importantly,leason fails to undertake the requisite analysis of the statutory language used in section that was so persuasively undertaken in openwave.consequently,we decline to follow leason.
lastly,we note that the trial court interpretation of section placed heavy reliance upon a public policy analysis.in its written order,the court indicated that an interpretation of section allowing the outside directors to incur liability for corporate wrongdoings without any showing of control over any alleged wrongdoer would be absurd and contrary to fundamental principles of corporate governance because it would deprive corporations of outside directors valuable oversight and deter individuals from serving as outside directors all of which would undermine corporate governance.the court made similar comments at the hearing on demurrer.
such an approach subordinates the statutory text to an individual judge subjective interpretation of what is,and what is not,compelling public policy and is particularly inappropriate in a case such as this where the statutes text is plain and unambiguous murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.judicial deference to the policy choices enacted into law by the legislature requires that statutory interpretation focus primarily on the language of the statute.
in conclusion,the trial court erred by adopting an unduly narrow interpretation of section by finding plaintiffs had not stated a claim under their fourth cause of action because they had not alleged facts showing that outside directors
