on september,the securities and exchange commission sec or commission issued an order pursuant to the securities exchange act of,d,affirming disciplinary action taken by the national association of securities dealers,nasd against kevin otto.otto,a securities salesman associated with an nasd member firm at the time of the misconduct charged,seeks review of the sec order pursuant to a.we deny otto petition and affirm the sec order.
factual background 
during all times relevant to the disposition of this case,kevin otto worked as a general securities representative for various nasd member firms including hamilton investments,wellington investment services corporation,and first montauk securities corporation.mary sue became a client of otto beginning in or and followed him through his various firm transfers.
in february,otto solicited from smith for an investment in the wisconsin business club wbc.in a letter to smith otto explained that 
wbc is a group of people that network to bring to the table business opportunities which enable me to make some cash.these are opportunities that you and i as individuals probably would see again as i stated on the phone this is not an investment nor is it offered by any securities company.it has nothing to do with me as a broker or my brokerage firm.this is a private thing.it is kind of fun.i think you like it liquidity depends on what the funds are in.
otto further professed that the return was reported as a treasury bill rate plus a couple of percentage points.smith provided otto with the unbeknownst to her,wbc did not exist.
rather than invest the into wbc as he had suggested he would,otto instead placed the partly in his personal bank account and partly in a charles schwab account for powersource battery corporation,an unprofitable company that he owned and operated with a partner,donna lebrecht.otto used smith funds for personal stuff,business expenses related to the operation of powersource,and expenses related to the investigation of other business opportunities.despite the illicit infusion of capital,powersource filed for bankruptcy protection in march of.
to cover up his misuse of her funds,otto prepared and sent to smith fictitious portfolio updates that falsely reflected a wbc balance.in april,smith requested funds from her wbc account.because he could not immediately return smith money,otto stalled the repayment with more deceit,explaining in a letter that the invest ment club has invested cash.may take a few weeks to find a replacement for your position once we sell your seat,we are out unless another opens up.in may,he wrote to smith that her account value was and he had arranged for all dividends capital gains to date to be forwarded to smith.otto further explained to her that it could take a few weeks to liquidate,and suggested that she withdraw approximately immediately,leaving in the club to remain active,thus attempting to prolong the charade that he had invested smith money in wbc.smith signed an authorization agreeing to leave in the fictitious club,and received a personal check form otto in the amount of in june.initially the check was returned for insufficient funds,but later smith was able to deposit it.
because of the delay between her request and her receipt of the wbc funds,smith decided to withdraw all of the wbc funds.still,otto did not immediately return smith money.in a letter dated july,he continued to represent that wbc existed as a legitimate investment club and blamed the delay in receiving her money on the investment club.
i not yet received our exit papers for the investment club.as your request is unusual things do happen that fast.the group has assured me that funds will not be less than its value at the time the funds were requested this is an exclusive club with most people of professional investment background.i pushed to get us in,therefore i ca cause a lot sic wave s.i should hope to receive our exit papers soon and subsequently the funds.
otto finally sent smith a check for the fictitious balance of smith wbc account on october,approximately six months after her initial request to withdraw her funds.
in october,smith sent to otto,first montauk securities corporation,copies of records and letters otto had sent her regarding her wbc account.nearly thirty months later,on march,nasd filed a complaint against otto,charging him with violating conduct rule,which requires members to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.at a subsequent hearing before the nasd regional district business conduct committee dbcc,otto admitted that wbc did not exist as anything other than an insignia.otto claimed,however,that smith had authorized him to use the funds as he did.according to otto,smith faced marital difficulties and wanted to use wbc in order to hide the money from her.otto further claimed that the only reason smith made a complaint against otto was because of the request of her father,also one of otto clients,who was upset with otto handling of his account.smith complaint was admitted into evidence at the hearings,but she did not testify.on august,the dbcc found that otto violated conduct rule and imposed a penalty composed of a censure,a permanent bar from associating with any nasd member,a fine of,and an assessment of costs in the amount of.
otto appealed the dbcc decision to the national adjudicatory counsel nac for nasd.at the hearing before the nac,otto again admitted that wbc never existed and that he used smith funds for his business and personal expenses.again smith did not testify.the nac found that otto misuse of smith funds was inexcusable.his misconduct,coupled with his total refusal to acknowledge that he had misused his client funds by using her money for his own personal and business benefit,makes him a danger to the investing public.further,in its decision,the nac explained that even though the guidelines did not recommend a bar for otto conduct,it considered a bar essential based on the egregious nature of otto conduct.in support,it noted three aggravating factors the series of lies and deception beginning with his solicitation of smith funds and continuing throughout her attempts to withdraw her funds his failure to accept responsibility for his misuse of smith funds and his attempt to lay blame on others,specifically upon smith herself with his theory that she attempted to use wbc to hide the money in a marital dispute.accordingly,on june,the nac affirmed the censure and bar,but reduced the fine to because it concluded that the dbcc used a conversion sentencing guideline rather than an improper use of funds guideline.
otto appealed the decision of the nac to the sec,which reviewed his case de novo.on september,the sec sustained the censure,bar,fine,and costs.the sec found that otto deceived his client with a network of lies.the sec pointed out that,by his own admission,the investment club into which otto told smith he had placed her funds did not exist.the sec further found that when smith sought to get her money back,otto repeatedly delayed returning her money and continued the fiction of the investment club,failing to tell smith that he used her money for his own benefit.the sec found that otto admittedly false statements to smith demonstrated deception of a client about the use of money that is unethical and reprehensible.in addition,the sec rejected otto procedural objections,finding that the nasd proceedings were fair,noting that otto admitted all of the facts necessary to determine his guilt.finally the sec held that the sanctions imposed by the nasd were not excessive or oppressive,concluding that otto conduct demonstrates a serious misunderstanding of the obligations he owes to a customer as a registered representative.otto now appeals.
otto raises two issues in his appeal.first,he contends that the nasd proceedings violated his due process rights because hearsay evidence was admitted and relied upon,because he did not have the opportunity to smith,and because the length of time that passed between the misconduct and the hearings deprived otto of the opportunity to present witnesses on his behalf who
