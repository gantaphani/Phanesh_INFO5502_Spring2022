background 
on october,cpi employed deal as an executive under the employment agreement.the employment agreement contains a term with an automatic renewal clause for an additional period,unless deal or cpi provides written notice at least sixty days before the renewal date of an intention to terminate the employment agreement.
section of the employment agreement sets forth four scenarios under which cpi could terminate deal employment a death or permanent disability,b for cause,c notification before the automatic extension,and d payment for involuntary termination without cause.the employment agreement specifies deal compensation upon each scenario occurrence.specifically,subsection d of the employment agreement addresses deal compensation following her termination without cause after a change of control 
if following a change of control i cpi terminates deal employment other than for cause pursuant to subsection b hereof,or ii deal employment terminates by reason of cpi termination of this agreement pursuant to subsection c hereof,cpi shall,at the time of such involuntary termination,make a lump sum cash payment to deal equal to of her base salary for the fiscal year of termination in addition to the payment pursuant to this subsection d deal shall be entitled to all remedies available under this agreement or at law in respect of any damages suffered by deal as a result of an involuntary termination of employment without cause.
the employment agreement also required cpi to pay deal an annual bonus after a change in control additionally,the employment agreement expressly did not obligate deal to mitigate any damages by seeking other employment.
deal and cpi also entered into a separate written stock option agreement stock option agreement,which granted deal the option to purchase shares of cpi common stock at per share.pursuant to the agreement,deal could exercise her option to purchase stock within ninety days of termination by giving written notice to cpi of the intention to exercise the option,accompanied by full payment of the purchase price of the shares with respect to which the option is exercised.
during the first year of deal employment,neither deal nor cpi terminated the employment agreement.thus,on october,the employment agreement automatically became effective for another year.however,on may,cpi terminated deal without cause following a change of control.at the time of her termination,deal had already earned and received of her base salary of.upon deal termination,cpi did not pay deal unaccrued base salary,annual bonus,or severance benefits.
in a letter dated june,deal,through her counsel,sent cpi written notice of her intent to exercise the option to purchase cpi common stock.deal also demanded the remainder of her annual base salary pursuant to section a of her employment agreement,the severance payment set forth in subsection d,as well as the annual bonus detailed in subsection b.deal did not accompany her letter with full payment of the shares purchase price,which totaled.rather,the letter stated deal intends to exercise her options pursuant to the parties stock option agreement and is prepared to tender cash in the amount of for her stock.please inform me if cpi intends to perform its agreement under that contract.cpi did not respond to this letter.on august,deal counsel sent a second letter berating cpi failure to pay deal and stating under the current circumstances,deal will not pay cpi the purchase price for the stock.we assume that cpi would keep the money and refuse to issue deal her stock.again,cpi did not respond to the letter.
deal sued cpi for breach of the employment agreement and the stock option agreement,and sought,inter alia,the remainder of her annual base salary,a bonus payment,the severance payment,and damages resulting from cpi breach of the stock option agreement.the district court ordered the parties to mediation,after which cpi agreed to pay deal the severance payment plus interest,but refused to pay deal any additional amounts.
the parties filed for summary judgment.cpi argued deal severance payment was in lieu of her unpaid base salary and annual bonus payment under the employment agreement.in response,deal contended she was entitled to her unpaid base salary and bonus payment,and effectively exercised her stock option.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of deal regarding deal salary and bonus payment claim,and in favor of cpi regarding the stock option claim.both parties appeal.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our standard of review is a familiar one.when considering a district court grant of summary judgment,we review findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts.aclu.found.city of plattsmouth,cir citations omitted.the parties agree missouri law governs this dispute.under missouri law,summary judgment is appropriate in a contract case where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous such that the meaning of the portion of the contract in issue is so apparent that it may be determined from the four corners of the document.family snacks of,prepared prods,cir internal quotations,citations,and footnote omitted.
unaccrued salary and bonus payment 
on appeal,cpi challenges deal entitlement to her unaccrued salary and annual bonus payment,arguing subsection d of the employment agreement exclusively governs deal payments and only allows recovery of the severance payment.according to cpi,a contrary conclusion pays deal for time not worked,renders a key provision of the employment agreement meaningless,and produces an absurd result.we reject cpi contentions and thus affirm the district court.
when a contract uses plain and unequivocal language,it must be enforced as written.lake cable,trittler,citation omitted see,sligo,nevois,cir.to determine whether a contract is ambiguous,we consider the instrument as a whole,giving the words contained therein their ordinary meaning.young dental engineered,citation omitted.a contract is not ambiguous merely because the parties dispute its meaning.sligo,at citing young dental,at.
with these principles in mind,we note it is undisputed deal employment agreement was in effect at the time of her termination.on october,deal term of employment automatically renewed for an additional period and would expire early only upon deal death,permanent disability,or termination for cause.by terminating deal without cause before her employment agreement expired on october,cpi breached its contract with deal,thus entitling deal to the remaining amount cpi would have paid her had it fully performed under the contract.see cornejo crawford county,noting it is well settled a plaintiff measure of damages for breach of an employment contract is prima facie the contract price agreed upon for such service quoting koenigkraemer.glass.because the employment agreement specifically provides deal is not required to mitigate her damages,deal is entitled to the full amount of her unaccrued annual base salary,plus interest.
in a similar fashion,deal also is entitled to her annual bonus payment,pursuant to subsection b of the employment agreement,which provides a fter a change of control,in addition to the base salary,deal shall be awarded for each fiscal year during the term of employment an annual bonus.emphasis added.the empl
