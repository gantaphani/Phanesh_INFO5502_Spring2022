this case requires us to determine whether the plaintiff appellant,new jersey carpenters health fund the fund,has stated plausible claims under a of the securities act of the act,et.subject to certain enumerated exceptions,a of the act impose liability whenever a security registration statement or prospectus contains a material misrepresentation or omission.id.a.here,the fund claims that the registration statement and the prospectus collectively,the offering documents for a security contained material misstatements and omissions because those documents reported standards for underwriting mortgages that the relevant underwriter had supposedly abandoned.the fund bases its conclusion about abandonment on three factual allegations that a disproportionately high number of the mortgages included in the security defaulted that rating agencies downgraded the security ratings after changing their methodologies to account for lax underwriting and that prior employees of the relevant underwriter have attested to systematic disregard of the reported underwriting standards during the relevant time periods.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york batts,concluded that these allegations failed to state a claim under a of the act.it also held that,even as the representative for a putative class,the fund lacked standing to pursue claims based on securities in which it had not invested.thus,the district court dismissed the fund complaint in its entirety,entering judgment in favor of the defendants appellees.the fund now appeals from that judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the fund factual allegations permit us to draw the reasonable inference that the defendants appellees are liable under a of the act.furthermore,we vacate the district court holding that the fund,as the representative of a proposed class,lacked standing to assert claims based on securities in which it had not invested.after the district court entered its judgment,this court issued an opinion that addressed the issue of.see neca ibew health welfare fund goldman sachs,cir.thus,we instruct the district court to reconsider the issue of standing presented here in light of that recent opinion.in sum,we reverse the district court judgment in part,vacate it in part,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a.the underlying securities 
according to the fund consolidated first amended securities class action complaint fac,on may,defendant appellee novastar mortgage funding corporation nmfc filed a registration statement and prospectus with the securities and exchange commission sec on form s.on june,nmfc amended the registration statement and prospectus,using form s.issuers like nmfc may register and offer securities on a continuous or delayed basis in the future for up to three years after the initial effective date of the registration statement.a a typically,an issuer commences a continuous or delayed offering by filing an initial shelf registration statement,which includes a base or core prospectus that contains general information,including the types of securities to be offered and a description of the risk factors of the offering.neca ibew,at.the core prospectus may omit otherwise required information if,because the issuer will offer the securities in the future,such information is unknown or not reasonably available.b a.in the amended prospectus filed on june,nmfc indicated that it would offer interests in trusts that principally contained residential mortgages.
after an issuer files its shelf registration statement,it may issue securities under that statement by filing a supplemental prospectus that discloses information previously omitted from the prospectus filed as part of the effective registration statement.id.b see also id.a ii requiring a supplemental prospectus to disclose any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement which,individually or in the aggregate,represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement.information disclosed in a supplemental prospectus shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement.id.b f see also id.a deeming each supplemental prospectus to be a new registration statement for the purpose of determining any liability under the act.
according to the fac,nmfc issued six securities under the june,shelf registration statement the novastar mortgage funding trust,series,which had assets worth approximately,and which nmfc offered on june,the novastar mortgage funding trust,series,which had approximately in assets,and which nmfc offered on august,the novastar mortgage funding trust,series,which had approximately in assets,and which nmfc offered on september,the novastar mortgage funding trust,series,which had approximately in assets,and which nmfc offered on november,the novastar mortgage funding trust,series,which had approximately in assets,and which nmfc offered on february,and the novastar mortgage funding trust,series the series trust,which had approximately in assets,and which nmfc offered on may.defendant appellee novastar mortgage nmi,nmfc parent company,originated or purchased all of the mortgages contained in each of the six trusts after nmi originated or purchased the relevant loans,it sold them to nmfc,which assigned them,in turn,to the trusts described above.defendants appellees greenwich capital markets,deutsche bank securities,and wachovia capital markets,llc collectively,the underwriter defendants underwrote and sold each of the six trusts that nmfc offered.
the amended prospectus filed on june,indicated that the supplemental prospectuses accompanying each offering would describe the underwriting standards used to underwrite the mortgage loans.app x at.the supplemental prospectus filed in conjunction with the series trust the prospectus described nmi underwriting guidelines at length.according to the prospectus,nmi adopted its underwriting guidelines in order to evaluate the credit history of the potential borrower,the capacity and willingness of the borrower to repay the loan,and the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan.id.at.to this end,nmi required each potential borrower to file an application and to provide documentation according to one of six levels of applicant documentation,which ranged from full documentation to stated income to no documentation.id.at.under the full documentation program,applicants would generally submit verification of employment and most recent pay stub or up to prior two years w forms and most recent pay stub.id.at.the stated income program,in contrast,permitted an applicant to qualif y based on monthly income as stated in the loan application.id.according to the prospectus,nmi originated of the loans in the series trust under the full documentation program,under the stated income program,and under the no documentation program.
the prospectus also notified investors that,o n a basis,exceptions to the underwriting guidelines are made where nmi believes compensating factors exist.id.compensating factors could include the length of time in residence,lowering of the borrower monthly debt service payments,the ratio on the loan,as applicable,or other criteria that in the judgment of the loan underwriter warrant an exception.id.finally,the prospectus assured investors that q uality control reviews were conducted to ensure that all mortgage loans met quality standards.id.at.
in addition to describing nmi underwriting guidelines,the series trust offering documents warned potential investors about certain risks.the amended prospectus filed on june,advised readers in bold to read the section entitled risk factors starting on page of this prospectus before making a decision to invest.id.at.certain risks resulted from the characteristics of the loans composing the series trust,and others were caused by changes that might occur in the housing market.
first,the prospectus warned that the loans composing the series trust would be ineligible for direct purchase by fannie mae due to credit characteristics that do not meet the fannie mae underwriting guidelines.id.at.as a result,the loans were likely to experience rates of delinquency,foreclosure and loss that are higher,and may be substantially higher,than mortgage loans originated in accordance with the fannie mae underwriting guidelines.id.the prospectus also identified other characteristics of the loans that might increase the likelihood of default.specifically,it disclosed that a small percentage of the loans were secured by on the related mortgaged properties,id.at,and that another portion of the loans did not provide for any required payments of principal during the first five or ten years of their term,which significantly increased the amount of later monthly payments,id.at.
the prospectus also warned investors about systemic risks.according to the prospectus,i f the residential real estate market should experience an overall decline in property values such that the outstanding balances of the mortgage loans become equal to or greater than the value of the mortgaged properties serving as collateral for the loans,the actual rates of delinquencies,foreclosures and losses could be higher than those now generally experienced.id.at.nine pages later,the prospectus disclosed that,in recent months,residential property values in many states have declined or remained stable,after extended periods during which those values appreciated.id.at.
on may,the fund invested in the series trust.nearly three years later,on march,the fund sold its interest in the trust for.
on june,the fund filed the fac,which brought claims under,a,of the act based on all six of the trusts that nmfc issued in connection with the june,registration statement.in the fac,the fund alleged that the initial prospectus and each of the supplemental prospectuses all misstated and omitted material facts,most notably,the fact that nmi,in an effort to increase the number of mortgages it originated,had abandoned its disclosed underwriting guidelines.
the fac based its assertion that nmi had abandoned its underwriting guidelines on two factual allegations.first,the fund alleged that,although moody and s p,the two rating agencies who had evaluated the six trusts,had initially given the trusts some of their highest ratings,they had later dramatically downgraded the trusts,categorizing them as either speculative or at substantial risk of default.second,the fund alleged that an unusually large percentage of the mortgages in each trust had entered default.according to the fac,of the mortgages had defaulted within four months of their trust offering,had defaulted within six months,and over had defaulted by june.the fac then referenced the mortgage fraud report by the federal bureau of investigation fbi,which was based on a study of three million residential mortgages and which indicated that between thirty and seventy percent of early payment defaults resulted at least in part from significant misrepresentations in the original loan applications.app x at.
c.the district court decision 
on august,the defendants appellees moved to dismiss the fac in its entirety.on march,the district court granted the motion in principal part,but permitted the fund to amend the claims based on the series trust.carpenters health fund novastar,civ.dab,wl,at.first,the district court held that,because the fund had not invested in any of the first five trusts that nmfc had issued under the june,registration statement,it lacked standing,even as the representative of a proposed class,to assert any claim based on those trusts.id.at.turning to the series trust,the district court concluded that the fund had not plausibly alleged that the registration statement,as amended by the prospectus,contained any material misstatement or omission.id.at.in the view of the district court,rather than making allegations specific to the origination practices that relate to the series trust,the fac offered pages of the subprime market melted down and defendants were market participants,so they must be liable for my losses in my risky investment.id.at.
d.the second amended class action complaint the sac 
on may,the fund filed the sac,which asserted claims under,a,of the act based solely on the series trust.the sac again alleged that the june,registration statement and prospectus,as supplemented by the prospectus,misstated nmi underwriting guidelines and failed to disclose that nmi had,in fact,abandoned its published guidelines.in support of its allegation that nmi had abandoned its guidelines,the sac again relied on the two factual allegations presented in the fac,but it also alleged that several unnamed prior employees of nmi and nmfc had attested to nmi systematic disregard of its underwriting standards.
first,the sac repeated its allegation that the rating agencies had severely downgraded the series trust ratings.unlike the fac,however,the sac attributed these downgrades to the rating agencies increased awareness of underwriting practices.specifically,the sac alleged that,in june of,approximately one month after nmfc had issued the series trust,s p revised its rating methodology in response to the level of loosened underwriting at the time of loan origination,misrepresentation and speculative borrower behavior reported for the ratings.app x at.moody allegedly also revised its methodology to account for previously undisclosed aggressive underwriting.id.according to the sac,the application of these new methodologies to the series trust caused the rating agencies to downgrade the majority of the trust ratings by as many as levels.id.at.
next,the sac again alleged that the series trust experienced unusually high default rates.according to the sac,of the loans in the series trust defaulted within six months of the offering,defaulted within one year,defaulted before june,and defaulted before june.like the fac,the sac referenced the fbi mortgage fraud report.according to that report,between thirty and seventy percent of early payment defaults resulted at least in part from significant misrepresentations in the original loan applications,and loans containing egregious misrepresentations were five times more likely to default in the first six months than loans that did not.id.at.
finally,the sac relayed statements from no fewer than eight unnamed former employees of nmi and nmfc.according to the sac,seven of the eight employees the fund interviewed had worked at nmi or nmfc during the six months preceding may,when over ninety percent of the mortgages in the series trust had been originated.specifically,the fund had interviewed a former vice president of operations,who worked in kansas city from until march a former quality control,who worked in kansas city from august until september a former closing supervisor,who worked in ohio from through may a former quality control auditor,who worked in ohio from until a former senior underwriter,who worked in lake forest,california from through a former account manager,who worked in ohio from until and a former account executive,who worked in ocala,florida from february until may.
many of the former employees alleged statements contradicted the prospectus description of nmi underwriting standards.according to several former employees,although the underwriting guidelines prioritized evaluat ing the credit history of the potential borrower,the capacity and willingness of the borrower to repay the loan,and the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan,id.at,the pressure nmi employees allegedly felt to achieve loan production and hit performance targets overshadowed the need for such evaluations,resulting in the guidelines systematic loosening,id.at.the former vice president allegedly said that,as a result of the emphasis on volume,the guidelines were tossed out the window.id.at.according to that vice president,employees did not worry about the consequences of disregarding the underwriting guidelines because nmi and nmfc were not keeping the crap,but instead selling it for securitization.id.at.
the alleged systematic loosening of the underwriting standards took many forms.for example,although the underwriting guidelines disclosed that nmi might make exceptions where compensating factors exist ed,id.at,former employees allegedly told the fund that vice presidents and supervisors at nmi and nmfc would routinely grant exceptions,even where underwriters had rejected an application because they regarded the accompanying documentation as suspicious or fraudulent.as a result of nmi alleged willingness to overlook questionable or insufficient documentation,nmi purportedly originated many loans under its full documentation program even though it had not actually obtained the documentation its underwriting guidelines required.for example,according to a former quality control auditor,one borrower had verified her employment by submitting a note that said,x cleans my house and i pay her three thousand a week.id.at.
nmi also allegedly disregarded the requirements described in its stated income program.according to the sac,prior to late,statements of income helped nmi determine a borrower capacity to repay,id.at,and applicants were rejected where their stated incomes were too low to sustain the payments that a mortgage required,id.at.in late and,however,as nmi employees sought to increase the number of mortgages they originated,they allegedly began to make exceptions to the income guidelines and to accept apparently unreasonable statements of income at face value.for example,one former senior underwriter stated that,although she had denied an application from a department store employee who claimed to make per month,she later discovered that others at nmi had overridden her denial.based on these accounts,the fund alleges that,during the relevant time periods,nmi systematically disregarded its underwriting guidelines.app x at.
e.the district court decision 
the defendants appellees moved to dismiss the sac on july.on march,the district court held that the sac failed to state a plausible claim under a of the act.carpenters health fund novastar,civ.dab,wl,at.the district court identified two bases for its holding.first,quoting its decision,it again found that the fund had failed to make allegations specific to the origination practices that relate to the only offer that is relevant here,the series trust.id.at.according to the district court,to state a plausible claim under the act,the fund needed either to cite an example of a loan that failed to meet the underwriting guidelines and ended up in the loan pool or to otherwise provide details that would tie its claim of loosened underwriting guidelines to the specific loans at issue.id.at.second,the district court found that the sac had failed to allege that any misstatements and omissions would have been material in light of the extensive risk disclosures and information the fund received,as well as events generally known about nmi,nmfc,and the subprime market in the months preceding the offering of the series trust.id.at.because the district court had dismissed all of the fund claims in its and decisions,it entered final judgment in favor of the defendants appellees.
the fund now appeals from that judgment.

misstatements or omissions 
section of the act provides 
in case any part of a registration statement contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,any person acquiring such security unless it is proved that at the time of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or omission may sue every person who signed the registration statement every person who was a director of or partner in the issuer at the time of the filing and every underwriter with respect to such security.
a.section a,in turn,permits a plaintiff to sue a ny person who offers or sells a security by means of a prospectus which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.a.
claims under sections and a are securities act siblings with roughly parallel elements.in re morgan stanley info.fund sec,cir.so long as a plaintiff establishes one of the three bases for liability under these provisions a material misrepresentation a material omission in contravention of an affirmative legal disclosure obligation or a material omission of information that is necessary to prevent existing disclosures from being misleading then,in a section case,the general rule is that an issuer liability is absolute.litwin,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.u nlike securities fraud claims pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of,plaintiffs bringing claims under sections and a need not allege scienter,reliance,or loss causation.morgan stanley info.fund,at citation omitted 
because claims under a of the act need not include allegations of fraud,this is an ordinary notice pleading case,subject only to the short and plain statement requirements of federal rule of civil procedure a.litwin,at.thus,as described above,to prevail on appeal,the fund must have alleged factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendants appellees are liable for the misconduct alleged.iqbal,at.here,the fund general claim that nmi abandoned its underwriting guidelines is the functional equivalent of an allegation that the prospectus contained material misstatements and omissions.we need not accept such a legal conclusion merely because the fund has couched it as a factual allegation.id.quoting twombly,at.in contrast,however,the fund allegations concerning default rates,credit ratings,and nmi specific practices as described by its former employees all contain factual content,which we must accept as true.id.the question,then,is whether this factual content permits us to draw the reasonable inference that nmi abandoned its underwriting guidelines,rendering the statements in the prospectus misleading and incomplete.id.
the supreme court has offered considerable guidance on what qualifies as a reasonable inference.for example,in twombly,the supreme court clarified that factual content that is merely consistent with,rather than suggestive of,a finding of liability will not support a reasonable inference.at.thus,where the antitrust laws required a plaintiff to plead that the defendants had agreed not to compete,the plaintiff could not simply rely on allegations that the defendants had acted as if they had agreed.id.at.as the supreme court explained,the conditions of the relevant market provided an obvious alternative explanation for the conduct alleged,specifically,that the defendants had more to lose by competing with one another than they had to gain.id.the factual content at issue,then,would not support a reasonable inference of liability because it was just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy.id.at.
the supreme court has also implicitly contrasted the reasonable inference standard with the higher standard that applies under the private securities litigation reform act pslra.when construing the pslra requirement that plaintiffs in securities fraud cases allege facts that support a strong inference of scienter,id.b a,the supreme court emphasized that a strong inference must be more than merely reasonable or permissible it must be cogent and compelling,thus strong in light of other explanations.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.the supreme court further held that an inference qualifies as strong only if a reasonable person would deem it at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.by implication,then,a reasonable inference need not be as compelling as any opposing inference one might draw from the same factual allegations.
thus,courts may draw a reasonable inference of liability when the facts alleged are suggestive of,rather than merely consistent with,a finding of misconduct.moreover,the existence of other,competing inferences does not prevent the plaintiff desired inference from qualifying as reasonable unless at least one of those competing inferences rises to the level of an obvious alternative explanation.
the united states court of appeals for the first circuit has applied this standard to a similar set of allegations.see plumbers union local pension fund nomura asset acceptance,cir.in nomura,as here,the plaintiff brought claims under,a,of the act,alleging that the offering documents of certain securities misstated the relevant underwriter guidelines.id.at.specifically,the plaintiff alleged that first national bank of nevada fnbn,one of the key loan originators for the relevant securities,had routinely violated its lending guidelines,approving as many loans as possible and even scrub bing loan applications of potentially disqualifying material.id.at alteration in original.these practices allegedly contradicted the registration statement claim that borrowers had demonstrate d an established ability to repay and that fnbn had verified their employment history.id.at.finally,the complaint asserted that,in,moody had downgraded the rating of all of the securities.id.at.considering whether enough ha d been said in the complaint to link fnbn practices with the mortgages that underpinned the securities at issue,the first circuit,with judge michael boudin writing for the court,held that,although a judgment call,the sharp drop in the credit ratings after the sales and the specific allegations as to fnbn offer enough basis to warrant some initial discovery aimed at these precise allegations.id.at.in passing,the first circuit commented that s imilar complaints in other cases have cited to more substantial sources,including statements from confidential witnesses,former employees and internal emails.id.at.
a majority of district courts in this circuit have agreed with the first circuit,permitting claims under a of the act to proceed where the plaintiff has provided a fairly specific account of how the relevant underwriters had systematically disregarded the guidelines disclosed in a security registration statement.see in re morgan stanley mortg.pass through certificates,d,emps.ret.of the gov t of the morgan chase,d,in re indymac sec,d,pub.emps.ret.of merrill lynch,d,carpenters health fund residential capital llc,civ hb,wl,at,carpenters health fund dlj mortg.capital,civ pac,wl,at,
we also agree.here,the sac incorporates one of the more substantial sources identified by the first circuit.nomura,at.the statements from prior nmfc and nmi employees suggest that nmi throughout the relevant time period and at different locations across the country disregarded its underwriting guidelines,approving loan applications despite deficiencies in an effort to generate a large volume of mortgages that it could sell to third parties.these allegations are suggestive of,rather than merely consistent with,a finding of liability.to connect its specific description of nmi conduct with the series trust,the fund has alleged that the loans in the trust had exceedingly high rates of early payment default.had nmi in fact disregarded its underwriting guidelines,which helped it to evaluate each borrower capacity and willingness to repay,app x at,it would have become more vulnerable to mortgage fraud.thus,according to the fbi mortgage fraud report,which the sac referenced,one would reasonably expect higher rates of early payment default,like those allegedly experienced by the series trust,to be a consequence of loosened underwriting.finally,the fund has alleged that the credit rating agencies,after becoming concerned about loose and aggressive underwriting,expressed greater and greater skepticism about the series trust.app x at.in sum,the fund has alleged that nmi disregarded its underwriting guidelines in specific ways,that the signs of disregard materialized for the series trust,and that those charged with evaluating the security looked for disregard and apparently found it.these allegations,taken together,permit us to draw the reasonable inference that the prospectus description of nmi underwriting standards misstated nmi actual practices,and the district court erred in concluding that something more was required 
the defendants appellees resist this conclusion,challenging the capacity of the fund allegations to support any inference of liability.first,the defendants appellees argue that we should distrust the unnamed prior employees purported statements and that,in any event,those few employees could have conceivably described nmi practices at only a tiny fraction of its offices.even under the higher standard imposed by the pslra,however,we have permitted plaintiffs to rely on unnamed sources so long as they are described in the complaint with sufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in the position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.novak kasaks,cir.here,the sac describes its sources as employees who would have participated in different aspects of nmi origination process during part or all of the relevant time period.these descriptions easily support the probability that the unnamed prior employees would have the alleged knowledge of nmi underwriting practices.see also new orleans emps.ret.celestica,cir summary order.moreover,although the unnamed employees apparently worked at only a few of nmi many offices,the sac alleges that those offices were regional operations offices and that they were spread across the country.app x at.finally,the statements relayed in the sac provide no basis for believing that factors unique to the relevant offices,rather than practices,resulted in the pressure to achieve loan production that these employees allegedly experienced.id.at.thus,we must draw the reasonable inference that these factual allegations support,namely,that the unnamed employees described widespread practices at nmi.litwin,at.
second,the defendants appellees argue that the prospectus disclosed that the loans in the series trust might default at rates higher,and perhaps even substantially higher,than those experienced by loans that conformed to different standards.app x at.according to the defendants appellees,the materialization of the very risks described in the prospectus,including the risk that the housing market would collapse,explains the default rates alleged by the sac,rendering the inferences the fund attempts to draw unreasonable.but this argument does not provide an obvious alternative explanation.twombly,at.the fact that the risks described in the prospectus may have caused many of the defaults that occurred does not impugn the fund central allegation,namely,that unconstrained underwriting increased the number of defaults,causing the ultimate rate of default to skyrocket to.app x at moreover,the sac relies not only on the number of defaults that occurred,but also on the timing of those defaults.given the findings set forth in the fbi mortgage fraud report,the frequency of early defaults suggests that mortgage fraud contaminated a significant portion of the loans in the series trust because anyone evaluating a borrower capacity and willingness to repay a loan would want to detect fraud,app x at,the apparent portion of the series trust that was affected by fraud provides additional support for the fund conclusion that nmi employees did not conduct the evaluations that the company disclosed underwriting guidelines required.
third,the defendants appellees argue that the rating agencies reduced the series trust ratings not because they had discovered nmi underwriting practices,but instead because the trust credit quality had deteriorated.once again,however,the deterioration of the trust credit quality is wholly consistent with the fund allegation that nmi had abandoned its underwriting guidelines.indeed,the rating agencies decisions to amend their methodologies to account for instances of loosened or aggressive underwriting indicates that adherence to published underwriting guidelines constituted one component of the credit quality that the agencies sought to assess.thus,the sac claim that the rating agencies significantly reduced the series trust ratings after amending their methodologies to account for aggressive underwriting again provides further support for the inference that the fund asks us to draw.
finally,the defendants appellees argue that the prospectus did not misstate nmi origination practices because it disclosed that nmi could make exceptions to its underwriting guidelines based on any criteria that the loan underwriter found persuasive.app x at.as the first circuit has explained,however,saying that exceptions occur does not reveal what the fund alleges,namely,a wholesale abandonment of underwriting standards.nomura,at.thus,because the factual content set forth in the sac allows us to draw the reasonable inference that nmi disregarded the underwriting standards described in the prospectus,the acknowledgment that those standards permitted exceptions does not cure the misstatements and omissions that the fund alleges 
discovery may reveal that the actual facts support the inferences drawn by the defendants appellees,rather than those drawn by the fund.but that has no bearing on the question before us.as the supreme court explained in twombly,a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that recovery is very remote and unlikely.at.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,we ask only whether the facts alleged in the sac,taken as true,allow us to draw the reasonable inference that the series trust offering documents contained misstatements and omissions.iqbal,at.for the reasons set forth above,we find the sac factual allegations support such an inference.
materiality 
even though the fund has plausibly alleged that the prospectus contained misstatements and omissions,its claims under a of the act may nonetheless fail if the alleged misstatements and omissions are not material.for a misstatement or omission to qualify as material,there must be a substantial likelihood that a complete and truthful disclosure would have been viewed by a reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.basic levinson,d quoting tsc,northway,d.because questions of materiality are inherently,id.at,we have previously held that a complaint may not properly be dismissed on the ground that the alleged misstatements or omissions are not material unless they are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.ganino citizens utils,cir quoting goldman belden,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these standards,numerous courts,including the first circuit in nomura,have concluded that misstatements of an underwriter guidelines are not so obviously unimportant that they are immaterial as a matter of law.id.at see nomura,at morgan,d at indymac,d at tsereteli residential asset securitization trust,d.we agree.the series trust consisted primarily of a pool of mortgage loans and interests in the properties that secured those loans.investors would profit from their interests in the series trust only if the trust could recoup a sufficient portion of the balance of those loans.thus,a substantial likelihood exists that a reasonable investor would want to know whether those underwriting the loans had adhered to the procedures in place for evaluating the capacity and willingness of the borrower s to repay the loan s and the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan s.app x at.given the apparent importance of this information,we conclude that,at this stage of the proceedings,the alleged misstatements and omissions are not immaterial as a matter of law.
once again,the defendants appellees resist this conclusion.first,they argue that the prospectus risk disclosures made it clear that the fund invested in an uncertain security at a particularly precarious time.nonetheless,such risk disclosures do not rectify the defect that the fund purports to identify.as the first circuit explained,n either being less stringent than fannie mae nor warning that less verification may be employed for certain limited documentation programs alerts investors to an alleged wholesale abandonment of underwriting standards.nomura,at.in general,disclosures about why a security,as described,might perform poorly can not overcome an allegation that the registration statement description of that security was materially inaccurate.a reasonable investor can independently analyze how a security will perform in the market,but she can not compensate for the fact that she has not received what she was told to expect.accordingly,the prospectus disclosure of other,distinct risks can not render the alleged misstatement of nmi underwriting standards immaterial as a matter of law.
second,the defendants appellees argue that two newspaper articles would have informed the fund of the very information it claims that the prospectus withheld while the total mix of information relevant to the question of materiality can include publicly available information,case law does not support the sweeping proposition that an issuer of securities is never required to disclose publicly available information.litwin,at.indeed,we have previously stated that t here are serious limitations on a corporation ability to charge its stockholders with knowledge of information omitted from a document such as a prospectus on the basis that the information is public knowledge and otherwise available to them.kronfeld trans world airlines,cir thus,in the context of allegedly false or incomplete proxy solicitations,we have held that sporadic news reports should not be considered part of the total mix of information that would clarify or place in proper context representations that were contained in materials that the company provided directly.united paperworkers int l union int l paper,cir 
here,the defendants appellees cite an april,new york times article that stated that nmi had eased up on the required documentation of a borrower income,app x at,and an april,article in forbes that imputed loose underwriting standards to nmi,among other subprime lenders,id.at.these articles,however,are only sporadic news reports,which do not alone clarify or contextualize the alleged misstatements in the prospectus.paperworkers int l,at.moreover,neither article discloses what the fund alleges,namely,that nmi had abandoned its published underwriting guidelines.instead,the claim that nmi had eased up on the required documentation might only have referred to the number of loans it issued under its no documentation and stated income programs.similarly,the forbes article might plausibly have characterized nmi standards as loose simply because they did not conform to the fannie mae underwriting guidelines.app x at.thus,rather than revealing what the series prospectus omitted,these articles could be interpreted as criticisms of nmi for what that prospectus disclosed.such vague criticisms of nmi did not render the alleged abandonment of its underwriting guidelines public knowledge.see litwin,at.
finally,the defendants appellees argue that,because the prospectus disclosed an extensive amount of information about the loans contained in the series trust,including the borrowers credit scores and the ratios,no reasonable investor could have cared about the procedures by which nmi originated the loans.we think,however,that knowledge that the borrowers had low credit scores and that many of
