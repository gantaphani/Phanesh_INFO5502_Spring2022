smart world technologies smart world was one of many technology companies that did not survive the bursting of the technology bubble during.its business was free internet access.at some point during its existence,smart world began offering and selling membership interests in the company through a written prospectus.the stolz family partnership stolz purchased of these membership units for a total of with a subscription agreement signed on february.the sale was effective with the issuance of a certificate of membership to stolz on april.thereafter,smart world business collapsed,and it filed for bankruptcy in june of 
stolz filed its original complaint against smart world and three of its officers collectively,also,smart world in this putative class action in february and its amended complaint on june.stolz alleged that the offer and sale of the membership interests violated the securities act of,et securities act or act.the amended complaint contained two counts.count i alleged a violation of a of the securities act,a,claiming that smart world and three of its officers made a public offering of unregistered securities in violation of of the securities act.count ii of the amended complaint alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations in connection with a prospectus for the public offering of securities in violation of a of the securities act,a.
on a motion to dismiss by smart world,the district court dismissed count ii in its entirety and dismissed count i as to philip spies,the smart world cfo.stolz i,d at.count ii was dismissed under the bespeaks caution doctrine.the court found that the prospectus of smart world contained sufficient cautionary language concerning possible risks that an investor could not be misled by the alleged misrepresentations.as to count i,the court dismissed the claim against spies because spies was not a control person under of the securities act.
stolz subsequently amended its complaint again,filing the second amended complaint on november.the second amended complaint only included count i,and did not replead count ii.in the second amended complaint,smart world amended the allegations of the factual background.while it had previously alleged that b eginning in or about november,smart world engaged in a public offering,now the second amended complaint alleged in paragraph that b eginning in or about july,and continuously through the bankruptcy filing smart world engaged in a public offering.on a new motion by smart world,the district court dismissed stolz second amended complaint in its entirety.stolz family partnership,lp daum,d stolz ii.claims under a of the securities act face a statute of repose that states that i n no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under section or a of this title more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.the original complaint was filed on february.the district court found that this filing was more than three years after the membership interests were bona fide offered to the public,and thus the claim was barred.
we review de novo the district court dismissal under rule b,accepting as true the material facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.van buskirk v.the new york times,cir 
as a preliminary issue,we must address smart world argument that stolz has waived its a claims by not repleading them in the second amended complaint.but this is not our rule.we will not require a party,in an amended complaint,to replead a dismissed claim in order to preserve the right to appeal the dismissal when the court has not granted leave to amend such a formalistic requirement serves no valid purpose.in this respect,we join most other circuits.see young city of ranier,cir collecting cases see also moore federal practice,ed.in this situation where a claim has been dismissed without leave to amend it would be pointless to require the plaintiff to replead the dismissed claim and plaintiff counsel would be forced to bear the risk of sanctions to preserve the client right to appeal.stolz a claim is properly before us on appeal.
allegations of historical or present fact 
a defendant may not be liable under a for misrepresentations in a prospectus if the alleged misrepresentations were sufficiently balanced by cautionary language within the same prospectus such that no reasonable investor would be misled about the nature and risk of the offered security.see halperin ebanker,cir certain alleged misrepresentations in a stock offering are immaterial as a matter of law because it can not be said that any reasonable investor could consider them important in light of adequate cautionary language set out in the same offering.luce edelstein,cir we are not inclined to impose liability on the basis of statements that clearly bespeak caution.this is the bespeaks caution doctrine under which the district court dismissed stolz a claim.
although it does not appear that this circuit has ruled specifically on this issue,other circuits have expressly limited the application of the bespeaks caution doctrine to,prospective representations,but they have noted that the misrepresentation of present or historical facts can not be cured by cautionary language see,ep medsystems,echocath,cir by its terms,the bespeaks caution doctrine is directed only to statements.district courts within this circuit have recognized this limitation.in re complete mgmt.sec,d,noting that the bespeaks caution doctrine applies to statements only,and not to material omissions or misstatements of historical fact.emphasis in original.this is a reasonable limitation on the bespeaks caution doctrine and we adopt it here.the cautionary language associated with the bespeaks caution doctrine is aimed at warning investors that bad things may come to dealing with the contingent or unforeseen future.historical or present within the grasp of the a different matter.such facts exist and are known they are not unforeseen or contingent.it would be perverse indeed if an offeror could knowingly misrepresent historical facts but at the same time disclaim those misrepresented facts with cautionary language.
additionally,the cautionary language must be examined in the context of the representations to determine whether the language warns of the specific contingency that lies at the heart of the alleged misrepresentation.see hunt alliance am.gov t income trust,cir the cautionary language,however,must relate directly to that by which the plaintiffs claim to have been misled.
stolz allegations centered on oral representations made by smart world that it had hired an investment bank to do a million financing and to subsequently take smart world public with an initial public offering ipo that would raise to million.in its amended complaint,stolz laid out relevant parts of the factual background for its a allegations as follows 
smartworld orally represented to prospective investors that it had entered into an agreement with an investment bank to do a financing which would raise million and that it had made arrangements with an investment banking firm to file an ipo 
amended complaint at,app.at.the specific allegations of a violation of a followed thereafter 
at no time prior to plaintiff purchase of the membership interests did smart world disclose that the investment bank it had retained had failed to raise any money for the company,that no initial public offering was being planned,that the projections of sales and revenues it was relying upon were totally without foundation,or that the company was essentially insolvent and was supporting itself through continued sales of membership interests rather than from revenues from ongoing business operations.thus,smart world made untrue statements of a material fact omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements made not misleading in violation of a of the securities act.
amended complaint at app.at.
even taking all facts alleged as true and examining this paragraph in the light most favorable to stolz,we can find only one allegation that can be characterized as involving present or historical fact,and as thus insulated altogether from the bespeaks caution doctrine that no initial public offering was being planned.this statement can be characterized as alleging that there never existed the foundational agreement even to try to take smart world public.while it should take very little discovery to investigate the viability of this allegation,it was improperly dismissed at this early stage of litigation.
the remaining allegations in are prospective in nature,and the bespeaks caution doctrine is available.therefore,we turn next to smart world cautionary language and as in so many documents of this kind,there is a significant amount of it.in its prospectus for the membership interests,for example 
to expand our network,we may need additional capital,which we may not be able to obtain if we do not receive additional capital,we will need to seek alternative sources of financing if alternative sources of financing are required,but are insufficient or unavailable,we will have to modify our plans,which may adversely affect our growth.
prospectus at app.at emphasis added.and in the subscription agreement 
b no assurance can be given,nor has any been given,that any of the financing transactions or the expansion will be consummated.even if consummated,no assurance can be given that the expansion will be successful or the financing will generate capital sufficient to fund the expansion,the needs of the company in connection therewith,or the operations of the company on a going forward basis.it is understood that if the financing and the expansion are not successful,there likely will be no funds available to refund any of the money invested in the company by the undersigned.this is a speculative investment which could result in the loss of the investment in its entirety.
c there is no present public market for the units and it is unlikely that a public market for the units will develop in the future.no public market will develop if either the financing or the expansion is not successfully completed.
d due to the absence of a public market for the units i the undersigned will not be able to liquidate this investment in the event of an unexpected need for cash ii transferability of the units is extremely limited and iii in the event of a disposition of the units,the undersigned could sustain a loss.
subscription agreement,b d app.at emphasis added.this language sufficiently cautions prospective investors that future financing was tenuous.any oral representations concerning a million or a future ipo as opposed to the existence of an agreement to try to plan an ipo were neutralized by these cautionary statements.other than the allegation that no agreement with the investment bank concerning the ipo existed,stolz remaining a claims were properly dismissed.
the interpretation of statute of repose is a question of statutory interpretation that this court reviews de novo.lander hartford life annuity ins,cir.in determining whether stolz a claim is,we must address two issues what is a bona fide offer and at what point during the bona fide offer does the repose period begin 
what is a bona fide offer 
stolz argues that the bona fide offer that triggers the repose period is the effective date of the security registration statement.it certainly is true that,in the case of registered securities,the date of registration has been treated as the date that starts the running of the repose period most relevantly in the context of claims.finkel stratton,cir griffin painewebber,d,morse peat,marwick,mitchell.unlike claims,a claims often deal with claims that a stock was not registered at all,so this test is a.we believe,however,that the registration is merely the manifestation of the underlying test the genuineness of the offer to the public.the relevant question for is when was the stock really and truly genuinely being offered to the public,as opposed to,say,a simulated offering.obviously,such an interpretation makes considerable sense in the context of unregistered securities.
in contrast,adopting stolz argument means,as appellants readily acknowledge,that unregistered securities would never be subject to the repose period because,by definition,they would never be registered.this would be an absurd result,and stolz arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.additionally,the majority of courts and commentators to consider this issue agree with us.see,kubik goldfield,cir finding that stock is bona fide offered when genuinely offered to public,even if unregistered,but in context of dealer exemption under usc slagell bontrager,finding in dictum that bona fide means genuinely offered sowell butcher singer,wl,at.may,finding bona fide in is to be interpreted in a fashion similar to dealer exemption and means genuine but see bradford moench,finding that unregistered securities could never be bona fide offered to the public.in interpreting another part of the act,professor loss,of an authoritative treatise on securities regulation,also interpreted bona fide to mean genuine,and not legal,in the context of the dealer exemption in 
the phrase bona fide certainly does not refer to a legal offering.it was obviously copied from the original,where the single clause that in became clauses a and b excepted transactions within one year after the first date upon which the security was bona fide offered to the public by the issuer or by or through an underwriter.the bona fide phrase was the drafter device for ensuring,as now provided specifically in clause b,that the requirement should apply for an entire year from the date of the first genuine rather than simulated offering to the public.in other words,the emphasis was on public and not first.
louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation,ed emphasis added.stolz presents no good reason why bona fide should not have the same meaning in.see gustafson alloyd,d ruling that identical terms in different parts of act are intended to have the same context of term prospectus.
stolz reliance on the dictum in finkel is misplaced.in finkel,we noted that the plaintiffs in that case conceded that ordinarily,a security is bona fide offered to the public at the effective date of the registration statement.finkel,at.thus,stolz argues that the prong of the repose period does not begin to run absent a registration statement.the claim at issue in finkel,however,was a a claim,not a a claim the issue in question was how to define the word sale in and the securities in question were registered,not unregistered.finkel aside on an unrelated issue is not persuasive 
when during the bona fide offer does clock begin to run 
the more difficult issue is whether the repose period begins when the security is first bona fide offered to the public the test,or last bona fide offered to the public the test.we raise this issue nostra sponte.because of the novelty and importance of this issue,we requested and received briefing from the securities exchange commission sec as amicus curiae.
this is a difficult issue because the language of provides us with little direction.there are no modifiers attached to bona fide offered,and the sentence in which the phrase is embedded is equally susceptible to being read as either first bona fide offered or last bona fide offered.
however,the vast majority of courts to consider have impliedly or expressly found that the period begins when the security is first bona fide offered.see,eckstein balcor film investors,cir noting in dictum that s ection of the act gives investors the lesser of three years from the time the security was first bona fide offered to the public or one year from the time the fraud was discovered hanson johnson,wl,at.june,adopting test for unregistered securities and collecting cases ballenger applied digital solutions,d,that is,the action must be brought both within one year of the alleged violation and within three years of the time the security was first bona fide offered to the public.in re nbw commercial paper,adopting test and explaining that the three year period is a trap for the unwary investor and puts the risk on the investor to discover the date of offering in re laser arms.sec,courts have determined the bona fide offering date of an unregistered security to be the date the security was first quoted by a dealer in the pink sheets,which is the date on which trading in the security commenced.zola gordon,adopting test for a claims based on weight of authority dendinger first,wl,at.july,same stone fossil oil gas,stating that claim must be filed within three years after the securities were initially bona fide offered to the public sowell,wl,at accepting test without discussion waterman alta verde,adopting test based on weight of authority in re national mortgage equity.mortgage pool certificates sec,same slagell bontrager,adopting test for a violations involving unregistered securities morley cohen,t he court is persuaded that the statute of limitations commences to run on the date the securities were first bona fide offered to the public.lecroy dean witter reynolds,adopting,in what may be dictum,the test,but expressing some degree of disquietude morse.applying test in context of claims fischer int l,from every indication in the authorities,the crucial date,the date when a security is first offered to the public within the meaning of of title,is not earlier than the effective date of last amendment to the registration statement and not later than the date when the prospectus is released to,or other solicitation is made of,the public.kramer scientific control,accepting,in and a context,test without discussion osborne mallory,applying test without discussion ingenito bermec,dismissing case for failing to plead compliance with three year repose period by not indicating the date on which security was first offered to the public.
similarly,most leading commentators have interpreted the language of as implicating the first offering of a security as the triggering event for the repose period.loss,supra,d a i,at presumably bona fide offered means first offered to the public.emphasis in original richard jennings et,securities regulation ed.section apparently means that as to a portion of an unsold allotment purchased by the plaintiff more than three years after the initial public offering,a possible action under a was barred before it accrued.while this result is ridiculous,it seems to be what the statute says.thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation,at ed.i n the case of a slow offering,it is conceivable that the cause of action would be foreclosed before it even arises.while the wisdom of this result has been questioned,the generally accepted rule is that the three year repose period is unconditional william hicks,civil liabilities enforcement and litigation under the act a plaintiff seeking relief under a must establish that the filing occurred within three years after the security was first bona fide offered to the public.ali,federal securities code at in the case of a slow offering,a particular buyer might be barred by the statute of limitations before he bought.
in contrast,we have found only three courts,all district courts,that have adopted the test.bradford.at hudson capital mgmt.int l,no,wl,at,in re bestline products sec.antitrust,no.mdl,wl,at.march.bestline,an unpublished district court opinion addressing a motion to dismiss,is the of these cases,and bradford and hudson rely on it without providing any additional analysis.the relevant text states 
the defendants interpretation of the statute arguing the approach is simply at odds with the remedial purposes of the securities act of.to hold as the defendants suggest would be to give individuals a license to sell unregistered securities to whomsoever they wished if they first offered the security to a group of people and,so to speak,ran the gauntlet for three years.it is doubtful that congress intended the act goals of registration,disclosure,and private enforcement to be so easily frustrated.as a result,the defendants interpretation of section must be rejected in favor of the plaintiffs interpretation,according to which the limitations period began on the date the alleged security was last offered to the public.
in re bestline,wl,at.
normally,such a weight of authority in favor of the test would be determinative.however,an examination of the authorities supporting the test reveals a dearth of foundational analysis and a large number of courts adopting the test did so simply because so many other courts had already done so.therefore,while such a preponderance of precedent is due deference,we can not end our discussion here.
before we move on,however,we need briefly to cabin our discussion structure to the facts of the present case,as elucidated in stolz pleadings.we are dealing with a single public offering of unregistered securities that began more than three years before stolz filed its complaint,but was concluded within the three year repose period.it is not,therefore,the situation of a defendant being granted immunity to continue illicit offers without civil liability after three years have passed.see infra.
in general,a statute of repose acts to define temporally the right to initiate suit against a defendant after a legislatively determined time period.unlike a statute of limitations,a statute of repose is not a limitation of a plaintiff remedy,but rather defines the right involved in terms of the time allowed to bring suit.
s tatutes of limitations bear on the availability of remedies and,as such,are subject to equitable defenses,the various forms of tolling,and the potential application of the discovery rule.in contrast,statutes of repose affect the availability of the underlying right that right is no longer available on the expiration of the specified period of time.in theory,at least,the legislative bar to subsequent action is absolute,subject to legislatively created exceptions set forth in the statute of repose.
calvin corman,limitation of actions,at.therefore,a statute of repose begins to run without interruption once the necessary triggering event has occurred,even if equitable considerations would warrant tolling or even if the plaintiff has not yet,or could not yet have,discovered that she has a cause of action.jackson nat.life ins.merrill lynch,cir the period is an absolute limitation which applies whether or not the investor could have discovered the violation.but see lyman johnson,securities fraud and the mirage of repose.arguing that courts are mistaken to read equitable tolling out of repose period.
in fact,as noted earlier,a repose period can run to completion even before injury has occurred to a potential plaintiff,extinguishing a cause of action before it even accrues.stuart,cir citations omitted see also,masters hesston,cir finding illinois statute of repose for strict product liability actions barred suit against manufacturer of allegedly defective product when injury occurred years after first sale of product lamb by and through donaldson volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft,simply stated,a statute of repose is triggered once the product is delivered to its first purchaser.if an injury results from the product after the authorized period has elapsed the victim is without recourse to the manufacturer of the product.nygaard goodin,validating statute that barred of workers compensation claims after four years even though claimant right to reopen based on worsening injury had not yet vested by the time the repose period expired.
this prospect does raise the possibility that a potential plaintiff might,through no lack of diligence on her part,find herself without any recourse for an injury that,if it had occurred earlier,would have been remediable.such a possibility,however,may not be inconsistent with the purpose of a statute of repose.
the statute of repose does not bar a cause of action its effect,rather,is to prevent what might otherwise be a cause of action,from ever arising the injured party injured after the repose period has passed literally has n o cause of action.the harm that has been done is damnum absque wrong for which the law affords no redress.
