the opinion filed on october,is amended as follows.
the last sentence of the second paragraph in part i,which reads 
betz told como and castro that she knew nothing about stocks and bonds and that she only would understand the bottom line,or total balance,of her account.
shall be deleted in its entirety.
in addition,the second and third sentences of footnote,which currently read 
in davis birr,wilson,cir,for example,we concluded that summary judgment on the issue of notice was proper because the plaintiff was a and experienced investor who made suggestions to his broker about his portfolio and who described himself as a sophisticated investor.id.at.by contrast,betz had informed the defendants that she had no experience with stocks or bonds and would only understand the bottom line of her account statements,and thereafter,if we credit betz testimony,received specific assurances from the president of trainer wortham that her account problems would be resolved and that she should forego suit.
shall be deleted and replaced with the following text 
for example,in davis birr,wilson,cir per curiam,a case our adoption of the standard for inquiry notice in federal securities fraud cases,we concluded that summary judgment on the issue of notice was proper where the plaintiff took an active role in the management of his investments and made suggestions to his broker about his portfolio.see id.at.by contrast,betz merely expressed generalized concerns about her declining account balance,in response to which,if we credit betz testimony,she received specific assurances from the president of trainer wortham that her account problems would be resolved and that she should forego suit.no such evidence of assurances from the highest levels of the defendant securities firm was present in davis.
having made the foregoing amendments to the opinion,all judges on the panel have voted to deny petition for panel rehearing,and so that petition is denied.
the full court has been advised of petition for rehearing en banc,and a judge of this court requested a vote on whether this case should be reheard en banc however,a majority of the active judges did not vote in favor of en banc consideration.fed.accordingly,the petition for rehearing en banc is also denied.no further petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc shall be accepted.
here we are,out in left field again.the panel unique interpretation of the statute of limitations for securities fraud puts us at odds with ten other circuits.
this is one of those byzantine securities cases involving convertible debentures or strip bonds there was no,prospectus artfully concealing liabilities.betz claims,rather,that defendant induced her to invest million by promising a princely return with zero risk.op.at.this purported oral flatly contradicts betz written contract and common her sole theory of fraud.if a securities defendant in a simple case like this can not use the statute of limitations as a shield against the costs and hazards of trial,then no defendant can,and the statute of limitations congress passed for cases is pretty much a dead letter in this circuit.
betz found out that her investment was after all by february,when she received an account statement from the bank showing a balance lower than her initial investment.how could a investment result in such a massive loss of principal does mean that the principal will never diminish betz admits that she read the statement and grasped the bottom line.order at.thereafter,her principal steadily dwindled she received more account statements charting its inexorable decline.one would think that a sane,rational,reasonable investor who discovered that her principal was fast disappearing after she had been promised that it would not be touch ed,op.at,would suspect that someone lied to her.yet betz waited three and a half years to bring double the time congress allowed.b.
the panel keeps betz lawsuit alive by invoking the mantra of material issues of fact that only a jury can decide.op.at.but there no factual dispute here everyone agrees on what betz knew and when she knew it.the only question is whether those facts were enough to put a reasonable investor on inquiry notice.see dissent infra.ten other circuits have held that inquiry notice may be determined as a matter of law where,as here,the underlying facts are admitted or undisputed.maggio gerard freezer ice,cir paddling stubbornly against the current,the panel insists that only a jury can decide 
but there more,so much more.according to the same ten circuits,the statute of limitations starts to run when plaintiff is on inquiry notice,that is,when a reasonable investor in plaintiff position would suspect he had been defrauded.see,sterlin biomune,cir.the panel pretends to adopt this standard,but rejects it in fact.since betz theory of fraud is that she was told her money would not be put at risk,she had at least inquiry notice that someone had lied to her when she saw her principal melt away like a popsicle in july.the appendix tells the tale in betz own hand it is her account statement from january,showing a balance that was by then nearly million below her initial investment.scribbled in the margin are betz notes describing a panic ked phone call to her account manager complaining about her losses.though the opinion does acknowledge this particular inquiry,it does mention a similar call betz placed to the same manager two months later.op.at.betz made these inquiries and several others like them more than two years before she sued in july so,to save her from the statute of limitations,the panel must adopt a bizarre definition of inquiry notice notice that actually causes the investor to make inquiries is nevertheless insufficient to put a reasonable investor on notice to make inquiries.no other court in the known universe has adopted such an oxymoronic rule.
five other circuits have dealt with cases where investors claimed they were hoodwinked by promises that their dollars would multiply like bunnies with absolutely no risk.all five held that the statute of limitations was triggered as soon as the investors found out they lost money,if not before.the first and third circuits held that sharply declining balances put investors on notice that the promised lack of risk was a lie.mathews kidder,peabody,cir nygaard,cooperativa de ahorro y credito aguada kidder,peabody,cir boudin.had betz lived in boston or philadelphia,she would have been on inquiry notice by january,at the very latest by then,her account had lost about half its value,and the bank had confirmed that those losses were real.the second,fourth and fifth circuits have held that investors in betz position are on inquiry notice even soon as they are handed documents warning them that their investments would be riskier than promised.dodds cigna,cir winter,brumbaugh princeton partners,cir wilkinson,topalian ehrman,cir garza.had betz lived in new york,baltimore or houston,she would have been on inquiry notice as soon as she opened her account and received the bank letter of understanding,which told her,in contradiction to the alleged oral promise,that her investment was subject to investment risk and a possible loss of principal.
in reaching the contrary conclusion,the panel holds that betz could be on inquiry notice until she had solid proof of every single element of her claim,including scienter.op.at.and,without more proof of scienter,the panel opines,a reasonable investor in betz position would have believed that the bank really did mean to put the money into,but somehow got confused and bought volatile stocks instead.according to the panel,it would have crossed a reasonable investor mind that the bank lied when it promised a investment until june,when betz had lost about of her principal and the bank refused to make good her losses.see op.at the argument does serious violence to reasonable investor and inquiry notice.
the panel cites no authority supporting its curious notion that an investor is on inquiry notice until he has concrete proof of every element of his claim,including scienter.there is no such authority ten circuits disagree.tellingly,the only case the panel cites fujisawa pharmaceutical kapoor,cir posner,holds just the opposite.fujisawa considered the panel position 
plaintiff contends that the statute of limitations does begin to run until the victim has in hand all the facts he needs in order to bring suit immediately 
id.at.but unlike our panel,the seventh circuit saw the obvious problem with this approach if the statute does start to run until plaintiff has proof of every element of his claim,plaintiff has no incentive to bring suit promptly.instead,he will often prefer a approach 
on this view,the potential plaintiff can complete his investigation,draft his complaint,and put the complaint in a drawer to be taken out in a year and filed if the price of the stock has fallen.
such delay is unfair to defendants,as the fourth circuit recognized in a similar case.while plaintiff is waiting to see whether his investment recovers on its own,defendant loses the security of knowing when legal action against him has been foreclosed.brumbaugh,at.plaintiff,by contrast,gets the benefit of a heads i win,tails you lose bet if the investment goes up,he reaps the profit if it goes down,he gets to recover his losses in court.worse still,plaintiff delay may prejudice defendant case as m emories fade,documents are lost,and witnesses become unavailable.id.if plaintiff spins out the statute of limitations long enough,he may be able to coerce settlement simply because aging has improved an originally meritless claim.id.after this opinion,we might as well rename the pslra in the ninth circuit as the splfea securities plaintiffs lawyers full employment act.
for all those reasons,every other circuit to consider the issue has followed the rule explained in brumbaugh and fujisawa t he facts that put the victim of the fraud on notice can fall short of actual proof of fraud.fujisawa,at.five other circuits state the point just as bluntly.see mgmt.telxon,cir plaintiff may not delay the commencement of the statute of limitations until after it has secured direct evidence of defendant culpability tello dean witter reynolds,cir i nquiry notice is triggered by evidence of the possibility of fraud,not f ull exposition of the scam itself internal quotation marks omitted sterlin,at dodds,at an investor does not have to have notice of the entire fraud being perpetrated to be on inquiry notice.kennedy josephthal,cir.
other circuits express the same idea by analogizing inquiry notice to storm warnings hints that something may be amiss so that the investor needs to start asking some hard questions.a plaintiff has storm is therefore on inquiry before the storm itself is upon him.where,as here,an investor is promised a certain return on a investment,but instead loses money by the bushel,the losses are storm warnings that the promise may have been a lie.see sudo,terrebonne parish consol.gov t,cir decline in value of plaintiff investment is a storm warning putting plaintiff on notice that defendant promises were lies mathews,at storm warnings include information that conflicts with representations that were made when the securities were originally purchased davidson wilson,cir storm warnings include reports from defendants showing a substantial discrepancy between the amounts promised and those actually received.we are the only circuit to hold that plaintiff has no storm warnings until the hurricane makes landfall.
the panel makes matters even worse by throwing a second pipe wrench into the machinery of the statute of limitations.as an alternative ground,the panel holds that,even if betz was on inquiry notice of possible thus had a duty to bank thwarted her inquiries by giving her assurances that her fortunes would improve.op.at.because of those assurances,the panel tells us,a reasonable investor in betz position just could have figured out that the bank had lied and therefore would have had no grounds for filing suit.that truly what they say check it out.id.
there is a handful of cases where a defendant outright lies and malfeasances prevented an investor who made diligent inquiries from discovering facts known only to the defendant.in such cases,courts have held that the statute was triggered.for instance,the panel cites sec seaboard,cir,where plaintiff claimed he asked defendant tough questions about facts that were in defendant exclusive possession,and defendant responded by lying about those facts.as a result,plaintiff held off suing.id.at.applying a standard we held that there was a factual dispute as to whether plaintiff could have discovered those facts on his own.see also,marks cdw computer,cir plaintiff inquired about fraud but defendant lied and refused to allow plaintiff to inspect the company books.
but ours is not a case where defendant thwarted plaintiff from developing the facts.indeed,betz does claim that the bank misrepresented any facts.the bank did not,for example,tell betz that she still had percent of her principal,even though the statements did show it.quite the opposite the bank confirmed that betz principal was gone.the bank did predict she would get her money back when the stock market recovered,but such a statement only confirms that plaintiff investment is subject to market fluctuations and is therefore not free from risk.a defendant who conceals facts may conceivably prevent a reasonably diligent investor from discovering the truth,but a defendant who jollies a disappointed investor along with sunny forecasts of future bull markets conceals nothing and thus does not prevent the investor from gathering enough information to bring suit.
the panel alternate ruling is as bad as the first,perhaps worse.one wonders what a securities defendant could say to an unhappy investor that would not,under the panel standard,toll the statute of limitations forever,no matter how many storm warnings the investor has received.if winds that uproot half of one property can be neutralized by a forecast of clear skies and mild breezes to come,then anything a defendant may say or refuse to say will,under the panel holding,constitute deliberate concealment that prevents plaintiff from learning what he needs to bring suit.needless to say,no other circuit has hacked this gaping hole into the statute of limitations.see,whirlpool fin.gn holdings,cir defendants attributed poor performance to a market recession,rather than fraud,but that could have prevented plaintiffs from discovering the facts needed to bring suit de la fuente dci,defendants disclosures were tempered with positive statements,but that optimism could have prevented investors from discovering the facts needed to bring suit.
by holding that only a jury can decide when the statute of limitations is triggered,the panel parts company with ten other circuits and forces defendants to trial even where the historical facts are in dispute.by inventing a rule that the statute is triggered until plaintiff gets proof of every element of his claim,including scienter,the panel again breaks with ten other circuits and takes our law even deeper into uncharted waters.and by holding that the statute stops running the moment defendant makes a cheerful noise,the panel effectively writes the statute of limitations off the books.businesses unfortunate enough to be sued in this circuit for securities fraud might as well forget about b it is nothing but a filigree on the statutory page.
we must decide whether heide betz federal securities fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations we hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether betz claim is time barred,and we reverse the district court summary judgment for the defendants.
on an appeal of summary judgment we,like the district court,view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draw all justifiable inferences in the party favor.anderson liberty lobby,d.viewed in the light most favorable to betz,the facts are as follows 
in,betz,a retired art dealer,sold her house for million.betz planned to buy a and invest the proceeds of the sale of her house to provide interest income.an employee of first republic bank named carmen castro introduced betz to david como,an employee of trainer wortham,an investment subsidiary of first republic bank.como and castro recommended that betz invest the proceeds from the sale of her house with trainer wortham.como and castro assured betz that,if she invested her million with trainer wortham,she could withdraw per month from her portfolio,for living expenses,without touching the million in principal.
according to betz,on june,betz entered into an oral agreement with como,who was acting on behalf of trainer wortham,giving the defendants control over her million.betz and como agreed that como would invest betz money in such a fashion that betz would receive a month from the profit of the investment and that the defendants would not touch the principal.the same day,betz and como,who was again acting on trainer wortham behalf,entered into a written letter of understanding for portfolio management and administration services and an investment management agreement.these documents explicitly stated that betz account was subject to market risk and that no person has represented to betz that any particular result can or will be achieved.however,these documents also contained no merger or integration clauses and made no reference to the alleged oral agreement regarding betz in monthly maintenance income.
after betz opened her account with trainer wortham,she received account statements at least once per month.in february,betz received a statement reflecting an account value below her initial investment of million.between february and july,betz received more account statements,each reflecting an account balance of less than million.in march,betz account balance had dropped to.around that time,betz spoke with robert vile,a trainer wortham employee,to express concern about the declining value of her account.vile told betz that the declining balance was attributable to her monthly withdrawals he assured her,however,that the shortfall was temporary,that the market would recover,and that in a year or less her account balance would be back to million.when subsequent account statements showed the balance of betz account continuing to fall,she met with castro,who told her that there was a serious problem with the way betz portfolio had been managed and that the president of trainer wortham,charles moore,would take care of the account because it was the right thing to do and because trainer wortham value d their client relationships.in may,after betz had met with moore in person,castro called betz to tell her that moore was meeting with other principals and attorneys regarding her account,and that betz should be patient with them and not take any legal action.however,in june,castro advised betz that trainer wortham was not going to do anything at all to remedy the declining value of her account.
betz filed her complaint in this case on july,alleging that como,vile,trainer wortham,and first republic bank collectively,trainer wortham or defendants had committed securities fraud in violation of b of the securities exchange act of,b,and rule of the securities exchange commission.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that betz federal securities fraud claim was barred by the statute of limitations.section a of the act of,stat,codified at b,provides that a suit for securities fraud under b of the securities exchange act must be filed not later than the earlier of years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation or years after such violation.the district court held that,because betz had inquiry notice of the defendants violations of b before july,betz claims were time barred,and on this ground the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.olympic pipe line city of seattle,cir.federal rule of civil procedure c entitles a party to summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.as we noted above,in deciding a motion for summary judgment,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.anderson,at.
the defendants contend that betz suit is time barred because she had both actual and inquiry notice of the facts giving rise to her claim.betz contends that she had neither.
we first address actual notice.betz suit is timely only if she filed it not later than years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation.b.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to betz,there is a genuine issue of fact about whether betz actually discovered that she had a claim against the defendants for securities fraud more than two years before she filed her suit on july.for betz to have a claim under b,the defendants must have had,among other things,scienter,which is the mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.see ernst ernst hochfelder,d see also simpson aol time warner,cir listing the elements of a federal securities fraud claim,petition for cert.filed sub nom.avis budget group,cal.state teachers ret,wl filed.in in re silicon graphics.securities litigation,cir,we held that to adequately plead scienter,a b plaintiff must plead,in great detail,facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of deliberately reckless or conscious misconduct.we went on to describe this heightened pleading standard as follows 
our holding rests,in part,on our conclusion that congress intended to elevate the pleading requirement above the second circuit standard requiring plaintiffs merely to provide facts showing simple recklessness or a motive to commit fraud and opportunity to do so.we hold that although facts showing mere recklessness or a motive to commit fraud and opportunity to do so may provide some reasonable inference of intent,they are not sufficient to establish a strong inference of deliberate recklessness.in order to show a strong inference of deliberate recklessness,plaintiffs must state facts that come closer to demonstrating intent,as opposed to mere motive and opportunity.accordingly,we hold that particular facts giving rise to a strong inference of deliberate recklessness,at a minimum,is required to satisfy the heightened pleading standard under the pslra.
we can not say that,as a matter of law,betz,before july,actually discovered facts suggesting that the defendants consciously or deliberately and recklessly deceived her.under the version of facts presented by betz,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that betz did not discover that the defendants intentionally misled her into believing that she could withdraw per month without depleting her principal until june,when moore told her that trainer wortham was not going to do anything to fix her account.
if the statute of limitations began running only upon betz actual discovery of the facts giving rise to her securities fraud claim,this would end our inquiry.however,the defendants contend that,even if betz did not actually discover the facts underlying her claim before july,betz was on inquiry notice of her claim before that date,and that her claim therefore is still barred by the statute of limitations.we address that argument in the next section.
we have held that the statute of limitations for a federal securities fraud claim begins to run when the plaintiff has either actual or inquiry notice that the defendants have made a fraudulent misrepresentation.see,gray first winthrop,cir volk davidson,cir.in more recent cases,however,it has been suggested that under the united states supreme court decision in lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d,only actual notice of the facts forming the alleged fraud,and not inquiry notice of those facts,triggers the running of the statute of limitations for a b claim see berry valence,cir see also livid holdings salomon smith barney,cir.the uncertainty introduced by our opinion in berry led us to suggest in livid holdings that,notwithstanding our unequivocal case law,we had considered,but not made a final determination on whether actual or inquiry notice of the alleged fraud triggers the running of rule statute of limitations.livid holdings,at.
in lampf,the supreme court resolved a split among the circuits regarding the statute of limitations applicable to a b claim.see lampf,at.some circuits had borrowed state statutes of limitations,while others had established a unique federal limitations period.see id.at.the supreme court in lampf held that the statute of limitations provided in e of the securities exchange act,e,was the appropriate standard.see lampf,at.section e provides that n o action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under this section,unless brought within one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation and within three years after such violation.no one disputes that discovery can occur when a plaintiff actually discovers facts giving rise to his or her claim.however,lampf left it to the lower courts to decide whether discovery occurs only upon actual notice or whether discovery can occur on some form of inquiry notice.
we hold that either actual or inquiry notice can start the running of the statute of limitations on a federal securities fraud claim.while it is unquestioned that actual notice can mark the beginning of the limitations period,two things happened in the aftermath of lampf that convince us that an inquiry notice standard should also apply to federal securities fraud claims.first,the courts of appeal in our sister circuits,along with the district courts in our own circuit,have uniformly embraced inquiry notice.in fact,every circuit to have addressed the issue since lampf has held that inquiry notice is the appropriate standard.berry,at see fin.sec.assurance,stephens,cir shah meeker,cir glaser enzo biochem,cir citing brumbaugh princeton partners,cir new england health care employees pension fund ernst young,llp,cir in re nahc.sec,cir young lepone,cir ritchey horner,cir sterlin biomune,cir marks cdw computer,cir topalian ehrman,cir.likewise,the district courts in our circuit regularly apply an inquiry notice standard to b claims.see,in re micron.sec,no,wl,at,in re immune response sec,d,in re infonet servs.sec,d,getty harmon,d,freedman,in re syntex.sec,aff,cir aizuss commonwealth equity trust.while not binding on us,the reasoned opinions of ten of our sister circuits and the widespread practices of the district courts in our own circuit weigh heavily in favor of holding that inquiry notice can trigger the running of the statute of limitations on a securities fraud claim.the uniformity of the precedent in this direction sends a signal message that inquiry notice,and not merely actual notice,can cause the statute of limitations for securities fraud to begin to run.
the second event that convinces us that an inquiry notice standard is appropriate is an act of congress.in the act of,congress extended the limitations period for b suits from one year after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation,e,to years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation for actions commenced after july,b act,b.in its new enactment,congress opted for language identical to the language previously in effect in e of the securities exchange act,e.the supreme court has instructed that we should assume that congress is aware of the prevailing case law and legislates in its light.see cannon of chicago,d it is always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives,like other citizens,know the law see also merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,curran,d interpreting the commodity exchange act in light of case law.in,the prevailing case law in the lower federal courts interpreted the language of e to mean that the limitations period could be commenced upon some form of inquiry notice.by choosing language nearly identical to the language of e,congress implicitly approved of that case law.see cannon,at.interpreting title ix to provide a private cause of action because congress used language identical to that found in title vi,which had already been interpreted by the courts to provide a private cause of action abrego dow chem,cir per curiam holding that the silence of the class action fairness act regarding the burden of proving removal jurisdiction indicated congressional intent to leave intact the common law rule placing the burden on the defendant united states male juvenile,cir noting that i n construing statutes,we presume congress legislated with awareness of relevant judicial decisions and holding that congress failure to explicitly include tribal governments within the federal juvenile delinquency act definition of state,when amending other parts of the act,may be interpreted as an endorsement of the judicial decisions excluding tribes from the definition of state.
we recognize that the pragmatic effects of applying an inquiry notice standard to b are both positive and negative for individual litigants.as was suggested in berry,a case decided under the old limitations period,such a standard may compel plaintiffs to file a suit based on skimpy facts.see berry,at quoting charles benjamin nutley,comment,triggering limitations on section b and rule actions actual or inquiry discovery,san diego.however,congress extension of the relevant limitations period from one to two years alleviates this concern and allows us to conclude that an inquiry notice standard strikes an acceptable balance between the interest in requiring plaintiffs promptly to file suit and the competing interest in avoiding the encouragement of baseless or premature suits by requiring plaintiffs to sue before they can discover the facts underlying their claims.see new england health care employees pension fund,at young,at sterlin,at.
we have previously stated that,if we were to adopt an inquiry notice standard for b suits,we would apply a standard similar to that applied by the tenth circuit.see livid holdings,at berry,at.today we adopt the test used by the tenth circuit.see,sterlin biomune,cir holding that inquiry notice triggers an investor duty to exercise reasonable diligence and that the statute of limitations period begins to run once the investor,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered the facts underlying the alleged fraud.under that standard,to determine when the statute of limitations begins running,we first determine when the plaintiff had inquiry notice of the facts giving rise to his or her securities fraud claim.a plaintiff is on inquiry notice when there exists sufficient suspicion of fraud to cause a reasonable investor to investigate the matter further.like our sister circuits,we caution that inquiry notice should not be construed so broadly that the particular plaintiff can not bring his or her suit within the limitations period.the facts constituting inquiry notice must be sufficiently probative of advanced beyond the stage of a mere suspicion to incite the victim to investigate.fujisawa pharm.kapoor,cir,quoted in tello dean witter reynolds,cir.once a plaintiff has inquiry notice,we ask when the investor,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have discovered the facts constituting the alleged fraud.the answer to that second question tells us when the statute of limitations began to run.
the question of whether inquiry notice exists is objective and contemplates a reasonable investor or reasonable person standard.see,newman warnaco group,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted holding that inquiry notice of securities fraud is triggered when the plaintiff receives sufficient storm warnings to alert a reasonable person to the probability that there were either misleading statements or significant omissions involved mathews kidder,peabody,cir holding that inquiry notice exists where a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have discovered the suspicious information and recognized it as suspicious great rivers coop.of iowa farmland,cir inquiry notice is present when the victim is aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to investigate and consequently acquire actual knowledge of the defendant misrepresentations.the existence of inquiry notice is only the first prong of the test that we are today adopting,and the sec
