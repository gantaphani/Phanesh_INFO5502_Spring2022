factual procedural history 
mercury,a company with annual revenues of million,provides fuel to small commercial and commuter airlines.eighty percent of its revenues are generated by the sale of fuel.its usual business practice is to invest in and to extend credit to airlines in order to obtain fuel agreements with them.
mansour is chairman and largest shareholder of sun jet holdings.sun jet holdings operated sun jet international sun jet,a niche airline which provided flights with limited frequencies to travelers.
in late may or early june,mercury contacted banmiller,ceo of sun jet,about entering into a fuel agreement and the possibility of investing in sun jet.mercury also received a copy of sun jet private placement memorandum ppm and an addendum to the ppm dated may,which lowered sun jet income projections.the ppm stated that sun jet did not intend to update or to revise the projections.
on july,mercury board of directors decided to invest in sun jet,conditioned on the execution of a fuel agreement.on august,sun jet transmitted its second quarter financial statements to its shareholders,which it did not provide to mercury.the statements indicated,as of june,that sun jet had fallen significantly below the income projections detailed in the ppm and addendum.on august,the parties entered into an irrevocable stock subscription agreement,and on august,mercury invested in sun jet.on september,mercury received the second quarter financial statements.thereafter,it extended million in unsecured fuel credit to sun jet on october.sun jet later filed for bankruptcy in june.mercury lost its investment and filed suit against mansour.
seymour khan khan,mercury chairman and ceo,testified in a deposition that he was the only person at mercury who spoke with mansour and banmiller regarding the information upon which its board of directors decided to invest in sun jet.khan also testified that had he received the second quarter financial statements as of july,he still would have invested in sun jet.khan also admitted that although mansour and banmiller made no false statements to him before july,and that the facts upon which sun jet based its may projections in the addendum were not false,he hoped to discover information which would provide mercury a basis for pursuing the lawsuit against mansour.khan further stated that although he had no contact with babcock,a director of sun jet,mercury included him as a party because his name appeared on the ppm.khan also admitted that he had made no independent investigation of sun jet.

rule claims 
mercury argues that mansour violated rule when it failed to disclose the updated projections based on the second quarter statements.in order to demonstrate a violation of rule,the plaintiff must show a material misstatement or omission which occurred in connection with the purchase or sale of securities that was made with scienter harm,and causation.krim,at rubinstein,at.in addition,the fifth circuit requires that the plaintiff perform due diligence in order to protect her interests.krim,at citing stephenson paine webber jackson curtis,cir.
mercury first alleged in its complaint that mansour violated rule by materially misrepresenting sun jet financial condition.it conceded,however,that there was no evidence of a material misrepresentation made to it by mansour.kahn testified,for example,that there was nothing to his knowledge that was available as of july,the date mercury decided to invest in sun jet,that presented a different financial position for the company than was described in the ppm and the addendum.moreover,kahn admitted that not only had mansour not made any false statements regarding sun jet,but also that many of the risk factors,as outlined in the cautionary language of the investment materials,were unpredictable.thus,the district court granted mansour motion for summary judgment because there was no evidence which raised a genuine issue of material fact with respect to mercury claims.
mercury also alleged common law negligence in its complaint,which the district court construed as negligent misrepresentation.the court found that mercury failed to explain the basis for this claim because mercury was unable to identify the duty owed by mansour to it which it believed mansour breached.
on appeal,mercury argues that mansour violated rule when it failed to update the projections in the investment materials based on the second quarter statements.it is,however,unclear on what basis mercury makes this argument.it appears that mercury is alleging that mansour negligently misrepresented sun jet financial condition,since the company actual financial health differed markedly from that predicted by the projections.this argument is meritless,given the concessions mercury made in the district court,the warnings contained in the investment materials and the lack of precedent to support mercury position.
mercury nonetheless contends that the reasonable investor would find the updated income projections material to its investment decision.the relevant inquiry for analyzing the materiality of such predictions is whether a reasonable investor would have considered the information material according to the total mix of information.krim,at see also isquith middle south utilities,et,cir stating that the correct standard is whether the information disclosed would have been misleading to a reasonable potential investor who read the information as a whole.in addition,the materiality of predictions is analyzed on a basis.isquith,at.
mercury correctly notes that ordinarily a reasonable investor may deem a significant decrease in projected income material to its decision to invest in an entity.in the instant case,however,this determination of materiality to a reasonable investor is overshadowed by kahn admission that despite the disappointing results from the second quarter financial statements,mercury still would have invested in sun jet.additionally,even after it had received the statements,mercury extended million in unsecured credit,an amount that was at least twice its initial investment.theref
