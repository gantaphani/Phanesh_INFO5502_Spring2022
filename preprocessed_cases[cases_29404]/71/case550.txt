opinion of the court 
chase manhattan bank appeals the district court denial of its.b motion for reconsideration of the final judgment excluding chase from the settlement of a securities fraud action that investors brought against cendant.chase portion of the settlement fund,which would have exceeded million,reverts to cendant under the terms of the settlement stipulation.specifically,chase claims alternatively,either that its handling of its claims did not constitute neglect on its part,or that the district court erred in failing to apply correctly the standards for determining excusable neglect in denying chase proof of claim 
cendant counters chase appeal on numerous grounds,only one of which we need consider in this appeal,the other claims having been resolved against cendant in our opinion in a related case,in re cendant corporation prides litigation,cir cendant sole remaining is that the district court properly denied chase the ability to participate in the settlement because chase failed to demonstrate excusable neglect.because the facts before us are incomplete,and because the district court did not make clear its reasoning and application of the excusable neglect factors,we find that we do not have a sufficient basis to review the district court ruling for abuse of discretion.see gunter ridgewood energy,cir.we will,therefore,vacate the district court decision and remand this case to the district court with directions to undertake a more thorough determination,with requisite factual findings,of whether the circumstances support chase claims of excusable neglect.
because related litigation is already the subject of at least three published opinions,each exhaustively setting forth the procedural and factual background,we will not do so here,but instead refer interested parties to these prior dispositions we set forth only those facts crucial to a resolution of the dispute here.
this appeal is one of several which arise out of the large securities fraud class action cendant prides litigation involving cendant and its former officers.in june,the district court approved a million settlement of the cendant prides class action litigation.under the terms of the stipulation of agreement of settlement and compromise the stipulation,cendant agreed to distribute one right,with a theoretical value of,for each prides owned as of the close of business on april.see also in re cendant.prides,d at.to collect the rights,each prides owner was required to submit a valid proof of claim by june.the proofs of claim could take the form of monthly brokerage account statements,or if prides were not held in brokerage accounts,the form of business records maintained in the ordinary course of business.under the terms of the settlement hearing order,a settlement administrator,valley forge administrative services,was to verify the proofs of claim.the rights,which are publicly traded,expire on february,when,in combination with the current prides,they will be exchanged for new prides 
chase is custodian for three mutual funds in which it held prides capital income builder,cib,income fund of america ifa,and capital and world growth and income,world growth.as of april,chase held prides for cib,with a settlement value of prides for ifa,with a settlement value of and prides for world growth,with a settlement value of with a total of for all three funds.pursuant to the terms of the stipulation,chase submitted three timely proofs of claim to participate in that settlement.for two of the claims,ifa and world growth,the administrator requested of chase additional documentation,that is,the administrator sent a request to cure.chase supplied the additional information,and though it was apparently sent four days late,the administrator approved the ifa and world growth claims.
cendant moved to disallow chase claims and those of other class members because of various minor filing delays.chase alleges that neither cendant,the prides class,nor the district court,notified it of either that motion or the resulting court ruling that claimants had to submit an excuse for any delay in order to preserve a claim that is why,maintains chase,it did not submit an excuse.as a result,the district court,on january,denied chase claims.on february,the district court certified its january order as final and appealable.as to the cib claim,though the administrator asserts that it sent a request to cure,chase claims that the letter was never received.the administrator denied that claim for failure to cure.
chase insists that it first learned of these dispositions in april of,and on april,filed a motion under.rule b to vacate the denial of its claims and to extend the time to appeal under rule a.on june,the district court denied chase motion,though as chase notes,the district court found that permitting claimants to participate in the settlement would not prejudice cendant 
chase challenges the district court denial of its b motion to permit it to participate in the underlying settlement.specifically,chase asserts on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to excuse chase delays in providing excuses for earlier minor filing delays due to lack of notice and the district court failed to apply properly the standards for determining excusable neglect outlined in pioneer inv.servs.brunswick.ptrshp,d.the district court,maintains chase,erroneously applied to chase ifa,world growth,and cib funds,the presumption that chase received various notices,when the funds had not.chase insists that had the district court properly applied the law it would have excused the delay and permitted chase to participate in the settlement,based upon the following factors,among others lack of prejudice to cendant the inconsequential delay as to ifa and world growth chase timely filing of its b motion the delay lack of impact on the judicial proceedings class notices which were confusing or not received,and chase unchallenged good faith in handling the claims of all three funds.
we review the district court denial of the b motion for abuse of discretion in re envntl.energy,cir.we have held as to abuse of discretion,generally,that an abuse of discretion arises when the d istrict c ourt decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.oddi ford motor,cir citation omitted.an abuse of discretion may also occur when no reasonable person would adopt the district court view.id.finally,we will not interfere with the d istrict c ourt exercise of discretion unless there is a definite and firm conviction that the court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.id.
a.the b excusable neglect analysis 
our prime inquiry is whether chase should have been relieved from the effects of the district court january,order denying its claims.
b provides,in pertinent part 
rule.relief from judgment or order 
b mistakes inadvertence excusable neglect newly discovered evidence fraud.on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment,order,or proceeding was entered or taken.
emphasis supplied.
in pioneer,supra,the supreme court delineated the analysis required for a finding of excusable neglect made applicable to rule b though pioneer was a bankruptcy case and held that courts are permitted,where appropriate,to accept late filings even where caused by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness,as well as by intervening circumstances beyond a party control.at the outset,the supreme court pronounced that the inquiry is essentially equitable and necessitates considering a situation totality 
because congress has provided no other guideposts for determining what sorts of neglect will be considered excusable,we conclude that the determination is at bottom an equitable
