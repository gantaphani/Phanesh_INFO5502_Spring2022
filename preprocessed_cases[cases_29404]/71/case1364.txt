donner management company appeals from an order awarding attorney fees to michael schaffer,following the dismissal without prejudice of donner shareholder derivative lawsuit against schaffer and nominal defendant asia web holdings,asia web in the published portion of this opinion,we hold that when at the commencement of a derivative lawsuit a voluntarily posts security under corporations code section,a prevailing defendant seeking attorney fees at the conclusion of the lawsuit need not retrospectively show the lawsuit had no reasonable possibility of benefiting the corporation.we also reject donner argument that a frivolous litigation standard should be imposed as a prerequisite to a prevailing defendant collection of a security furnished under section.finally,we hold the practical definition of prevailing party applies to this case involving a dismissal without prejudice,and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining schaffer was the prevailing party for purposes of an attorney fees award based on the security.accordingly,we affirm the order.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we deny schaffer motion to dismiss the appeal,and reject donner argument that the trial court abused its discretion in granting schaffer relief under code of civil procedure section for a late filing of his attorney fees motion.
factual and procedural background 
schaffer was a director and the chief executive officer of asia web.on march,donner filed a derivative shareholder complaint against schaffer and nominal defendant asia web,alleging schaffer had breached his fiduciary duty and engaged in conversion,and requesting an accounting.on april,asia web filed a motion requesting that donner post a bond pursuant to section,subdivision c.to support the bond motion,asia web submitted a declaration from the current chair of its board of directors explaining that schaffer had resigned from the corporation,and detailing reasons why the lawsuit was detrimental to the corporation.
to avoid a discovery stay pending litigation of the bond motion,donner voluntarily deposited a cashier check as security to satisfy the bond request,as allowed under section,subdivision e and code of civil procedure section.a stipulated order filed june,provided plaintiffs hereby agree that pursuant to code of civil procedure the officer of the court is authorized to collect,sell or otherwise apply this deposit to enforce the liability of plaintiffs,or any of them,if any,on the deposit it is further stipulated and agreed that defendant michael schaffer may participate in the security deposited by plaintiffs.defendants asia web holdings,and michael schaffer reserve their respective rights to apply for attorneys fees and costs and oppose any application by either of them.capitalization omitted.
thereafter,the parties conducted discovery and the matter was set for trial.meanwhile,in february or march,asia web appointed a special litigation committee,composed of a newly elected board of directors,to investigate whether the lawsuit was of benefit to the corporation.after interviewing various parties to the litigation and examining documents,on april,the special litigation committee notified donner of its conclusion that based on its business judgment it was not in the best interests of the company to continue the litigation.to reach this conclusion,the special litigation committee considered a wide range of issues,independent of the merits of the litigation,including but not limited to the impact of this litigation on the time and resources of company personnel,its impact on future operations and fundraising efforts 
accordingly,on may,donner moved to dismiss the action without prejudice,based on its recognition that a special litigation committee defense in favor of the defendants had been established which barred the action.in moving to dismiss the action,donner advised the court that it was not necessary to hold a full evidentiary hearing on the matter because donner had concluded the members of the special litigation committee were properly independent and the committee had performed an adequate investigation,thus establishing the special litigation committee defense.
schaffer did not oppose the motion to dismiss,but asserted that the dismissal should be with prejudice,contending that the lawsuit was without merit and had been brought to advance donner personal interests.the trial court rejected schaffer request for a dismissal with prejudice,finding that schaffer had not presented any evidence to prove his assertions.the court dismissed the action without prejudice on august.
schaffer filed a motion for attorney fees and costs based on the security posted by donner under section.the court ruled that schaffer was the prevailing party entitled to attorney fees.to support its ruling,the court found that the special litigation committee defense was more than a procedural defense schaffer was successful in mak ing the case go away and there was no recovery on the complaint 
discussion 
iii.award of attorney fees to schaffer as the prevailing party under section 
donner challenges the propriety of the trial court decision to award attorney fees under the section security to schaffer as the prevailing party.donner argues fees should not be awarded under section without a determination that there was no reasonable possibility the lawsuit would benefit the corporation,and the lawsuit was frivolous.further,he asserts schaffer can not properly be characterized as the prevailing party given that the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice with no reflection on the merits.
attorney fees under section 
to evaluate donner first two arguments,we review the legal principles applicable to attorney fees awards under section.
attorney fees may not be awarded absent statutory authorization or contractual agreement.code civ,santisas goodin cal th,fn,d.section provides a statutory basis for attorney fees in shareholder derivative lawsuits.see brusso running springs country club,d.brusso.
to compel a in a derivative lawsuit to furnish a bond securing payment of the defendant attorney fees,section requires that the defendant establish a probability,based on affidavits or oral testimony,t hat there is no reasonable possibility that the prosecution of the cause of action alleged in the complaint against the moving party will benefit the corporation or its shareholders,or t hat the defendant moving party,if other than the corporation,did not participate in the transaction complained of in any capacity,subds.c,d,italics added.in assessing whether there is no reasonable possibility the action will benefit the corporation,the court must evaluate the possible defenses which the plaintiffs would have to overcome before they could prevail at trial.ballantine sterling,cal.corporation laws,supra.
if the defendant does not satisfy one of the section grounds for a bond and accordingly no bond or other security is posted,the defendant will not be entitled to section attorney fees even if he or she prevails at the end of the litigation.alcott d.friedman,cal.practice guide corporations,supra,to.on the other hand,if the defendant does establish one of the section grounds,the court fixes the amount of the bond not to exceed to be furnished by the plaintiff for reasonable expenses,including attorneys fees,which may be incurred by the moving party and the corporation in connection with the action,including expenses for which the corporation may become liable pursuant to section,subd.d.
to prevent collateral estoppel effect,section,subdivision d provides that a court ruling granting or denying the motion for security shall not be a determination of any issue in the action or of the merits thereof.see witkin,supra,actions.if a defendant makes a successful motion under section requiring the plaintiff to post a bond as security for attorney fees,and the plaintiff fails to post the bond,the trial court must dismiss the action,subd.d see brusso,supra,d at.
a plaintiff in a derivative lawsuit has the option of avoid ing the inconvenience and delay of the motion proceeding by voluntarily posting a bond in the aggregate amount of,either before or after a motion for security is made.this will be deemed full compliance,and any pending motion must be dismissed.witkin,supra,actions,subds.e,f.
the purpose of the section security provision is to prevent unwarranted shareholder derivative lawsuits.witkin,supra,actions,brusso,supra,d at.the justification for the security is derived from the fact that the cause of action and potential remedy belong to the corporation,not the shareholder see desaigoudar meyercord,supra,th at,d,and the corporation has chosen not to pursue the litigation.as explained by the california supreme court e very stockholder who is unable to induce the corporation,through its board of directors,to institute a particular action on its own behalf,and who undertakes as its volunteer representative to sue on the cause asserted by him,may be required to furnish security.beyerbach juno oil cal d,beyerbach.in these circumstances the legislature,for the protection of third persons who have dealt with the corporation,as well as for the protection of the corporation and its officers and employe e s,can constitutionally require that the stockholder who would act as in the nature of a guardian ad litem must,as a condition of prosecuting the action on behalf of the corporation,either show a reasonable probability that the suit will be successful or secure the payment of the defendants expenses should they prevail.the legislature,of course,can attribute some weight to the fact that the corporation has not seen fit to institute action on a cause which either belongs to it or to no one.id.at,see also chase d.
no reasonable possibility of benefit standard 
donner argues that no fees should be awarded unless there has been compliance with section provision that a mandatory bond requires a showing of no reasonable possibility of benefit to the corporation from the action.donner contends that because plaintiffs voluntarily posted the security in this case,this showing has not been made.
after initially filing our opinion in this case,we granted a rehearing and asked the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether a plaintiff voluntary posting of a security excuses the requirement that a defendant show no reasonable possibility of benefit to the corporation.having considered the parties arguments,we conclude that when a plaintiff voluntarily posts security,the defendant may seek to enforce the security as the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case without having to retrospectively satisfy the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard.
when interpreting statutes,we seek to ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.our first task is to look at the language of the statute itself.ibid.section contains no express language addressing what,if any,showing must be made when a defendant seeks to collect on a security that was posted voluntarily.however,section voluntarily posting provision suggests that once security is posted by the plaintiff,the bond is available to pay for the defendant attorney fees should the defendant emerge as the prevailing party.section,subdivision e states if the plaintiff shall,either before or after a motion is made pursuant to subdivision c,or any order or determination pursuant to the motion,furnish a bond in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion,the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this section and with any order for a bond theretofore made,and any such motion then pending shall be dismissed and no further or additional bond shall be required.italics added.the phrase to secure the reasonable expenses of the parties entitled to make the motion reflects that the security,once posted,is available to pay for the prevailing defendant expenses.there is nothing to indicate that a prevailing defendant must make an additional showing to access the security.
additionally,the bond statute mandates dismissal of the bond motion after a voluntary posting of security.this feature supports a conclusion that the legislature did not intend to require a retrospective determination of the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard.when a plaintiff voluntarily posts security,the section bond motion is not merely placed in abeyance waiting for resolution at the conclusion of the case.instead,the motion is dismissed,eliminating the need and the opportunity for the court to rule on whether the moving party met its statutory burden.thus,when a prevailing defendant seeks to collect on the security at the conclusion of the case,there is no pending bond motion upon which the trial court is expected to rule.section dismissal provision correlates with a legislative intent to dispense with the no reasonable possibility of benefit requirement in the event of a voluntary posting of security.
moreover,from a practical perspective,imposition of a no reasonable possibility of benefit requirement at the conclusion of the litigation would fashion an awkward adjudicatory rule.the statute imposes this requirement as a threshold determination to be made by the trial court based on an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility the litigation will be of benefit to the corporation.after the case is concluded,retrospective evaluation of the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard would require the trial court to ascertain whether it would have been persuaded at the commencement of the lawsuit that the no benefit showing had been made so as to compel posting of a bond.it is unlikely the legislature would have intended to impose such a speculative task on the parties or the trial court.
our conclusion,derived from the plain language and substantive structure of the statute,is also supported by the california supreme court discussion of the bond statute in beyerbach,supra,cal d.in beyerbach,the court recognized that the legislature was entitled to impose special rules on shareholder derivative lawsuits because of their unique characteristics.in upholding the constitutionality of the bond statute,beyerbach reasoned that the legislature could determine that normally corporations will pursue their own causes of action when of benefit to the corporation,and that shareholders may abuse the right to bring a derivative suit.id.at.accordingly,it was reasonable for the legislature to enact a statute requiring a in a derivative lawsuit to either show a reasonable probability that the suit will be successful or secure the payment of the defendants expenses should they prevail.beyerbach,supra,cal d at,italics added.the analysis in beyerbach underscores that the purpose of the security is to restrain derivative lawsuits filed by shareholders instead of the corporation itself,and supports that once the security is furnished so as to allow the plaintiff to proceed with the litigation,the security is available to reimburse the defendant should the defendant prevail.
in evaluating the constitutionality of the pretrial bond requirement,the beyerbach court noted that the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard provides a due process safeguard for the plaintiff.beyerbach,supra,cal d at.however,in a situation where the plaintiff voluntarily posts bond,the plaintiff is,of his or her own accord,in effect choosing to substitute one benefit the defendant burden to show the lawsuit is not beneficial to the corporation prior to obtaining a bond for another benefit the speedier resolution of the lawsuit by dispensing with litigation of the bond motion.the fact that the defendant will be able to collect on the security only if he or she is the prevailing party ensures that the plaintiff will not be unfairly deprived of his or her posted funds.under these circumstances,there is no due process imperative for imposing the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard at the conclusion of the case in a situation where the plaintiff voluntarily furnished security.
donner contends that if a prevailing defendant is not required to meet the no reasonable possibility of benefit standard at the conclus
