petitioner thomas heath iii appeals from the opinion and order of the securities and exchange commission sec,affirming the new york stock exchange llc nyse finding that petitioner violated nyse rule a by disclosing a client confidential information to a third party rule a the j e rule subjects registered members to disciplinary sanctions for engaging in conduct or proceeding inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.the nyse found that,although petitioner did not act in bad faith,he engaged in unethical conduct in violation of the j e rule.on appeal to the sec,petitioner argued that bad faith is required to sustain a j e rule violation.the sec held that a finding of mere unethical conduct was sufficient to sustain a j e rule violation for a breach of confidence and affirmed the nyse finding that he violated the rule by making the disclosure.petitioner now appeals the sec opinion and order,principally arguing that bad faith,and not mere unethical conduct,was required to sustain the j e rule violation.he argues alternatively that,if the j e rule does in fact prohibit mere unethical conduct in this case,it failed to provide adequate notice that his conduct was sanctionable.finally,he argues that the nyse improvidently granted summary judgment against him by failing to resolve questions of fact and draw reasonable inferences in his favor.because we conclude that petitioner arguments lack merit,we deny the petition.
background 
factual background 
petitioner joined morgan securities as an investment banker in its financial institutions group in,where he advised financial institutions in connection with mergers and acquisitions.he ultimately became a managing director and remained with morgan until.
hibernia bank was a client of morgan.petitioner covered the account for nine years.petitioner testified that he was close to the ceo of hibernia,both professionally and personally.through this relationship,he secured morgan engagement as hibernia financial advisor in connection with its merger with capital one.hibernia formally engaged morgan in this capacity on february.
in of that year,antonio ursano,global head of bank of america financial institutions group,contacted petitioner,unsolicited,and proposed that petitioner join bank of america as the sole head of its bank group.petitioner met with him and initially indicated he was not interested.they met again,at ursano insistence,and ursano offered petitioner a job for two years at million per year,with the understanding that he would be promoted within the year to succeed ursano as head of bank of america financial institutions group.petitioner said that he would consider it,and,on february,he gave ursano a verbal commitment to join bank of america pending a written agreement.
ursano asked petitioner to begin in one week,but petitioner said that he was working on a large transaction which he felt he needed to complete both in the interest of his client and of his current employer.he did not disclose any further details regarding the transaction at that time.while he did not say so explicitly to ursano,petitioner was referring to the hibernia and capital one merger.petitioner believed that leaving morgan without closing the hibernia and capital one deal would be disruptive to the transaction,and to hibernia particularly.
on february,petitioner informed tim main,his supervisor at morgan,that he intended to join bank of america,but that he would stay at morgan to secure the hibernia engagement and get the deal across the finish line.main agreed that it was the honorable thing to do.petitioner emphasizes that he had no monetary interest in completing the acquisition at morgan and he intended to forfeit any bonus by resigning prior to fiscal year end.
ursano asked petitioner to meet eric corrigan,the of bank of america depository institutions group,who would have reported to petitioner upon his arrival.they met on february.the purpose of their meeting was to get acquainted with each other and to begin developing a working relationship.they did not discuss hibernia at this meeting.petitioner testified that corrigan seemed to think that they were going to be of the bank group and not that petitioner was coming on as the sole head.
two days later,on february,petitioner received an offer letter from bank of america,which stated that he would join as a managing director and head of banks for the financial institutions group reporting to ursano,who was the head of the financial institutions group with compensation of approximately million over two years.
on march,ursano asked petitioner to discuss with corrigan how they were going to work out coverage on their joint accounts,and to assure corrigan that he was a decent guy and a good partner who was not going to stomp all over him on those accounts.petitioner and corrigan had a phone conversation that day during which petitioner made suggestions about how corrigan could get involved in petitioner accounts and invited corrigan to meet with a number of his clients.petitioner testified that his objective was to build corrigan up and to let him know that he had heard nice things about him from clients,and that he would be there to help out if corrigan needed it.
near the end of this conversation,corrigan asked about petitioner pending transaction,stating that there are a lot of rumors out in the marketplace.and we know you have a bank deal somewhere down in the south.petitioner testified that he initially refused to divulge any information regarding the hibernia acquisition,but eventually responded if you really want to know,i will tell you exactly what it is,but you have to understand,you know,i got a week to go.this is obviously confidential information.the deal is done,bankers have been hired,nothing is going to change.and you just have to understand and respect that.corrigan replied,well,are you comfortable telling me petitioner responded,the real question is,are you comfortable with me telling you because you the one that ca act on this in any way.corrigan replied,i can understand that,i can keep a secret.at that point,petitioner disclosed that capital one was acquiring hibernia morgan was representing hibernia in the deal percent of the deal was being funded with cash the deal had been in motion before january and hibernia believed that capital one ratio was sufficiently low that it gave hibernia a degree of comfort with the stock.
petitioner testified that he disclosed this information to corrigan for a couple of reasons 
i think that you have to understand that i was talking to someone who,as the gray area merged,was increasingly more of a colleague.and i realize that that is technically not what was going on,but the whole gist of the conversation was business going forward.know,the conversation itself,i had mentioned that,you said,well,there a good marketing piece that we talk about going forward i dealing with someone who going to be a colleague.i dealing with someone who the whole purpose of this thing is to build trust build a collegiality with.i the conversation has gone more towards marketing and this deal had direct relevance.the final thing that i will tell you is when he says they are hearing rumors and they know i got something in the south,i mean,my forehead just beaded up with sweat,i terrified.and my view i basically put a firewall around the problem and i sincerely believe that.and i know in hindsight that is incredibly stupid particularly given what happened.but understand,i knew with percent certainty there was zero role b of a in that deal,zero.
throughout his testimony,petitioner emphasized that he was attempting to prevent corrigan and others at bank of america from snooping around the deal.as he put it,he was attempting to put a firewall around the problem.
corrigan confirmed to petitioner that he understood that he could not act on the information in any way,and petitioner believed that corrigan,an experienced industry professional and future colleague,would keep the information confidential as he had promised.that same day,however,corrigan disclosed the information to thomas chen,the head of bank of america diversified financial services group.chen in turn left a voicemail message for the head of capital one mergers and acquisitions group,inquiring whether there was a role for bank of america on the deal.
on march,while petitioner was in a meeting at bank of america,corrigan invited petitioner to stop by his office.during their conversation,corrigan asked petitioner how the hibernia deal was going and whether there was room for another advisor on the merger.petitioner testified that he was emphatic in saying that there was no way that could happen and that he thought he had made that abundantly clear in their prior conversation and he was shocked that corrigan even asked.he made clear that it morgan and bear sterns at hibernia and at capital one it credit suisse first boston and nothing is going to change.corrigan made no mention of the call to capital one or the fact that he disclosed the information to chen.
on march,the merger agreement between hibernia and capital one was signed and announced by the wall street journal.the total transaction was valued at approximately billion,representing a premium or approximately billion over the closing price of hibernia shares on friday,march.as petitioner had disclosed to corrigan,credit suisse first boston acted as financial advisor to capital one,and morgan and bear stearns acted as financial advisors to hibernia with morgan as the lead advisor.neither the terms of the deal nor the parties financial advisors had changed since petitioner march conversation with corrigan.
that same day,alex lynch,a colleague of petitioner from morgan,informed petitioner that there was a problem.he said that capital one received a call from bank of america in an attempt to get itself retained,armed with very explicit information about the merger with hibernia.lynch said that they had everything it was as if you had handed them a term sheet and they used it w hen we connected the dots and add it all up,it points directly at you.petitioner was immediately put on leave.
petitioner spoke to corrigan that day and told him that a colleague from morgan had told petitioner that bank of america approached capital one in an attempt to get itself retained with specific details of the merger.corrigan denied disclosing the information.petitioner did not tell corrigan at this point that he was put on leave.the next day he asked corrigan again.this time corrigan said that he kind of did disclose the information.corrigan denied revealing hibernia role in the merger to chen,but admitted that he suggested to chen that the rumors that capital one was involved in a merger were true.petitioner then spoke to chen,and chen said that when he called capital one,he mentioned only that he was aware that capital one was involved in a bank deal.
petitioner disclosed the entire situation to ursano at bank of america and recommended that he elevate this internally to the top of the house immediately.over the next two days,a bank of america investigative team interviewed corrigan,chen and petitioner,and,on march,bank of america counsel informed petitioner counsel that bank of america believed that petitioner did not act with any devious or malicious intent,but had made an error in judgment.on march,bank of america revoked its offer of employment to petitioner and fired corrigan and chen.morgan had fired petitioner the day before.
ii.nyse proceedings 
on january,the nyse division of enforcement enforcement charged that petitioner disclosure violated nyse rule a,which prohibits conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.enforcement filed a motion for summary judgment on october,and petitioner filed a competing motion on october.on november,the nyse hearing board hearing board granted summary judgment on liability against petitioner,finding that he violated the j e rule by making the disclosure to corrigan 
first,the chief hearing officer cited nyse rule c,which grants a hearing officer the authority to resolve any and all procedural and evidentiary matters and substantive legal motions.in the matter of nyse disciplinary proceedings against thomas heath,iii,nyse hearing bd,spa at she concluded that t his includes the authority to consider and,if warranted,grant a motion for summary judgment.id.she held that a hearing officer power to decide a summary judgment motion under nyse rule c is analogous to that of a federal court deciding a summary judgment motion under rule.id.at.
the chief hearing officer explained that petitioner main argument is that to prevail on its charge,enforcement must show that he acted in bad faith.id.at.she disagreed,holding that a violation of the just and equitable principles of trade codified by nyse rule a may occur either through bad faith or unethical conduct.id.she cited several sec decisions for this proposition and concluded that the concept of unethical conduct is different,that it is broader faith.id.
the chief hearing officer then found that by disclosing confidential information,petitioner had acted unethically.she reasoned there is no dispute that the information that petitioner disclosed to corrigan included sensitive,nonpublic details of a transaction that had not yet been consummated it is commonly accepted that when a financial advisor takes on work that requires the communication of such sensitive,nonpublic information from the client to the advisor,the client has an expectation that the advisor will keep that information confidential.id.at.she noted that i t is undisputed that petitioner employer had a code of conduct that spelled out the duties of an employee to keep confidential certain sensitive information learned on the job.id.at.she concluded 
but the duty of confidentiality at issue here stems not only from the explicit code of conduct,but also from the ethical obligation to which every financial advisor becomes subject upon learning of sensitive,nonpublic information about a client in the normal course of business.it is a duty that should be to any experienced financial professional.by disclosing confidential information about the pending transaction to someone who,at the time of the disclosure,was an employee of a competitor firm,petitioner breached the duty that he owed to his client and thereby violated the just and equitable principles of trade.
id.footnote omitted.
in support of his summary judgment motion,petitioner submitted a letter,dated february,from randall howard,hibernia president of commercial banking and a member of its board of directors at the time of the merger with capital one.the letter stated 
i am comfortable and confident in petitioner judgment that his disclosure to a b of a subordinate was made in strict confidence with no intention that the individual would breach that confidence in any way.moreover,at the point of the disclosure all terms of the transaction and hiring of bankers had been finalized,and the deal was in effect completed.given the circumstances,i do not view tom discussion as a breach of our confidence.had we known about this at the time,there is no remedial or regulatory action we would have sought.
i have known tom for many years.he has always been an honest,straightforward banker,and our thoughts of him are evidenced by the fact that we looked to him as our advisor for our most important transaction.i absolutely would work with tom again should the opportunity present itself and entrust him with the most guarded of confidences.his absence from the industry leaves a large gap which has not been filled.
the chief hearing officer noted that the letter was prepared and submitted long after the breach occurred and apparently in the executive personal capacity,rather than on behalf of the client.id.at.she concluded,in the absence of any contemporaneous waiver by his client,petitioner obligation to maintain the confidentiality of his client information is unaffected.id.she also found that there was no competing obligation or equitable excuse to justify petitioner action.she explained 
nothing in the record would indicate that petitioner,in the instant matter,was under any competing obligation to make the disclosures that he did or that any equitable excuse relieved him of his ethical obligation to keep the information confidential.rather,his reasons for making the certainly lacking any malevolent or deceitful,in the final analysis,in that they were intended to gain the trust of,and thereby smooth things over with,a colleague.petitioner admits that he made the disclosures,at least in part,to make corrigan understand that he was going to be a good partner and that he was not going to stomp all over him.on the record before me,i can not find anything that excuses the unethical conduct in which petitioner engaged.
id.at citation and footnote omitted.
in a footnote,the chief hearing officer also dismissed petitioner explanation that he made the disclosures in order to preempt corrigan from snooping around the deal and acting on the information in the market place.she wrote 
even assuming it were true,as i must for purposes of deciding enforcement motion,i do not find that this concern rises to the level of a competing obligation or equitable excuse that absolves petitioner of his breach of confidentiality.on the contrary,if petitioner suspected that corrigan might snoop around the deal for the purposes of acting on information in the market place,petitioner could,indeed,should other steps to prevent such a result,such as alerting his current and future employers,as well as his client,to his suspicions.if anything,those suspicions regarding corrigan should have made petitioner even more reluctant to divulge sensitive information to his would be colleague and,thus,only served to heighten petitioner ethical obligation to safeguard his client confidential information against incursion by this potentially untrustworthy individual.
id.finally,the chief hearing officer rejected petitioner argument that summary judgment should not be granted because neither his former firm nor his former client were injured as a result of the disclosure.she wrote,there can be no question that the disclosures that petitioner made did have the potential for unraveling the deal.had that occurred,many investors could have been merely petitioner client or his firm,but also the shareholders of those organizations.id.at.she granted summary judgment against petitioner,finding him guilty of violating the j e rule,and indicated that the penalty would be imposed after a hearing at a future date.
thereafter,a nyse hearing panel panel was convened to hear evidence and argument concerning the penalty to be imposed.it heard testimony of several witnesses,namely,a managing director at morgan who was petitioner colleague,randall howard the former member of hibernia board of directors who wrote the letter discussed supra,an attorney who was a close colleague of petitioner and worked as general counsel and as an investment banker at morgan,and petitioner himself.petitioner testified,in particular,that the disclosure came in the last two minutes of a minute telephone conversation,while he was packing his bags in a hotel room.
enforcement argued for a penalty of censure,a bar and a fine.it maintained that this was a case of first impression,in which an investment banker had disclosed a client confidential information and,therefore,there is no relevant precedent to aid the panel.it emphasized that petitioner breach was not a mistake after his breach,he did nothing to alert morgan or hibernia at the time of the breach,there was potential for harm,such as an unraveling of the deal or volatility in the market as an experienced investment banker,he should have known better than to disclose confidential,information a less severe penalty would not deter others similarly situated and given the large amount of income he was earning,was a relatively small fine.
petitioner,for his part,argued that his disclosure did not cause any harm and the potential for harm was low because the deal was finalized,and that he was not personally enriched by his disclosure.he emphasized that he had already incurred a very high personal cost,including the loss of a minimum annual income of million for and and his inability to find work in the months following the incident.he contended that he did not act in bad faith,nor was there any evidence of such rather,his disclosure was a spontaneous thing that happened in the or minute of a conversation where he was kind of blindsided because he did expect this to come up,had never anticipated it coming up,and never planned on having this conversation.finally,he pressed that he had been,at all times,candid and forthcoming during the investigation and disciplinary proceedings surrounding his disclosure.petitioner argued that,under these circumstances,a letter of admonition would be most appropriate.
after the hearing,the panel issued its decision dated march.the panel found the nature of the violation in this case to be very serious,warranting a serious penalty.in the matter of thomas woodley heath,iii,former registered representative,nyse hearing bd.decision,wl,at.it emphasized the potential of harm that the disclosure had,but found that,comparatively speaking,the risk was small given the advanced stage of the deal.
the panel also found that petitioner lacked any bad faith.id.at.it explained that petitioner only shared the confidential information with corrigan after making the latter promise that he would not share it with anyone else,and petitioner had every reason to believe that corrigan would keep his promise.id.it credited petitioner testimony that he made the disclosure without premeditation and only as a result of a momentary lapse in judgment.id.it found that petitioner used poor judgment and was motivated by a desire to gain the trust of a future colleague,but was not motivated by any improper goal of personal enrichment,nor did he obtain any.id.at.finally,the panel emphasized that petitioner wrongdoing stemmed from a single act of indiscretion against a backdrop of an otherwise unblemished career.it found that petitioner was not likely to repeat his mistake.accordingly,it concluded that a fine was punitive,and instead imposed a penalty of censure and a fine.
in a two paragraph decision dated october,the nyse board of directors affirmed the chief hearing officer summary judgment decision and the penalty imposed by the panel.on november,petitioner filed an appeal with the sec.see d.
iii.sec opinion 
petitioner advanced three arguments to the sec on appeal.specifically,he argued that the j e rule requires a finding of bad faith alternatively,he did not receive fair notice that his conduct was sanctionable under the j e rule and the nyse erred by determining his guilt on a motion for summary judgment.the sec rejected all three of his arguments and affirmed the nyse decisions.see in the matter of the application of thomas heath,ii,release,docket,wl.
bad faith argument 
first,the sec held that it has long applied a disjunctive bad faith or unethical conduct standard to disciplinary action under the j e rule.id.at.it explained 
this rule incorporates broad ethical principles,and focuses on the ethical implications of the a pplicant conduct.the rule serves as an industry backstop for the representation inherent in the relationship,between a securities professional and a customer,that the customer will be dealt with fairly,and in accordance with the standards of the profession.
promulgated to discipline a wide variety of conduct that may operate as an injustice to investors or other participants in the marketplace,the j e rule focuses on the securities professional conduct rather than on a subjective inquiry into the professional intent or state of mind.accordingly,a violation of the rule need not be premised on a motive or scienter finding 
petitioner breach of confidentiality violated one of the most basic duties of a securities professional,a duty that is grounded in fiduciary principles and reflected in the morgan code of conduct.
id.at footnotes omitted.
fair notice argument 
in the alternative,petitioner argued to the sec that he lacked notice that the j e rule could subject him to discipline for unethical conduct that was not motivated by bad faith.the sec held that a s an experienced investment banker,petitioner can be fairly charged with notice that his breach of his duty to maintain the confidentiality of his client information violated the just and equitable principles of trade.id.at.it further noted that petitioner was on actual notice given that the morgan code of conduct prohibited him from making such disclosures.the sec emphasized that petitioner testified that he had read the code of conduct and acknowledged that one of the factors that creates a successful m a banker is having the judgment of how to use confidential information and how to use it in a trustworthy and honest way.id.at internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
summary judgment argument 
finally,petitioner argued to the sec that the chief hearing officer erred in granting enforcement motion for summary judgment because she did not resolve questions of fact and draw reasonable inferences in his favor.the sec rejected this argument because it itself had conducted a de novo review of the record.id.at.in particular,it indicated that t he record includes petitioner testimony taken by the division during its investigation,and petitioner testimony before the nyse hearing panel during the penalty phase of the nyse hearing.id.moreover,the sec highlighted the fact that petitioner does not contest the material facts underlying the nyse finding of a violation of the rule,his disclosure of material information regarding the pending merger of his client and the circumstances surrounding his conversation with corrigan.id.
petitioner now appeals the sec opinion and order.see a.
discussion 
in reviewing the sec opinion and order,we must affirm t he findings of the commission as to the facts,if supported by substantial evidence.mfs secs,cir quoting a.the administrative procedure act,which applies to our review of commission orders,provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.internal citation omitted.
is bad faith required for a j e rule violation 
petitioner first argument is that a finding of bad faith is required for a j e rule violation,citing several sec decisions and our decision in buchman sec,cir.it is clear,however,that the j e rule is concerned with enforcing ethical standards of practice in the securities industry and is violated by a breach of confidence if such breach amounts to unethical conduct.
the nyse is a national securities exchange registered with the sec pursuant to section of the securities exchange act of,as amended exchange act,see barbara stock,cir,and,as such,is a organization sro,see a.it therefore has a duty to promulgate and enforce rules governing the conduct of its members.see id.b,g see also barbara,at.these rules are subject to sec approval,see b barbara,at,and must be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,b.
while congress enacted the exchange act to prohibit fraudulent practices in the securities industry,it recognized that such legislation must be supplemented by regulation on an ethical plane in order to protect the investor and the honest dealer alike from dishonest and unfair practices by the submarginal element in the industry and to cope with those methods of doing business which,while technically outside the area of definite illegality,are nevertheless unfair both to customer and to decent competitor,and are seriously damaging to the mechanism of the free and open market.vi louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation ed quoting.at at see also avery moffatt,misc,s ecurities trading is a highly complex field in which it is not always feasible to define by statute or by administrative rules having the effect of law every practice which is inconsistent with the public interest or with the protection of investors.as a result there is a large area for the operation of exchange rules on the level of business ethics rather than law,and in that sphere the statute leaves it to the exchanges to carry on the necessary work of prevention and discipline.such r egulation of the ethics of an industry means a substantial degree of,properly supervised by government.loss seligman,supra,at see also silver stock,d discussing congress intent for sros to police the securities industry to reform unethical practices in the industry.thus,in accordance with the exchange act,b,the nyse adopted,with the approval of the sec,the j e rule,which prohibits registered members from engaging in conduct or proceeding inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.
it has long been the view that the j e rule is designed to enable sros to regulate the ethical standards of its members.see,loss seligman,supra,at.sec precedent is clear on this point.in in the matter of benjamin werner,wl july,the sec rejected the petitioner argument that nasd j e rule could only be violated by an unlawful act.the sec noted,we have long recognized that the j e rule is not limited to rules of legal conduct but rather that it states a broad ethical principle which implements the requirements of section b of the exchange act.id.at emphasis added.it explained that the nasd through its disciplinary powers can and should play an important role in improving the ethical standards of its members,subject always to their rights to obtain review by this commission and the courts.id.at see also in the matter of the application of william rembert,wl,at,we have long recognized that the nasd j e rule states broad ethical principles section b of the exchange act empowers organizations,such as the nasd,to discipline their members for unethical behavior,as well as violations of law.emphasis added in the matter of the application of timothy burkes,wl,at,as the commission has stated previously,disciplinary hearings to require compliance with high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade are ethical proceedings hence the concern is with ethical implications of the applicant conduct.
directly on point is in the matter of the application of robert kauffman,wl,aff,kauffman sec,cir.there,the sec affirmed nasd findings that the petitioner violated nasd j e rule by misrepresenting to nasd and to the pennsylvania securities commission that he had received a bachelor degree.id.at.the petitioner argued that his misrepresentation was accidental and not in bad faith.id.at.although the sec ultimately found that the petitioner had acted in bad faith,it rejected his argument that the j e rule required a finding of scienter.id.it wrote 
kauffman argues that,in order to find liability under nasd j e rule,we must find scienter.we disagree.we have long recognized that nasd j e rule states a broad ethical principle that implements the requirements of section b of the securities exchange act of the most that is required is a finding of bad faith or unethical conduct.although kauffman implies that the securities laws are designed solely for protection from fraud,and not merely unethical behavior,section b of the securities exchange act of empowers organizations,such as the nasd,to discipline their members for violations of just and equitable principles of trade.
id.at emphasis added internal citations omitted.
similarly,in in the matter of the application of calvin david fox,docket,wl,fox i,the sec reviewed the nyse finding that the petitioner had violated the j e rule by making a misstatement to his member firm employer about the status of his license to practice law in the state of florida and by submitting an altered copy of an order of the florida supreme court to support the misstatement.id.at.the petitioner argued that his statement that he was in good standing reflected his good faith legal opinion that his license suspension was stayed while the court considered his motion for rehearing.id.at.he also contended that his submission of the altered order to his employer was inadvertent,and that he had intended to send it only to his family.id.the sec noted that w ith respect to a charge that conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade,we have held that a organization need not find that the respondent acted with scienter,but must find that the respondent acted in bad faith or unethically.id.at emphasis added 
in in the matter of the application of paul grassi,docket,wl,the sec addressed the proper interpretation of nyse rule a,which prohibits members from engaging in acts detrimental to the interest or welfare of the nyse.id.at.in so doing,it drew upon its rule a jurisprudence,writing 
rule states broad ethical principles that implement the requirements of section b of the exchange act which,among other things,empowers organizations to discipline their members for unethical behavior as well as violations of law.
in reviewing allegations that conduct is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade,we have held repeatedly that a organization disciplinary authority is broad enough to encompass conduct that does not involve a security if that conduct reflects on a person ability to comply with the regulatory requirements of the securities industry and to fulfill his fiduciary duties we have held that scienter is not required to establish a violation of such rules and that the most that is required is a finding of bad faith or unethical conduct.
id.at,footnotes omitted see also in the matter of dep t of enforcement shvarts,no,nasd discip.lexis,at,june,bad faith in the sense of malicious intent or deceitfulness need not be established e ven if the violation of the court order were not in itself a violation of the j e rule,shvarts conduct would still be violative because it was unethical.
courts have echoed this principle.as early as,judge friendly noted that the j e rule is something of a which,in addition to satisfying the letter of the statute,preserves power to discipline members for a wide variety of misconduct,including merely unethical behavior.colonial realty bache,cir,cert.denied,d.the ninth circuit has held the same.see erdos sec,cir an nasd violation does not require that the dealer act with scienter.see also generally alderman sec,cir.the j e rule concern with unethical conduct is consistent with the nyse rules special focus on the professionalization of the securities industry.gustafson strangis.
despite this substantial authority,petitioner points to our decision in buchman sec,cir,as well as sec precedent stating that bad faith is required for a breach of contract to violate the j e rule.these cases are inapposite.
first,we should note that prior to our decision in buchman,sec precedent held that a breach of contract violated the j e rule when the breach was unethical or dishonorable.in the matter of samuel franklin,wl,at,see also in the matter of the application of brokerage,wl,at,but even if we were to assume that applicant were chargeable with a breach of its contract,it would not necessarily follow that it had violated the rule,for not every failure to perform a contract violates the nasd rule it must also appear that such failure was unethical or dishonorable or that the breach was committed without equitable excuse or justification.footnote omitted.
in,this court decided buchman,in which we vacated an sec order sanctioning a for violating nasd j e rule.at.the in buchman,shaskan,refused to honor the terms of a purchase agreement with another brokerdealer for the sale of stock in a company called crystalography.id.the sec had suspended trading in crystalography stock out of concern for fraud.id.the sec rule at the time was that when it imposed such a suspension on trading,a broker could not complete contracts to accept delivery of the affected stock unless he has no reason to believe that the other party is connected with the fraudulent activity.id.emphasis added.while the sec had lifted the suspension on crystalography stock when the other attempted to deliver the stock in the company to shaskan,the sec issued a statement that should take the necessary measures to assure themselves that they are not unknowingly effecting a consummation of open contracts which may be in furtherance of a scheme to manipulate the price of the securities of crystalography or would otherwise violate the federal securities laws.id.at.shaskan requested clarification from the sec as to its obligation to ensure that the other was not involved in fraud and refused to accept trades of the stock until it received such clarification.id.in the meantime,shaskan capital position had become impaired,and the nyse directed it to fulfill open contracts with its customers.id.the firm never accepted the crystalography shares,however,and nasd brought charges against it for failing to do so.id.at.the sec sustained nasd finding that shaskan and its principals did not observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade when they refused to honor the contract.id.at.
we vacated the sec order,writing 
with deference to the commission,we believe that under the circumstances of this case,shaskan refusal to complete the muir transactions during and after the suspensions,was colorably justified by the confusion as to the true state of the market and as to the applicable law.by this we do not mean that shaskan necessarily has a defense to a claim by muir for breach of contract.but,as the commission concedes,it is that a breach of contract between nasd members is of no concern to the nasd or to the commission if such breach does not contravene the ethical standards embodied in article iii,section.the commission itself has held that a refusal to complete a contract based on a reasonable belief that a transaction was part of a manipulative scheme does not violate article iii,section.there are,of course,situations in which this claim is a sham,and if it is found that petitioner did not have a belief both honest and reasonable that there was a manipulative scheme afoot at the time of the contractual default,its failure to fulfill contractual obligations would violate article iii,section.the touchstone,in other words,is good ultimate test of violation of an ethical standard.a breach of contract is unethical conduct in violation of nasd rules only if it is in bad faith,just as conduct violates rule only if there is scienter intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.the measure of culpability then becomes whether appellants were in good faith.
appellants here were put on notice by the commission itself that there had actually been unlawful manipulation of the price of crystalography stock.and,as we have seen,the commission itself notified the in the public release lifting the old suspension of trading,release,that there was a real possibility of a of the unlawful activity with respect to open contracts.the release warned brokers to assure themselves that they are not unknowingly effecting a consummation of open contracts which may be in furtherance of a scheme to manipulate the price of securities of crystalography.t here can be no doubt of appellants bona fide belief that there was a manipulative scheme afoot and that,based upon the warning issued by the commission after the suspension was lifted,the manipulative scheme still affected open contracts.this record does not support a conclusion that appellants were snatching excuses out of thin air.they were bound to cooperate with the commission in refusing to accept stock which would succeed in bringing the fruits of manipulation to a guilty seller.
a broker,confronted with an atmosphere of manipulation or insider trading,faces a real dilemma.he risks a breach of contract action if he refuses to accept delivery,but he risks other sanctions if he accepts delivery in the face of publicly proclaimed suspicions of securities act violations which permeate the scene.
the evidence should be truly substantial to support a finding that,in such circumstances,when there is evident manipulation,the broker has wilfully used the situation in a fraudulent effort to avoid his contractual obligation.this is especially true when the alleged ethical misconduct is based on a single transaction and does not even purport to show a course of unethical business practice.we see nothing in our decision which would encourage truly unethical practices or would lower the standards of compliance.
accordingly,we grant the petition.the commission order is vacated.

buchman is entirely distinguishable from this case.as the chief hearing officer found in the present case,n othing in the record would indicate that petitioner,in the instant matter,was under any competing obligation to make the disclosures that he did or that any equitable excuse relieved him of his ethical obligation to keep the information confidential.in the matter of nyse disciplinary proceedings against thomas heath,iii,nyse hearing bd,spa see also supra.specifically,the chief hearing officer found that petitioner acted for reasons,to build a relationship with corrigan,and dismissed petitioner explanation that he made the disclosures in order to preempt corrigan from snooping around the deal and acting on the information in the market place.she suggested that if petitioner suspected that corrigan might snoop around the deal for the purposes of acting on information in the market place,he could,indeed,should other steps to prevent such a result,such as alerting his current and future employers,as well as his client,to his suspicions.in the matter of thomas heath,iii,at spa see also supra.these findings,which the sec affirmed and we conclude are supported by substantial evidence,demonstrate why buchman is entirely inapposite to this case.that is,in buchman,the petitioner shaskan was faced with the opposing interests of the sec concern for fraud,expressed in a specific sec warning,and shaskan contractual obligation to accept the crystalography shares.thus shaskan reason for the breach of contract,a good faith adherence to sec warnings,became all important in understanding shaskan ethical obligation and its lack of bad faith in breaching the contract.here,by contrast,petitioner was faced with a different factual situation and no such competing ethical and regulatory considerations he owed a fiduciary duty to hibernia to keep the information confidential and he disclosed that information in violation of his ethical obligation to his client.
moreover,the sec has correctly understood buchman to be limited to the breach of contract context.see,in the matter of the application of morris kurz,wl,at,breach of contract case,citing buchman in the matter of the application of robert jautz,docket,wl,at,same in the matter of the application of william george,iii,wl,at,same see also in the matter of the application of leonard john ialeggio,docket,wl,at,citing buchman as holding that a breach of contract violate s the j e rule where bad faith or unethical conduct evidenced.this is a breach of confidence case,which implicates quintessential ethical considerations not necessarily implicated in a breach of contract case.thus,the axiom that the j e rule prohibits mere unethical conduct and does not require scienter holds true in this case at bottom,the only question is whether petitioner breach of confidence constitutes unethical conduct 
petitioner argues,however,that the bad faith standard articulated in buchman has been applied outside the breach of contract context.he relies upon two sec decisions in the matter of the application of nicholas avello,exchange act release,wl,avello,aff,avello sec,cir and in the matter of the application of calvin david fox,docket,wl,fox ii,aff,fox sec,cert.denied,d.
in avello,the petitioner appealed to the sec after nasd found him liable for operating a securities business with insufficient net capital,failing to maintain accurate financial records,making inaccurate financial reports to nasd and filing six inaccurate quarterly reports.it was found that avello was given incorrect information by a and did not act in bad faith.avello,wl,at.the sec wrote 
avello argues that there is a requirement that nasd find there was bad faith before finding liability under nasd conduct rule.when a violation of conduct rule is not based on the violation of some other rule,we have required a showing that the respondent has acted in bad faith before liability can be found.there is no bad faith requirement,however,when,as here,a violation of conduct rule is based upon the violation of a commission rule.
id.at.footnote in avello reads 
robert jautz,if obligation to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade is only violation alleged,there must be a finding of bad faith.
first,it is clear that avello statement regarding bad faith is dictum because the conduct at issue in that case violated a separate rule,which automatically amounts to a violation of the j e rule.moreover,avello citation to jautz is inaccurate,as jautz held that a breach of contract violates the j e rule only if it is committed in bad faith or is accompanied by unethical conduct.jautz,wl,at emphasis added 
the same two problems lie with petitioner citation to the sec decision in fox ii,which was issued after the remand to the nyse in fox i,see supra.as noted,the nyse found that fox violated the j e rule by making a misstatement to his member firm employer about the status of his license to practice law in the state of florida and by submitting to his employer an altered copy of an order of the florida supreme court to support the misstatement.fox i,docket,wl,at.fox argued,however,that he had a good faith mistaken belief regarding the status of his license and that he accidentally sent the altered copy of the order to his employer.id.at.in fox i,the sec,citing jautz,held that a organization need not find that the respondent acted with scienter,but must find that the respondent acted in bad faith or unethically.id.at.it noted,however,that the nyse did not make findings with respect to whether fox acted in bad faith or unethically.id.at.it remanded to the nyse,which on remand found that fox conduct was in bad faith and unethical.fox ii,wl,at.fox then appealed to the sec,but the sec dismissed his appeal on the basis that it was untimely,and thus did not reach the merits.see id.at.
petitioner hones in on a footnote in fox ii.the relevant text and footnote reads 
in the remand decision,we asked the nyse to address whether fox alleged conduct was in bad faith or unethical.
robert jautz,holding that if only violation alleged by nasd is failure to observe just and equitable principles of trade,there must be a finding of bad faith.
id.at.as with avello,this is dictum and an incorrect recitation of the law as set forth in jautz.
under these circumstances,we agree with the sec that the incorrect dicta in avello and fox ii can not reasonably be read as signaling a rejection of the sec longstanding unethical conduct standard for j e rule violations outside the breach of contract context.it is clear from the exchange act and the relevant sec and circuit precedent that the j e rule prohibits mere unethical conduct in a breach of confidence case.
while we have reached this conclusion without affording dispositive deference to the nyse or sec,we acknowledge our obligation to afford some level of deference to their interpretation of the nyse rules.see fogel chestnutt,cir friendly,a n exchange has a substantial degree of power to interpret its own rules,cert.denied,d accord alderman sec,cir shultz sec,cir b ecause these are rules of the exchange,the exchange should be allowed discretion in determining their meaning.here the commission has affirmed that interpretation,and we find no error in its approval.internal citations omitted intercontinental,am.stock,cir since these are the rules of the exchange,it should be allowed broad discretion in the determination of their meaning and application.we find no error in the commission approval of this interpretation of the rule,cert.denied,d moses burgin,cir krull sec,cir gurfel sec.
ii.notice argument 
petitioner argues next that neither the nyse nor the sec has articulated a mental state standard for a j e rule violation.he contends that without an articulation of a mental state standard,registered members lack fair notice of the conduct that might be sanctioned.brief for petitioner thomas heath iii at.he writes,e ven if petitioner knew that he would be held to certain profession
