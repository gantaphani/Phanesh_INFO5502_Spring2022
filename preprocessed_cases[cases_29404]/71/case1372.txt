when plaintiff melvin maudlin retired from his employment with pacific decision sciences corporation pdsc,he negotiated a deal with his business partner,hark vasa,by which pdsc would pay him million over a period of nearly years.their agreement allocated for the redemption of maudlin shares of stock about percent of the outstanding shares,with the balance of million,designated by the transaction documents as deferred compensation,to be paid at the rate of per month.the monies were paid as agreed for nearly five and years.payment stopped,however,when pdsc new management expressed concerns about the legitimacy of the deferred compensation arrangement.maudlin sued,inter alia,to recover the balance of the payments he claimed he was owed.the court denied maudlin any relief,concluding the contract was a disguised stock redemption that violated the california corporations code and evaded taxes.the court further found maudlin was in pari delicto with vasa and pdsc.
we reverse the judgment.by comparing the total payments under the contract with the amount of pdsc retained earnings when the contract was executed,the court relied upon california corporate law that was superseded by statute effective in.the court should have compared each individual payment with pdsc retained earnings as of the date each payment was due.with respect to the tax evasion issue,we are unable to distinguish this case from a california supreme court precedent that compels us to conclude on this record that maudlin was not in pari delicto.therefore maudlin is entitled to enforce the contract.
maudlin and vasa formed pdsc as a california corporation in.pdsc was in the business of developing and licensing custom computer software to meet particularized needs of its client companies.vasa served as the president and chief executive officer of pdsc and maudlin was its corporate secretary.at the time of its formation,vasa owned or controlled percent of the stock and maudlin owned percent.the remaining percent was owned by the person from whom pdsc had acquired its original business assets.
from the time of its formation in until,maudlin and vasa both worked full time for pdsc.according to vasa,he and maudlin were both underpaid during the formative years,and they had made an informal agreement that if some day the company makes a lot of money and the company has money available,we pay maudlin.but no amounts were set.in,maudlin decided to retire when he suffered some serious health problems that made it difficult for him to continue providing services to the corporation.maudlin and vasa discussed the means by which maudlin could divest his interest in the company.maudlin wanted to sell his shares of stock and pdsc wanted to buy them.maudlin also wanted to be paid at the rate of per month for a period longer than his life expectancy.the record is virtually silent as to any discussions held between maudlin and vasa when they derived million as the total amount to be paid to maudlin.maudlin testified vasa came up with the total number of million paid at the rate of per month for months as deferred compensation,and for his shares of stock,but maudlin had no idea what the number was based upon.the evidence also disclosed,however,that shortly before maudlin and vasa struck their deal,pdsc had sold stock to a new investor for per share,from which the inference is easily drawn that the million to be paid to maudlin was the approximate value of his shares.
what is clear from the evidence,however,is that vasa retained anne tahim,pdsc accountant,to assist with the documentation for the transaction.vasa told tahim that maudlin was retiring,and he wanted to sell his stock,which the company wanted to buy.and also since maudlin was retiring,vasa wanted to provide him the retirement benefits vasa also wanted a document that would be tax advantageous to the company,and that would require monthly payments to maudlin for months.
tahim recommended the use of a secular trust by which pdsc would pay per month to the trust,and the trust would pay each month to maudlin.the document that was eventually signed on september,by vasa as president of pdsc and as trustee of the pacific decision sciences corporation secular trust secular trust,did just that and recited that maudlin had rendered services to pdsc for which he had not been compensated in the amount of.by separate agreement of september,pdsc agreed to purchase maudlin shares of pdsc stock for,payable in three annual installments,with the first payment due in the first quarter of.the shareholder resolution authorizing the purchase required the corporation to buy the shares on november,while the board of directors september,resolution provided that effective immediately maudlin shares would become pdsc treasury shares.
following execution of the secular trust,pdsc began making the monthly payments for the benefit of maudlin,and continued making the payments until october when pdsc was acquired in a statutory merger by pds acquisition corporation,a delaware corporation that was a wholly owned subsidiary of applied digital solutions,ads after the merger,pdsc continued making the monthly payments through may.maudlin also received payment of for his stock,accepting the reduction in price in exchange for an accelerated payment.
the secular trust was established as a separate entity,filing separate tax returns,reporting the distributions to maudlin to the taxing authorities,and providing maudlin with a schedule reflecting the payments he received.pdsc deducted the payments to the secular trust on its own tax returns,and maudlin reported and paid taxes on his distributions as ordinary income.
in the course of the merger negotiations,ads conducted a review of the books and records of pdsc with its own team of accountants,and the secular trust obligation was fully disclosed,both on the financial statements and on a formal disclosure schedule as part of the merger documents.
under an employment agreement negotiated as part of the merger,vasa continued as an employee of pdsc until he was replaced in january.new management reviewed the books and records and made an inquiry of maudlin about the secular trust.maudlin asked tahim to respond to the letter of inquiry,which she did.not satisfied with the response,pdsc made its last secular trust payment in may,prompting maudlin to bring this action against pdsc,ads,and vasa.for convenience,we will sometimes refer to pdsc and ads collectively as the pdsc defendants.

following a bench trial,the court ruled the secular trust was void on the grounds that it was illegal,fraudulent,contrary to public policy and in violation of provisions of the california corporations code and the federal internal revenue code,and that the secular trust was a subterfuge to disguise a stock repurchase as deferred compensation pay.the court further found the conduct of the parties to the and of substantially the same moral turpitude,although each was acting in his own while cooperating in the creation of the secular trust.the court concluded,maudlin and vasa should be left as they were when they came to court.any other action would reward their wrongdoing at the expense of the innocent parties pdsc and ads.accordingly,the court entered judgment in favor of the pdsc defendants on all of maudlin causes of action,and in favor of the pdsc defendants on all of vasa causes of action in his.as to maudlin complaint against vasa,the court dismissed it without prejudice.maudlin timely appealed the judgment.no other party filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
introduction 
the court judgment was based on the underlying premise that the secular trust was a subterfuge to disguise a stock repurchase as deferred compensation pay.pdsc hoped it could successfully deduct the monthly payments to maudlin as an ordinary business expense on its tax returns,thereby cheating the taxing authorities of tax otherwise owed on some per year.the court concluded the secular trust arrangement could not be enforced as a stock repurchase agreement because it violated provisions of the california corporations code.another premise of the court judgment was the innocence of the pdsc defendants.thus,the court found that pdsc and ads had no part in the preparation of the secular trust nor joined in any improper purposes and that maudlin and vasa should be left as they were when they came to court.any other action would reward their wrongdoing at the expense of the innocent parties pdsc and ads.
on appeal,maudlin does not challenge the court finding that the secular trust arrangement was,in reality,a redemption of his stock.no doubt he recognizes substantial evidence supports that conclusion.instead,he argues the stock repurchase was not illegal under california corporate law,contrary to the court conclusion,maudlin was not in pari delicto with vasa and pdsc with regard to the contract tax evading structure,and the pdsc defendants were legally bound by the understanding of the predecessor corporation.
assuming the transaction was a stock repurchase,as found by the trial court,we conclude the transaction was not illegal under california corporate law.the holdings of the cases relied upon by the pdsc defendants have not constituted correct statements of california law for some years,having been decided long before the legislature enacted corporations code sections and in their current form,effective in.with regard to the tax evasion issue,and the court conclusion that maudlin was in pari delicto with vasa and pdsc,we are unable to distinguish the material facts established by the record in this case from the facts relied upon by the supreme court in deciding,cal d,wherein the supreme court concluded a litigant in the same position as maudlin was not in pari delicto.because is indistinguishable,we are bound by its result.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.finally,under california law governing the rights and obligations of surviving corporations in mergers,pdsc has the same obligation to maudlin as it did before the merger.since the transaction was enforceable by maudlin before the merger,it is likewise enforceable against pdsc after the merger.any complaint the pdsc defendants have with respect to the completeness of the disclosures made during the merger transaction can not be used as a defense against maudlin,who,according to the evidence,played absolutely no part in the merger transaction.
the transaction was not illegal under california corporate law 
the pdsc defendants argued in the trial court,as they argue on appeal,that corporations code section section prohibits the redemption of stock from a shareholder unless,at the time the contract is executed,the corporation has retained earnings which are greater than the total contract price payable over the entire life of the contract 
that was once the law,but has not been since.counsel continued citation of cases that are no longer apt because the relevant statutes were changed some years ago is puzzling,particularly when one of the cases the pdsc defendants rely upon expressly notes,inter alia,that the retained earnings test no longer needs to be met at the time the contract is executed,but only when the payments are made.see kupetz wolf cir,distributions to shareholders must be scrutinized at the time they are made and not at the time the parties contracted that they would be made in the future.
section,subdivision a states in pertinent part neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make any distribution to the corporation shareholders section except as follows the distribution may be made if the amount of the retained earnings of the corporation immediately prior thereto equals or exceeds the amount of the proposed distribution.the key to understanding section is to note precisely what it distribution to shareholders.thus,unless a contract to pay a shareholder in the future is a distribution to the shareholder,the contract is not restricted or impaired by section.
corporations code section,which is embedded in the text of section to ensure the reader does not miss its significance,defines the term distribution to its shareholders.as relevant to the matter at hand distribution to its shareholders means the purchase or redemption of its shares for cash.t he time of any distribution by purchase or redemption of shares shall be the date cash is transferred by the corporation,whether or not pursuant to a contract of an earlier date,italics added.the meaning of section is plain.a distribution occurs only when the cash is transferred,not when the contract is signed.and since section applies only to distributions,its restrictions must be measured when the distribution is made,when cash is transferred.
a leading treatise on california corporate law describes the purpose of the current law on corporate redemptions.the present general corporation law was designed to eliminate the requirement that a corporation be able to purchase shares covered by a contract of purchase at the time the contract is entered into and to require such ability only as of the date of performance by the corporation.this is effected through the interplay of and the provisions of chapter of the general corporation law,the definition of distribution to its shareholders,provides that the time of any distribution by purchase or redemption of shares shall be the date cash or property is transferred by the corporation,whether or not pursuant to a contract of an earlier date,provided that when a debt obligation that is a security as defined in is issued in exchange for shares,the time of the distribution is the date when the corporation acquires the shares in that exchange.in turn,provides that a corporation shall not make any distribution unless the tests already described are met either as to the retained earnings test immediately prior to the distribution or as to the remaining assets test immediately after giving effect to the distribution thus,the statutory scheme is to permit a distribution,whether or not by virtue of a contract entered into prior thereto,if the corporation meets the applicable tests at the time the distribution is made.ballantine sterling,cal.corporation laws ed.
the cases relied upon by the pdsc defendants were either decided before the legislature enacted corporations code sections and in their present form,or do not support their argument for other reasons.see mcconnell estate of butler cir predates mindenberg carmel film productions d,same matter of national tile terrazzo,cir same in re qintex entertainment,cir,interpreting delaware law which prohibits a corporation from purchasing shares of its own stock when the capital of the corporation is impaired or when such purchase or redemption would cause any impairment of the capital of the corporation and noting the older cases required legally available funds both at the time the agreement was made and at the time of performance.the modern trend is to uphold such agreements as valid,regardless of the situation at the time of the making of the agreement,and to enforce them,to the extent that the corporation has legally available funds at the time of repurchase in re reliable cir interpreting same delaware statute and concluding it did not prohibit guarantee by corporation of third party obligation to seller of the corporation stock where corporation had sufficient surplus at time of the guarantee.
the cases cited by the pdsc defendants interpreting delaware law involved the question whether the repurchase of stock impaired the capital of the corporation,an issue not contested in this action.and california law has a test.if the retained earnings are sufficient to pay the cash at the time it is transferred in satisfaction of an earlier obligation to do so,the distribution is not prohibited.delaware law helps not one whit on this issue.
here,substantial evidence would support a finding that pdsc had sufficient retained earnings,both before and after the merger,to make the distributions to maudlin through his last payment in may but that is not really the issue.the pdsc defendants did not claim entitlement to reimbursement of payments already made.instead,the pdsc defendants asserted no obligation to make any further payments.and they did so on the basis of their assertion that the contract was an illegal contract for the repurchase of maudlin stock.at least insofar as the source of the alleged illegality is the restriction imposed by section,we have seen that the contract itself is not illegal.a distribution is prohibited only if cash is paid at a time when the retained earnings of the corporation are insufficient to cover the distribution.making the particular distribution is the potentially prohibited act,not the execution of a contract which may or may not be impaired by future events.thus,unless maudlin is barred from enforcing the contract by reason of his participation in a tax evasion scheme,he is,as a matter of corporate law,entitled to enforce the secular trust arrangement as a stock redemption agreement.whether he is entitled to payment of each installment when due depends upon the measure of retained earnings at the time each payment is to be made.
pursuant to binding supreme court precedent,maudlin is not in pari delicto 
we turn to the court conclusion maudlin was in pari delicto regarding the contract tax evading structure.in,supra,cal d,the california supreme court considered a set of facts virtually indistinguishable from those in this case.leland satre was an employee,officer,and shareholder of the corporation.upon termination of his employment,satre negotiated an agreement by which the corporation would repurchase of his stock for.but the corporation insisted the contract be written to reflect a cash payment of for the stock,with the remaining to be paid in semiannual installments of each,pursuant to a separate severance benefit agreement,which recited the payments were being made in consideration of the assignment of certain nonexistent patent rights.id.at.both and satre understood that the recited consideration was not the true consideration,and that the severance benefit agreement was actually intended to provide for the payment of the remaining of the agreed purchase price of the stock.id.at.further,the evidence indicated that the severance benefit agreement was intended by both parties to provide the balance of the consideration for the stock,and that had insisted on the subterfuge to give it an improper income tax advantage.id.at.satre was aware of purpose,but satre sole purpose was to obtain the purchase price.id.at.
with the above evidence,the trial court in made findings nearly identical to the trial court findings in this case.i t found that the agreement afforded a means by which both parties could have taken improper tax advantage of the federal and state governments,was entered into by both parties for tax purposes,was against public policy and should be treated as illegal it then concluded the parties were in pari delicto,and that neither party was entitled to relief,supra,cal at.
the supreme court disagreed and reversed.the court noted,there is no doubt that the general rule requires the courts to withhold relief under the terms of an illegal contract or agreement which is violative of public policy,supra,cal d at.but the court added,these rules are intended to prevent the guilty party from reaping the benefit of his wrongful conduct,or to protect the public from the future consequences of an illegal contract.they do not necessarily apply to both parties to the agreement unless both are truly in pari delicto.ibid.the high court then adopted a formulation of the in pari delicto doctrine articulated in norwood judd d.t he courts should not be so enamored with the latin phrase in pari delicto that they blindly extend the rule to every case where illegality appears somewhere in the transaction.the fundamental purpose of the rule must always be kept in mind,and the realities of the situation must be considered.where,by applying the rule,the public can not be protected because the transaction has been completed,where no serious moral turpitude is involved,where the defendant is the one guilty of the greatest moral fault,and where to apply the rule will be to permit the defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff,the rule should not be applied,supra,cal d at.the court also relied upon its earlier statement of an exception to the general rule in lewis queen ball sons cal d,where the court said in some cases,effective deterrence is best realized by enforcing the plaintiff claim rather than leaving the defendant in possession of the benefit or the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.in each case,how the aims of policy can best be achieved depends on the kind of illegality and the particular facts involved,supra,cal d at.
applying this rationale to the case before it,the supreme court concluded no reason appears why satre should be denied the aid of the courts in obtaining the agreed consideration for the assets which he has delivered to.except for payment of that consideration,the transaction has been completed,and the public requires no further protection.is clearly guilty of the greater moral fault,and satre conduct involved little,if any,serious moral turpitude.certainly,refusal of the courts to enforce the agreement would permit defendant to be unjustly enriched at the expense of plaintiff.such a course would result in a forfeiture disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality,and the respective conduct of the parties.finally,effective deterrence will be best realized by enforcing plaintiff satre claim rather than by leaving the defendant in possession of the benefit,supra,cal d at,fns.omitted.
the instant case can not be distinguished from on any material basis.yet the trial court ruled that none of the exceptions appear before the court in this case.using the analysis contained in,maudlin and vasa were in pari delicto.the court below made a further finding that at the time vasa,maudlin and the accountant,anne tahim,conceived and drafted the trust,the goals and hoped for benefits differed between maudlin and vasa,but both were fully and intimately aware of the illegality,immorality and resultant benefits to themselves,respectively.any other finding would grant relief to the wrongdoer or wrongdoers.
as makes clear,however,mere knowledge by one party to a contract that the transaction is structured in a manner designed to achieve the unlawful purpose of the other party is not the beginning and the end of the inquiry.and with regard to the finding that maudlin conceived and drafted the trust,we have searched the record for evidence to support the finding and are unable to find any.the pdsc defendants likewise have not directed us to any evidence in the record that would distinguish this case from.they point to the court findings,but not to supporting evidence.the evidence pdsc does cite is the same type of evidence considered by the court,or,in some cases,is simply not germane to the asserted illegality.
for example the pdsc defendants point out that maudlin testified it was his desire that the payout be over a period of time longer than my lifetime.but there is nothing immoral,illegal,or against public policy with respect to that request.and the pdsc defendants make much of maudlin deposition testimony wherein he was asked how much he was paid for his stock,and he answered,i guess you say i was paid million.of course,that testimony is highly probative of the real purpose of the secular redeem maudlin stock.but the disguised stock redemption is the same type of conduct considered by the court.and,of course,the stock redemption itself is not illegal,immoral,or against public
