the panel granted the pro se petition for review by sharemaster,a registered broker dealer,and held that the securities and exchange commission decision that a penalty that the financial industry regulatory authority finra imposed on sharemaster was not a live sanction capable of redress was unreasonable and inconsistent with applicable law.

the panel held that the sec interpretation of securities exchange act section d to include a requirement was entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.the panel further held that the sec unreasonably decided that the disciplinary sanction imposed by finra on sharemaster was no longer live.the panel concluded that the disciplinary sanction imposed by finra remained live based on a fine,and sharemaster challenge to finra final disciplinary sanction was subject to review by the sec.the panel remanded for the sec to determine whether,if sharemaster prevails on the merits of its argument regarding the applicability of a requirement,the sec may direct finra to reinstate sharemaster nunc pro tunc.
judge smith dissented in part because the majority resolved the case on grounds not raised by the parties and not supported by the record.he did,however,agree with the majority conclusion that the sec interpretation of securities exchange act section d,concerning a requirement,was entitled to chevron deference.judge smith would hold that there is substantial evidence to support the sec finding that no part of the in costs was a sanction,and he would deny the petition for review.
callahan,circuit judge 
securities exchange act section d authorizes the securities and exchange commission the commission to review any final disciplinary sanction imposed by a registered securities industry organization,including the financial industry regulatory authority finra.d.this case requires us to decide whether the commission review authority under section d is limited to final disciplinary sanctions that remain live.the commission interpreted section d to include a requirement in dismissing petitioner sharemaster application for review of a disciplinary sanction imposed by finra.we hold that commission interpretation of section d is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.however,we conclude that the commission decision that a penalty that finra imposed on sharemaster is not a live sanction capable of redress is unreasonable and inconsistent with applicable law.we therefore grant sharemaster pro se petition for review.
finra and the commission regulatory framework 
finra is a securities industry organization sro registered with the commission under section of the securities exchange act the exchange act.as a condition of its registration,finra is required to have in place rules regulating the conduct of its members and other participants.id.b.these rules must provide for the enforcement of federal securities laws and the commission rules,including the imposition of disciplinary sanctions.see id.b id.k c.finra rules provide for a variety of sanctions that finra may impose on its members and other participants for violating securities laws,including censures,fines,suspensions,expulsions,or any other fitting sanction.finra rule 
disciplinary proceedings before finra are placed on either an ordinary or expedited track.see finra rules.both tracks involve similar procedural steps,but finra endeavors to handle expedited disciplinary proceedings more quickly.see finra rules.additionally,although most sanctions imposed in an ordinary finra disciplinary proceeding are automatically stayed pending the commission review,sanctions imposed in an expedited proceeding are not.see finra rules a,r.however,an aggrieved party may request a stay from the commission,which the commission must decide on an expedited basis consistent with the commission other responsibilities.d.
among the provisions enforced by finra are exchange act section e a,e a,and commission rule d,d.the provisions,which finra enforced against sharemaster here,require some registered to annually file a balance sheet and income statement certified by a public accounting firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board pcaob.e a.
once finra internal disciplinary process is complete,an aggrieved party may file an application for review with the commission.exchange act section d authorizes the commission to review any final disciplinary sanction or denial of access that,like the sanction at issue here,section d requires finra to report to the commission.id.d.
while section d addresses what finra actions shall be subject to review,section e entitled disposition of review cancellation,reduction,or remission of sanction governs the scope of the commission remedial authority.in deciding an application for review of a final disciplinary sanction,section e requires the commission to declare whether finra correctly found a violation of applicable rules or,if not,to set aside the sanction.id.e a,b.if the commission finds a violation,it may affirm the sanction imposed,modify the sanction,or remand for further proceedings.id.e a.additionally,if the commission finds that the sanction imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter or is excessive or oppressive,the commission may cancel,reduce,or require the remission of such sanction.id.e.
section f entitled dismissal of review proceeding addresses the commission review of denials of access imposed by finra and other sros.it directs the commission to dismiss an unmeritorious challenge to an action denying access to finra or,in the case of a meritorious challenge,set aside finra action and grant the access that finra denied.id.f.
background 
sharemaster business and annual report 
sharemaster is a registered securities and finra member that is wholly owned and operated by howard feigenbaum.sharemaster alleged annual income is modest at around.its business is limited to acting as an agent for investment and insurance companies in the sale of mutual funds and variable insurance products.it does not hold any customer funds or securities.in preparing an annual audit report for,sharemaster learned that review of the report by a accountant may be required under f.sharemaster found that a accountant would charge significantly more to prepare the required annual report than the certified public accountant that sharemaster regularly used instead of the usual charge.according to sharemaster,this increased cost would inflict a significant financial hardship on its small business.after consulting with the commission,sharemaster learned that e i a provides for an exemption from the pcaob requirement for certain securities brokers and dealers believing that it qualified for this exemption as an agent that does not hold customer funds or securities,sharemaster filed an annual audit report using a certified accountant who was not registered with the pcaob.
finra disciplinary sanction on sharemaster 
in may of,finra department of member regulation rejected sharemaster annual report and suspended sharemaster finra membership because the report did not comply with rule d pcaob requirement.sharemaster filed a request for a hearing before a finra hearing panel,which was held on june.on october,the hearing panel found that sharemaster report did not comply with rule d pcaob requirement and thus rejected it.the panel sanctioned sharemaster for the violation,ordering 
sharemaster is suspended until it files the requisite annual report.at the end of six months,the suspension will convert to an expulsion if sharemaster has at that time not filed a properly audited annual report for.sharemaster is also ordered to pay costs of,which includes an administrative fee of and the cost of the hearing transcript.
the sum that finra ordered sharemaster to pay evidently included a penalty for not timely complying with rule d or,in the commission words,a late fee.costs associated with the hearing amounted to and the cost of the hearing transcript presumably accounts for the remaining.
the commission review of finra final disciplinary sanction 
on october,sharemaster filed an application for commission review of finra final disciplinary sanction.because the sanction was imposed in an expedited disciplinary proceeding,it was not automatically stayed.sharemaster states that the absence of an automatic stay presented it with a hobson choice comply immediately or risk going bankrupt waiting for the commission to decide the motion to stay.accordingly,three days after seeking review,sharemaster filed an annual report reviewed by a more costly,accountant.while finra order imposing the sanction stated that the suspension would be lifted upon filing of the requisite annual report,finra did not lift the suspension until january,almost three months later.
the commission then requested supplemental briefing from sharemaster and finra on what impact,if any,sharemaster subsequent compliance and finra lifting of the suspension would have on the commission consideration of sharemaster application for review.both finra and sharemaster asserted that sharemaster compliance with the pcaob requirement and the lifting of the suspension did not foreclose the commission review under section d.according to finra,costs that had been assessed against but not yet paid by sharemaster were sufficient to preserve statutory jurisdiction.in its brief,sharemaster also argued,among other things,that the commission had a statutory duty to review finra failure to immediately lift the suspension after sharemaster filed a compliant report,as the delay violated the terms of finra sanction order and caused financial harm to sharemaster.
on october,the commission dismissed sharemaster application for review,finding that it lacked jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to section d of the exchange act because the suspension was no longer in effect.sharemaster,exchange act release,wl.sharemaster thereafter sought review by the ninth circuit.however,at the commission request,we remanded the matter on may.
on remand,the commission ordered additional briefing.this time,finra changed its position and argued that the commission lacked review authority under section d.sharemaster renewed its argument that the commission had authority to review finra sanction,as well as finra failure to timely lift the suspension upon submission of a compliant report.on august,the commission withdrew its earlier order and dismissed sharemaster application for review.sharemaster,exchange act release,wl.the commission again concluded that it lacked statutory jurisdiction under section d to consider finra final disciplinary sanction because there was no longer a live sanction for it to act upon after finra lifted the suspension.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the commission first found the term final disciplinary sanction to be ambiguous because no provision of the exchange act defines that term or expressly addresses whether a coercive sanction must be in force at the time of commission review.id.the commission found that the term ambiguity becomes more apparent when section d is read in conjunction with section e,which suggests that a sanction must remain in place at the time of review for the commission to act upon 
for instance,in describing any proceeding to review a final disciplinary sanction,section e provides that there must be,among other things,opportunity for the presentation of supporting reasons to affirm,modify,or set aside the sanction.moreover,section e a provides that if an sro acted appropriately,the commission shall so declare and,as appropriate,affirm the sanction imposed by the sro,modify the sanction,or remand to the sro for further proceedings.and similarly,section e b provides that if an sro did not act appropriately,the commission shall,by order,set aside the sanction imposed by the sro and,if appropriate,remand to the sro for further proceedings.
id.at footnotes omitted.
after finding section d unclear on whether a sanction must remain in place in order to be subject to the commission review,the commission conclude d that the better approach is to construe sections d and e as imposing such a requirement.id.the commission provided several policy considerations in support of its interpretation.first,it reasoned that because coercive sanctions operate like judicial civil contempt sanctions they ought to be treated similarly.id.courts have generally resisted reviewing such sanctions after a contemnor has complied and the sanction has lifted.id.second,a contrary reading of the statute would require the commission to issue effectively advisory opinions with no direct,real world effect.id.at.third,requiring the commission to review a disciplinary sanction after a party has achieved compliance could waste limited commission resources and possibly come at the expense of parties with genuine,urgent,and ongoing disputes.id.at.finally,requiring a live sanction ensures meaningful review because the parties will have a substantial and concrete interest in the outcome of the proceedings.id.at.
the commission next addressed sharemaster contention that finra failure to promptly lift the suspension after sharemaster filed a compliant report constituted a denial of access subject to review by the commission.id.at.in a footnote,the commission suggested that finra wrongly delayed lifting the suspension nonetheless,the commission found that it still lack ed jurisdiction because the suspension has lifted and there is nothing to affirm,modify,or set aside.id.at.the commission declined to consider the extended suspension a denial of access under section d for purposes of determining its statutory authority to review finra action.it reasoned that the extended suspension was inextricably intertwined with the october finra hearing panel order and,as a result,it is appropriately considered a final disciplinary sanction and not a denial of access.id.at.
finally,the commission rejected numerous arguments by sharemaster that finra disciplinary sanction remained subject to review even though sharemaster had submitted a compliant report and finra had lifted the suspension.see id.at.concluding that no final disciplinary sanction remained in place to act upon,the commission dismissed sharemaster application for review.id.at.
on september,sharemaster timely filed this pro se petition for review.we have jurisdiction pursuant to section a of the exchange act,a 
sharemaster challenges the commission decision dismissing its application for review on two grounds.first,sharemaster argues that the commission requirement is inconsistent with section d,which directs the commission to review any final disciplinary sanction imposed by finra.second,sharemaster contends that,even if a requirement is read into the statute,the commission unreasonably applied the requirement in dismissing sharemaster application for review.we disagree with sharemaster first argument,but agree with its second.
a.the commission interpretation of section d is entitled to chevron deference.
sharemaster first argument requires us to decide whether the commission interpretation of section d warrants deference under the familiar analysis set forth in chevron,
at step one of the chevron framework,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.city of arlington,fcc,quoting chevron,at.our analysis begins with the text of the statute.yokeno sekiguchi,cir.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil.
looking to the exchange act,we conclude that congress did not speak to the precise question presented whether the commission is authorized only to review final disciplinary sanctions that remain live.section d authorizes the commission to review any final disciplinary sanction or denial of access to services imposed by registered sros,but the exchange act does not define these terms.d.while the commission has by regulation defined final disciplinary action,c,the regulation also is silent on whether a sanction must remain in effect in order to be subject to review 
section d broader statutory context does not resolve the ambiguity created by this silence.as the commission explained,other parts of the statute lend some support to the view that,in order to be subject to review by the commission,a final disciplinary sanction imposed by an sro must remain in place.specifically,section e directs the commission,in disposing of an application for review,to issue a declaratory judgment and,as appropriate,affirm,modify,or set aside the sanction,or remand to the sro for further proceedings.e.this provision suggests but,as the commission concedes,does not unambiguously confirm that congress intended that there remain a sanction in place for the commission to affirm,modify,or set aside.
the legislative history is similarly inconclusive.while the legislative history suggests that the term disciplinary sanction was intended to be broadly defined,it is also silent on whether such a sanction must remain live in order to be subject to the commission review.see comm.on banking,housing urban affairs,securities acts amendments of,accompanying,at.
because the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue addressed by the commission whether the commission has a statutory duty to review a final disciplinary sanction that is moot or,in the commission words,no longer live we find that the first step of chevron is satisfied and we move on to step two.see chevron,at.
step two of the chevron framework requires us to determine whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.if the agency interpretation is not in conflict with the statute and represents a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make,we must defer to it.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet.
for the same reasons that we found the statute ambiguous,we conclude that the commission interpretation of section d to require a sanction to remain in place in order to be subject to review is permissible.again,the exchange act is silent on this issue and section e can be read to require that a disciplinary sanction remain in place for the commission to act upon.
the commission asserted policy considerations supporting its interpretation of the scope of its authority are reasonable.as mentioned,the commission justified a requirement by analogizing to doctrines applicable to article iii courts.the commission explained that its requirement finds support in the rule that voluntary compliance with a civil contempt order generally precludes appellate review.see sec hickey,cir.recognizing that the purging of the contempt ordinarily renders the controversy moot.the commission also explained that a requirement furthers its interest in avoiding unwarranted advisory opinions and thereby conserving its limited resources.analogizing to article iii standing doctrine,the commission further explained that requiring a live sanction would help ensure meaningful review because the parties will have a substantial and concrete interest in the outcome of the proceedings.sharemaster,wl,at.these policy considerations are without doubt reasonable.
indeed,if an sro such as finra imposed a disciplinary sanction but then fully retracted the sanction by,for example,setting aside a suspension and returning any fine levied,it would make little sense for the commission to proceed with review.this observation highlights the reasonableness of the commission view that it need not review moot sanctions.in fact,it is reasonable for the commission to assume that congress legislated against the backdrop of mootness and standing doctrines in defining the scope of the commission review authority.see city of arlington,at noting that congress should be presumed to legislate with stable background rules in mind.while these doctrines apply to article iii courts,analogous doctrines are also well established in the context of agency adjudications.see,or.cedar prods,ibla,t he interior board of land appeals decides actual controversies and avoids giving opinions on moot questions or abstract propositions.
we hold that the commission interpretation of section d as only permitting review of live disciplinary sanctions is permissible under the statute and based on reasonable policy considerations.we therefore defer to the commission interpretation.
b.the commission unreasonably decided that the disciplinary sanction imposed by finra on sharemaster was no longer live.
our inquiry does not end with our conclusion that the commission interpretation of section d is entitled to chevron deference.the question remains whether the commission application of its requirement to dismiss sharemaster application for review was reasonable and consistent with applicable law.whether framed as going to the scope of the commission review authority or the application of its delegated authority,the underlying question is the same did the commission unreasonably refuse to review sharemaster case see city of arlington,at.we find that it did.
before the commission,sharemaster offered numerous reasons why the disciplinary sanction finra imposed remained live after sharemaster submitted a compliant report and finra lifted the suspension.one such reason was that sharemaster was still stuck with a penalty for not timely filing a compliant annual report.in its order,the commission offered two reasons why this financial loss did not preserve finra review authority after the suspension was lifted.
first,the commission suggested that the entire sum may have represented the cost of pursuing a hearing before finra,rather than a disciplinary fine.sharemaster,wl,at.however,the commission own dismissal order and briefing before this court undermine this position.in its dismissal order,the commission stated only that of the that finra ordered sharemaster to pay appears to be another example of costs assessed as part of the finra proceedings.id.emphasis added.in its answering brief on appeal,the commission conceded that this sum was apparently a late fee.we agree.finra decision plainly suggests that finra imposed a penalty on sharemaster,in addition to taxing a administrative fee and a transcript fee.
second,the commission stated in its dismissal order that,even if this amount did not represent an assessment of costs,we would still lack the power to order finra to repay sharemaster.id.at.the commission did not explain why this is so,but referenced footnote of its order.that footnote,in turn,references two commission decisions that offer no support for the commission position.the first decision held in relevant part that the commission is not authorized to award monetary damages.beatrice feins,exchange act release,at.this decision does not support the commission position because sharemaster does not seek damages.the second commission decision stated that exchange act section does not appear to authorize the setting aside of an sro fees assessment or authorize remission of the fees charged in connection with a hearing before an sro.marshall,exchange act release,wl,at.this decision does not lend the commission support because,in addition to charging in administrative fees associated with the hearing,finra imposed a fine on sharemaster possibly for failing to timely file a compliant annual report.
the imposition of a fine is a disciplinary sanction under both finra rules and the commission precedent.see finra rule listing fine as a disciplinary sanction c acknowledging that a sanction may consist of a fine tague sec,exchange act release,sec,wl,at,listing expulsion,suspension,fine or censure as final disciplinary sanctions.calling the a late fee is of no moment regardless of its label,it appears to be a penalty imposed for not timely filing an annual report prepared by a accountant.it is not part of the separately ledgered administrative fee that finra taxed to sharemaster for pursuing an administrative appeal.the fine became a final disciplinary sanction when sharemaster exhausted remedies before finra.the sanction remained live even after the suspension lifted because the fine was not canceled and the money was not remitted to sharemaster.
unlike the sunk transactional costs of pursuing an administrative appeal,if sharemaster prevails on the merits of his argument that he was not required to use a accountant,the commission would be compelled to set aside the fine because sharemaster,in fact,timely complied with securities laws.the commission view that it lacks authority to order finra to repay the conflicts with the exchange act.the commission has authority to act upon a monetary sanction pursuant to section d and e.section e provides that the commission must set aside such a sanction if it was incorrectly levied.e.moreover,section e makes clear that the commission has authority to cancel,reduce,or require the remission of such sanction,even if the fine was correctly levied.id.e emphasis added 
given that the commission is empowered to undo what has already been done,the monetary sanction is not moot.nw.res.info.ctr.marine fisheries,cir.the fact that might be characterized as a amount is without consequence.as long as the parties have a concrete interest,however small,in the outcome of the litigation,the case is not moot.gomez.moreover,this amount of money is substantial to sharemaster small business.
the government contends,and our dissenting colleague would hold,that sharemaster waived any argument based on the fine by not raising it in its briefs.ordinarily,we will not consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant opening brief.united states ullah,cir.the general waiver rule applies even to like sharemaster who proceed pro se in the face of a complicated statutory scheme.see wilcox comm r,cir.however,we make an exception to the general rule for good cause shown or if a failure to do so would result in manifest injustice,when the issue is raised in the appellee brief,or if the failure to raise the issue properly did not prejudice the defense of the opposing party.ullah,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also united states salman,cir,cert.granted in part,ed,and aff.
the second and third exceptions apply here.sharemaster raised the argument in front of the commission,and the commission addressed the merits of sharemaster argument in its decision below and again in its answering brief on appeal.at oral argument,sharemaster stated that it did not intend to waive this issue.see hall city of los angeles,cir.finding no prejudice where parties had opportunity to brief the issue gonzales,cir.considering an issue not raised in an opening brief where an opponent had an opportunity to address the issue at oral argument.in addition,to ensure that our consideration would not prejudice either side,we requested and received supplemental briefs on this issue.we further note that it was the government that called the a late fee in its brief these words were not put in its mouth by sharemaster.
sharemaster makes several additional arguments in support of the view that the disciplinary sanction remains a live injury capable of being redressed.for example,sharemaster contends that the commission has authority to retroactively shorten sharemaster suspension and direct finra to reinstate sharemaster to membership nunc pro tunc,which sharemaster alleges would allow it to collect commissions that would have been paid it if not for the suspension.sharemaster also argues that,even if the sanction is no longer live,it is capable of repetition but evading review and thus should qualify for an exception to the requirement.we need not reach these arguments or sharemaster due process claim because we conclude that the disciplinary sanction imposed by finra remained live based on the fine.accordingly,sharemaster challenge to finra final disciplinary sanction is subject to review by the commission pursuant to section d.we leave it to the commission to determine on remand whether,if sharemaster prevails on the merits of its argument regarding the applicability of the requirement,the commission may direct finra to reinstate sharemaster nunc pro tunc.
we hold that the commission interpretation of section d as limiting its review authority to final disciplinary sanctions that remain live is entitled to chevron deference.however,we hold that the commission unreasonably decided that the monetary penalty that finra imposed on sharemaster was not a sanction and thus not a live disciplinary sanction.
sharemaster pro se petition for review is granted.each side shall bear its own costs of this appeal.
because the majority resolves this case on grounds not raised by the parties and not supported by the record,i must dissent.that said,the majority correctly concludes that the securities and exchange commission interpretation of securities exchange act section d that the commission review authority under that section is limited to final disciplinary sanctions that remain live is entitled to chevron deference however,the majority thereafter speculates as to the nature of costs assessed against sharemaster in order to invent a live sanction and preserve the commission review authority.it is that part of the decision i can not join.
sharemaster sought the commission review of a financial industry regulatory authority finra order suspending it from finra membership for failure to file a compliant annual financial report.under the commission interpretation of section d,its review of the finra order was limited to final disciplinary sanctions that remained live.the only disciplinary sanction described in the finra order was a suspension.after concluding that sharemaster was in violation of the exchange act,the finra order states accordingly,sharemaster is suspended until it files a compliant annual report.the finra order did not separately impose any fines on sharemaster.indeed,the word fine is not used anywhere in the finra order.sharemaster subsequently opted to comply with the finra order by filing a compliant annual report,and finra lifted the suspension.therefore,the only sanction imposed by the finra order was no longer live and,applying the commission interpretation of section d,the commission is without jurisdiction.case closed.
but no determined to find a live sanction,the majority invents one.the majority notes that the finra order also required sharemaster to pay hearing costs.the majority speculates that the ordered by finra included a penalty.it then concludes that this penalty which it also labels as a fine amounts to a live sanction that preserves the commission jurisdiction to review the finra order.without persuasive argument by the parties on this second issue thus,left only to speculation,the majority presses on to address and decide it,sua sponte adopting a position neither raised before us by the parties nor supported by the record.
as an initial point,sharemaster clearly did not raise the issue on which the majority rests its decision.the only sanction referred to by sharemaster or finra or the commission was the suspension.it is undisputed that sharemaster did not argue in either its opening or reply brief that finra sanctioned it with a fine.even in the face of persistent,leading prompts from the majority at oral argument,sharemaster did not pursue this position.our precedent is well established regarding such circumstances.o n appeal,arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived.smith marsh,cir.this waiver rule which the majority acknowledges applies to pro se litigants,such as sharemaster,just as it applies to parties represented by counsel,should have ended our inquiry.see wilcox comm r of internal revenue,cir.the majority essentially admitted as much wh
