background 
the present action concerns an investment made by south cherry in bayou accredited fund,bayou accredited,on the recommendation of hennessee group.the following description is based on the nonconclusory factual allegations in south cherry complaint,which we accept as true for purposes of reviewing the dismissal pursuant to.b,along with the hennessee hedge fund advisory group investor presentation hennessee investor presentation or presentation containing the representations described in the complaint see declaration of fred groothuis dated april,exhibit a.
hennessee group presentation to south cherry 
hennessee group or hg is an advisor with respect to investments in hedge funds,private pools of capital collected from qualified investors.defendants elizabeth lee hennessee and charles gradante are hg managing principals.hg describes itself as the industry leader the most recognized hedge fund consulting firm in the industry,whose principals have testified before congress on hedge fund issues.in,south cherry was inexperienced in investing in hedge funds.see complaint.at the request of one of south cherry creditors,hg made a presentation to south cherry and its principal,fred groothuis,as to the hg process for evaluating hedge funds.
the hennessee investor presentation that was sent to south cherry stated that h edge funds provide superior returns relative to risk it emphasized hg unique experience and expertise in evaluating hedge funds,stating that hg had direct relationships with hedge funds,had p ersonal and professional relationships with all key managers in the industry,and review ed hedge funds per month and it extolled,inter alia,what hg called its proprietary data base and analytics,its unique due diligence process,and its c redibility with investors and industry professionals.according to the presentation,hg considered only hedge funds with years audited track record its due diligence process with respect to such funds included the following five levels of scrutiny prior to its recommendation of such a fund for investment collection of information about the fund manager assessment of the fund experience,credibility,and transparency interviews of hedge fund p ersonnel from the top down at the fund offices to give hg a sense of overall professionalism,attitude and depth of organization study of the fund i ndividual positions,with an emphasis on its long,short,cash,and derivative positions,as well as any o ff balance sheet transactions and review of audited financial statements,checks of the fund key personnel references,confirmation of the fund prime banking relationship,and measures to verify auditor.the presentation also stated that after a decision to invest in a given hedge fund,m onitoring the investment,once it is made,is equally important,and that hennessee group provided o ngoing and continuous quantitative and qualitative analysis and conducted due diligence.
after receiving the presentation from hennessee group,south cherry and hg entered into an oral arrangement whereby 
hennessee group contracted with south cherry that it would recommend to south cherry suitable hedge fund investments which had passed every stage of hennessee group detailed and rigorous five step due diligence process.in addition,hennessee group promised south cherry that it would continue to perform due diligence on investments south cherry would make in reliance on hennessee group recommendations.in exchange,south cherry agreed to pay hennessee group an annual commission of of each hedge fund investment south cherry made as a result of a hennessee group recommendation.
south cherry investment in bayou accredited 
one of the hedge funds recommended to south cherry by hennessee group was bayou accredited,whose principals included samuel israel iii and daniel marino see complaint.hennessee group presented to south cherry a biography of israel representing that from to,israel had been head trader for omega advisors,one of the hedge fund industry largest and most successful funds,and had manag ed assets exceeding billion for leon cooperman,who was widely described as a legendary trader.id.hennessee group represented that at omega,israel was responsible for all equity and financial futures execution,and shared responsibility for hedging the portfolio using futures and options.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
in,israel and marino formed bayou fund,llc bayou fund in or about january,israel and marino replaced bayou fund with several bayou family funds,including bayou accredited.see id.
in recommending an investment in bayou accredited to south cherry,hennessee group represented in writing to groothuis and south cherry,among other things,that the predecessor,bayou fund,had a greater than annualized return since inception,that it was profitable in of the months since its inception,and that it had accomplished all of this at relatively low risk relative to the broader marketplace.
id.further,
a s part of its investment recommendation to groothuis and south cherry,hennessee group also provided south cherry with six years of written monthly performance figures for bayou fund.net of all fees,hennessee group represented to south cherry that bayou fund annual performance between and ranged from a gain in to a gain in to a high water gain of in.
in reliance on hennessee group representations and recommendations,and in specific reliance on south cherry understanding that bayou accredited had passed all stages of hennessee group due diligence process,south cherry invested in bayou accredited.complaint.the complaint states that south cherry invested a total of million sic million in bayou accredited from march,through june,that it withdrew million in the spring of,and that it invested another on or about october,for a total net investment of million.id.from the spring of until the spring of,hennessee group sent south cherry monthly reports as to the status of its investment in bayou accredited,the last of which reported to south cherry that its million had appreciated to approximately million.id.
the complaint alleged that in fact,however,as revealed in a september sec report and an sec action against the bayou funds principals,bayou accredited was part of a ponzi scheme.see,complaint.according to the sec,israel and marino had begun to divert moneys from all members of the bayou family funds in,and they had essentially stopped trading in those accounts and transferred all of those funds assets to other accounts in april.see complaint,see also id.quoting the sec as asserting that shortly after its inception in,bayou began to sustain large losses from trading and israel and marino,and a former bayou principal,began lying to investors regarding the fund performance and the value of investors accounts.defendants israel and marino also began to misappropriate and dissipate millions of dollars of investor monies from the fund and,beginning in,the four successor funds.internal quotation marks omitted alterations in complaint.all of the bayou family fund principals were eventually convicted,upon their pleas of guilty,of securities fraud.see id.
in july,israel had written to bayou family fund investors to say that the funds would be liquidated and that each investor would receive distributions in august no distributions were ever made.south cherry lost its entire remaining million investment in bayou accredited.see complaint.
the sec reported that bayou fund in fact lost millions of dollars in every single year it traded.complaint.thus,t he figures hennessee group provided to south cherry were all false,showing profits where there were instead large losses.id.in fact,the complaint alleged,all of the above representations by hennessee group as to israel background and the performance of bayou fund were false.see,id.israel was never head trader for omega advisors,and never held any position remotely comparable rather,the legendary leon cooperman has since described israel as a mere order taker.id.and bayou fund,having consistently lost money trading in securities and options,created trading profits out of whole cloth in order to mask that fact.id.further,i n order to hide th e fact of those losses,israel and marino in or around fired bayou fund independent auditor,hertz herson hhco,and replaced it with a firm called richmond,fairfield associates richmond fairfield id,a firm that the complaint alleged was not a genuine auditor id,was not independent because its principal was marino id,and never did any auditing id.despite the fact that hhco had stopped auditing bayou fund in,and never audited any of the bayou family funds once they were established in,hennessee group represented to south cherry that bayou accredited,and the bayou family funds,were audited by hhco.id.
the complaint alleged that hennessee group could not have performed any real due diligence in,for if it had,it would have discovered,inter alia,that israel,prior to forming bayou fund,had been a mere clerk,that hhco had not been the auditor for any of the funds since,and that the new auditor was not independent because it was owned by marino,a bayou fund principal.see,complaint.thus,hennessee group had no reasonable basis to credit the bayou fund financial figures and was negligent or reckless in passing them on to investors like south cherry.complaint.
c.the decision of the district court 
following the disclosures as to the nature of the bayou funds,south cherry commenced the present action,asserting,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,a claim against hennessee group for failure to perform the promised due diligence,and claims of securities fraud under b and rule against hennessee under of the act against elizabeth lee hennessee and gradante as control persons of hg,see misrepresenting the financial status and performance of the bayou funds.hennessee group moved to dismiss the claim pursuant to.b on the ground that it was barred by the new york statute of frauds all of the defendants moved to dismiss the securities fraud claims pursuant to rule b on the ground,inter alia,that the complaint failed to plead scienter in accordance with the requirements of the pslra.
in an opinion reported sub nom.in re bayou hedge fund litigation south cherry street llc hennessee group llc,d,the district court granted the motions to dismiss.the court found that the oral agreement between south cherry and hennessee group was a contract of indefinite duration,as n o termination provision,express or implied was alleged.d at.the court noted that although it could be said that performance of the contract would be completed when south cherry sold its hedge fund holdings,such completion could occur only at the option of south cherry because hennessee group could not perform its obligations within one year unless south cherry exercised that option,the court concluded that the agreement was unenforceable under oblig.law a.see d at.
the district court ruled that south cherry securities fraud claim,that hg acted recklessly when it failed to uncover the bayou fraud after it promised to conduct due diligence on bayou accredited,id.at,should be dismissed for lack of any indication of scienter.it concluded that hg alleged failure to perform due diligence did not establish recklessness in the sense that b and rule require,because that failure did not establish either that hg knew bayou accredited was part of a ponzi scheme or that hg intended to deceive south cherry.see d at.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,south cherry contends that the district court erred in dismissing both its contract claim and its securities fraud claim.we review dismissals pursuant to rule b de novo,see,burch pioneer credit recovery,cir,assuming all factual allegations to be true,and determin ing whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief,ashcroft iqbal,d iqbal see.a complaint must contain a short and plain statement showing that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.we also review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim in accordance with the heightened pleading standards imposed by the pslra,discussed in part.below.see generally faulkner beer,cir novak kasaks,cir novak.applying these standards to south cherry claims,we see no error in the rulings of the district court.
a.the contract claim 
new york statute of frauds provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
every agreement,promise or undertaking is void,unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing,and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith,or by his lawful agent,if such agreement,promise or undertaking 
by its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof 
oblig.law a.this provision requires answers to one or both of the following questions whether the agreement is reflected in a writing signed by the party against which enforcement is sought,and if it is not,whether the agreement is one described by the statute.
there is no dispute here that the answer to the first question is negative.although south cherry complaint alleged that hennessee group promised south cherry in writing that it would perform both extensive and ongoing due diligence complaint emphasis added,the writing to which south cherry refers was a unilateral presentation by hg,rather than a contract.south cherry does not contend that it alleged there was any writing signed by hennessee group containing the terms of the agreement that south cherry sought to enforce it merely argues that the district court erred in ruling that the statute of frauds was applicable to the oral contract pleaded in the complaint south cherry brief on appeal at emphasis added see also id.at south cherry alleged an oral agreement whereby hg would provide south cherry with hedge fund recommendations and due diligence,in exchange for which south cherry would pay a fee for each year it held a recommended investment.emphasis added.
the disputed question is whether the alleged oral agreement is within the scope of a.historically,courts generally held that this provision of the statute of frauds was limited to those contracts only which by their very terms have absolutely no possibility in fact and law of full performance within one year,d n boening,kirsch beverages,boening citing corbin,contracts williston,contracts ed,making the key question whether the contract,according to the reasonable interpretation of its terms,required that it should not be performed within the year,boening,at,at,quoting warner texas pacific.the new york court of appeals had ruled that if the obligation of the contract is not,by its very terms,or necessary construction,to endure for a longer period than one year,it is a valid agreement,although it may be capable of an indefinite continuance,boening,at,at,quoting trustees of first baptist church brooklyn fire insurance.
the principle that this aspect of the statute of frauds encompasses only those contracts that by their very terms have absolutely no possibility in fact and law of full performance within one year,boening,at,at,has not,however,been applied literally.in shirley polykoff advertising,houbigant,for example,the plaintiff alleged an oral agreement pursuant to which it had designed an advertisement for the defendant,for which the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff for every year that the defendant used the advertisement.if the defendant had paid the plaintiff and used the advertisement only within one year of the making of the agreement,performance by both sides would,literally,have been completed within one year.but under the agreement,the defendant had the right to use the design in perpetuity.thus,although the defendant was not obligated to use the advertisement in any given year,its in any given year did not extinguish its obligation to pay if it used the advertisement in any subsequent year.accordingly,the possibility existed that the agreement would not be performed within one year the duration of the defendant right and obligation was thus unlimited and the court held that enforcement of the agreement was barred by the statute of frauds.see at,at,see also martocci greater new york brewery,finding an oral agreement to be within the statute,even though the defendant liability depended on the placing of orders by a third party,which could have ceased within one year.
in boening itself,the plaintiff alleged an oral agreement in which the defendant,a prime distributor of chocolate drink a agreed to grant the plaintiff predecessors the exclusive right to distribute in a particular area of new york if they ceased distribution of a competitor chocolate drink,and b agreed that the predecessors exclusive subdistributorship would continue for as long as they satisfactorily distributed the product,exerted their best efforts and acted in good faith.at,at.the boening court concluded that these terms,reasonably construed,necessarily meant that the oral agreement between the parties called for performance of an indefinite duration and could only be terminated within one year by its breach during that period.as such,the agreement fell within the statute of frauds and was void.id.at,at,emphases added.
if,however,an oral agreement expressly provides that it may permissibly be terminated within one year by either party,such a termination is considered performance,rather than a breach and such an agreement is not within the statute of frauds.see,blake voight.south cherry,arguing that the district court erred in finding the statute of frauds applicable here on the ground that only south cherry could end the contract within one year without a breach,relies on boening for the proposition that an oral agreement is not within the statute of frauds w here one or both parties have an explicit option to terminate their agreement within one year.south cherry brief on appeal at quoting boening,at,at,emphasis and alteration in brief.boening did so state but as the court in huebener kenyon eckhardt,dep t huebener,observed,s ignificantly,in distinction to other rules set forth in boening review of the existing authorities,this sentence in boening is not followed by any citation of authority,huebener,at,at and we note that the only cases that boening cited subsequently in which only one party had an option to terminate and the oral agreement was held to be outside the statute of frauds were cases in which that option belonged to the defendant,see boening,at,at,citing coinmach industries domnitch,and north shore bottling schmidt sons.
in north shore bottling,the new york court of appeals held that an oral agreement giving the defendant an express option to terminate was not within the statute of frauds but it noted that an agreement would be within the statute if instead the option to terminate was solely in the plaintiff,the party seeking to enforce the agreement,and not in the party to be charged.at,at,emphasis in original citing,inter alia,belfert peoples planning of america.thus,the new york courts have held that the principle announced in blake voight,that an oral contract is not made unenforceable by the statute of frauds if by its express terms,it is terminable by either party within one year,is not applicable where only the plaintiff has that option.see,americana petroleum northville industries,dep t huebener,at,at sawyer sickinger,dep t.the rationale is that 
where the right to cancel or terminate is limited unilaterally to plaintiff,the defendant liability endures indefinitely,subject only to the uncontrolled voluntary act of the party who seeks to hold defendant.under such circumstances it is illusory,from the point of view of defendant,to consider the contract terminable or performable within one year.and it is to the party to be charged,alone,namely the defendant,that the statute is designed to provide protection from fraud and perjury.
belfert peoples planning of america,misc d,internal quotation marks omitted,aff,dep t a contract is one not performable within a year where t he oral options are exercisable by the plaintiff appellant alone,aff without opinion.accordingly,our court has recognized that under new york law,an oral agreement that is not by its terms to be fully performed within one year falls within the statute of frauds if the option to terminate rests with the plaintiff alone.see zaitsev salomon,cir if performance within one year depends upon an act solely within the control of the party seeking to enforce the oral agreement,the statute of frauds remains applicable.
thus,south cherry contention that the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the statute of frauds is applicable where only the plaintiff has the option,without a breach,to end the contract within one year,is without merit.
south cherry also seeks to take the alleged oral agreement between itself and hennessee group outside the statute of frauds by contending a that hg had an option to terminate see south cherry brief on appeal at,b that hg obligations under the agreement could have ended within one year as a result of the collapse of a hedge fund in which south cherry invested see id,and c that its arrangement with hg consisted not of a single contract of indefinite duration,but rather of a series of contracts,each of which was capable of being performed in a year see id.at.these contentions too are merit less.
south cherry contention that hennessee group had the right to terminate the alleged agreement within one year at will,merely by recommending that the investor sell an investment south cherry brief on appeal at,borders on the frivolous.recommendations are not commands.although south cherry states that it would have been unreasonable for it not to follow such a recommendation see south cherry reply brief on appeal at,the fact remains that the right to decide whether to sell belonged to south cherry and south cherry alone.and the complaint alleged that hennessee group promised south cherry that it would continue to perform due diligence on funds invested in by south cherry.complaint.thus,according to the complaint description of the agreement,hg could not fully perform its obligations merely by recommending the sale of a previously recommended fund if south cherry chose to continue to invest in that fund,hg could end the agreement only by breaching it.
nor is there merit in south cherry contention that the statute of frauds did not apply because a hedge fund could go out of business within a year,an event which would necessarily terminate the agreement between south cherry and hg south cherry brief on appeal at.the complaint contains no allegation that the parties agreed that the contract would end upon dissolution of a hedge fund.nor can such a provision reasonably be inferred,given,inter alia,that south cherry,on hg recommendations,invested in more than one such fund see,complaint.the alleged agreement provides no basis for either an inference that if any one of the funds in which south cherry invested failed,hennessee group would be relieved of its obligation to perform ongoing due diligence on the other funds in which south cherry invested,or an inference that if any one such fund failed,south cherry would be required to sell all of its other funds.
finally,we reject south cherry contention that i t has long been the law in new york that an agreement of the type alleged in the amended complaint is a series of independent contracts,each of which could be performed within one year.south cherry brief on appeal at citing nat nal service stations,wolf,nat nal emphasis ours.nat nal involved an arrangement between a plaintiff gas station owner and defendant gasoline distributors the arrangement was that if the plaintiff would order its gasoline through the defendants and if the defendants accepted those orders,the defendants would give the plaintiff a discounted price.the court noted a that the plaintiff was not obligated to place any order with the defendants,and b that if the plaintiff did place an order,the defendants were not obligated to accept it.thus,the agreement was clearly one at will and for no definite or specific time and thus by its terms did not of necessity extend beyond one year from the time of its making.at,at.the court concluded that w e are confronted with an alleged contract by the terms of which neither party was bound to do anything at any time,and consequently there is nothing in its terms to bring it within the statute of frauds.id.at,at.the arrangement in nat nal bears no resemblance to the contract alleged here,in which a hennessee group agreed to perform due diligence before recommending a hedge fund to south cherry,b south cherry,upon investing in any fund,became obligated to pay hg annually of the amount invested in that fund for so long as south cherry held that investment,and c hennessee group agreed to perform continuing due diligence with respect to any such fund as long as it was held by south cherry.
in sum,we conclude that because the possibility of performance of the alleged oral agreement within one year depended solely on the will and actions of south cherry,the party seeking to enforce the agreement,the district court correctly ruled that south cherry contract claim was barred by the statute of frauds.
b.the securities fraud claims 
the element of scienter 
to state a claim on which relief can be granted under b and rule,a plaintiff must plead,inter alia,that in connection with the purchase or sale of securities,the defendant made a false representation as to a material fact,or omitted material information,and acted with scienter.see,tellabs,makor issues rights,d chill general electric,cir chill in re time warner.securities litigation,cir,cert.denied,d.the supreme court has defined scienter as a mental state embracing intent to deceive,manipulate,or defraud.tellabs,at.quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d.
prior to the enactment of the pslra,this court had held that in order to plead an intent to deceive,the complaint must allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent,acito imcera group,cir see,shields citytrust bancorp,cir in re time warner.securities litigation,at,and that such an inference could be drawn from allegations of facts showing that the defendant had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,see,acito imcera group,at shields citytrust bancorp,at.motive,we observed,could be shown by pointing to the concrete benefits that could be realized from one or more of the allegedly misleading statements or nondisclosures opportunity could be shown by alleging the means used and the likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged.id.at.this test is generally met when corporate insiders a re alleged to have misrepresented to the public material facts about the corporation performance or prospects in order to keep the stock price artificially high while they sold their own shares at a profit.novak,at.but in attempting to show that a defendant had fraudulent intent,it is not sufficient to allege goals that are possessed by virtually all corporate insiders,such as the desire to maintain a high credit rating for the corporation or otherwise sustain the appearance of corporate profitability or the success of an investment,or the desire to maintain a high stock price in order to increase executive compensation.see,san leandro emergency medical group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir chill,at acito imcera group,at.
this court has also long held that the scienter element can be satisfied by a strong showing of reckless disregard for the truth.see,lanza drexel,cir en banc rolf blyth,eastman dillon,cir.rolf,cert.denied,d sec mcnulty,cir,cert.denied,d novak,at,atsi communications,shaar fund,cir.see also tellabs,at.every court of appeals that has considered the issue has held that a plaintiff may meet the scienter requirement for civil liability under b and rule by showing that the defendant acted either intentionally or recklessly the supreme court itself has not yet decided whether a showing of reckless behavior is sufficient.
by reckless disregard for the truth,we mean conscious,a state of mind approximating actual intent,and not merely a heightened form of negligence,novak,at internal quotation marks omitted emphases ours.in elaborating as to what may constitute recklessness in the context of a private securities fraud action,we have referred to conduct that at the least is highly unreasonable and which represents an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care to the extent that the danger was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it,in re.securities litigation,cir quoting rolf,at emphasis ours or to evidence that the defendants failed to review or check information that they had a duty to monitor,or ignored obvious signs of fraud,and hence should have known that they were misrepresenting material facts,novak,at emphases added.an egregious refusal to see the obvious,or to investigate the doubtful,may in some cases give rise to an inference of recklessness.chill,at internal quotation marks omitted emphases added see,sec mcnulty,at defendant corporate officer who prepared and proceeded to file documents with the sec containing statements whose veracity he himself had questioned,had had an obvious duty to verify the suspicious information.
in passing the pslra,congress adopted a substantive standard modeled upon the pleading standard of the second circuit,novak,at quoting legislative history,insofar as we had applied a strong inference test see part.below,although it did not adopt our gloss for the pleading of intent or our alternative standard of recklessness,see novak,at.thus,we reasoned that,under the pslra,litigants and courts need not and should not employ or rely on magic words such as motive and opportunity with respect to intent but that,in accordance with our prior cases,a strong inference of the requisite state of mind 
may arise where the complaint sufficiently alleges that the defendants benefited in a concrete and personal way from the purported fraud engaged in deliberately illegal behavior knew facts or had access to information suggesting that their public statements were not accurate or failed to check information they had a duty to monitor 
see also id.at.
in novak,we also noted that there are limits to the scope of liability for failure adequately to monitor the allegedly fraudulent behavior of others.id.at.in chill,for example,we held that the allegation that a parent company had failed to interpret its subsidiary unprecedented and dramatically increasing profitability in a particular form of trading as a sign of problems,and thus had failed to investigate further,did not adequately plead recklessness amounting to scienter.see at.in decker,cir,we held that the allegation of a accountant failure to identify problems in a company internal controls and accounting practices was not sufficient.for recklessness on the part of a accountant to satisfy ernst ernst requirement of scienter,it must approximate an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.id.
pslra pleading requirements 
as a general matter,t o survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.iqbal.at quoting bell atlantic twombly,d twombly emphasis ours see also iqbal.at the twombly pleading standard applies to all civil actions internal quotation marks omitted.determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief will be a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.iqbal
