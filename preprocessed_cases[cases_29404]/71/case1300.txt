background 
marvin schwan marvin founded sse in marshall,minnesota,in as a milk processing operation.sse subsequently expanded,first to become a cafe and an ice cream manufacturer,and eventually into a profitable provider of both home and retail delivery of selected frozen foods.by the early,sse had become a sizable producer,wholesaler,and retailer of food products employing about people.sse operations included both international and domestic sales,totaling approximately billion in and billion in.as of,sse top management team consisted of president marvin schwan,a tax accountant,a director of marketing,a general counsel,a controller,a national sales manager,and a manufacturing manager.
sse is a privately held company capitalized with two classes of stock,voting of sse equity capital and nonvoting of the equity capital.the stock is not listed on any stock exchange and is not publicly traded.under the company,sse has the refusal on all sales or transfers of common stocks held by certain stockholders,based on a fair market value transfer price.
in december,sse nonvoting stock split to,increasing the number of nonvoting shares from to.in addition,marvin,sse president,purchased newly issued voting shares.he contributed of these shares to the preexisting marvin schwan revocable trust and the remaining shares to a newly created great great grandchildren trust trust.as of the december,valuation date,a total of shares of voting shares including the recently issued and nonvoting shares were issued and outstanding.
marvin died unexpectedly on may,at the age of,leaving sse without its founder and president.at the time of marvin death,voting shares and shares were held in the marvin schwan revocable trust.in accordance with marvin schwan estate plan,a charitable foundation known as the king foundation received the shares owned by this revocable trust,which comprised of outstanding sse stock.sse redeemed the king foundation shares pursuant to a february,amended redemption agreement.
the plaintiffs are marvin four children and three of their spouses.on december,the plaintiffs established separate trusts for the primary benefit of their respective children,using sse shares that marvin had previously distributed to his children.plaintiffs lorrie,david,and paul each gifted shares of nonvoting stock to their respective trusts,splitting their gifts with their spouses pursuant to.plaintiff mark gifted shares of sse.
in june,the plaintiffs employed a firm called business valuation consultants also known as gray to value sse shares.gray valued sse at per share as of the december,gift date.based on this valuation,each plaintiff filed a gift tax return reporting a gift of,a unified credit of,a tax gst exemption of,and a tax of.
in,in the midst of litigation unrelated to the present tax matter,the plaintiffs retained willamette management associates willamette to appraise the company value though that litigation settlement was based on a value of per share,the willamette appraisal valued sse at per share as of december.
in july,as a result of this lower valuation,the plaintiffs filed for a claim for refund and request for abatement with the irs,seeking restoration of their respective unified credits in the amount of,a restoration of their respective gst exemptions in the amount of each,and a gift tax refund of.
in,several of the plaintiffs gifted and donated additional sse shares to various recipients.these transactions led to disputed calculations of the plaintiffs gift taxes and income taxes based upon the disputed value of sse shares as of december.the court of federal claims valued the shares at as of december,as urged by the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs income and gift taxes for were then recalculated based on this value,and the government has not appealed the court of federal claims ruling.for the purposes of this appeal,then,only the december,valuation remains relevant.
proceedings before the court of federal claims 
the challenge facing both the court of federal claims and this court is the determination of the fair market value of sse nonvoting stock as of december.both the plaintiffs and the government employed the assistance of valuation experts.the government retained herbert spiro,while the plaintiffs retained shannon pratt.pratt was the founder of willamette,the firm that had assessed sse market value during the unrelated litigation in.
the court of federal claims evaluated and compared the two experts valuations carefully and with respect to the december,accepted some assessments proposed by each of the experts before reaching its final determination.see helvering grocery.lukens commissioner,cir.the court of federal claims approached this challenge within the statutory and regulatory framework established by the treasury regulations.under this framework,property without a market value is assigned the value that it would obtain in an market transaction between a buyer and a seller,each of whom is trying to maximize profits.see estate of klauss comm r,memo,cch,wl.furthermore,a gift of property is valued as of the date of transfer,a,and the value of the gift is determined by the value of the property passing from the donor,not the property value received by the donee.reg.a.
both spiro for the government and pratt for the plaintiffs applied blended methodologies to the valuation task,using both a market approach and an income approach to valuation,deriving a weighted average of the two indicated values,and then applying various discount factors the court of federal claims accepted spiro application of the two valuation methodologies and pratt assessment of the appropriate discount factors to arrive at its own conclusion,valuing sse at per share as of december.see lukens,at.
the market approach to valuation rests upon the assumption that similar investments should obtain similar values.the key to this approach is therefore the identification of comparable publicly traded guideline companies and the application of those companies financial fundamentals to those of sse.spiro and pratt agreed on the propriety of this method and upon the categories of relevant financial factors.their primary disagreements lay in the weight assigned to different factors and in the relationship between sse specifics,leadership and leverage to those of the guideline companies.after calculating market pricing multiples based upon guideline company quoted trading prices and financial data,both experts adjusted for risk factors that affected the company as a whole pratt assessment of these risks was far more pessimistic than was spiro.
the income approach stems from the proposition that the value of a corporation is given by a discounted cash flow analysis of its future profit streams.the application of this approach,as both experts explained,requires the determination of a suitable discount rate,the projection of future cash flows and profits,and the identification of relevant risk factors.once again,the court of federal claims found spiro application of this methodology more reliable than pratt.
taken together,spiro assessed per share values of using the income approach and using the market approach,prior to discounting for lack of marketability and for lack of voting rights.he then explained that the income approach was the more reliable of the two,and proposed a weighted average to arrive at a valuation of per share for minority nonvoting sse stock,prior to discounting.
pratt did not specify share prices under the different methods.he did,however,calculate enterprise values of billion under the income approach and billion under the market approach.he also applied an admittedly less reliable transaction approach,proposed a weighted average,and derived an enterprise value of approximately billion or per share,also prior to discounting for lack of marketability and for lack of voting rights.
as noted,the court of federal claims considered both the numbers suggested by the experts and the justifications offered for those numbers,and found spiro application of this methodology to be more reliable than pratt.the court of federal claims thus adopted a valuation of before considering the necessary discount factors.
the value had to be discounted for lack of marketability.both experts relied on two sources of empirical data for aid in quantifying the discount factor discounts on sales of restricted shares of publicly traded companies and discounts on private transactions prior to initial public offerings ipos.based on these studies and on an examination of the perceived risks facing a potential investor in sse stock,pratt concluded that a discount for lack of marketability was appropriate.spiro concluded that a discount was justified.
the court of federal claims found pratt analysis of these factors more persuasive than spiro,but nevertheless adjusted it upward to arrive at a percent discount for lack of marketability as of december.both experts agreed that a further discount for the lack of voting rights was appropriate.the court of federal claims accepted this assessment,applied a combined discount factor of to its undiscounted valuation of,and arrived at a valuation of per share of sse,as of december.the plaintiffs appeal this determination.
the court of federal claims ordered the parties to reach agreement on the plaintiffs tax liabilities,and the refund due to lorrie and jeffrey based upon valuations of per share as of december,and per share as of december.on november,the court of federal claims ordered each of the plaintiffs to pay in gift tax,plus in interest due as of the date of the order and in gift tax,plus in interest due as of the date of the order.the court of federal claims also ordered the government to refund to lorrie and jeffrey against their income tax,plus in interest due as of the date of the order.the plaintiffs timely appealed.we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under a.

this distinction,and the standard of review that we apply to valuation,are not unique to this court.see,lukens,at the tax court determination of the fair market value of the timeshare units is a finding of fact reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.morris comm r,cir determination of the fair market value of certain property is a factual one and should not be reversed on appeal unless clearly erroneous.
the plaintiffs do not appeal the court of federal claims fundamental legal determinations concerning the appropriate standards for valuation,such as the use of an transaction as a benchmark,valuation as of date of transfer,or valuation as the property passed from the donor,rather than to the donee.the court of federal claims framework for valuation rested upon sound legal principles.valuation of property for which there is no market is determined by considering the company net worth,earnings potential,capacity to pay dividends,and other relevant factors.reg.f.revenue ruling,wl,which is widely accepted as setting forth the appropriate criteria to consider in determining fair market value,estate of newhouse comm r,wl,identifies eight such relevant factors the nature of the business and the history of the enterprise from its inception the economic outlook in general and the condition and outlook of the specific industry in particular the book value of the stock and the financial condition of the business the earning capacity of the company the capacity whether or not the enterprise has goodwill or other intangible value sales of the stock and the size of the block of stock to be valued and the market price of freely traded stocks of corporations engaged in the same or a similar line of business.in addition,when valuing minority interest stock of a corporation,the application of certain discounts may be warranted to reflect the stock lack of marketability lack of voting rights.cent.trust united states.both experts presented valuations consistent with these principles.the court of federal claims valuation methodology,which drew upon those of the experts,was therefore correct as a matter of law.
the plaintiffs contend that the court of federal claims failure to consider sse actual earnings results in and in assessing the valuation is a legal error subject to de novo review,while the court of federal claims underassessment of the significance of one particular risk potential triggering of the redemption a clearly erroneous factual determination.
all of the plaintiffs arguments on appeal therefore stem from a single source the confluence of several risk factors that actually occurred during the years and.the willamette report described several risk factors relevant to understanding the ways that sse differed from otherwise comparable companies.these risk factors included reliance on a home delivery route system thin management ranks reliance on a key management figure,marvin schwan the risk of food contamination the competitors greater human resources sse inability to invest in a national advertising campaign,based on its lack of a nationally recognizable brand name and the demographics of its customer base less diversity in product offerings than the guideline companies and the relatively small size of sse board of directors.
by the end of,at least two of these risks had materialized marvin schwan died on may,and an outbreak of salmonella in october led to a product recall,a plant closure,and a class action lawsuit.in other words,several events that the appraisers had identified as foreseeable though unlikely risks in had actually occurred by.these unexpected occurrences led to declines in sse sales and income during both and,and account at least in part for the drop in the company value between the and valuation dates.
the plaintiffs contend that the actual occurrence of these events suggests that spiro underestimated their ex ante probability in his valuation,and that pratt assessments were therefore more reasonable.as evidence of the effect of these underassessed probabilities,the plaintiffs point to the disparities between spiro projected revenues and gross profits for and and sse actual revenues and gross profits for those years.the plaintiffs find it highly significant that spiro overestimated revenues by and,and gross profits by and.the plaintiffs also challenge spiro assertion that considering actual and revenues when determining a valuation would have been inappropriate appraisal practice.
the court of federal claims addressed this challenge in footnote of its opinion 
plaintiff reliance on sse actual financial results for and to cast doubt on defendant appraisal must be similarly rejected.although the federal circuit in krapf,at,held that date transactions may provide a parameter or give rise to an inference of the earlier value,and should not be absolutely barred from consideration,consideration of financial results here would be improper.as the government points out,if such a technique were accepted,there would be little need to resort to the courts in valuation cases.the mere passage of time,together with the accumulation of date data,would convert the valuation process form an inexact science to an exact science.estate of gillet commissioner,memo,cch,wl.
