this case involves claims that a pharmaceutical company and three of its directors violated federal securities laws.plaintiffs primary allegation is that inspire pharmaceuticals,committed securities fraud by overstating the prospects for an experimental drug that the company was developing to treat dry eye disease.when we apply the careful scrutiny required by congress in the private securities litigation reform act of and by the supreme court in tellabs,makor issues rights,d,we conclude that plaintiffs allegations are lacking.in particular,plaintiffs fail to raise the strong inference of wrongful intent that is necessary to support their securities fraud claims.we thus affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint.
inspire is in the business of developing prescription drugs to treat diseases of the eyes,lungs,and sinuses.one of the company flagship products is diquafosol tetrasodium diquafosol,a treatment for dry eye disease.inspire designed diquafosol both to prevent and to heal the damage that dry eye disease causes to the cornea of the eye.eye drops,in contrast,provide only relief of dry eye symptoms.
before inspire could market diquafosol,the company had to demonstrate the drug safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the food and drug administration.the fda generally requires drug companies to conduct clinical trials with predetermined goals,or endpoints,that must be satisfied.endpoints may be either subjective or objective.a subjective endpoint is a goal relating to a symptom experienced by the patient,such as itchiness of the eye.an objective endpoint is a goal relating to a verifiable test.
a common objective test for dry eye drugs is known as corneal staining,a procedure in which a fluorescent dye is used to highlight damaged areas of the cornea.the result of the test or its score varies from zero to five depending on the number of highlighted areas.a score of zero is known as corneal clearing.clearly,a showing that diquafosol causes an improvement in patients corneal staining scores would help the drug chances for fda approval.even better would be a demonstration that diquafosol causes patients number of stained corneal areas to fall to zero,thus achieving corneal clearing.
to that end,inspire performed a series of clinical trials for diquafosol.of significance here is study,a phase iii trial designed to demonstrate efficacy in a large patient population.diquafosol met its primary objective endpoint in study patients using diquafosol showed a statistically significant improvement in their corneal staining scores.importantly,a statistically significant number of patients also exhibited corneal clearing.but diquafosol failed to meet its subjective endpoint.while patients using the drug showed improvement with respect to a subjective sensation of a foreign body in the subjective results were not statistically significant.
with these results in hand,inspire sought approval to market diquafosol by submitting a new drug application to the fda in june.the fda had no written guidance for approving dry eye treatments at the time,and the agency requirements for approval were not altogether clear.it had been thought historically that the fda would only approve a dry eye treatment that met both an objective endpoint and a subjective endpoint in two trials.but the only prescription treatment for dry eye ever to be approved,restasis,had gained the fda blessing in despite failing to meet that rigorous standard.thus,inspire surmised that diquafosol might be approved despite missing its subjective endpoint in study.
the fda responded by telling inspire that it had to conduct at least one more study to obtain approval.in private communications,the fda gave inspire two options.inspire could conduct two additional trials that met both an objective endpoint and a subjective endpoint.or it could conduct one additional trial that time as a primary corneal clearing that inspire had achieved in study.inspire chose the latter option and commenced study in june with a primary endpoint of corneal clearing.
inspire announced publicly that it was performing study.but inspire was regarding the details of the trial,as investment analysts noted at the time.in particular,inspire stated that it would not disclose the primary endpoint of study because the company did not want to divulge the fda requirements for approval to the company competitors,who could have used that information to plan their own studies.
however,inspire did make a handful of public comments regarding study.in prospectuses for stock offerings in july and november,the company stated that it had a clear understanding of the fda additional requirement for approval of diquafosol.inspire also referred to study as a confirmatory phase iii trial in those prospectuses and other public statements.inspire ceo and director christy shaffer further expressed in a conference call with investors and analysts on may,that study design was very similar to that of study.and shaffer stated in another conference call on november,that the primary endpoint of study was a corneal staining endpoint.despite the fact that inspire had declined to disclose the exact endpoint of study,and despite the fact that inspire also had announced that study had achieved corneal clearing,some stock analysts speculated that the primary endpoint of study was only a relative improvement in corneal staining scores and that study was likely to meet that.
while study was ongoing,shaffer and two other inspire directors sold some of their shares in inspire.shaffer sold shares in july,shares in august,and shares in november together,about of her total holdings of shares and vested options.also in november,gregory mossinghoff sold shares of his total holdings,and gary novack sold shares.despite the sales,all three of the directors actually increased their net holdings in inspire while study was pending through the acquisition of vested stock options.
on february,inspire announced the results of study.diquafosol had failed to meet its primary endpoint,a statistically significant amount of corneal clearing.inspire stock price fell from on february to on february.on february,this action ensued.
and stephanie cozzarelli,robert and carole swoboda,and investmentgesellschaft a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of purchasers of inspire stock.plaintiffs alleged numerous violations of federal securities laws by inspire,shaffer,mossinghoff,and novack.in particular,plaintiffs claimed that defendants had violated sections b and a of the securities exchange act of,as well as rule,by fraudulently misleading investors as to study likelihood of success.see b,a.plaintiffs also alleged that defendants had violated sections,a,and of the securities act of,a,by similarly misleading investors about study in the prospectuses relating to the company july and november stock offerings.plaintiffs further claimed that shaffer had committed insider trading in violation of section of the exchange act.
on defendants motion,the magistrate judge issued a recommendation that the complaint be dismissed.see in re inspire.sec,d.applying the heightened pleading standards of the private securities litigation reform act,the judge held that plaintiffs claims under the exchange act failed because plaintiffs had not established a strong inference of scienter.see id.at.further,plaintiffs entire action warranted dismissal because plaintiffs had insufficiently pled the requisite element that was common to all of plaintiffs claims a false or misleading statement by defendants.see id.at.the district court accepted the magistrate recommendation and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.see id.at.this appeal followed.
we begin with plaintiffs claims under section b of the exchange act and rule.those provisions act to protect the integrity of the market in securities and prohibit fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.see b.a successful securities fraud plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter upon which the plaintiff justifiably relied that proximately caused the plaintiff damages.teachers ret.of hunter,cir internal quotations omitted.to prove the necessary mental state of scienter,negligence is not enough.a plaintiff must show either intentional misconduct or such severe recklessness that the danger of misleading investors was either known to the defendant or so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir internal quotations omitted.
these substantive elements of a securities fraud claim are demanding.but the potential liability for defendants also can be significant.as a result,there is a danger that some exchange act suits seek only valuable settlements and fees rather than success on the merits.indeed,securities fraud actions,if not adequately contained,can be employed abusively to impose substantial costs on companies and individuals whose conduct conforms to the law.tellabs,makor issues rights,d.
to eliminate such abuse,congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act of,stat.see tellabs.at.through the e xacting pleading requirements of the pslra,congress charged courts to be vigilant in preventing meritless securities fraud claims from reaching the discovery phase of litigation.id.at.in particular,congress required that plaintiffs make specific allegations of false statements or else face dismissal.see b.and congress instructed courts to dismiss any securities fraud complaint that does not state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with scienter.id.b 
the supreme court in tellabs underscored that meritorious private actions to enforce federal antifraud securities laws are an essential supplement to criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement actions.at.but it also made clear that raising a strong inference of scienter is no small burden.the court recognized that the pslra unequivocally raised the bar for pleading scienter.id.at internal quotations omitted.and in defining just how strong an inference of scienter must be,the court gave that standard teeth,using adjectives like cogent,compelling,persuasive,effective,and powerful.id.at.the court held that the test applied by the seventh circuit only that a reasonable person could infer that scienter not demand a strong enough inference of scienter to satisfy the statutory language.see id.at.instead,the court held that an inference of scienter can only be compelling,and it is weighed against the opposing inferences that may be drawn from the facts in their entirety.see id.
tellabs therefore prescribed the following test a complaint will survive,we hold,only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.id.at.thus,when the facts as a whole more plausibly suggest that the defendant acted even than with intent or severe recklessness,the action must be dismissed.only then,the court held,will the pslra serve its purpose of derailing frivolous,litigation.id.at.
to sum up,tellabs recognized that securities fraud actions serve an important only when those actions are meritorious.see id.at.the pslra balances these concerns by requiring courts to sort out the meritorious claims from the abusive ones early in litigation,and tellabs obligates courts do so with care.keeping in mind the duty that congress and the supreme court have thus placed upon us,we turn to the specific allegations of securities fraud in plaintiffs complaint.
the theory underlying plaintiffs securities fraud claims amounts to this inspire and its directors intentionally misled the public to believe that study was likely to succeed,thereby artificially inflating inspire stock price to the financial benefit of the company and the individual directors.to support that theory,plaintiffs allege that certain statements by defendants misled investors regarding the endpoint of study.plaintiffs rely primarily on shaffer statement on a conference call in november that study had a corneal staining endpoint.they also point to statements that study was a confirmatory trial and that study was very similar to study.
the district court held that plaintiffs had not satisfied the pslra because they had not alleged with sufficient particularity that defendants statements were misleading.we agree with the district court that the pslra establishes strict requirements for pleading falsity with specificity and that there is a substantial question as to whether plaintiffs allegations of falsity were adequate.see hunter,at.but we also find it quite the district court did as plaintiffs failed to allege facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter.we therefore assume for the sake of argument that defendants statements were misleading and turn to plaintiffs theory of scienter.
plaintiffs attempt to establish a strong inference of scienter through the following allegations.plaintiffs primary claim is that defendants knew both that the primary endpoint of study was corneal clearing and that corneal clearing was different than corneal staining,so shaffer statement that study had a corneal staining endpoint must have been intentionally false.plaintiffs also claim that corneal clearing is almost impossible to on quotations from anonymous doctors who worked on studies and that defendants therefore knew that study would likely fail.plaintiffs also argue that defendants had multiple financial motivations to commit fraud.plaintiffs allege that inspire was losing money in and needed to raise capital,and they allege that shaffer compensation was tied to the performance of the company and diquafosol.plaintiffs also claim that the individual defendants sold large numbers of their own inspire shares while study was pending.when all of these allegations are combined,plaintiffs contend that a strong inference of scienter emerges.
we disagree.plaintiffs proposed inference of scienter depends on stringing together a series of isolated allegations without considering the necessary context.plaintiffs insist that we should rely solely on their discrete allegations,and they urge us not to look beyond the complaint for additional facts.in particular,the complaint quotes selectively from various reports by investment analysts,and plaintiffs argue that we should not consider the reports in full.that argument is erroneous.while we must accept plaintiffs factual allegations as true,the supreme court in tellabs held that we should not decide the issue of scienter by viewing individual allegations in isolation.see.at.rather,we must examine the facts as a whole,including facts found in documents incorporated into the complaint by reference.id.furthermore,plaintiffs nowhere challenge the authenticity of the analyst reports attached to defendants motion to dismiss and cited in plaintiffs complaint.our consideration of such documents is undoubtedly proper.see am.chiropractic ass trigon healthcare,cir.
the content of these analyst reports makes clear why plaintiffs urge us not to look beyond the complaint itself the reports demonstrate the fundamental weakness of plaintiffs case.the reports reveal that inspire never confirmed the primary endpoint of study publicly and that the company even expressly stated that it would not announce the specifics of study for competitive reasons.as morgan stanley explained in august inspire does not want to disclose details,such as endpoints,that its competitors could use in their development programs.in addition,that same report by morgan stanley makes clear that inspire had achieved clearing of corneal staining in study and had announced that result to the public.finally,the analysts did opine that the endpoint for study was a reduction in corneal staining scores.but the analysts also admitted to inspire refusal to disclose the opinions were just that opinion,assum ption,and belief.
these facts suggest an inference that defendants withheld information from the market with the intent to protect inspire competitive interests.as the analyst reports suggest,inspire had expended substantial time and resources to learn the fda requirements for approval of a dry eye treatment,and the company did not want to divulge that information to its rivals.it is beyond our purview to determine whether that decision was correct as a matter of business judgment.but a decision to seek a competitive advantage,whether wise or not,is quite different from an intent to deceive.indeed,plaintiffs do not suggest that withholding information to protect one competitive interests is anything other than a legitimate business call.rather,plaintiffs suggest only that it is the wrong inference to draw from the facts alleged.
we thus have two competing inferences based on the facts as a whole.plaintiffs argue that the facts support a nefarious intent,and defendants argue that the facts support an innocent one.under the pslra and tellabs,we must weigh those competing inferences and determine whether plaintiffs inference of scienter is cogent and at least as compelling as defendants inference of a legitimate business judgment.at.as explained below,we conclude that no strong inference of scienter exists because the inference that defendants acted with the nonfraudulent intent to protect their competitive advantage is more powerful and compelling than the inference that defendants acted with an intent to deceive.
upon examination,inspire legitimate business motivations explain each of the facts alleged in the complaint more convincingly than plaintiffs tenuous theory of wrongful intent.we shall address each of those allegations in turn,but we first note that plaintiffs have not alleged the existence of any internal documents from inspire or other direct statements contradicting the inference that defendants acted with a lawful intent based on their competitive interests.while that sort of allegation is not necessary to support an inference of scienter,see tellabs.at,plaintiffs do have the difficult task of establishing a countervailing,cogent inference of scienter through indirect and circumstantial allegations.
plaintiffs scienter theory depends principally on shaffer statement that study had a corneal staining endpoint.plaintiffs insist that shaffer was intentionally lying because she knew both that the endpoint of study was corneal clearing and that there was an irreconcilable distinction between the terms corneal clearing and corneal staining.but that argument ignores reality.in fact,the two terms are more or less at least interchangeable enough to dispel a strong inference of fraud.corneal staining is a procedure,and corneal clearing is one possible result of that procedure.a corneal staining endpoint is thus a general,descriptive phrase that encompasses a spectrum of possible endpoints,including corneal clearing.it is difficult to infer intent to deceive from shaffer reference to the general phrase rather than the specific result at the end of the spectrum.furthermore,shaffer had a perfectly legitimate reason to refer to corneal staining generally rather than to corneal clearing in of inspire competitive interests.shaffer reference to a corneal staining endpoint therefore supports at most an inference of imprecise or even negligent use of language,not an inference of scienter.
we also find unpersuasive plaintiffs other primary allegation supporting its theory of scienter.plaintiffs argue that defendants knew that the corneal clearing endpoint of study was almost impossible to achieve and thus acted with wrongful intent by leading investors to believe that study would succeed.again,the facts in their entirety belie plaintiffs theory.morgan stanley report in august makes clear that study had achieved corneal clearing.that fact bears more significantly on defendants outlook regarding study than statements from anonymous doctors who said that corneal clearing was nearly impossible to achieve.based on the fact that defendants achieved corneal clearing in study and then set out to achieve it again in study,it is much more likely that defendants thought that study would succeed than that they thought it would fail.further proving the point,much of the complaint portrays diquafosol as the lead development product on which inspire future as a company depended.consolidated class action complaint.it is improbable that inspire would stake its existence on a drug and a clinical trial that the company thought was doomed to failure.plaintiffs inference of fraud based on the supposed impossibility of corneal clearing is thus not even plausible,much less convincing.
plaintiffs conclusory allegations regarding defendants motives to defraud also lack merit.plaintiffs claim that inspire was motivated to make public statements about diquafosol that were overly optimistic because the company needed to raise money to fund its operations.they also claim that shaffer had an incentive to puff up the outlook of study falsely because her compensation was tied to the company performance.but a strong inference of fraud does not arise merely from seeking capital to support a risky venture.indeed,the motivations to raise capital or increase one own compensation are common to every company and thus add little to an inference of fraud.see ottmann hanger orthopedic group,cir.all investments carry risk,particularly in a field like biopharmaceuticals.if we inferred scienter from every bullish statement by a pharmaceutical company that was trying to raise funds,we would choke off the lifeblood of innovation in medicine by fueling frivolous what congress sought to avoid by enacting the pslra.furthermore,the fact that some analysts relied on defendants hopeful statements to the analysts admitted they were study would succeed adds little to an inference of scienter.speculation by investors and subsequent buyers remorse can not support an exchange act suit alone.
finally,the individual defendants sales of inspire stock were not unusual or suspicious and thus do not add support to an inference of scienter.in re pec solutions.sec,cir.when we consider the directors total number of shares and vested stock options as stated in sec filings,the stock sales highlighted by plaintiffs were modest to de minimis novack,mossinghoff,and shaffer sold,and of their holdings,respectively.see id.at teachers ret.of hunter,cir.moreover,the total holdings of each defendant increased while study was ongoing,hardly suggesting that the defendants sought to dump their shares at an inflated price.and as the district court observed,both mossinghoff and novack resigned from inspire around the time of their sales,indicating that their departures,rather than an intent to defraud,may have prompted them to sell their stock.in re inspire.sec,d,internal citation omitted 
thus,even when we accept all of plaintiffs factual allegations as true,the record as a whole does not support a strong inference of scienter.the most persuasive inference is that defendants acted with a lawful intent to protect their competitive intent that plaintiffs do not suggest is illegitimate.and that inference is more compelling than the inference that defendants acted with an intent to mislead or deceive.the district court therefore properly dismissed plaintiffs claims under section b and rule.plaintiffs claims under sections a and of the exchange act are derivative of their section b and rule claims,so the a and claims were properly dismissed as well.see a,hunter,at carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.
we turn next to plaintiffs claims under the securities act.sections and a of the securities act apply to registration statements and prospectuses for securities,respectively.both provisions prohibit materially false statements or omissions,although proof of scienter is not required.see,herman maclean huddleston,d newcome esrey,cir en banc.
plaintiffs claim that inspire and shaffer violated sections and a because the company registration statement and prospectuses for its july and november stock offerings were false and misleading the prospectuses stated that inspire had a clear understanding of the fda additional requirement for the regulatory approval of diquafosol.and the prospectuses referred to study as a confirmatory phase iii trial.plaintiffs allege that these statements were misleading because inspire failed to disclose that the primary endpoint of study,cornea
