background 
akorn financial reports and sec filings 
akorn is a corporation that manufactures and sells diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals.during the time relevant to this proceeding,akorn customers included both pharmaceutical wholesalers and direct or customers.however,the company profits were primarily from five major wholesale customers,which amounted to approximately of its total sales and of its gross accounts receivable as of december.akorn customers would generally order products and be invoiced according to varying rates,corporate credits,and payment schedules.invoices were typically twenty to thirty pages long.payment schedules varied between thirty and ninety days,with larger wholesalers generally enjoying longer payment terms than direct customers.akorn classified its payment schedules as current,thirty to sixty days past due,sixty to ninety days past due,and over ninety days past due.akorn,however,did not charge interest on overdue bills,thus minimizing the incentive for customers to remit payments in a timely manner.a customer payment to akorn was accompanied by a remittance advice of up to lines in length.a remittance advice explained the payment and,in some instances,asserted claims for a variety of credits that could apply to the order.
in the late,akorn invoicing system was a labyrinth in which the company billed customers and processed cash remittances and credit claims against invoices at three different finance offices that used different computer programs and mechanisms.in,in an effort to centralize its finance,billing,and accounts receivable records,akorn began using a software program called macola.akorn use of macola was,as the software proved incapable of tracking the age of akorn outstanding invoices,monitoring debits and credits applied to a particular customer account,and handling data management.in,akorn began using a edwards software package.rather than migrating its billing files from the macola software to the edwards software,akorn recorded new receivables on the edwards software,but the company did not transfer the existing accounts.the result was a parallel system of bill tracking that used two different software modules.
petitioner rita mcconville served as chief financial officer cfo for akorn from february,to march.as cfo,mcconville reported to akorn president and chief executive officer ceo,floyd benjamin.mcconville supervised akorn corporate controller and its finance departments,and she worked with akorn auditor,deloitte touche llp deloitte.as cfo,mcconville was also,along with akorn corporate controller,responsible for filing akorn financial documents with the sec.
on february,akorn auditor,deloitte,sent a letter to its board of directors,alerting the board to anticipated problems in akorn financial statements for the fiscal year ending on december.the report identified as particularly problematic akorn management failure to review the accounts receivable in detail,misapplication of credits and payments to customer accounts,and failure to collect outstanding balances effectively and efficiently.the report also included a section entitled management response,which was drafted in part by mcconville,stating that management had begun an effort to reconcile all customer accounts,with a goal of significant collection resolution by june,and complete cleanup by august.
later in,the disarray in akorn financial department boiled over when a billing discrepancy arose between akorn and its largest customer,cardinal health incorporated,which represented of akorn net sales and of its gross accounts receivable.akorn records based on invoices going back to when the macola software was used showed that cardinal owed akorn approximately million.cardinal records showed that it had a credit balance with akorn of approximately,meaning the variance in the companies books differed by nearly million.the chairman of akorn board of directors and a major stockholder,john kapoor,instructed mcconville and the corporation ceo to meet with cardinal and resolve the billing dispute.mcconville took copies of the largest outstanding invoices to the meeting with cardinal,leaving behind the invoices with smaller balances during the meeting,mcconville presented only the larger outstanding invoices to cardinal for payment.after the meeting,cardinal sent akorn,which it viewed as full payment to settle any debt it owed and creating a credit balance with akorn.akorn,on the other hand,believed that many outstanding cardinal invoices remained unpaid,and a march,letter from ceo benjamin to cardinal stated that there was still a discrepancy of more than million to be reconciled between the akorn records and the cardinal records.it is unclear from the record how the discrepancy of just under million before the meeting jumped to over million after the meeting.
notwithstanding the lingering dispute between cardinal and akorn over the amount of cardinal outstanding balance,if any,mcconville reassured akorn auditor deloitte that the customer accounts were successfully being reconciled and that there was little past due money owing from wholesalers because most of the aging balances were offset by more recent credits mcconville also wrote a press release,dated february,announcing an approximate million profit in akorn results.during february and early march,mcconville also reviewed drafts of the financial statements.
still not satisfied with akorn financial condition,kapoor assigned mcconville to work with a consultant hired by kapoor to conduct a thorough analysis of akorn accounts receivable and to submit a report discussing any potential of the receivables.on march,the consultant submitted a report to kapoor,stating,in relevant part 
the wholesaler accounts have never been worked.we are talking about an accumulation of problems over a or year period.this provides us with a legacy of pages and pages of reports on each of those five accounts,consisting of a maze of transactions including open invoices,partially paid invoices,billbacks,credits for return goods,credits for damaged goods,credits for shipments not received,credits for billing errors,rebate credits,chargeback credits,deductions taken arbitrarily by the wholesaler,situations where the wholesaler used credits multiple times,and unapplied cash.these transactions go back as far as.
emphasis in original.the consultant further concluded that there we re no quick fixes available because n o management reports exist that trend sales,cash,aging,reserves,unbilled,or days sales outstanding.therefore,the could not have been properly monitored.at the end of the day,the consultant concluded that a determination on the collectibility will require a substantial amount of time months and work.although kapoor instructed mcconville to work with the consultant,mcconville maintains that she never viewed the report or discussed its contents before it was submitted to the board of directors.
on march,akorn board of directors removed mcconville from her position as cfo,and demoted her to corporate controller as part of her new duties,mcconville reported to incoming cfo kevin harris,and she was tasked with resolving the billing dispute with cardinal.mcconville also continued her work,the degree to which is disputed by the parties,compiling the figures for akorn fiscal year audit for the financial statements that would be filed with the sec.what is apparent from the record is that mcconville input in the fiscal year financial statements began while she was cfo of akorn as stated,during her tenure as cfo,mcconville frequently reassured akorn auditor,deloitte,that the books would eventually balance out.she also regularly met with deloitte representatives and reviewed preliminary draft figures for the financial statements.according to the commission findings,by mcconville last day as cfo on march,the financial statements were largely completed,and a draft of the form,a document reporting a corporation financial health to the sec,had already been prepared.the commission also found that,as cfo,mcconville reviewed a draft of the form,the filing of which was delayed due to the consultant investigation 
mcconville,among others,signed two management representation letters in connection with deloitte annual audit of the financial statements filed with the form.the first letter,dated february,stated that,to the best of mcconville knowledge other than those disclosed,no events had occurred subsequent to december,that required consideration as adjustments to or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements management believed the credit allowances were adequate to absorb currently estimated uncollectible receivables in the account balances and management had reviewed the financial statements for impairments of akorn assets,and no adjustment to the statements was required notably,mcconville admits that the task of resolving the cardinal billing dispute was far from complete on april.however,the second letter she signed,dated april,stated that there are no events which have occurred subsequent to february,that have a material effect on the financial statements that are in the filing or that should be disclosed in order to keep those statements from being misleading.that same day,akorn filed the form with the sec,reporting a net income of,current assets of as of december,and accounts receivable of,which amounted to approximately of akorn assets.mcconville did not sign the form.
on may,a month after filing the form,akorn filed its quarterly report,form,for the quarter that ended on march.in its form,akorn increased by million its allowance for doubtful accounts,that is accounts with balances unlikely to be recovered.mcconville employment with akorn terminated in july.over a year later,on october,akorn restated its financial statements for and by filing a form.the form stated that akorn had not adequately considered all of the information available with respect to certain disputed receivables in establishing its allowance for uncollectible accounts as of december,and the million increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts should have been recorded at the end of,rather than in the form.at the end of the day,once the financial statements were corrected,akorn sustained a net loss of million in,rather than a gain of million as it had originally reported in its form.
sec proceedings 
on november,the sec instituted proceedings against mcconville and akorn cfo harris.the sec alleged that,as cfo,and later as corporate controller,mcconville mismanagement of akorn financial department caused the corporation to file inaccurate financial statements with the commission in violation of federal securities laws.an administrative law judge alj determined that mcconville and harris were liable,and the alj ordered mcconville to cease and desist and to disgorge nine months of her akorn salary.on review,the commission largely agreed with the alj decision,finding the footnotes to the form should have reported an unquantifiable impairment in akorn accounts receivable and that mcconville lied to deloitte about the financial health of the company,which she failed to monitor properly.the sec concluded that mcconville conduct violated sections b,b and b of the securities exchange act of,b and b,as well as sec rules and.and,although the commission believed disgorgement was unwarranted,it ordered mcconville to cease and desist from further securities violations.this petition for review followed.
ii.analysis 
the securities exchange act of,requires us to give highly deferential,conclusive effect to the commission factual findings,so long as they are supported by substantial evidence in the record.monetta fin,sec,cir.as a congressionally authorized administrative agency,the commission interpretation of the securities exchange act will be upheld,unless the interpretation is contrary to clear congressional intent.united states mead,d see also chevron,nrdc,d.in addition,the commission interpretation of its own regulations promulgated pursuant to the act will be upheld,unless the regulations are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.
a.there is substantial evidence that mcconville violated sec rule.
under section b of the securities exchange act,b,promulgated as securities and exchange commission rule,the commission must show that mcconville made a false statement or omission of material fact with scienter in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.sec maio,cir.
as an initial matter,we briefly address mcconville argument that she can not be primarily liable for the misstatements in akorn because her significant participation in creating the corporate misstatements can not form the basis for rule liability mcconville argument is essentially that despite her substantial involvement in drafting the financial statements,their subsequent fraud on the market can not be attributed to her because she did not sign or physically file the form.this circuit long ago rejected mcconville literal interpretation of rule antifraud provision.see sec holschuh,cir.in holschuh,a corporate officer provided materially misleading information that was ultimately incorporated into offering circulars given to potential investors.the officer argued that rule liability could not be imposed against him because he had no direct contact with investors or editorial control over the contents of the offering circulars.we disagreed,holding that actual or contact with offerees or buyers is not a condition precedent to primary liability for antifraud violations,so long as the requisite intent was established.id.at 
as to the merits of the case against mcconville,the sec concluded the following 
the violations here were significant.mcconville was responsible for misrepresentations and omissions in akorn form,which was filed with the commission and thus made available to investors.as a result of the deficiencies in akorn recordkeeping and internal controls,akorn receivables were overstated,no impairment of the receivables was disclosed,and no reserve was created for customer accounts that represented of the receivables.mcconville made misrepresentations to deloitte in the management representation letters to deloitte,knowing that deloitte would be basing assumptions on those letters in its work on the audit 
we now consider whether there is substantial evidence to support the commission finding that,with the requisite scienter,mcconville breached a duty to disclose an unquantifiable impairment in akorn accounts receivable.given that the loss to akorn investors was inevitable when the form was filed,and only the magnitude of the loss was uncertain,as discussed below,we conclude mcconville failure to disclose the impairment in akorn financial statements violated rule.
mcconville argues that the commission findings regarding the first and third elements of rule liability are not supported by substantial evidence.regarding the first factor whether she made or,more precisely,caused akorn to make material misstatements to investors,mcconville argues that the sec findings are not supported by substantial evidence because she had no obligation to file or cause the form to be filed this argument misses the point,however.as we have stated,the issue is not whether mcconville quite literally delivered the misleading statements to the sec,but whether she caused akorn to make mate
