this case arises from efforts by,world holdings,llc world holdings,to obtain payment on certain bonds issued by appellant,the federal republic of germany germany.germany now appeals the denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.after a careful review,we affirm.
in,germany offered for subscription in the united states million of bearer bonds,called dawes bonds,which were listed on the new york stock exchange and payable in gold dollars in new york city at the offering fiscal agent in the united states.in,germany offered for subscription in the united states million of a second type of bearer bond,called young bonds.the young bonds were also listed on the new york stock exchange and payable in new york city.
both the dawes bonds and the young bonds were backed by the full faith and credit of germany and required germany to maintain sinking funds from various revenue sources.according to world holdings,germany discontinued payments to the sinking funds in june.by july,germany had ceased making interest payments on both the young bonds and the dawes bonds.though germany was in default of its obligations under the bonds,the outbreak of world war ii made impossible any demands for payment or pursuit of remedies under the bonds.
following the war,germany affirmed its liabilities,including the dawes and young bonds.a payment plan was negotiated at the conference on german external debts in london,and on february,germany,the united states,and seventeen other nations signed the london debt agreement lda which resulted in a proposed settlement of most of germany war ii debts,including the bonds also in,a series of measures were enacted relating to the london debt agreement.one of those measures is the agreement between the united states of america and the federal republic of germany regarding certain matters arising from the validation of german dollar bonds the treaty.
in the treaty,the united states and germany agreed that it is in their common interest to provide for the determination of the validity of german dollar bonds in view of the possibility that a large number of such bonds may have been unlawfully acquired during hostilities in germany or soon thereafter,para.another agreement signed in conjunction with the lda,the agreement between the government of the united states of america and the government of the federal republic of germany regarding the validation of dollar bonds of german issue the agreement on validation procedures,provided the procedures by which a bondholder might validate his bonds.the treaty explicitly references the agreement on validation procedures and provides 
no bond,coupon,dividend warrant,renewal certificate,subscription warrant or other secondary instrument shall be enforceable unless and until it shall be validated either by the board for the validation of german bonds in the united states established by the agreement on validation procedures,or by the authorities competent for that purpose in the federal republic.
in order for a bondholder to satisfy the validation requirement of the treaty,he must show,by reference to evidence,that his bonds were held outside germany on january.according to world holdings,the validation requirement came about due to a stolen bond theory,as described in abrey reusch.
after the first world war,and principally between and,a large number of bearer dollar bonds were sold by german enterprises prior to the outbreak of the second world war,many of these dollar bonds had been repurchased and reacquired by the issuers for eventual retirement,and later submitted to meet sinking fund and amortization requirements.such reacquired bonds were retained in germany and no longer represented valid obligations.
during the second world war,it was impossible to present such bonds to the american trustees or paying agents for cancellation.as a consequence,large numbers of these uncancelled bearer dollar bonds,in negotiable form,were held in the vaults of german banks.
after the surrender of germany,russian occupation forces seized the uncancelled,negotiable dollar bonds which they found in the german bank vaults within the area of their control.the face amount of such bonds has been estimated at.these looted bonds were returned to circulation by the russians.
at the same time,other german dollar bonds,amounting to about,were in the legitimate possession of their bona fide purchasers.there was thus a real possibility that the eventual holders of the looted bonds would share the available assets limited available foreign exchange of the german obligors equally with the legitimate bondholders,a large number of whom were nationals of the united states.moreover,the free and open trading in the united states of all german dollar bonds was impeded by the uncertainties arising from the situation described above.
world holdings currently owns or controls a significant number of dawes and young bonds in the original principal amount of and denominations.in december,world holdings demanded payment of its bonds in a letter sent to angela merkel,chancellor of germany,and several ministers of germany germany did not respond.
germany has maintained that the bonds must be submitted for validation before they can be paid.world holdings states that no validation board is currently in existence world holdings further claims that it is not subject to the validation requirement 
world holdings filed this action on january.in its amended complaint,world holdings charges germany with breach of contract based on germany alleged default of its obligation to pay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on world holdings dawes and young bonds.
germany moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that world holdings failure to register its bonds and submit them for validation is fatal to its claims.specifically,germany argued that the treaty precluded an enforcement action in united states courts on bonds that have not been validated.
the district court denied the motion,finding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the action under the exception to the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia or the act,et.this appeal followed 
ii.analysis 
we review de novo the district court decision to deny the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.sinaltrainal,at.
the fsia,enacted in,years after the treaty,establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether a court in this country,state or federal,may exercise jurisdiction over a foreign state.republic of argentina weltover.under the act,a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states and of the states unless one of several statutorily defined exceptions applies.id.at emphasis in original.as the supreme court has held,the fsia is the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.argentine republic amerada hess shipping.
among the fsia exceptions to immunity is the exception of section a,which provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from suit in any case 
in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states.
a.germany concedes that its issuance and sale of bonds in the united states brings it within the exception to the fsia grant of immunity.
despite the application of this exception,germany argues that it is nonetheless immune from suit.the fsia was adopted s ubject to existing international agreements to which the united states was a party at the time of the fsia enactment.the subject to clause,to which we will refer as the treaty exception,applies when international agreements expressly conflic t with the immunity provisions of the fsia.amerada hess,at quoting,at,reprinted in,alteration in original if there is an express conflict between the fsia and such an agreement regarding the amenability of a contracting state to suit in the united states courts,the international agreement prevails.see moore united kingdom,cir see also,at.
the international agreement to which germany points is the treaty,adopted many years prior to the enactment of the fsia.article ii of the treaty states 
no bond,coupon,dividend warrant,renewal certificate,subscription warrant or other secondary instrument referred to in the first sentence of article i above shall be enforceable unless and until it shall be validated either by the board for the validation of german bonds in the united states established by the agreement on validation procedures,or by the authorities competent for that purpose in the federal republic.
art.ii emphasis added.our task is to determine whether the treaty expressly conflicts with the immunity provisions of the fsia,specifically,the exception which serves to abrogate germany immunity.
in so doing,we look to amerada hess for guidance.we note at the outset that amerada hess presented a slightly different question than this case.there,the court had found that none of the exceptions enumerated in section applied to abrogate argentina sovereign immunity.amerada hess,at.thus,when considering the treaty exception,the court was evaluating the plaintiff claim that the subject to language extended jurisdiction where it otherwise did not exist.in finding that it did not,the court explained that the treaties at issue did not create private rights of action for foreign corporations to recover compensation from foreign states in united states courts.id.at.rather,they only set forth substantive rules of conduct and state d that compensation shall be paid for certain wrongs.id.in other words,the treaties at issue did not expressly conflict with the fsia because they did not speak to the issue of sovereign immunity.
here,as the district court found,article ii is silent on the question of immunity.germany would have us read article ii to say that a plaintiff can not bring an action in the courts of the united states to enforce its rights under its bonds unless and until it has validated its bonds,but that meaning is not apparent from the language of the treaty though article ii states that no bond shall be enforceable unless and until it shall be validated,that does not necessarily mean that a plaintiff may not bring a legal action in the united states courts to seek enforcement of a bond that has not been validated.in the absence of such an express conflict,we find that the treaty exception does not apply.
germany also points us to the preamble of the treaty which states,in part 
t he united states and the federal republic agree that further measures are required to permit debtors and creditors to proceed to the orderly settlement of the obligations arising from german dollar bonds with confidence in the stability of the procedures regarding validation and with assurance that claims prejudicial to such settlement will not be asserted on the basis of bonds which were unlawfully acquired.
para.emphasis added.while this portion of the preamble amplifies the language of article ii that n o bond shall be enforceable unless and until it shall be validated,like article ii,it does not specifically address the issue of immunity from suit in united states courts.following the reasoning of amerada hess,this language is,in effect,stat ing that compensation shall not be paid for certain bonds.see,at.it is not explicitly expressing an intent to deny claimants access to united states courts to determine whether their bonds are enforceable.again,as amerada hess requires,unless a treaty expressly conflicts with the fsia immunity provisions,the fsia controls,and there is no express conflict here.
because we find that the plain language of the treaty does not expressly conflict with the fsia,we do not,and need not,consider the legislative history offered by germany in support of its position 
iii.conclusion 
as we find that the treaty exception does not apply,and the parties have agreed that the exception does apply,we find that germany is not immune from suit and affirm the district court denial of germany motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
we advise that this is not a decision as to whether world holdings bonds are,in fact,enforceable.we hold merely that the district court has the authority to decide that issue.the court may yet determine that world holdings failure to comply with the validation requirement of article ii renders its bonds unenforceable and,in fact,we expect that the district court will decide the issue of the applicability of article ii validation requirement to world holdings bonds at the earliest possible opportunity.
