we must decide whether a putative class can be certified in this securities fraud class action.
this appeal stages the last act of a long drama that followed the collapse of an elaborate stock manipulation scheme.
genesisintermedia,geni is a delaware corporation with its registered address in california.its stock once traded on the nasdaq,but since late has traded over the counter but off the nasdaq turmoil in geni stock price began in the fall of and continued as the details emerged of what the plaintiffs allege was a sophisticated scheme to manipulate the price of the company stock.
desai,christopher and therese long,and elizabeth lamb investors allege that deutsche bank securities dbsl,deutsche bank securities,and deutsche bank ag collectively,deutsche bank,through wayne breedon,a at dbsl,masterminded this stock price manipulation scheme breedon and deutsche bank,however,played only one part in the plot that investors allege.some background,therefore,is necessary.
a common way to manipulate the market in a security is to cause its price to increase by creating the illusion of more investor interest than really exists.the manipulator acquires shares of the security before the price increase,then slowly sells them off and reaps the profit.the problem with this model,however,is that as the manipulator sells off his shares he depresses the price,which lessens his profit.investors here allege a scheme that varied the theme in a way designed to cure this problem.it involved a commercial arrangement known as a securities loan.
in the typical securities loan,a lends securities to another,the loan being secured by cash collateral the borrower gives to the lender.see generally stephenson deutsche bank ag,d.the borrower of the security receives rebate payments,which are like interest on the cash collateral he has transferred to the security lender as the value of the security increases,the amount of cash collateral and the level of interest also increase.the securities to the made daily.
according to investors,a web of schemers including several persons no longer defendants used securities loans to profit contemporaneously with the inflation of geni stock price,rather than by selling the stock after the price rose which would have depressed the price.it worked as follows 
officers of geni first issued themselves unregistered shares of the company.such shares may not be publicly traded,but the geni officers loaned them to a called native nations securities,receiving cash collateral in return.richard evangelista,an employee of native nations and apparently a longtime associate of breedon,falsified the records of his employer to make it look like the geni shares had come from other.native nations then lent the shares cash collateral coming back to deutsche bank.breedon was in charge of this account,which continued to absorb unregistered shares of geni stock.eventually,breedon and his associates at geni developed a chain of that came between native nations and deutsche bank in order to increase the amount of capital for the scheme and to insulate deutsche bank from any fallout should the scheme collapse.
the geni officers used the cash collateral to in geni publicly traded shares.this created the appearance of investor demand.that appearance inflated the stock price,which in turn required the borrowers of geni stock,from native nations to deutsche bank,to provide more cash collateral to feed the cycle.it also increased the rebate payments to the borrowers,from native nations down the line to deutsche bank.it seems deutsche bank gained the most from the rebate payments,however,because the intermediary in the chain paid out a percentage of the rebates they received to the next party in the chain.deutsche bank,being the last in line,did not have to do that.
to ensure that geni price kept climbing,breedon and his associates at geni allegedly paid off two stock analysts to recommend geni stock in order to drum up demand.one of the analysts was courtney smith,a defendant in this litigation the longs claim that they purchased geni stock in february of on the basis of smith bogus recommendations.the secret deal between geni and smith later came to light in the news media.
as the district court put it,this scheme solved the classic problem of market manipulators everywhere it allowed them to profit from fraudulently inflating a stock price without having to sell the shares.
by september,the scheme had driven geni stock price from per share to over per share.the terrorist attacks that day stopped all trading in the markets until september.when trading resumed,the share price fell dramatically for reasons that are unclear.by september,geni stock was down to per share,at which point trading in the stock was suspended.geni delisted its stock from nasdaq soon after it now trades for pennies.
as the price collapsed in september of,borrowers of the stock,starting with deutsche bank,demanded their cash collateral back.the cash calls went up the chain to native nations.though deutsche bank was able to recover nearly all the collateral it had pledged,the intermediary were not so lucky.geni had spent the cash collateral,so it could not return it to native nations,which left the,and many of the other between it and deutsche bank,insolvent.thus,deutsche bank had profited through the rebate payments it received,but it had managed to recover almost of all the cash collateral it had advanced.
investors seek to represent a class of people who bought geni stock in the putative class period,which is december,to september.they sue under b and a of the securities exchange act of the act,codified at b and a,respectively.desai,the lead plaintiff,purchased shares on the last day of the period.lamb bought shares on september.the longs,as mentioned,bought their shares in february of after seeing analyst courtney smith recommendations on television.
this case began over seven years ago,but it remains at the class certification stage.in october of,several parties,desai apparently among them,filed putative class actions in united states district court for the central district of california,judge stephen wilson presiding.originally,they alleged that geni,its officers,and their associates had made misrepresentations to the public or paid others to do so to inflate the price of geni stock.deutsche bank was not named a defendant.
after some preliminary wrangling over who would be the lead plaintiff,the california district court appointed horizon international,llc,an institutional investor,and desai as lead plaintiffs.when the third amended complaint,on which the two district court opinions relevant to this appeal are based,was filed,desai and horizon were the only representative plaintiffs.
in june of,the california district court transferred the case to the united states district court for the district of minnesota,where related proceedings were pending in the bankruptcy of mjk clearing,one of the unfortunate in the chain between deutsche bank and geni.see in re genesisintermedia.sec.investors counsel added lamb and the longs as class representatives,and horizon withdrew as lead plaintiff.then investors moved for certification of the class pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.in december of,the minnesota district court denied the motion.the eighth circuit denied investors petition for interlocutory appeal,and the minnesota district court transferred the case back to judge wilson in california.
in march of,the case was reopened in the central district of california.a little more than two months later,the district court allowed investors to renew their motion for class certification.judge wilson ultimately denied the motion one day after investors filed a fourth amended complaint.the district court order denying the motion therefore assumes that the third amended complaint is the operative complaint,although it was aware that the longs and lamb had been added as representative plaintiffs after that,default judgment was entered against some of the defendants,including breedon,and the claims against the other defendants,except for deutsche bank,were dismissed.the last defendant standing,and the only one before us,is deutsche bank.
the class representatives then negotiated,as individuals,a settlement with deutsche bank,but explicitly preserved their rights to appeal the denial of class certification.the district court entered final judgment and investors timely appeal.
federal rule of civil procedure governs when a district court may certify a class.all classes must meet the four of rule a and fall into one of the three categories of class actions defined in rule b.the minnesota district court addressed the rule a prerequisites,but the california district court ruled only on rule b grounds.some of our sister circuits have concluded that the interlocutory orders of district courts that transfer a case to an district court are reviewable on appeal of the transferee court judgment.see,chaiken vv publ g,cir we have jurisdiction to review the interlocutory judgment of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts entered prior to the transfer of the case to a district court within our jurisdiction and the issuance by that court of a final order.we need not decide whether to endorse such position,however,as we can decide this case on rule b alone.
specifically,investors seek certification under rule b.to certify under that provision,the district court must find,first,that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members,and,second,that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.b the rule also lists the following matters pertinent to the certification decision 
a the interests of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions b the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class c the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum d the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.
the california district court concluded that individual questions of law or fact predominated over common ones,which sufficed to take the putative class outside of rule b.the district court focused on the element of reliance which is required to prove a violation of b of the act.the district court denial of class certification depended on its belief that investors would have to prove reliance on an individual basis because they could not prove it see basic levinson,d recognizing that such individualized proof of reliance effectively makes it impossible to proceed as a class,because individual issues then would overwhelm the common ones.
a ruling on class certification is subject to a very limited review and will be reversed only upon a strong showing that the district court decision was a clear abuse of discretion.in re mego fin.sec,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the inquiry turns on whether the district court faithfully applied the requirements of rule b.see,armstrong davis,cir.to review the district court decision,we must understand the underlying causes of action.
investors bring two claims against deutsche bank.first,they allege a violation of b of the act and rule,promulgated thereunder they also allege a violation of a.section a extends liability for violations of other provisions of the act,including b,to certain controlling persons.thus,in this case liability under a turns on a violation of b.the district court evaluated the questions of law or fact with respect to the underlying liability for a violation of b,not with respect to a.we therefore put a aside.
section b makes it unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly b t o use or employ,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of the sec rules and regulations.rule categorizes violations of the statute into three categories 
a t o employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud 
b t o make any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading or 
c t o engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
the words are capacious,to be sure,and w hen we deal with private actions under rule,we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.all the same,rule encompasses only conduct already prohibited by b.stoneridge inv.partners,llc,d.thus,the cause of action must be based either on a manipulative device or contrivance or on a deceptive one.see b atsi commc ns,shaar fund,cir.
courts have generally categorized deceptive and manipulative devices into misrepresentations,omissions by those with a duty to disclose,or manipulative acts.see,ganino citizens utils,cir section b of the exchange act bars conduct involving manipulation or deception,manipulation being practices that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity,and deception being misrepresentation,or nondisclosure intended to deceive.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted see also stoneridge.at cent.bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d.misrepresentations and most omissions fall under the prohibition of rule b,whereas manipulative conduct typically constitutes a scheme to defraud in violation of rule a or a course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person in violation of rule c.see,in re initial pub.offering sec,d,treating manipulation as a violation of rule a or c and misrepresentations and omissions as violations of rule b.
here,investors allege manipulative conduct and omissions by deutsche bank manipulation,the supreme court has recognized,is virtually a term of art when used in connection with securities markets.the term refers generally to practices,such as wash sales,matched orders,or rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially affecting market activity.santa fe,green,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as for omissions,the term generally refers to the failure to disclose material information about a company,as opposed to affirmative manipulation.see basic,at.the person who omitted the material information must have had a duty to disclose it to the person supposedly harmed by the omission.see paracor,capital,cir rule is violated by nondisclosure only when there is a duty to disclose.internal quotation marks omitted.such a duty may arise from a relationship of trust and confidence between parties to a transaction.chiarella united states,d.
regardless of whether a b plaintiff alleges a misrepresentation,omission,or manipulation,he must plead and prove the following elements

reliance establishes the causal connection between the alleged fraud and the securities transaction.see stoneridge.at citing basic,at.to say that a plaintiff relied on a defendant bad act is to say that the defendant actions played a substantial part in the plaintiff investment decision.rowe maremont,cir.it is thus often referred to in cases involving the public securities markets as transaction causation,dura,broudo,d,presumably because reliance requires an to show that he would not have engaged in the transaction in question had he known about the fraud.
reliance can be presumed in two situations.in omission cases,courts can presume reliance when the information withheld is material pursuant to affiliated ute citizens united states,d.reliance can also be presumed in certain circumstances under the fraud on the market theory.basic,at.precisely to which cases this presumption is,to misrepresentation,to omission,to manipulation cases,or to some combination of the an issue the parties contest on appeal.the two presumptions are conceptually distinct.
the fraud on the market theory bears some additional explanation.it is a way to show the requisite causal connection between a defendant bad act and a plaintiff injury,id.at,that lies at the heart of the element of reliance.the theory allows plaintiffs to rely on a rebuttable presumption of investor reliance based on the theory that investors presumably rely on the market price,which typically reflects the misrepresentation or omission.joint council pension trust fund am.holding,cir.the presumption is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business.basic,at.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,the presumption is usually available only when a plaintiff alleges that a defendant made material representations or omissions concerning a security that is actively traded in an efficient market.binder gillespie,cir.in other words,the theory allows the plaintiff to connect causally the defendant bad act with the plaintiff decision to buy or sell the security,by presuming that the plaintiff based his decision on the price of the security and that such price reflects the defendant bad act.
the district court concluded that neither the affiliated ute presumption of reliance nor the fraud on the market presumption of reliance applied in this case.the affiliated ute presumption did not apply,according to the court,because this was not primarily an omissions case.the district court rejected the application of the fraud on the market presumption because,by their own admission,investors could not show an efficient market.finally,the court rejected their invitation to create a novel presumption of reliance on the integrity of the market in the context of manipulation cases.whether or not they can rely on a presumption of reliance determines whether their putative class can meet the requirements of rule b.for without a presumption,investors would have to prove reliance as to each class member individually.
the presumption of reliance under affiliated ute is limited to cases that can be characterized as primarily alleg ing omissions.id.at.therefore,if investors putative class action is not such a case,they can not avail themselves of the affiliated ute presumption.
investors allege that this is an omissions case because the case as a whole is overwhelmingly other words.in other words,they seem to assume that as long as liability is not based on misrepresentations,then it must be based on omissions.relatedly,they argue that because deutsche bank and the other former defendants failed to disclose their active manipulation of geni stock,they have made an actionable omission.this approach would collapse manipulative conduct claims and omission claims.
we must recognize,however,that manipulative conduct has always been distinct from actionable omissions.
omissions are generally actionable under rule b.as we explained above,they stem from the failure to disclose accurate information relating to the value of a security where one has a duty to disclose it.paracor,at.insider trading cases are a notorious example the insider who knows nonpublic information and trades on the basis of it has committed an actionable omission.see,united states,d chiarella,at.
manipulative conduct,by contrast,is actionable under rule a or c and includes activities designed to affect the price of a security artificially by simulating market activity that does not reflect genuine investor demand.see santa fe,at.ernst ernst hochfelder,d manipulation connotes intentional or willful conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.in order to succeed,manipulative schemes must usually remain undisclosed to the general public.see santa fe,at.if such nondisclosure of a defendant fraud was an actionable omission,then every manipulative conduct case would become an omissions case.if that were so,then all of the supreme court discussion of what constitutes manipulative activity would be redundant.we decline to read the supreme court case law on manipulative conduct as little more than an entertaining,but completely superfluous,intellectual exercise.see stoneridge.at listing the three types of b actions cent.bank,at.same.
one of our sister circuits has recently come to a similar conclusion.in joseph wiles,cir,the tenth circuit held the affiliated ute presumption inapplicable in a case involving some omissions,but also misrepresentations and secret manipulation.
any fraudulent scheme requires some degree of concealment,both of the truth and of the scheme itself.we can not allow the mere fact of this concealment to transform the alleged malfeasance into an omission rather than an affirmative act.to do otherwise would permit the affiliated ute presumption to swallow the reliance requirement almost completely.moreover,it would fail to serve the affiliated ute presumption purpose since this is not a case where reliance would be difficult to prove because it was based on a negative.we therefore hold the affiliated ute presumption of reliance inapplicable 
id.at.we agree with the tenth circuit approach,which carefully maintained the distinction,for purposes of the affiliated ute presumption,between omission claims,on the one hand,and misrepresentation and manipulation claims,on the other.
investors also alleged,and the district court addressed,some omissions in their third amended complaint that do not appear in their fourth amended complaint.as we indicated above,see supra,note,where the latter complaint differs from the former,we take the latter as operative because it supersedes the prior complaint.thus,investors have alleged no actionable omissions and so the affiliated ute presumption of reliance does not apply 
the fraud on the market theory,as the supreme court has adopted it,
is based on the hypothesis that,in an open and developed securities market,the price of a company stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business.misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements the causal connection between the defendants fraud and the plaintiffs purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations.
basic,at.quoting peil speiser,cir alteration in original.thus,the theory presumes first that a n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price.id.at.second,b ecause most publicly available information is reflected in market price,an investor reliance on any public material misrepresentations may be presumed for purposes of a rule action.id.
the second element of the presumption depends upon the efficiency of the market in which the security trades.see binder,at see also basic,at.listing as an element of the presumption as that the shares were traded on an efficient market oscar private equity invs.allegiance telecom,cir listing an efficient market as a prerequisite for application of the fraud on the market theory in re polymedica.sec,cir before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon the integrity of the market price,however,the market must be efficient.hayes gross,cir where the security involved is traded in an open and efficient market,the plaintiff may rely on the theory freeman laventhol horwath,cir t he presumption of reliance arising from the fraud on the market theory is only supported by common sense and probability as applied to efficient markets.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.investors acknowledge that the market for geni shares was not efficient.normally,that would amount to a fatal concession.
investors,however,ask us to recognize a new presumption for manipulative conduct cases.investors,they argue,typically rely on the integrity of the market,that is,that no one has destroyed its efficiency by manipulation.this consideration justifies a presumption of reliance,according to investors,when manipulation allegedly destroys the efficiency of the market,and with it the reliability of the market price.
we are chary.no authority required the district court to adopt investors integrity of the market presumption.indeed,the supreme court has adopted a rather restrictive view of private suits under b,noting that,t hough it remains the law,the b private right should not be extended beyond its present boundaries.stoneridge.at.in stoneridge,the court listed the affiliated ute presumption and the fraud on the market presumption as the two reliance presumptions it has recognized.id.at.after concluding that n either presumption appli ed,it did not inquire into any other presumption that seemed appropriate,but simply analyzed whether the plaintiffs could prove reliance directly.id.these passages may not forbid the recognition of new presumptions,but they do illustrate that the district court did not have to recognize this one.
we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to adopt the integrity of the market presumption.on the contrary,it permissibly declined to certify the class under rule b on the ground that individual issues pertaining to the issue of reliance predominate over common ones.
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court denial of the motion for class certification.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
my colleagues and i agree that the district court did not err in rejecting the integrity of the market presumption that investors proffered in this case.i therefore join the court opinion affirming the district court refusal to certify the class.unfortunately,however,we are left to conclude abruptly with a declaration of the result,for we can not agree on the correct approach.i believe that,because the validity of a presumption of reliance in securities class actions is a matter of law and because errors of law are per se abuses of discretion,we must explicitly decide whether investors are entitled to this novel presumption as a matter of law.i write separately to explain my view.
we review class certification decisions for abuse of discretion,but errors of law constitute per se abuses of discretion.cooter gell hartmarx,d a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.here,investors squarely raised and the district court forthrightly rejected a new legal integrity of the market presumption.this presumption,as described by investors,would apply in this case.therefore,if the presumption is legally valid,then investors are entitled to plead it.if not,then they are not.
consider the situation in reverse suppose the district court had adopted the integrity of the market presumption and granted class certification.in such case,i believe we would be bound to reverse even if existing law did not squarely foreclose such a theory because we would have to decide whether the presumption was legally valid.the same is true here.the district court held that there is no integrity of the market presumption as a matter of law.we must decide whether that legal conclusion was correct.
in short,to reach the integrity of the market presumption on its merits is not a matter of choice.we must decide its validity.it was raised in the district court and addressed by the district court it was raised and fully briefed on appeal.where the district court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,then it necessarily abuse d its discretion.id.i am at a loss as to how this case compels variation from this clear rule.
as explained,i would address the integrity of the market presumption on the merits.in my view,the presumption is legally unsupported and logically inadvisable.as presented to us,the integrity of the market presumption works in the following way.the average investor in securities typically relies on the integrity of the market,that is,that no one has destroyed its efficiency by manipulation.this consideration justifies a presumption of reliance,according to investors,when manipulation allegedly destroys the efficiency of the market,and with it the reliability of the market price.
first,the cases from which investors purport to have derived their theory do not support it.
investors initially point to gurary winehouse,cir,for support.but gurary did not recognize any new presumption of reliance.it merely held that,to make out a manipulation claim,a plaintiff must show that he did not know that the price was affected by the alleged manipulation.id.at.to be sure,the second circuit also noted that t he gravamen of manipulation is deception of investors into believing that prices at which they purchase and sell securities are determined by the natural interplay of supply and demand,not rigged by manipulators.id.but this language merely summarizes the essence of a manipulation claim.it does not purport to go beyond the fraud on the market presumption.
sticking with the second circuit,investors also cite schlick cement,cir.such case does indeed offer support,for the opinion held that proof of transaction causation is unnecessary by virtue of the allegations as to the effectuation of a scheme to defraud which includes market manipulation.id.at.this seems to say that there is no need to prove reliance to make out a manipulative conduct claim.but even investors do not take that position.in any event,the second circuit has reversed itself on this point.see,atsi commc ns,at listing reliance as an element in a manipulative conduct claim.and in re blech securities litigation,another case on which they rely,reiterated the reliance element,even to make out a claim for manipulative conduct.see id.at.furthermore,blech applied the fraud on the market presumption without recognizing any other presumption unique to manipulative conduct cases.id.
shores sklar,cir en banc,does not help investors either.in shores,the fifth circuit concluded that,although the plaintiff could not show reliance on the specific misrepresentation,he could nonetheless show reliance because he was entitled to assume that an issued security was legally issued.see id.at.as the fifth circuit later described the case,shores embraced a presumption of reliance where alleged fraud created the market for a security,insofar as actors who introduced an otherwise unmarketable security into the market by means of fraud are deemed guilty of manipulation,and a plaintiff can plead that he relied on the integrity of the market rather than on individual fraudulent disclosures.regents of of credit suisse first boston usa,cir.
this fraud created the market theory,even were it viable,would not help investors.they do not allege that the manipulative scheme of deutsche bank and others created the market for geni stock.geni shares traded publicly before the date the scheme allegedly began.furthermore,they did not purchase the unregistered shares that the geni insiders had lent down the chain of.thus the theory of shores would not apply to this case.
beside being virtually unknown,an integrity of the market presumption is inadvisable because it would swallow the reliance requirement.most investors do,i think it fair to say,assume that the markets are not corrupt.basic,at.it has been noted that it is hard to imagine that there ever is a buyer or seller who does not rely on market integrity.who would knowingly roll the dice in a crooked crap game quoting schlanger.but if that hypothesis sufficed to presume reliance,then no plaintiff would ever have to prove reliance.that might not worry me if this novel presumption made the requisite causal connection,which lies at the heart of the reliance element,between a defendant bad act and a plaintiff injury.basic,at.but investors integrity of the market presumption only connects the bu
