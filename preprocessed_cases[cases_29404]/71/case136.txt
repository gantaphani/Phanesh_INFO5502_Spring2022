this case presents the challenging task of fitting a statute to a financial arrangement of more recent vintage.enacted in,the securities investor protection act sipa seeks to protect investors who have entrusted their assets to a.if the runs into financial trouble,sipa authorizes the speedy return of investors property and ensures that investors will be made whole if the assets are lost.in this case,we must consider how sipa treats an investor who delivered securities to a as part of a financial transaction known as a repurchase agreement.we conclude that an investor who delivers securities to a as part of a repurchase agreement is not protected by sipa because the investor did not entrust assets to the.
background 
a repurchase agreement commonly known as a repo involves a matched purchase and sale.first,the seller agrees to sell assets,usually securities,to the buyer for a fixed price second,the buyer agrees to resell those same assets back to the seller at a later date and for a slightly higher pricehence the name repurchase agreement.
viewed from the seller perspective,repos offer a mechanism for converting idle securities into liquid cash for a limited period.the seller can then employ that cash for investments or other purposes,before returning the cash to the buyer in exchange for the securities at the conclusion of the repo.viewed from the buyer perspective,repos provide an outlet for excess cash,and for the temporary acquisition of attractive securities.moreover,because the resale price is higher than the original sale price,the buyer retains the difference known as the repo rate as a fee for the transaction.when viewed from a buyer perspective,the transaction is called a reverse repo.
between january and may,doral bank and doral financial corporation collectively,doral entered into six repurchase agreements,with doral as the seller,and lehman brothers lehman as the buyer these transactions were governed by master repurchase agreements mras.notably,the mras describe the relationship between doral and lehman as contractual and make not mention of a fiduciary relationship.the mras gave lehman full legal title over the underlying securities,and lehman was free subject to its obligation to resell the securities on the repurchase date to sell,transfer,pledge,or hypothecate the securities as it desired.doral,for its part,received cash in exchange for the securities,and was free to use that cash for its own purposes.doral also retained an economic interest in the securities,including the rights to receive all principal,interest,dividends,and other distributions.the mras protected both lehman and doral against changes in the value of the securities by marking the repos to market.if the value of the securities fell,doral was required to deliver additional securities or cash to lehman to ensure that the market value of the securities matched the cash held by doral.conversely,if the value of the securities rose,doral could demand additional cash or securities to rebalance the transaction.
under these agreements,doral sold several hundred million dollars worth of securities to lehman,with the expectation that lehman would resell the securities back to doral at the conclusion of the transactions.unfortunately for doral,the financial crisis struck while the repurchase agreements were still outstanding,and lehman fell apart before doral could repurchase the securities from lehman.although doral still had the cash that lehman paid for the securities,those securities had apparently appreciated in the meantime such that doral stood to profit if it had repurchased the securities at the price.
after lehman entered into sipa liquidation on september,doral submitted timely claims asserting that it was entitled to recover this profit.the sipa trustee denied these claims,concluding that doral was not a customer of lehman,and therefore was not protected by sipa.doral promptly objected to the trustee denial,but shortly thereafter transferred its claims to cvf lux master pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.cvf lux master is managed by carval investors uk limited carval,the appellant in this case.
on june,the bankruptcy court peck,bk.affirmed the trustee determination that the repos did not make doral or carval a customer under sipa.in re lehman.carval appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.on february,the district court cote,affirmed the bankruptcy court.in re lehman.
discussion 
this appeal turns on a single issue was doral a customer of lehman for purposes of sipa if doral was a customer of lehman,then under sipa the appellant is entitled to the prompt return of any property that lehman was holding on doral behalf,the securities that lehman never resold to doral as required by the repurchase agreements,less the contractual repurchase price.conversely,if doral was not a customer of lehman,then the sipa door is closed,and the appellant is relegated to pursuing a claim for those unreturned securities in the ordinary course of lehman bankruptcy proceedings.we begin our analysis of this question by first reviewing the principles articulated by our sipa caselaw.we then turn to how these principles treat repurchase agreements.we conclude by addressing the appellant reliance on matter of bevill,bresler schulman asset mgmt.cohen army moral support fund,and the appellant contention that congress spoke to the treatment of repos in various statutes enacted since sipa passage 
i.the securities investor protection act of 
congress enacted sipa in in response to a business contraction in the securities industry that led to the failure or instability of a significant number of brokerage firms.sec.investor prot.barbour.these failures sent shockwaves through the securities market as investors who had handed their assets over to suddenly lost access to their property.existing bankruptcy safeguards did not adequately protect investors because investor assets were frequently commingled with the other assets,and thus would be tied up for years in extended bankruptcy proceedings.as more and more investors lost access to assets they had previously thought safe,the situation threatened a domino effect involving otherwise solvent brokers that had substantial open transactions with firms that failed.barbour,at.
sipa was designed to arrest this process,restore investor confidence in the capital markets,and upgrade the financial responsibility requirements for registered brokers and dealers.id.to accomplish these goals,sipa created special procedures for the liquidation of failed.sipa trustees administer what is in effect a bankruptcy within a bankruptcy for investors who had property on account with the.see.the trustee amasses customer property and e ach customer shares ratably in this fund of assets to the extent of the customer net equity at the time of filing.in re new times sec,cir internal quotations marks and citation omitted.if this fund of customer property is insufficient to make investors whole,the trustee may dip into a special trust fund bankrolled by fees assessed on the community of.this fund is administered by the securities investor protection corporation sipc one of the appellees in this is a private nonprofit membership organization created by sipa.see sec.investor prot.morgan,kennedy,cir.
but a claimant only gets these special protections if it is a customer of the.sipa defines a customer as 
any person including any person with whom the debtor deals as principal or agent who has a claim on account of securities received,acquired,or held by the debtor in the ordinary course of its business as a broker or dealer from or for the securities accounts of such person for safekeeping,with a view to sale,to cover consummated sales,pursuant to purchases,as collateral,security,or for purposes of effecting transfer.
a.whether a claimant qualifies as a customer is determined on a basis.see in re new times,at sipa contemplates that a person may be a customer with respect to some of his claims for cash or shares,but not with respect to others.
beginning with sec baroff we have consistently emphasized that to be a customer under this definition,an investor must have entrusted property to the,cir.in baroff,the claimant had lent a substantial quantity of securities to a shaky with the intent of shoring up the balance sheet.it was understood that the securities would be returned in a short period of time as soon as the was able to straighten out its situation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.before the securities could be returned,however,the failed and entered sipa liquidation.the claimant sought to get his securities returned,but the trustee denied the claim,finding that the claimant did not qualify as a customer under the statute.id.at.
on appeal,we explained that the claimant was not a customer because he never entrusted assets to the.both the legislative history of the definition of customer and its use since enactment have stressed protection to,and equality of treatment of,the public customer who has entrusted securities to a broker for some purpose connected with participation in the securities markets.id.at.the claimant in baroff,by contrast,had lent the securities to the to bolster the financial situation,rather than to trade on the claimant own account.because the securities had not been handed over for the to use for business on the claimant behalf,the loan lacked the indicia of the fiduciary relationship between a broker and his public customer.id.at.as such,the claimant was a creditor in the situation of a commercial bank,trade creditor,landlord,equipment lessor,or any other party who relies on the ability of a business enterprise to repay a business loan rather than a customer of the.id.
in the decades since baroff,our cases have consistently hewed to this entrustment requirement for protection under sipa.see,in re new times,at sec.investor prot.exec.sec,cir per curiam.most recently,in in re bernard madoff investment securities llc,we reaffirmed that the critical aspect of the customer definition is the entrustment of cash or securities to the for the purposes of trading securities,cir further internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.several of our sister circuits have also joined us in requiring that a claimant show that it entrusted property to a to qualify as a customer.see,in re brentwood,cir the definition of customer embodies a concept an investor is entitled to compensation from the sipc only if he has entrusted cash or securities to a who becomes insolvent in re old naples,cir appleton first bank of ohio,cir sec first sec.of,cir.
ii.entrustment 
recognizing that it must satisfy this entrustment requirement,the appellant contends that repurchase agreements necessarily involve entrustment.the appellant attempts to characterize our entrustment precedents as requiring sipa claimants to show that they delivered securities or cash to the for some purpose connected with participation in the securities market.appellant br.quoting baroff,at.doral met this standard,appellant argues,because doral delivered assets to lehman when it sold the securities during the first phase of the uncompleted repurchase agreements.
but mere delivery is not entrustment.entrustment,as contemplated by baroff,must bear the indicia of the fiduciary relationship between a broker and his public customer.at.this fiduciary relationship,in turn,arises out of the broker obligation to handle the customer assets for the customer benefit.baroff offered several examples of behavior that would tend to show that the broker was holding the assets as part of a fiduciary relationship with a customer selling the assets for the customer using the assets as collateral to make margin purchases of other securities for the customer or otherwise using the assets to facilitate securities trading by the customer.id.this list of activities,while by no means exhaustive,illustrates what baroff meant when it used the term entrustment the customer handing assets over to a so that the may do business on the customer behalf.see,exec.sec,at appleton,f d at.
under this framework,doral did not entrust anything to lehman.instead,it sold the securities to lehman,which acquired full legal title.see paragraph of the mras providing that a ll of seller interest in the purchased securities shall pass to buyer on the purchase date and,unless otherwise agreed by buyer and seller,nothing in this agreement shall preclude buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the purchased securities or otherwise selling,transferring,pledging or hypothecating the purchased securities.at most,doral retained a contractual right to repurchase the securities at the conclusion of the repos.sec drysdale sec,cir the repo merely imposes a contractual obligation to deliver identical securities on the settlement date set by the repo contract.
in the meantime,however,lehman owned the securities,and could do what it wanted with them.as the district court correctly found,doral repos share many,if not most,of the characteristics that baroff focused on in finding that the claimant there did not entrust securities to his 
lehman did not sell the purchased securities to facilitate further securities trading on behalf of doral or use the purchased securities to make margin purchases of further securities on behalf of doral.doral had no reasonable expectation that lehman would sell or use the purchased securities in the near future for these purposes on behalf of doral lehman had acquired title to the purchased securities through the agreements and,as was its right,used the purchased securities as collateral or for other repurchase agreements.
in re lehman,at.lehman discretion to use the securities as it saw fit extended even to situations where lehman and doral interests would become adverse.for example,if at the time of repurchase the securities are worth less than the contractual repurchase price,then doral obligation to repurchase would be,and completing the sale would inflict a net loss on doral conversely,lehman would make money on the sale because doral would repurchase the securities at an price.rather than being required to act in doral interest by,for instance,canceling the repurchase of the securities,lehman would remain free indeed,would be contractually obligated to pursue its own interests by reselling the shares at the contractual repurchase price.
in short,lehman and doral were contractual counterparties,and each entered into the repos for its own benefit.because lehman was acting for its own interests,it had no obligation to use the securities on doral behalf,and its relationship with doral thus bore none of the indicia of the fiduciary relationship between a broker and his public customer.baroff,at.and without these indicia of a fiduciary relationship,we can not say that doral entrusted securities to lehman.
this conclusion aligns us with the eleventh circuit,the only other circuit to expressly consider whether repurchase agreements involve entrustment.in re esm gov t,cir esm,dealt with a failed reverse repo transaction the had sold securities to the claimant as part of a repo,but went bankrupt before it could repurchase the securities from the claimant as agreed.id.at.the claimant was left holding the securities,and had to resell them to a third party at a loss the claimant subsequently filed for protection as a customer.id.
the eleventh circuit denied the claimant customer status.citing baroff,the esm court explained that it is the act of entrusting the cash to the debtor for the purpose of effecting securities transactions that triggers the customer status provisions.id.at alterations omitted.accordingly,a customer claim must bear the indicia of a fiduciary relationship rather than an ordinary relationship.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the eleventh circuit concluded that the repurchase agreements in that case had no indicia of a fiduciary relationship.the failed was not holding cash that rightfully belonged to the claimant.id.the claimant had the right to resell the securities to the for the cash at a later date until then,the cash belonged to the,not the claimant.id.at.as such,the claimant had no fiduciary relationship with the,and there was thus no entrustment.
the eleventh circuit analysis applies with equal force to doral repos here.as explained above,lehman was not holding securities that rightfully belonged to doral.instead,lehman owned the securities,subject only to its contractual obligation to resell the securities at the end of the repos.until the repos ended,they continued to belong to lehman,not doral.accordingly,as in esm,doral relationship with lehman did not have the hallmarks of the fiduciary relationship between a customer and its.
the appellant tries to evade this conclusion by invoking lehman supposed general fiduciary duty to consummate the repurchase agreement.but,here,the repurchase agreements imposed,at most,a contractual obligation on lehman to resell the underlying securities back to doral at the conclusion of the repo.notably,the appellant does not does not cite a single case holding that a repo counterparty breached a fiduciary duty by failing to resell or repurchase securities at the conclusion of a repo.moreover,even assuming that such a duty existed,it would not be the type of fiduciary relationship described by baroff,in which a holds assets on a customer behalf.
more generally,the appellant argues that the securities were entrusted because doral retained a continuing economic interest in the securities even after they were sold to lehman.the appellant cites several features of the repo transactions to show that doral had an economic interest in the securities.first,of course,was doral expectation that it could repurchase the securities at the conclusion of the repos.according to the appellant,the repurchase agreements were,from doral perspective,less a sale of the securities than a temporary parting with assets that remained,fundamentally,its property.second,doral books accounted for the securities as if it still owned them conversely,lehman books did not treat the securities as property of lehman.see.third,because doral expected to pay a fixed contract price for the securities when it repurchased them at the end of the repo,doral,not lehman,bore the market risk associated with the securities if the securities rose or fell in value over the course of the repo,doral would reap the gain or suffer the loss,while lehman stood to clear the same repo rate no matter what happened to the underlying securities.see id.at united states manko,cir a repurchase agreement may expose the parties to market risk,since the repurchase price may be greater or less than the market price of the underlying asset at the date.finally,under the mbas governing the repos,doral received any principal or interest payments generated by the securities during the course of the repos in the form of regular payments passed on from lehman.see.
for all these reasons,the appellant contends that doral retained a significant economic interest in the securities,even though the securities were formally owned by lehman,and thus that lehman must have had some obligation to act on doral behalf in advancing that interest.in its strongest form,the appellant appears to argue that doral continued interest in the securities amounted to practical ownership of the securities by doral,even in the face of lehman legal title.on this view,because lehman possessed something that belonged to doral,doral must have entrusted the securities to lehman.
but in this case,the fact that doral retained economic interests in the securities does not persuade us that doral entrusted the securities to lehman.to constitute entrustment,doral economic interests must somehow constrain lehman to use the securities on doral behalf,so as to reflect the indicia of a fiduciary relationship between a broker and his public customer.baroff,at.but as explained above,the repos assigned title over the securities to lehman,and that title carried with it the power to dispose of the securities as lehman saw fit doral continuing economic interests in the securities did not constrain lehman discretion over the securities,much less obligate lehman to use those securities on doral behalf.lehman obligation to pass on principal and interest payments to doral,for example,did not require lehman to do anything with the securities rather,the repos simply provided for lehman to pay doral an amount equal to the income generated by the securities.similarly,lehman contractual obligation to resell the securities at the conclusion of the repo was akin to a common forward contract requiring lehman to make a future sale at a fixed price.nothing about this resale of the security mandated lehman to act in doral interest.doral economic interests in the securities,however strong they might have been,thus arose out of lehman fixed contractual obligations to doral that is,as features of the deal struck between doral and lehman rather than out of any obligation for lehman to use the securities on doral behalf.as such,those economic interests can not form a basis for finding that doral entrusted the securities to lehman.
in sum,we hold that lehman unrestricted ownership of the securities defeats any suggestion that doral entrusted the securities to lehman when it entered into the repos.and because doral did not entrust securities to lehman,we further conclude that the appellant is not a customer for purposes of sipa with this conclusion in mind,we now turn to the appellant other arguments that we should follow the seminal decision in re bevill,bresler schulman asset mgmt.cohen army moral support fund,hereinafter,bevill,bresler,and that congress has legislated directly on the treatment of repos under sipa.
c.in re bevill,bresler schulman asset mgmt.
the appellant relies heavily on the district of new jersey bevill,bresler decision,which held that certain repo participants were customers for purposes of sipa.at.although a district court decision from another circuit would normally be of limited relevance,bevill,bresler has proven influential in subsequent courts analysis of this question.see,esm,at discussing bevill,bresler.as such,the bankruptcy court,district court,and parties all devote substantial attention to bevill,bresler,seeking either to invoke or distinguish its holding.accordingly,we address bevill,bresler separately here.
bevill,bresler arose out of the massive sipa liquidation of the new jersey bevill,bresler,schulman bbs in.bbs entered into numerous repo and reverse repo transactions involving government and agency securities.the transactions were left uncompleted when bbs disintegrated after being charged with fraud by the sec.bbs repo counterparties subsequently sought protection as customers under sipa.
the bevill,bresler district court found that the repo counterparties qualified as customers.the court began its analysis by concluding that repo counterparties fell within the facial definition of customer set forth in.the district court then acknowledged,citing baroff,that i t may not be enough,however,merely to satisfy the literal requirements of the sipa customer definition.bevill,bresler,at.the district court explained that,for a claimant to be a customer,the transactions in which they were engaged and which form the basis of their claim of customer status must have been related to investment,trading or participation in the securities market,and furthermore the transactions must have arisen out of the type of fiduciary relationship which generally characterizes the relationship between a and its customers.id.citing baroff,at.the district court reasoned that these factors were clearly present in repo transactions,stressing the economic importance of the repo markets,as well as the fact that t he risks and potential rewards associated with repo and reverse repo transactions are unquestionably risks and rewards which are entirely distinct from and additional to any credit risk associated with the solvency of the broker as a financial intermediary.id.at alterations omitted.accordingly,the district court concluded that bbs disappointed counterparties were customers under sipa.the appellant lauds bevill,bresler as the seminal case on the issue of whether repos are protected under sipa,and urges us to follow it.appellant br.see also id.at listing cases that cite bevill,bresler.
bevill,bresler analysis,however,confli
