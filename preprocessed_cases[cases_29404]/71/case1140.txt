background 
pathogenesis corporation pathogenesis or the company,founded in,is a pharmaceutical company that develops and markets medicines to treat chronic infectious diseases.pathogenesis developed tobi,tobramycin solution for inhalation,the first inhaled antibiotic designed to treat lung infections for people with cystic fibrosis.tobramycin,the key element in tobi,is an antibiotic that had previously been administered through intravenous injection.the introduction of tobi was an advance in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.as an inhaled medicine,tobi delivers tobramycin in greater concentrations than is possible through intravenous treatment.
in december,pathogenesis received food and drug administration approval to sell tobi and in january,the company began selling tobi to wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and mail order pharmacies collectively,the wholesalers.nearly one year later,on december,pathogenesis told its wholesalers by letter that the company was increasing the price of tobi by at least seven percent,effective that day.the letter further told the wholesalers that they could purchase tobi at the lower,price during a two week period beginning december,the program.in response to the program,each of the wholesalers purchased large amounts of tobi,which contributed,in part,to strong fourth quarter sales.at the end of,pathogenesis had generated million in sales and its sales totaled million,a increase over total sales from the preceding quarter because of pathogenesis strong fourth quarter earnings,investors had high expectations that sales of tobi would continue to grow during the first quarter of.near the end of the first quarter of,however,pathogenesis announced that sales of tobi would not meet these heightened expectations and would only be about million.stock values dropped and plaintiffs alleged securities fraud.
the theory of plaintiffs complaint is that pathogenesis had access to information in december and the beginning of that showed patient demand for tobi had plateaued.according to the plaintiffs,the program was devised both to conceal flat patient demand for tobi and artificially to inflate sales.plaintiffs further contend pathogeneis needed to demonstrate strong sales in order to negotiate favorable financing with lenders and to expand distribution with foreign distributors.
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that between january and march,the class period pathogenesis made at least three false and misleading statements designed to create the impression that pathogenesis impressive fourth quarter results were the result of increasing patient demand for tobi.on january,the day the class period begins,pathogenesis chairman and ceo,wilbur gantz,was interviewed on a syndicated television program.he said that the company had a very good fourth quarter and that pathogenesis was seeing a continuing ramp up of business here in the united states.ten days later,pathogenesis announced in a press release its and results and made what plaintiffs contend is the second misleading statement during the class period in the press release gantz said our strong showing is due to excellent acceptance of tobi by the cystic fibrosis community.the next day,the price of pathogenesis common stock rose by about,or,to close at per share.
as additional evidence of motive to commit fraud,plaintiffs point to two stock sales made by gantz during the class period.on february,one week after pathogenesis announced its and results,gantz filed a document with the securities and exchange commission declaring his intention to sell shares of pathogenesis common stock.gantz began selling his pathogenesis stock that day,selling shares of pathogenesis common stock at per share.he sold another shares of pathogenesis at per share on february.before these two transactions,gantz had not sold any of his holdings of pathogenesis common stock.
meanwhile,on february,alan meyer,pathogenesis chief financial officer,made the third allegedly false and misleading statement during the class period.meyer told attendees at an investor conference that the company was looking at very strong sales growth and earnings growth for the future.he went on to say,we think we are poised very well for future penetration of the cystic fibrosis market.
meyer optimistic forecast was not met.on march,pathogenesis issued a press release stating that some first quarter sales were accelerated into the fourth quarter of as patients and wholesalers increased their normal orders.pathogenesis announced that results would not be as strong as previously predicted and would be approximately million.the next day,on march,pathogenesis common stock dropped like a rock and plummeted,from a share to a share.
procedural history 
on march,one day after the price drop,plaintiff david lipton filed a lawsuit in district court for the western district of washington against pathogenesis,gantz and meyer.lipton alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of and rule shortly thereafter,seven more actions were filed in the same court.the eight cases were consolidated.nearly six months later,on september,a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed against pathogenesis,gantz and meyer.this complaint added a claim under section of the act 
in november,defendants filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint.defendants submitted documents,including,inter alia,graphs that tracked the number of prescriptions for tobi and investor analyst reports on pathogenesis.the prescription data graphs submitted with defendants motion to dismiss were generated by prometrics consulting.pathogenesis relied on prometrics to provide weekly and monthly information on the number of patient prescriptions being filled for tobi.prometrics,in turn,received this data from an information vendor,ims health ims.the ims data was available to the investment analysts who followed pathogenesis and was available to anyone who subscribed directly with ims or through an intermediary,such as prometrics.reports from investment analysts indicated that in december and during the class period,patient demand for tobi was on the rise 
after the filing of defendants motion to dismiss,the plaintiffs moved to strike the prometrics graphs and the investment analyst reports.on february,the district court granted plaintiffs motion to strike the prescription demand data,finding the authenticity of these reports in dispute.but the district court ruled that it would consider the investment analyst reports for the purpose of determining whether and when information was disclosed to the market.
on february,the district judge,in an oral ruling,dismissed the complaint with prejudice,holding that plaintiffs had not pleaded detailed and particular facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter as required by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra and two of the three challenged statements were and protected by the pslra safe harbor provision.see c.the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and the defendants the district court order that excluded the graphs of patient prescription data.
ii.pleading scienter under silicon graphics 
the dispositive issue for us is whether the district court erred in holding that the plaintiffs did not adequately plead scienter.our inquiry here is governed by the pslra.there,congress provided that in any private securities fraud action for money damages,a complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.b.the complaint must also state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.b 
although there is disagreement in the federal courts of appeals about the meaning of the required state of mind,we have previously held that the pslra requires plaintiffs to plead,at a minimum,particular facts giving rise to a strong inference of deliberate or conscious recklessness.in re silicon graphics.sec,cir emphasis added.our decision in silicon graphics also holds that plaintiffs who plead the required state of mind in general terms of mere motive and opportunity or recklessness fail to meet the pslra heightened pleading requirements.id.where pleadings are not sufficiently particularized or where,taken as a whole,they do not raise a strong inference of scienter,a rule b dismissal is proper.see ronconi,at.
plaintiffs asserted that fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions occurred in gantz january statement that sales were continuing to ramp up gantz january statement in a press release that pathogenesis strong showing is due to excellent acceptance of tobi by the cystic fibrosis community and meyer february statement to investors at a conference that pathogenesis was looking at very strong sales growth and earnings growth for the future.plaintiffs complaint challenged the accuracy and completeness of these statements and alleged that misrepresentations were made to create the perception of strong patient demand for tobi 
we focus on the element of scienter the required state of mind that the pslra requires be pleaded with particularity.plaintiffs attempted in their complaint to show scienter from defendants alleged receipt of reports indicating flat patient demand gantz february sale of pathogenesis stock and defendants alleged motive to impress pathogenesis lenders with reports of strong financial performance and to expand internationally.the district court found the allegations inadequate under the pslra and our decision in silicon graphics.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b.silicon graphics,at.we agree with the district court that,taken as a whole,plaintiffs allegations do not give rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.
internal reports 
plaintiffs allege that pathogenesis knew that patient demand was flat because the company had access to internal reports on sales data and ims patient demand data.according to plaintiffs,both types of data informed the defendants that sales would be lower than investors were led to believe.
we first address plaintiffs allegation that pathogenesis could regularly track its sales data to show that the defendants knew or should have known that patient demand for tobi was flat during the class period.in silicon graphics,we explained that a proper complaint which purports to rely on the existence of internal reports would contain at least some specifics from those reports as well as such facts as may indicate their reliability.id.at.here,plaintiffs merely assert in conclusory terms that the defendants had access to internal data demonstrating a decline in sales of tobi.plaintiffs do not identify any internal reports of sales data,much less plead,in any detail,the contents of any such report or the purported data.see id.at.without this information,as was the case in silicon graphics,we can not ascertain whether there is any basis for the allegations that the officers had actual or constructive knowledge of flat patient demand that would cause their optimistic representations to the contrary to be consciously misleading.id.
we next address the claim that defendants had access to ims data that allegedly informed the defendants that patient demand for tobi was flat.the plaintiffs complaint states based on the ims data available,defendants knew,or were reckless in not knowing,and failed to disclose that patient demand for tobi was flat and not increasing during the class period.but again,this allegation does not give rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with deliberate or conscious recklessness.although plaintiffs refer to the existence of the ims data and make a general assertion about what they think the data shows,plaintiffs do not allege with particularity any specific information showing that prescription data informed defendants that patient demand for tobi was flat.plaintiffs do not mention a specific ims document relied on by defendants such as a particular ims report,graph or chart.nor do they detail with particularity the content of such data.rather,plaintiffs merely allege that pathogenesis tracked patient demand using data provided by ims and that this data supposedly indicated that patient demand was flat.as we held in silicon graphics,negative characterizations of reports relied on by insiders,without specific reference to the contents of those reports,are insufficient to meet the heightened pleading requirements of the pslra see id at.we hold that plaintiffs allegations of negative internal reports and ims data are insufficient to demonstrate deliberate or conscious recklessness.
stock transactions 
plaintiffs also allege in their complaint that securities fraud may be inferred from gantz sale of shares of pathogenesis shortly after the company announced its earnings.they contend that gantz sale of pathogenesis stock gives rise to a strong inference that defendants knew that their public forecasts during the class period were knowingly false when made because gantz had not previously sold any shares of pathogenesis common stock intended to sell more shares of pathogenesis common stock than the actually sold and sold his shares after he and meyer allegedly made inaccurate and misleading forecasts.
we have previously held that a strong inference of fraudulent intent may occur when an insider owning much of a company stock make s rosy characterizations of company performance to the market while simultaneously selling large percentages of his holdings.ronconi,at.but that did not occur here.the insider sales are not substantial in the aggregate compared to the market,only gantz and not other insiders sold during the class period,and the sales by gantz were only a small part of his total holdings.gantz sales of shares of stock,a tiny percentage of his holdings,does not support any inference of impropriety or fraud.
as we explained in silicon graphics 
i nsider trading is suspicious only when it is dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed information among the relevant factors to consider are the amount and percentage of shares sold by insiders the timing of the sales and whether the sales were consistent with the insider prior trading history.
at citations and internal quotations omitted.in this case,gantz sale of shares constituted only of his total pathogenesis holdings.the sale of such a small percentage of total holdings does not give rise to the strong inference of scienter required by the pslra.see ronconi,at suggesting that sales of and of an individual holdings were not suspicious silicon graphics,at transactions of four of six corporate officers who each sold less than of their total holdings were not suspicious gantz sales as alleged can equally or more likely support the inference that he was engaging in modest diversification.
we also conclude that the timing of gantz stock transactions was not suspicious.officers of publicly traded companies commonly make stock transactions following the public release of quarterly earnings and related financial disclosures.that gantz would sell an extremely small portion of his total holdings following the positive announcement of pathogenesis and fourth quarter earnings does not support an inference that gantz knew or should have known that the optimistic reports of tobi projected growth were false.see in re sec,d,officers sale of shares following press release announcement of anticipated increase in quarterly revenu
