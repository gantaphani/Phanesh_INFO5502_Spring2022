the the claimants whose reimbursement is the subject of this appeal are individuals and entities that were fraudulently induced by william goren to purchase shares in bogus mutual funds offered by his investment companies,new times securities services,new times and new age financial services,new age collectively,the debtors.after goren scheme was exposed,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york thomas platt,judge ordered that the assets of new times and new age be liquidated pursuant to the securities investor protection act of sipa.
in the course of that liquidation,the sipa trustee concluded that the claimants were eligible to receive cash advances from the securities investor protection corporation sipc,but that they had claims for cash subject to a reimbursement limit under sipa.he set the value of the claims at the amount of money that the claimants paid to the debtors to purchase the bogus funds.the claimants filed objections to the trustee determinations and the district court sustained the objections,holding that i the claimants,in fact,had claims for securities eligible for much more generous sipc advances of up to,and ii the claims were properly valued according to the equity positions reflected in the claimants final account statements from the debtors,which included interest and fictitious dividend reinvestments.the trustee and sipc appeal from that ruling.
this appeal requires resolution of issues of first impression in the second circuit.we hold today that the district court properly determined that the claimants had claims for securities under sipa but we find that the district court erred by calculating the value of those claims by reference to the fictitious account statements that the claimants received from the debtors.instead,each claimant net equity should be calculated by reference to the amount of money the claimants originally invested with the debtors not including any fictitious interest or dividend reinvestments.in so holding,we decline to adopt sipc narrow reading of the relevant sipa provisions and,instead,defer to the sec persuasive interpretation of the statute.
background 
goren fraud 
from approximately until,through new times and new age,goren defrauded hundreds of long island and queens,new york investors out of approximately million goren scheme was multifaceted.he solicited customers of new age and new times to invest in i one or more money market funds often called the new age securities money market fund,ii shares of bona fide mutual funds from,the vanguard group and putnarn investments,that were never,in fact,purchased,and iii fraudulent promissory notes issued by goren new age.instead of investing these customers funds as represented,goren misappropriated the money 
on february,the sec filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york against goren and new age and naming new times as a relief defendant,alleging violations of the securities acts and seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.the following day,the district court thomas platt,judge issued a preliminary injunction freezing goren assets and appointed a temporary receiver for new age and new times.goren eventually pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges arising from his role in orchestrating and operating this scheme.he is currently serving an prison sentence.
b.the sipa liquidation 
on may,the district court ordered that new times,a registered member of sipc be liquidated pursuant to sipa.upon the recommendation of sipc,the court appointed james giddens to serve as the trustee for the new times liquidation.the proceeding was referred to the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of new york stan bernstein,bankruptcy judge.new age remained in receivership under the jurisdiction of the district court.
during a standard sipa liquidation,the trustee must satisfy net equity claims of customers of the failed.a a b.each customer net equity is the dollar amount of the account or accounts of a customer,to be determined by calculating the sum which would have been owed by the debtor to such customer if the debtor had liquidated,by sale or purchase on the filing date,all securities positions of such customer corrected for any indebtedness of such customer to the debtor on the filing date.id.these net equity claims are paid first by a pro rata distribution of customer property,which is defined as cash and securities held by the debtor excluding any securities held in a particular customer name.id.
sipc maintains a substantial reserve fund that is supported by assessments on sipc members revenues and by interest generated from its investments in treasury notes see id.a,c see also sec.investor prot.bdo seidman,llp,cir general accounting office,pub.no,sec.investor update on matters related to the sipc,available at http gao report.to the extent that a customer net equity exceeds his ratable share of customer property,the trustee may use sipc advances from this fund to pay customers in cash or to purchase replacement securities for a customer d,a.
these sipc advances are subject to one of two limits under sipa,which is why the determination of whether a customer has a claim for cash or a claim for securities must be made.sipa provides that the sipc shall advance to the trustee such moneys,not to exceed for each customer,as may be required to pay or otherwise satisfy claims for the amount by which the net equity of each customer exceeds his ratable share of customer property.id.a.if,however,any portion of that claim is a claim for cash,as distinct from a claim for securities,the amount advanced to satisfy such claim for cash shall not exceed for each such customer.id.a.
early in the new times liquidation,the trustee review of the operations of new times and new age revealed extensive intermingling of the two entities in communications with the public.br.for appellants james giddens and sipc at.as a result,with the approval of sipc,the trustee moved for an order substantively consolidating the estates of new times and new age so as to maximize recovery to victims of goren fraudulent activities,irrespective of whether they had dealt with new times,the entity or new age,the non entity.id.the sec filed a brief in support of such a consolidation,and on november,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion.as a result,the assets and liabilities of the two entities were pooled and the combined estate has since been administered by the trustee under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.customer claims have been determined according to sipa and the debtor,for sipa purposes,includes both new times and new age for claims arising after april,which is the date that new times became an and a member of sipc.
c.the trustee determination claims for cash claims for securities 
over claims have been filed in the liquidation proceeding.the fourteen claimants whose reimbursement is the subject of this appeal are among claimants who,fraudulently induced by goren,invested in his bogus money market funds the funds or the new age funds it is worth noting that there is no suggestion that any of the claimants,many of whom were elderly retirees,had any suspicion of goren criminality or of the of the new age funds in which he claimed to have invested their money.to the contrary,all of the claimants have indicated that they believed they were investing in,conservative money market mutual funds.
to be this is the crucial fact in this new age funds in which the claimants invested never existed.they were not organized as mutual funds,they were never registered with the sec and they did not issue any of the requisite prospectuses for investors.although the claimants received confirmations and monthly account statements indicating that their initial payments to the debtors and fictitious dividends were invested in the new age funds,in reality,goren had embezzled their money.
because the claims were for securities,the trustee concluded during the liquidation proceedings that the claimants had claims for cash eligible for only in cash advances and he valued those claims according to the amount paid to the debtors for the purchase of the bogus shares,less any withdrawals or redemptions by the claimants.amounts shown on the claimants account statements as dividends or interest earned on the bogus funds were not included in the calculus.sec goren,d.the trustee made it clear to the claimants that any amounts they were owed in excess of would be treated by the debtors estate as general unsecured claims,but the trustee warned the claimants that the consolidated new age and new times estate would likely lack funds to satisfy any general unsecured claims.id.
meanwhile,investors who were misled by goren to believe that they were investing in mutual funds that in reality existed were treated much more favorably.although they were not actually invested in those real goren never executed the information that these claimants received on their account statements mirrored what would have happened had the given transaction been executed.br.for appellants james giddens and sipc at.as a result,the trustee deemed those customers claims to be securities claims eligible to receive up to in sipc advances.id.the trustee indicates that this disparate treatment was justified because he could purchase real,existing securities to satisfy such securities claims.id.furthermore,the trustee notes that,if they were checking on their mutual funds,the securities claimants,in contrast to the cash claimants bringing this appeal,could have confirmed the existence of those funds and tracked the funds performance against goren account statements.id.
d.the district court decision 
thereafter,the claimants filed written objections to both i the trustee determination of their claims as cash claims and ii his refusal to compensate them for interest and dividend reinvestments.see goren,d at.in response,the trustee joined by sipc moved for an order upholding his determination.id.while these objections and motions were pending,bankruptcy judge bernstein recused himself from the case.id.at.thereafter,district court judge platt withdrew the reference and took exclusive jurisdiction of the sipc proceeding.id.
after reviewing the matter,the district court denied the trustee motion and sustained the claimants objections in a may,memorandum and order.the court determined that the claimants had claims for securities and that the value of those claims could be derived from the claimants equity positions as stated in their final account statements including the fictitious interest and dividend reinvestments.id.at.the court explained that,in keeping with sipa policy goals,this result turns on the transaction notice provided to customers and their legitimate expectations and promotes investor confidence.id.at.the district court relied on the series rules,in reaching this conclusion goren,d at explaining that,under the series rules,receipt of written confirmation of the purchase or sale of a security generally determines what type of claim customers hold.in the district court view,the trustee determination erroneously hinge d on the unilateral actions of the fraudfeasor who embezzled his clients funds.id.at.
the trustee and sipc promptly filed a joint notice of appeal.on june,responding to our request,the sec filed an amicus brief in partial support of the claimants and in partial support of the trustee and sipc.
discussion 
this appeal presents several issues of first impression in this circuit.first,we are called upon to determine whether the claimants should be treated as having claims for securities under section a of sipa,a,which are eligible for sipc cash advances of up to,or as having claims for cash,which are eligible for reimbursement capped at.second,if the district court properly held that the claims were claims for securities,we must evaluate whether the district court properly calculated the claimants net equity by referring to the fictitious securities positions reflected in the claimants account statements which included artificial interest and dividend reinvestments.finally,in the course of addressing these novel issues of statutory interpretation,we confront the still thornier question of whether and to what degree we ought to defer to the sec interpretation of the relevant provisions of sipa when it directly contradicts sipc reading of the statute.
i.the conflicting interpretations of sipa 
we review de novo the district court conclusions of law,including its interpretation of sipa and the series rules.see gurary,cir,cert.denied,d levy southbrook int l,cir,cert.denied,d.
in this case,the sec has outlined an interpretation of section a of sipa that plainly conflicts with the interpretation being pressed by sipc and the trustee all three agree,however,that i the claimants were customers pursuant to sipa because they deposited cash with the debtor for the purpose of purchasing securities,ii the securities in question did not exist and,thus,could not be liquidated or replaced by the trustee iii the series rules do not govern this case and iv the trustee properly measured the claimants net equity by reference to the amount of money they paid to goren and the debtors to purchase the bogus funds 
at this point,the interpretations diverge.the trustee and sipc work backward from the determination of the claimants net equity,which is the sum they would have been owed by the debtors if the debtors had liquidated,on the filing date,all of the claimants securities positions.see.because here there were no securities to liquidate,the trustee had to value the claims according to the amount of cash that the claimants initially paid to the debtors for their investments in the new age funds.for that reason,sipc and the trustee conclude the claims are properly viewed as cash claims under section a and,thus,limited to in sipc advances.see id.a.
the sec rejects this test,instead focusing on congress intent in creating the distinction between the two types of claims and,derivatively,on satisfaction of the customer legitimate expectations.according to the sec,the claimants should be treated as having claims for securities regardless of the fact that the securities were they received purchase confirmations and account statements from goren and the debtors.br.for amicus curiae sec at.
before we consider whether and to what degree we ought to defer to either interpretation,we must examine the relationship between the sec and sipc.
ii.the relationship between sipc and the sec 
by the explicit language of sipa,sipc is not an agency or establishment of the united states government.a a.sipc asserts that although it is not an agency per se,it is,under sipa,an independent corporation endowed with its own voice and responsibilities in the conduct of liquidations and payment of net equity claims from the sipc fund.letter from harbeck,general counsel,sipc,to the court of harbeck letter,at.according to sipc,the sec possesses potential supervisory authority in some but not all areas of sipc operations.id.citing c.although we agree with sipc that the drafters of sipa clearly envisioned roles for both the sec and sipc in administering the statute see thomas lee hazen,law securities regulation,we find that congress deliberately limited the authority of sipc relative to the sec.
the supreme court held in securities investor protection corporation barbour,d,that sipa invests the sec with plenary authority to supervise the sipc.id.at.indeed,sipa drafters seem to have anticipated substantial and vigorous oversight of sipc by the sec,at,reprinted in,explaining that sipa provides for substantial oversight on the part of the commission over the conduct of the affairs of sipc id.at noting that the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce not only directs,but expects the commission to use its oversight in a vigorous,but fair,manner see also sec.investor prot.charisma sec,cir in fact,it is contemplated that the sec will exercise a supervisory role over sipc performance.
for example,although sipa provides sipc with the power to adopt,amend or repeal bylaws and rules as necessary or appropriate to further the purposes of sipa,b,the sec may disapprove any such bylaw in whole or in part,and any proposed rule or rule change must be filed with and approved by the sec before it takes effect,id.e a.indeed,the series rules,which the district court held govern this case see goren,d at,were proposed by sipc and approved by the sec in just that manner,see explanatory note.sipa also empowers the sec to take an even more proactive role the sec may,by such rules as it determines to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or to carry out the purposes of this chapter,require sipc to adopt,amend or repeal any sipc bylaw or rule,whenever adopted.e emphasis added.
in addition,the sec may,on its own motion,file an appearance in any proceeding and may thereafter participate as a party.id.c.even more significantly,i n the event of the refusal of sipc to commit its funds or otherwise to act for the protection of customers of any member of sipc,sipa authorizes the sec to seek a court order requiring sipc to discharge its obligations under sipa and for such other relief as the court may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of sipa.id.b see also barbour,at.hazen,supra.
deference to sipc interpretation is inappropriate in this case 
shortly after sipc was formed,this court considered,in an entirely different context,the degree of deference that should be accorded to sipc interpretation of a different provision of sipa.noting its familiarity with sipa liquidations,sipc argued that it should be given deference on a par with that given to an sec interpretation.sec.investor prot.charisma sec,cir.the charisma securities court noted that while sipc expertise should be accorded weight by a district judge,the court was hesita nt to draw the analogy between the corporation and the sec,because the sipc is not an independent regulatory agency,nor has it yet had the opportunity to establish a long history of knowledgeable and conscientious performance as has the sec.see also in re lloyd,stating that because sipc is not a governmental agency,it can not take advantage of the implicit deference which must be accorded to federal agencies interpretations of their own pertinent statutory schemes and operative administrative regulations,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds,aff,cir.
although sipc now has the history of knowledgeable and conscientious performance under sipa that it lacked when charisma securities was decided,its status the as a not changed.sipc argues that other corporations have been accorded deference,see harbeck letter at citing pension benefit guar.ltv,d velazquez legal servs,cir,aff,d,but we find that the entities at issue in those cases are dissimilar to sipc in critical respects.the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc was established as an entity within the department of labor,with the power to adopt,amend,and repeal necessary bylaws,rules,and regulations.a,b.as such,we have characterized pbgc as a federal agency.jones laughlin hourly pension plan ltv,cir see also ltv,at.repeatedly characterizing pbgc as an agency.sipc,on the other hand,does not have similar authority.
with respect to the legal services corporation lsc,the other corporation cited by sipc,the sec notes that although lsc is not a government agency,it is unlike sipc because its enabling statute gives it final authority to promulgate rules.letter from prezioso,general counsel,sec,to the court of prezioso letter,at.we agree.see texas rural legal aid,legal servs,according chevron deference to lsc interpretation because,although lsc is not an agency,congress has entrusted lsc with the duty to administer the legal services corporation act and has delegated to lsc the authority to fill any gap left by congress through rulemaking,indicating that congress intended that it be treated for these purposes like an agency of the government citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
this case is also distinguishable from ltv and velazquez because the agency with plenary authority to supervise the sipc,barbour,at.proffered a competing view of the meaning of the statute.the trustee and sipc suggest,however,that the sec oversight and authority has somehow atrophied because,in the over thirty years since sipa creation,it has never been exercised meaningfully.harbeck letter at.while the sec historically approach to its sipa responsibilities is relevant to our deference analysis,see infra at,we do not believe it has effected the shift in the balance of power between the two organizations that sipc and the trustee seem to envision 
in chao russell le frois builder,cir,we addressed a similar problem where two administrative agents the secretary of labor and the occupational safety and health review competing views of the statute at issue.id.at.we held that the very first step of that deference analysis required a choice between the two agencies for purposes of the deference analysis,then,we must first decide to which administrative secretary or the delegated authority to make rules carrying the force of law.only then can we decide the nature or extent of that deference.id.quoting united states mead,d citation omitted.while sipc clearly plays an essential administrative role,congress deliberately chose not to grant sipc agency authority,see a a,and instead invested plenary authority over sipa with the sec,barbour,at.thus,while sipc proposed construction of the statute is a relevant part of our will certainly inform the level of deference we accord to the sec reading of the is not an interpretation to which we must necessarily defer we confine our holding to the unique facts of this case where the sec has offered a competing and more persuasive interpretation of the statute.we do not consider what measure of deference an sipc interpretation might warrant under other circumstances,when it alone speaks to the meaning of one of its rules.our decision in charisma securities left that general question open and we do so here as well.
ultimately,we agree with the sec that w hatever sipc expertise in overseeing sipa liquidations,congress did not intend for the commission interpretations of sipa to be overruled by deference to the entity that was made subject to the commission oversight.prezioso letter at.the sec has also highlighted that,under the statutory scheme,if sipc filed a proposed rule that set forth its current interpretation of section a of sipa,a,the commission would,after considering whether the proposed rule was consistent with sipa and in the public interest,have authority to deny approval of such a rule.id.even more compelling,the sec argues that it could require sipc to adopt a rule that sets forth what the sec believes is the appropriate interpretation of section a.id.we agree that deference to sipc,under the circumstances presented here,would impermissibly undermine that statutory hierarchy.whether the sec interpretation of section a deserves deference from this court is a separate question to which we now turn.
iii.the sec interpretation is persuasive and merits skidmore deference 
mandatory chevron deference is unwarranted in this case 
the first question we must ask in the deference analysis is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.of course,if congressional intent could be discerned from the face of sipa,our deference inquiry would be over because the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.see also united states gayle,cir statutory construction begins with the plain text and,if that text is unambiguous,it usually ends there as well.sipa does not address the precise issue presented in this case.the statute fails to provide any definition of a claim for cash.see.none of the provisions outlines how the were fraudulently misled to invest their money in goren bogus be treated.this is precisely the type of interstitial question anticipated by chevron and its progeny.see,barnhart walton,d.
in light of the statute silence,and because we have an agency interpretation of section a of sipa,a,the second chevron step requires that,as opposed to proceeding to construe the statute ourselves as we usually would,we must determine whether the sec interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.if the administrator reading fills a gap or defines a term in a way that is reasonable in light of the legislature revealed design,we give the administrator judgment controlling weight.nationsbank of north carolina,variable annuity life ins,d quoting chevron,at.see also sec zandford,d explaining that sec interpretation of the ambiguous text of b is entitled to deference if it is reasonable.
there are several reasons that the mandatory deference envisioned by chevron would be inappropriate here.first,although the sec has clearly had the power to draft rules to address this ambiguity in sipa,the interpretation proffered in its brief has never been articulated in any rule or regulation as the sec admits,o ther than the series rules,which the commission does not interpret to cover fictitious securities,the commission has not defined by regulation the terms in section a.prezioso letter at.in united states mead,d,the supreme court explained that it ha s recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.id.at.emphasis added.while the fact that the sec interpretation has not been expressed in the form of a rule or regulation crafted after notice and comment does not alone determine the applicability of chevron,see id.at.walton,at,taken together with the factors discussed infra,it counsels against affording chevron deference to the sec interpretation.
second,it appears that the position taken by the sec in its brief is one that it has not previously articulated in any form.local,int l of teamsters daniel,d noting that considerable weight is given to an administrative agency consistent,longstanding interpretation of the statute under which it operates emphasis added.to be clear,while the sec articulation of this position is new,the issue certainly is not.the sec acknowledges that sipc has long held its position regarding the treatment of securities.sipc first articulated this a claim for fictitious securities is properly treated as a claim for cases that arose over a decade ago.see plumbers and steamfitters local severance and ret.fund appleton in re first ohio sec,table,wl,at cir,unpublished decision finding that the only legal conclusion possible where claimants sought sipc advances for securities that never even existed was that the claims were for cash and not for securities,cert.denied,d appleton hardy in re first ohio sec,unpublished order affirming trustee determination that a claim for securities is a claim for cash.sipc also apprised the sec of its position on this issue in its and annual reports.harbeck letter at.
third,the sec concedes that its new interpretation of sipa has been expressed for the first time in an amicus brief filed at the request of this court and that,under those circumstances,its interpretation may not be entitled to chevron deference.prezioso letter at.as we observed in callaway commissioner,cir,the supreme court has accorded deference,even to agency interpretations appearing for the first time in an amicus brief,where there is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.a new,and therefore inconsistent position,may yet be fair and considered.id.at citations omitted see also cedar rapids cmty.sch.dist.garret ex rel.charlene,d auer robbins,d.but christensen harris county,d interpretations such as those in opinion interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.the sec opinion is certainly not the sort of post hoc rationalization to defend past agency action against attack about which the supreme court has registered concern.auer,at.citation omitted.we have no reason to doubt that the sec interpretation was the product of careful consideration.and the sec familiarity with this case from its inception lends credence to its view.nevertheless,the sec submitted its brief only after being invited to do so and only once this dispute reached appeal indeed,in some cases,we have declined to consider arguments raised for the first time in an appellate amicus brief.see,concourse rehab.nursing,debuono,cir.this,then,is another consideration that weighs against chevron deference.
finally,the sec historical relationship with sipc and sipc arguably greater familiarity with the provisions of sipa are yet additional reasons to decline to apply chevron deference to the sec interpretation of sipa.chevron deference is predicated,in part,on the perceived superior expertise of the agency in question.see pension benefit guar.ltv,d p ractical agency expertise is one of the principal justifications behind chevron deference.with respect to sipa and the determinations made by the trustee and sipc during liquidation proceedings,the sec role involves more removed oversight.indeed,if the conduct of this litigation is any indication,it appears that the sec generally adopts a approach with respect to sipc liquidations and litigation.as a result,the sec expertise in this context is arguably less compelling than it would be with respect to those portions of the securities exchange act as to which it takes a more proactive role.bowen am.hosp.ass n,d noting that where the department of health and human services was one of agencies responsible for promulgating regulations forbidding discrimination,there is not the same basis for deference predicated on expertise as we found in chevron.
for these reasons,we find that the informal opinion proffered by the sec in its amicus brief lacks the force of law and thus does not warrant chevron deference.chao,at.
skidmore deference is appropriate 
the fact that chevron is inapplicable to this case does not mean that the sec interpretation will merit no deference whatsoever.instead,it warrants the more limited standard of deference adopted by the supreme court in skidmore swift.see united states mead,d chevron did nothing to eliminate skidmore holding that an agency interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form,given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency.quoting skidmore,at.esden bank of boston,cir,cert.denied,d.as the skidmore court explained,the level of deference owed to any particular interpretation depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.at.see also mead,at.in community health center,cir,we outlined the factors that inform our skidmore analysis,including the agency expertise,the care it took in reaching its conclusions,the formality with which it promulgates its interpretations,the consistency of its views over time,and the ultimate persuasiveness of its arguments.id.at.
applying the community health center factors in this case,we find that several notably the persuasiveness of the sec in favor of deference to the sec reading of section a of sipa,a.under the federal securities laws,the sec is responsible for regulating,administering the securities exchanges and protecting the public interest.the protections outlined in sipa are merely one aspect of this much broader legislative scheme.although the sec has not always played a direct role in administering sipa,its general oversight of the securities laws gives it expertise that merits some degree of deference.we decline to accord the sec interpretation the considerable deference it requests,because the sec has not had the kind of history of consistent interpretation of section a that prompted our holding in community health center.see at.as we did in community health center,we decline to determine the exact molecular weight of the deference to be accorded to the sec position without analyzing the persuasiveness of its interpretation the final skidmore factor.id.at.
c.the sec claims for securities analysis is persuasive 
the sec disagrees with sipc claims for cash analysis,asserting that the mere fact that the claimants net equity is determined by the amount of cash paid for the securities does not mean that the claimants have claims for cash within the meaning of section a.br.for amicus curiae sec at.although it notes that the sipc desire for consistency among the various provisions of sipa is not an unreasonable approach,the sec argues that the provisions relied upon by sipc to supply this definition do not mention the terms claim for cash or claim for securities.id.at.in fact,the net equity definition,see,upon which sipc heavily relies,does not even use the word cash.none of the provisions relied upon by sipc illuminate the definition of a claim for cash.
the sec interpretation furthers sipa investor protection goals 
examination of sipa legislative history reveals that the sec interpretation is better tailored to the original aims of sipa drafters.congress enacted sipa in,in response to a rash of failures among securities in the late that had resulted in significant losses to customers whose assets either were unrecoverable or became tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings.sec.investor prot.bdo seidman,llp,cir.the statute was designed to effect two aims,at,reprinted in.first,the legislation immediately established a substantial reserve fund to provide protection to customers of to reinforce the confidence that investors have in the securities markets.id.second,sipa strengthen ed the financial responsibilities of.id.later amendments to the statute have reiterated this emphasis on investor protection.in,the statute was amended to,inter alia,increase the amounts available to be distributed in liquidations to each customer from to no more than instead of the present is available to satisfy claims for cash,at,reprinted in.these and other changes included in the amendments were intended to address the perceived limitations upon sipc ability to provide the type and degree of protection for securities customers for which sipa was enacted.specifically,these limitations in some cases impair the satisfaction of customers claims as fully,promptly and efficiently as the committee believes is desirable.id.these statutory investor confidence and providing protection to better served by the sec broader reading of section a see tcherepnin knight,d we are guided by the familiar canon of statutory construction that remedial legislation should be construed broadly to effectuate its purposes.interpreting the securities exchange act.
the legislative history of section a of sipa supports the sec interpretation 
the distinction between claims for cash and claims for securities in section a was introduced into sipa shortly before the legislation was passed.it appears to have been intended to address concerns raised during the drafting process by the department of the treasury and the board of governors of the federal reserve.in april,the acting general counsel of the department of the treasury sent letters to the chairmen of the relevant committees of both the senate and the house stating that treasury opposed the bills,in part because the proposed limit on cash advances of per account far exceeded the limit per account on coverage provided by fdic and fslic,and,thus,could be construed as an indication that the federal government attaches greater importance to the preservation of public confidence in than to the preservation of confidence in the banking system.federal insurance corporation hearings on,and before the subcomm.on sec.of the senate comm.on banking and currency,cong.letter from englert to sparkman securities investor protection hearings on,and before the subcomm.on commerce and fin.of the house comm.on interstate and foreign commerce,cong.hereinafter house subcommittee hearings letter from englert to staggers.the vice chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve system made a similar the proposed sipc insurance would be more generous than coverage afforded depositors under the fdic and a july letter to the house committee.house subcommittee hearings,supra,at letter from robertson to staggers.he indicated,however,that the federal reserve board recognized that coverage of customers of can not be entirely parallel to that afforded depositors in banks,because the broker performs a custodial an integral part of customer account holding customers fully paid securities in safekeeping.id.he proceeded to explain that t he accounts of customers of thus reflect partly depository claims credit balances comparable to claims insured by the fdic and partly custodial claims comparable not to deposits but to bank trust accounts.id.
notwithstanding this disparity,both bills emerged from their respective committees without modification of the limit,see cong.rec,draft of,cong.e id.at,draft of,cong.m,and the house bill containing the limit was passed on december,id.at.at a december debate,however,the senate adopted an amendment proposed by senators mcintyre and muskie to reduce the maximum protection for all sipa claims from to in order to bring investor protection in line with the protections which the congress has already made available to depositors in banks and shareholders in savings and loan associations.id.at statement of mcintyre.another senator,after observing that it was reasonable to reduce the coverage for cash to to bring it in line with the insurance coverage for cash deposits in other institutions,inquired whether it might be more acceptable and more efficient in restoring confidence if the figure in the original bill with respect to securities only were left at and the applied to the cash.id.statement of bennett.after considerable debate,the senate passed the amended all claims to with an understanding that the issue of a provision with separate limits for cash and securities would receive further examination in conference.id.at.
shortly thereafter,the conference committee reported that it had adopted the system envisioned during the senate debates,distinguishing the amount of protection available for securities claims from that available for cash claims.conf,at,reprinted in,the conference substitute continues the limitation,but provides further that,insofar as all or any portion of a customer claim is for cash as distinct from securities,the amount advanced for such claim to cash shall not exceed.the revised bill was passed by both chambers and signed into law on december.
in light of this history,we are persuaded by the sec view that the dichotomy between claims for cash and claims for securities in section a of sipa,a,was introduced to distinguish the custodial functions of a with respect to securities from the functions with respect to cash deposits.br.for amicus curiae sec at.the claims for cash in section a was intended to limit the protection of a brokerage firm customer who uses his account as a depository for cash to the same protection for that cash that bank depositors receive under fdic coverage.id.adopting this view of the statute,we find that because the claimants directed that the money they placed with the debtors be used to purchase,importantly,because they received confirmations and account statements reflecting such are not the types of cash depositors envisioned by the drafters of the claims for cash provision.
the series rules support an outcome based on the claimants legitimate expectations 
as a final source of support for its position,the sec cites the series rules.under the series rules,whether a claim is treated as one for securities or cash depends not on what is actually in the customer account but on what the customer has been told by the debtor in written confirmations.thus,if the debtor sends a written confirmation to the customer that the securities in the customer account have been sold,then the customer has a claim for cash,even if the sale never took place unless there is a contract for the sale.a.the customer is also viewed as having a claim for cash even if he or she placed an order for the purchase of securities unless i the debtor has sent a written confirmation of the purchase or
