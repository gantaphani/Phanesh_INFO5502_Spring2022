toys r us,toys sells not only toys for tots but also maintains investments in financial instruments,including debt securities and repurchase agreements.as a nationwide purveyor of toys,toys pays state income tax proportionate to its profits in each state.in california,a retailer tax obligation is based on an apportionment formula the average of three fractions to arrive at a percentage that is then multiplied times the corporation worldwide income to determine the amount of income apportioned to california.the three fractions are california payroll divided by worldwide payroll,california property divided by worldwide property,and california sales divided by worldwide sales.toys challenges the calculation of the sales fraction of the equation,arguing the worldwide sales figure should include not only the interest earned by its financial investments but also the principal amount of these investments.since toys financial arm operates out of the state of delaware,the principal and interest income would inure to the worldwide sales figure and,accordingly,significantly reduce the amount of income apportioned to california.
toys filed a complaint for refund of taxes,requesting a refund of taxes and interest paid to defendant franchise tax board ftb.the complaint alleged toys was entitled to a refund on the ground that all gross receipts received by toys from the sale of financial instruments must be included in the apportionment factor.following a court trial,the trial court found in favor of the ftb.toys appeals,contending the trial court erred in interpreting the revenue and taxation code.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
toys sells children toys,games,and furniture through its chain of toys r us stores during the years at issue,toys maintained a treasury department in new jersey.the treasury department managed toys investments in repurchase agreements and debt securities held to maturity,referred to as financial instruments.
for a portion of the relevant period,the treasury department directly invested funds for toys according to investment guidelines established by toys.for the remainder of the period,toys engaged an outside brokerage firm to assist in the management of its financial instruments.toys financial instruments are usual,ordinary,and recurring transactions for toys.
not surprisingly,toy sales peak during the christmas season.retailers manage cash from christmas sales to build inventory through the summer and fall to prepare for the next christmas season.at toys,its treasury department manages this excess cash.
the treasury department invested toys excess cash with the objective of maximizing yield while maintaining liquidity as needed for the business.during the years in question,toys reported the income earned from its financial instruments as business income.this income was apportioned to california based on the apportionment formula set forth in revenue and taxation code section et 
in july toys filed a complaint for refund of taxes for the income years ending february,february,january,and january,in the amount of plus interest.the complaint alleged toys was entitled to a refund on the ground that all gross receipts received by toys from the sale of financial instruments must be included in toys sales factor under sections,subdivision e and.
a court trial followed.toys presented two witnesses.jon kimmins,toys senior vice,testified he was responsible for toys capital structure and cash management during the relevant period.kimmins explained the operation of toys treasury department and the necessity for cash management in the cyclical toy business.kimmins stated investments were made based upon the rate of return and the duration of the investment.
richard pomp,a professor of tax law,testified as an expert witness.professor pomp opined there was no principled reason under tax policy why the gross receipts from the disposition of financial instruments should be treated any differently than the gross receipts from the disposition of inventory,which is fully includable as gross in the sales factor.
under professor pomp analysis,the company has a certain amount of cash at the end of the day.the company can convert the cash into inventory,a doll for example,and sell it the following day.however,if conversion to inventory is not a good use of the money,the company can instead invest the cash in a financial instrument.as professor pomp explained that these are alternatives,and one of the functions of the treasurer is to decide what the best use of that cash might be.and i guess i see a financial asset as a competitor for inventory.and each one,in a sense,is using the funds generated by the business.each one is an investment,one in an inventory and one in a financial asset.each one gets turned over in some period of time the financial instruments generate a margin that could be true of toys too or in the case of diapers,no profit margin.so i guess i see that the money being fungible,all of this just would generate the income which now the state is taxing i do see any fundamental difference in the gross receipt generated by a financial instrument or by a cabbage patch doll.
the ftb presented testimony by steven sheffrin,an economics professor.professor sheffrin testified regarding whether the inclusion of the total amount received from the financial investment transactions would fairly represent toys business activity in california.
sheffrin,in forming his opinion,made a number of calculations based on the data in the toys annual reports and the stipulations between the parties.in,for every dollar of sales of toys,clothes,and furniture,toys generated about cents of gross profit.if gross receipts are included in the return of principal,then for every dollar of sales in the treasury function,toys generated about cents of gross profit.the ratio of these two numbers is approximately.this meant the retail sales portion of the business generated times more gross profit than the treasury function.
sheffrin next compared the ratio of net income before taxes to sales and determined that for every dollar of sales,the profit was cents.the ratio here was,meaning that the sales in a store are times more powerful in terms of generating income than the treasury function.
sheffrin then testified as to the potential effect of including the return of principal from investments in the sales factor.for,if the principal is included in total receipts,they would constitute about percent of all receipts.if this number is divided by,because of the apportionment formula,the number is.if the treasury function were moved from new jersey to new york,percent of toys apportionable income would be moved from new jersey to new york.in sheffrin opinion,it was implausible that by simply moving six employees responsible for the treasury function,toys could move percent of its income to another state.
sheffrin considered the remaining years and found similar results.for,retail sales generated times more net income before taxes than the treasury function.toys stores in california constituted about percent of its total stores.this percentage is close to the sales factor percentage for california under the ftb interpretation of the statute.if the return of principal is included in gross receipts,the treasury function constitutes percent of total receipts.when divided by,as in the apportionment formula,the treasury function equals percent.sheffrin testified this meant that by moving six employees to another state,toys could move percent of its apportionable income to another state.
for,retail sales generated times more gross income per dollar of sales than the treasury function.retail sales generated times more net income before taxes per dollar of sales than the treasury function.toys stores in california constituted about percent of total stores,a percentage close to the sales factor percentage under the ftb analysis.if the return of principal is included in gross receipts,the treasury function would constitute percent of total receipts,or percent when divided by.again,sheffrin testified that under this analysis,by moving six employees to another state toys could move percent of its apportionable income to another state.when sheffrin applied this analysis to,he reached similar results 
the trial court issued a ruling on submitted matter in favor of the ftb.the court began by considering the meaning of sale,concluding the term sales must be a function,or derivative,of gross receipts.therefore,if no sale has occurred,no gross receipts have been produced.if that is true,then toys return of principal from its paper can not reasonably be deemed to be gross receipts from sales,since toys was not selling anything when they invested their spare cash.interest is not received from the sale of money.
the court reviewed the statutory scheme and found the sales factor is included in the apportionment formula in order to reflect the market for the taxpayer goods and services.citation.no market is exploited by engaging investments.the return of capital thereon has everything to do with the repayment of toys lent funds,and virtually nothing to do with selling toys or children clothing.clearly,inclusion of toys return of principal does not serve to accomplish the basic function of the sales factor and thus can not be included in its total sales.
the court concluded the term gross receipts in section,subdivision e could not be construed to include the return of working capital from toys investment in financial instruments because to do so ignores economic reality,conflicts with the goal of uditpa and could lead to unreasonable or absurd results.in addition,the court found the inclusion of the gross receipts as urged by toys would not fairly represent the extent of the corporation business in the state.
following entry of judgment,toys filed a timely notice of appeal.

ii.apportionment under section,subdivision e 
the statutory scheme 
california employs the unitary method of corporate income taxation.under this method,the state calculates its tax base by first defining the scope of the unitary business of which the taxpayer activities in california form a part.the state then apportions the business income of that unitary business between california and the rest of the world on the basis of a formula taking into account objective measures of the corporation activities within and without the jurisdiction.hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,d,hoechst.
california taxes a portion of the business income of a taxpayer engaged in a unitary business california uses an objective formula to apportion the income to california.the percentage of income apportioned to california is an average of three fractions the first fraction,known as the property factor,has a numerator of the average value of california real and tangible personal property and a denominator of all real and tangible personal property.the second fraction is the payroll factor,which is the total amount of compensation paid by the taxpayer in california divided by the total compensation paid everywhere.the third fraction is the sales factor,which is the total sales in california divided by the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the income year.each fraction has a numerator representing the amount attributable to california and a denominator representing the worldwide amount.citicorp north america,franchise tax bd.th,d.
here,the parties dispute the amount to be included in the denominator of the sales factor.section provides the sales factor is a fraction,the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the income year,and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the income year.section,subdivision e defines sales as all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated under sections through of this code.
construing statutes 
in determining another provision of the uditpa,the supreme court outlined the rules of statutory construction to construe this definition,we apply the rules of statutory construction and seek to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.as always,we begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,then we need go no further.citation.if,however,the language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,then we look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.where the legislature adopts a uniform act,the history surrounding the creation and adoption of that act is also relevant.hoechst,supra,cal th at,d.
with these precepts in mind,we consider the parties gloss on gross receipts.
the parties positions 
the phrase all gross receipts forms the eye of this appellate hurricane.toys argues the total amounts,both interest and principal,earned by its financial interests constitute gross receipts to be included in the sales denominator.toys contends the plain language of the statute mandates that all gross receipts include the interest and principal received on the sale of investments.
according to toys,the plain language of section,subdivision e states that sales means all gross receipts.dictionary definitions reveal gross to mean consisting of an overall total exclusive of deductions and receipts to mean t he amount or quantity received.this language,toys argues,is clear and unambiguous the total amounts received by toys from the sale of its financial instruments should be included in gross receipts for the sales apportionment factor.
the ftb disagrees,contending that only the interest earned on the financial instruments constitutes gross receipts under the statute.according to the ftb in the case of transactions which are not sales of property,but which generate receipts,the portion which is the receipt should be the consideration received by the taxpayer.the amount of consideration received is determined by looking at the exchange from the transactions.the transactions in question were loans.the nature and purpose of the transactions was to earn income to support the business while retaining liquidity to meet business needs.citation.toys bought debt securities and held them to maturity.citation.toys also entered into repurchase agreements and held them to disposition.citation.these transactions were in government securities.citation.in essence,toys loaned money and at the end of the loan term albeit a short term,toys received back the amount loaned plus interest.
gross receipts 
a variety of courts have grappled with the definition of gross receipts in the apportionment formula in the uditpa,reflecting both toys and the ftb reading of the term.some courts find only net gains from the sale of investments are included in the sales factor.other courts conclude gross receipts refers to both the interest and the principal received on investments.a number of courts find gross receipts includes both the interest and principal but apply the equitable apportionment provision of section to preclude inclusion of the total revenues from sales.
historically,the treatment of receipts from temporary cash investments became a significant legal issue with the breakup of the american telephone telegraph at t communications system.at t possessed an enormous portfolio of investments,and inclusion of the principal in the allocation formula apportioned billions of dollars in income away from other taxing jurisdictions to new york state.consequently,a number of new jersey courts required at t and its subsidiaries to include only the net income from their temporary cash investments in the sales factor.
in american.director,div.of taxation,at t,the court considered whether proceeds from at t maturing securities and from its sales of securities should be included as gross receipts for purposes of new jersey receipts factor the court held we uphold as a general matter the exclusion of gross revenues received by plaintiff from the sale or maturity of investment paper.as the trial court observed,idle cash can be turned over repeatedly by investment in short term securities.it is no true reflection of the scope of at t business done within and without new jersey to allocate to the numerator or the denominator of the receipts fraction the full amount of money returned to at t upon the sale or redemption of investment paper.to include such receipts in the fraction would be comparable to measuring business activity by the amount of money that a taxpayer repeatedly deposited and withdrew from its own bank account.the bulk of funds flowing back to at t from investment paper was simply its own money.whatever other justification there is for excluding such revenues from the receipts fraction,it is sufficient to say that to do otherwise produces an absurd interpretation of the statute.it is axiomatic that a statute will not be construed to lead to absurd results.all rules of construction are subordinate to that obvious proposition.even the rule of strict construction does not mean that a ridiculous result shall be reached because some ingenious path may be found to that end.citation.id.at.
in indiana of state revenue,the indiana tax court reached a similar conclusion.the court reviewed the department of state revenue determination that apportionment can not include rolled over securities in the sales factor at issue was whether the denominator of sales factor should be increased to include the principal or capital element of investments.as in the present case,the answer turned on the definition of gross receipts.id.at.the court cited at t and concluded gross receipts for the purpose of the sales factor includes only the interest income,and not the rolled over capital or return of principal,realized from the sale of investment securities.thus,the department was correct in including only the interest earned as part of the total receipts in the denominator of the sales factor of the apportionment formula.id.at see also walgreen arizona drug of.
all of these cases focus on the absurd result of including both principal and income in gross receipts,a focus at least one commentator finds problematic.state taxation third edition by hellerstein and hellerstein criticizes the decision in at t and,by implication,other cases that reach the same result.they note from a policy perspective,the result the new jersey court reached is desirable,in view of the distortion in the apportionment that the inclusion of the proceeds of the very large sales of investments produced.the statutory provisions that the court construed,however,do not support the holding.the limitations of receipts from the sales in question to the profits is inconsistent with the inclusion of the entire gross proceeds of other transactions,such as receipts from sales of inventory,in the sales factor.both types of transactions are governed by the same statutory measure receipts from sales of tangible personal property and all other business receipts.the court view that the inclusion of the receipts from the investments would produce absurd results suggests that this may have been an appropriate case for the invocation of the equitable apportionment provision of the statute,which is the basis for other court opinions hellerstein hellerstein,state taxation ed westlaw,wl,c i,fn.
some courts have concluded the plain meaning of the sales factor statute requires that total gross receipts should include the total sale of investments.appeal of merrill,lynch,pierce,fenner smith,sbe westlaw,wl illinois tool works,lindley ohio.
the treatment of the term gross receipts in cases finding the principal not included in the sales fraction of the equation is problematic.these cases link receipts to sales as a means of excluding the principal realized on investments.however,we have found no definition of gross receipts that implies any necessary connection between a sale and a receipt.one tax encyclopedia provides the following definition gross receipts ordinarily means total receipts before anything is deducted receipts from the business include receipts from incidental business carried on by the corporation in addition to its principal business.fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations as of westlaw,fns.omitted.
the term gross receipts does not appear ambiguous it means the total receipts taken in by a corporation.as one commentator notes,the sales factor in the apportionment formula has a much broader scope than receipts from sales of tangible personal property.it typically covers receipts from services,rentals,royalties,sales of stock,and business operations generally,at least in the absence of some specific statutory or regulatory limitation on its scope.hellerstein hellerstein,supra,at.thus defined,gross receipts necessarily includes the full amount realized on the redemption or sale of securities.only the invocation of the equitable apportionment provision under section,or legislative action,provides a satisfactory means of limiting gross receipts to interest 
equitable apportionment,section 
in the alternative,the ftb argues that inclusion of the return of principal from investments in the sales factor denominator does not clearly represent toys activity in california.at trial the ftb presented evidence in support of this position.the trial court found t he evidence produced at trial is compelling for this court to find that if the principal from toys transactions in paper is included in the denominator of the sales factor,then the income apportioned to california under the statutory apportionment formula does not fairly represent the extent of plaintiffs business activity in this state.
section states,in part if the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer business activity in this state,the taxpayer may petition for or the franchise tax board may require,if reasonable t he employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer income.
at the outset,the parties disagree over who bears the burden of proving whether or not section applies.toys places the burden squarely on the ftb to prove application of the standard apportionment formula does not fairly represent its business activity in california.the ftb,in return,claims toys bears the burden of proving the ftb use of an apportionment formula other than that provided for by the state is wrong.
as the ftb concedes,no california appellate court has addressed the question of who has the burden of proof under section.however,several state board of equalization sbe cases have determined that the party seeking to deviate from the statutory allocation formula bears the burden of proving the use of the normal formula does not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer activity in california.appeals of bank of tokyo sbe westlaw,wl appeal of aimor sbe westlaw,wl appeal of california first bank sbe westlaw,wl appeal of new york football giants,sbe westlaw,wl.for the reasons expressed below,we conclude the ftb has met this burden.
the sbe has noted that showing distortion in the standard formula is a difficult hurdle to overcome.however,section must be analyzed on a basis there is no bright line rule that det
