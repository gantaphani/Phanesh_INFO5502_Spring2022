glen benussi was found guilty after a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york lewis kaplan,judge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,see a,wire fraud,see,and commercial bribery,see a,in violation of.he now appeals from a final judgment of conviction pronounced on july,and entered on july,sentencing him to five years incarceration,a term of supervised release,in restitution,and a special assessment.benussi is presently released on bail pending resolution of this appeal.
in urging this court to reverse or vacate his conviction,benussi does not dispute his knowing and intentional participation in the charged conspiracy.instead,he challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of proof that the conspiracy operated within five years of his may,indictment,as required by the applicable statute of limitations.see a.presented with substantially this same challenge in a motion for a new trial,see,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations was satisfied by evidence that benussi,louis pasciuto had received fraud proceeds on and after may.see united states benussi,d.
in challenging this ruling on appeal,benussi argues that pasciuto passive receipt of fraud proceeds can not,as a matter of law,establish the conspiracy continuance into the limitations period the trial evidence was,in any event,insufficient to prove pasciuto knowing receipt of such proceeds the prosecution reliance on pasciuto receipt of proceeds,an overt act not charged in the indictment,constituted either an impermissible constructive amendment of the indictment or a prejudicial variance in proof the fifth superseding indictment on which benussi was tried,see united states fiore,cr.lak indictment hereafter indictment or,was untimely because it did not relate back to the may,second superseding indictment in which benussi was initially named,see united states fiore,cr.lak indictment hereafter indictment or and a new trial is required because the general verdict of guilty makes it impossible to determine if the jury relied upon untenable legal theories.
we conclude that none of these claims has merit.we hold that when a member of a conspiracy whose purpose is economic profit knowingly receives a share of the scheme anticipated proceeds,whether actively by holding out his hand or passively by holding out his brokerage account,that conspirator engages in an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy the trial evidence in this case sufficed to support a reasonable jury finding that pasciuto did knowingly receive conspiracy proceeds into a brokerage account under his control within the statutory limitations period because the indictment specifically alleged that the conspiracy extended through the conspirators receipt of proceeds,the government reliance on unpleaded overt acts of receipt to satisfy the statute of limitations constituted neither a constructive amendment of the indictment nor an impermissible variance in proof because indictment did not materially broaden or substantially amend indictment,it properly related back to the earlier pleading and no new trial is warranted where,as in this case,any deficiencies in one theory of guilt are factual rather than legal and sufficient evidence supports a guilty verdict on an alternative theory.
background 
a.the conspiracy to pump and dump securities 
on may,glen benussi was first charged,together with ten,with conspiracy to commit securities fraud,wire fraud,and commercial bribery in connection with the initial public stock offerings of two businesses,gaylord companies gaylord and environmental corporation.see indictment.the conspiracy,a variation on the classic pump and dump persons holding certain securities fraudulently inflate their price the pump in order to sell at an artificial profit the dump is described in detail in judge kaplan comprehensive opinion denying benussi rule motion.see united states benussi,d at.we assume familiarity with that opinion and here review only the facts necessary to our discussion of the issues on appeal.
in the fall of,glen benussi,together with three other principals of nationwide securities nationwide,opened a manhattan branch office and agreed to underwrite the initial public offering of shares of gaylord common stock.the offering plan provided for stock to be sold at per share,with purchasers also offered two warrants per share at a cost of each.each warrant entitled its holder to buy an additional share of gaylord common stock at the offering price during the period between october,and october.
instead of following this plan,benussi and his confederates secretly agreed to strip one warrant from each stock unit.the nationwide principals divided most of these warrants among themselves,using the remainder to bribe brokers to assist in their scheme to inflate the market price of the gaylord securities,thereby ensuring significant profits when the conspirators sold their stripped warrants.meanwhile,the conspirators generally concealed their interests in the stripped warrants by using nominee accounts under their control.for example,benussi traded stripped warrants in nationwide accounts in his wife maiden name,as well as in the names of two offshore corporations,barson holdings,and rum united.louis pasciuto,a nationwide broker,traded stripped warrants in nationwide accounts in the name of his subsequently,his wife,stefanie feehan.
in february,the conspirators repeated this scheme in connection with the public offering of shares of common stock.once again,the offering plan permitted customers to purchase one share of stock,this time at per share,together with two warrants at each.the conspirators again stripped one warrant from each unit,distributed these stripped warrants among themselves,and fraudulently manipulated the market price of securities to inflate the value of their warrants.
sale of the stripped warrants 
in order not to alert market attention to their scheme,the conspirators agreed not to sell their stripped warrants until trading was approved by nationwide principal marco fiore.in the case of the gaylord warrants,fiore approval came in,a short time after the public offering in the case of the warrants,fiore authorized sale on february,the same day the public offering took effect.
trading records show that the conspirators did not dispose of their shares in single blocks,but usually employed a series of transactions,often over several months.for example,benussi used seven transactions in two nominee accounts between november and january,to sell approximately gaylord warrants at prices ranging from to per warrant.on the other hand,benussi sold all of his warrants on february,the day he acquired them,using four transactions in three nominee accounts,for which he received from to per warrant.other conspirators,however,paced their sales over the course of the next few months.significantly,for purposes of the statute of limitations issue before us,louis pasciuto sold approximately warrants out of the stefanie feehan account through more than a dozen trades executed between may,and june.
overt acts within the limitations period 
of the ninety overt acts alleged in indictment,only one involved conduct during the limitations period on or about august,an unindicted caused a nationwide customer to sell approximately shares of common stock.indictment at.in indictment,the aforementioned overt act was deleted and three other timely overt acts were alleged 
pp.on or about may,louis pascuito caused a nationwide brokerage account in the name of pascuito girlfriend to sell approximately warrants at approximately per warrant.
qq.on or about may,louis pascuito caused a nationwide brokerage account in the name of pascuito girlfriend to sell approximately warrants at approximately per warrant.
rr.on or about june,louis pascuito caused a nationwide brokerage account in the name of pascuito girlfriend to sell approximately warrants at approximately per warrant.
indictment at.
in his rule motion to the district court,benussi argued that these unilateral warrant sales could not satisfy the statute of limitations because they evidenced no concerted activity by the conspirators.indeed,benussi submitted that the charged conspiracy had ended when the conspirators received their shares of the stripped warrants or,at the latest,in early april,when the conspirators stopped manipulating the gaylord and securities and nationwide manhattan office closed.the district court rejected these arguments,holding that the indictment alleged,and the evidence established,that the conspiracy extended through the conspirators receipt of profits from sales of the stripped warrants.see united states benussi,d at.
in reaching this conclusion,however,the district court identified a different concern with relying on the pleaded overt acts to satisfy the statute of limitations.specifically,it was unclear to the court whether the trades described in these overt acts actually involved stripped warrants acquired pursuant to the charged conspiracy.apparently,pasciuto had sold the majority of his stripped early march,leaving only stripped warrants in the feehan account at the start of may.the other warrants in the feehan account in may were the product of a fraudulent transfer that pasciuto had made in march from benussi rum united account.these warrants,however,had not been stripped from the initial stock offering rather,they had been purchased by pasciuto and certain nationwide principals on the open market earlier in the month with money appropriated from the rum united without benussi an effort to curb the securities price decline.as the district court observed,
even if the purchase of warrants in the rum account arguably was in furtherance of the conspiracy,it is not a rational inference that their subsequent theft,transfer,and eventual sale by one or more of the furthered the conspiratorial agreement with which benussi was charged.
id.at.nevertheless,the district court concluded that it had not been necessary for the jury to determine exactly which may warrant trades out of the feehan account involved the stripped warrants because trading records plainly showed that the feehan account received the proceeds for all may sales on or after may,citing this court opinion in united states ben zvi,cir,the district court ruled that such knowing receipt of conspiracy proceeds satisfied the requirement for an overt act within the limitations period.see united states benussi,d at.
ii.discussion 
a.a knowing receipt of conspiracy proceeds into a brokerage account under his control can constitute an overt act in furtherance of the charged scheme 
benussi asserts that receipt of conspiracy proceeds into the feehan account on or after may,can not,as a matter of law,bring the charged conspiracy within the statute of limitations.
when a conspiracy requires proof of an overt act,the government satisfies the statute of limitations,see a,if it establishes that the conspiracy operated within the period preceding the indictment,and a conspirator knowingly committed at least one overt act in furtherance of the scheme within that period.see grunewald united states,d united states ben zvi,at.benussi acknowledges this test but asserts that unilateral receipt of proceeds can not establish an ongoing conspiracy,and passive receipt of proceeds can not constitute an overt act in furtherance of the scheme.we review these legal claims de novo.see united states coriaty,cir.
in evaluating benussi twin challenges,we look to the scope of the charged conspiracy.as the supreme court explained in grunewald united states,at,the crucial question in determining whether the statute of limitations has run is the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,for it is that which determines both the duration of the conspiracy,and whether the act relied on as an overt act may properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.
a conspirator receipt of anticipated economic proceeds evidences the continued operation of a conspiracy 
benussi argues that the scope of the charged conspiracy extended only to the conspirators receipt of stripped warrants or,at the latest,to april,when their manipulation of the market for gaylord and warrants ended.he insists that the conspiracy alleged in the indictment did not extend to the conspirators unilateral sales of their stripped warrants after that april date.see appellant br.at.the argument,however,is not supported by the indictments,which specifically allege that the ultimate conspiratorial goal was the sale of fraudulently acquired and inflated securities and the receipt of substantial cash profits.in both indictments and,the grand jury states that defendants 
engaged in deceptive and manipulative sales practices in order to sell securities of the subject ipos to their retail customers,thus creating demand for,and increasing the price of,the securities,and enabling the defendants to sell the securities they controlled through the nominees at artificially inflated prices.as a result of this scheme,the defendants obtained illegal profits of not less than approximately million.
indictment at indictment at.
this court has consistently ruled that where a conspiracy purpose is economic enrichment,the jointly undertaken scheme continues through the conspirators receipt of their anticipated economic benefits.united states mennuti,cir accord united states laspina,cir united states ben zvi,at see also united states fletcher,cir united states knuckles,cir.this conclusion derives from the principles that a conspiracy continues until its aim has been achieved,it has been abandoned,or otherwise terminated,united states rucker,cir and absent withdrawal,a conspirator participation in a conspiracy is presumed to continue until the last overt act by any of the conspirators,united states diaz,cir internal quotation marks omitted and cases cited therein.
benussi argues that a conspirator receipt of anticipated economic benefits can not,as a matter of law,prove an ongoing conspiracy if he singularly controls when that receipt occurs in such a case,there must be some other evidence of concerted activity.his only support for this assertion is an observation in united states roshko,cir,that the defendant in united states mennuti had acted in concert with the other conspirators after the completion of the underlying mail fraud offense in order to further the conspirators general criminal objective of securing an economic windfall for themselves.
in fact,this statement is dictum,intended neither to support the actual holding in roshko nor to limit the payoff principle articulated in mennuti.indeed,roshko acknowledged that it makes a good deal of sense to view conspiracies for economic gain as continuing until the conspirators receive their anticipated economic benefits because the receipt of such benefits is the sole reason the conspirators become involved in the scheme.roshko,at quoting united states mennuti,at.the court simply found the payoff analogy inapt when applied to conspiracies with goals.
the pleaded purpose of the roshko conspiracy was procurement of resident alien status for meir roshko through a fraudulent marriage,an end achieved outside the statutory limitations period.to avoid dismissal,the prosecution,relying on mennuti,argued that the conspiracy extended to roshko subsequent divorce,his remarriage,and his second wife adjustment of her immigration status,the last event being roshko payoff for her participation in the charged conspiracy.the court disagreed,not,as benussi suggests,because the conspirators failed to engage in any concerted action during the limitations period,but because their actions within that time frame simply were not in furtherance of the conspiracy pleaded purpose.see id.at t he grand jury did not allege that irene roshko acquisition of permanent resident status was an object of the conspiracy meir acquisition of a green card was the object of the conspiracy alleged in this indictment.the subsequent alleged overt divorce and his marriage to superfluous to the success of that object.
in benussi case,not only was the charged conspiracy economically motivated,the indictment specifically pleaded the receipt of such gain as the ultimate object of the jointly undertaken scheme.see indictment at indictment at as a result of this scheme,the defendants obtained illegal profits of not less than approximately million.thus,roshko,no less than mennuti,supports the conclusion that the scope of the conspiracy in this case continued through both the conspirators sale of the stripped warrants and their receipt of profits.
benussi citation to united states doherty,cir,does not alter our conclusion.in that case,although a pleaded objective of the charged conspiracy was the salary increase that would accompany a fraudulently procured police promotion,the first circuit rejected the government argument that each salary payment constituted a new overt act by the defendant.judge breyer,writing for the court,observed that payoffs could reasonably be viewed as part of a conspiracy where their receipt consists of one action,or a handful of actions,taking place over a limited period of time,or where some evidence exists that the special dangers attendant to conspiracies remain present until the payoff is received.id.at.but no such conclusion was warranted where receiving the payoff merely consists of a lengthy,indefinite series of ordinary,typically noncriminal,unilateral actions,such as receiving salary payments,and there is no evidence that any concerted activity posing the special societal dangers of conspiracy is still taking place.id.emphasis in original.
were this court to follow doherty,benussi would not benefit because,in his case,the conspirators receipt of profits fits more comfortably into the former doherty category than the latter.although the conspirators sales of stripped warrants numbered more than a handful,they were hardly indefinite in number or lengthy in duration.indeed,it appears that all the stripped warrants were sold within ten weeks of the public offering and within four weeks of the closing of the nationwide manhattan office.this is not surprising.implicit in the conspiratorial scheme was an understanding that the receipt of benefits depended on selling the stripped warrants before their inflated market price collapsed.pasciuto may warrant sales out of the feehan account and his receipt of benefits on and after may,fall within this understanding.
in sum,because a conspiracy continues so long as overt acts in furtherance of its purposes are done,united states rucker,at because receipt of anticipated profits is an overt act in furtherance of an conspiracy,see,united states ben zvi,at and because an overt act may be committed by only a single one of the conspirators,braverman united states.see also united states diaz,at,we reject benussi argument that,as a matter of law,a single conspirator receipt of anticipated benefits within the limitations period can not,by itself,establish an ongoing conspiracy,see generally united states laspina,at holding that where conduct falls within scope of criminal agreement,conspiracy continues as long as one or more conspirators engage in such conduct.
a conspirator passive receipt of proceeds can constitute an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy when such receipt is knowing and intentional 
citing our statement in ben zvi that t o constitute an overt act for purposes of the statute of limitations the act must involve some affirmative conduct or deliberate omission,united states ben zvi,at,benussi submits that the passive receipt of profits into the feehan account on and after may,can not,as a matter of law,constitute the affirmative overt act necessary to satisfy the statute of limitations.we disagree.
in ben zvi,this court made plain that when the object of a conspiracy is economic profit,defendants engage in the necessary affirmative conduct and,therefore,commit the required overt act when they knowingly take possession of their share of that profit.the ben zvi conspirators schemed to defraud their insurer by staging a robbery of their own jewelry store.to determine whether the government satisfied the statute of limitations,the court considered two overt acts.the first charged luiz ben zvi with causing an electronic funds transfer to be made from lloyd of london to lloyd new york attorney.the second charged ben zvi and her brother with causing checks to be drawn from the lawyer bank account to pay their insurance claim.the court ruled that the first transfer did not constitute an overt act by ben zvi because though precipitated by earlier fraudulent acts and omissions of defendant and her coconspirators,it did not involve or otherwise turn on any identifiable act or omission of the conspirators as of the time of the wire transfer.id.although the second act similarly involved a financial transfer by an innocent third party precipitated by the defendants,the court identified an important difference the defendants themselves received the check,which was made payable to their jewelry business.because this check represented the anticipated economic benefits of the conspiracy,the court ruled that its knowing receipt by the defendant and her constituted overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.at 
benussi submits that ben zvi is distinguishable because the conspirators there took physical possession of the anticipated proceeds.but the case does not indicate whether the manner of receipt was by the conspirators own hands,through a clerical employee,through an attorney or accountant,by direct deposit to the conspirators business account.indeed,the means by which a conspirator takes possession of his share of the scheme proceeds is not determinative of his commission of an overt act.a street thief or bank robber may well receive his share of criminal proceeds in hand a more sophisticated schemer may arrange for fraud proceeds to be wired to his bank or brokerage,as in this case,that of his nominee.in each case,what establishes the receipt as an overt act is not whether the conspirator conduct can be labeled active or passive,but whether the receipt was knowing and intentional.see united states ben zvi,at finding defendants knowing receipt of conspiratorial proceeds to satisfy overt act requirement.the unwitting receipt of criminal proceeds can not,after all,constitute an overt act.see united states floyd,cir.the requisite knowledge and intent to possess such proceeds,not the means employed to take possession,are the decisive factors in establishing a conspirator affirmative receipt of the proceeds or,at the least,his deliberate failure to renounce them.ben zvi,at.
we therefore reject benussi legal challenge and hold that a conspirator knowing receipt of criminal proceeds achieved passively through a wire transfer into an account under his control can satisfy the overt act element of conspiracy.
trial evidence established pasciuto knowing receipt of conspiracy proceeds within the statute of limitations 
benussi submits that the trial evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that pasciuto knowingly received conspiracy proceeds through the feehan account on or after may.in assessing a factual sufficiency challenge,we review the evidence in its totality,see united states autuori,cir,and in the light most favorable to the prosecution,see united states berger,cir,mindful that the task of choosing among permissible competing inferences is for the jury,not a reviewing court,see united states morrison,cir.we will affirm the jury guilty verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d emphasis in original accord united states best,cir.
applying this standard of review,we reach the same conclusion as judge kaplan there was ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could have concluded that pasciuto knowingly received payments for the sale of warrants in the feehan account on and after may.united states benussi,d at.specifically,evidence of pasciuto active participation in the pump phase of the conspiracy established his strong motive to dump stripped warrants at inflated prices.trial evidence further revealed that the conspirators almost uniformly used nominee accounts at nationwide to hold their stripped warrants and to receive profits from the sales thereof.pasciuto wife,stefanie feehan,testified that she did not open the nationwide account in her name out of which thousands of stripped warrants were sold throughout the spring of rather,pasciuto advised her that he had opened this account.feehan identified pasciuto handwriting on the account forged signature cards as well as on a related check.she further testified that she had never traded in the account,but when she received proceeds from any transactions therein,she gave them either to pasciuto or,at his direction,to other persons.
we must assume not only that the jury credited feehan testimony,but that it drew all reasonable inferences therefrom in the prosecution favor.see united states walker,cir.thus,although feehan may not have offered direct evidence of pasciuto may sale of warrants from her account or of the subsequent receipt of benefits from those sales,we conclude that the evidence of pasciuto overall control of the account together with his active role in the conspiracy sufficed to support a reasonable jury inference that pasciuto knowingly received those proceeds and,thereby,committed an overt act in furtherance of the charged conspiracy within the limitations period.see united states ben zvi,at.
proof of pasciuto unalleged overt acts within the limitations period did not constitute a constructive amendment of the indictment or an impermissible variance in proof 
benussi argues that the government can not satisfy the statute of limitations by proof of an unalleged overt act.specifically,he submits that the prosecutor reliance on pasciuto unalleged receipt of conspiracy proceeds on and after may,violated due process by constructively amending the indictment or,alternatively,by creating a prejudicial variance between the indictment and the proof adduced at trial.
proof of an unalleged overt act can satisfy the statute of limitations provided defendant has fair notice 
in united states frank,this court reaffirmed the rule of this and other circuits that the overt act element of a conspiracy charge may be satisfied by an overt act that is not specified in the indictment,at least so long there is no prejudice to the defendant,cir and cases cited therein accord united states laspina,at it is clear the government may offer proof of acts not included within the indictment,as long as they are within the scope of the conspiracy.internal quotation marks omitted.as we explained in united states armone,a principal reason for the overt act requirement in a conspiracy prosecution is simply to manifest that the conspiracy is at work,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,as long as defendant is given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,this court has afforded the prosecution significant flexibility to prove the conspiracy operation through both unalleged and alleged overt acts.united states frank,at internal quotation marks omitted.
benussi does not attack this principle as it applies to the general overt act element of conspiracy.instead,he submits that the principle should not extend to overt acts used to satisfy the statute of limitations.see generally united states davis,cir holding that conspiracy operation within statute of limitations must be proved by an overt act alleged in the indictment.this court expressly rejected an identical argument in united states frank,holding we see no reason to devise a special rule for the statute of limitations requirement that is different from the rule governing the overt act element.at.benussi urges us to reconsider frank on the ground that the statute of limitations serves a special,to protect against stale can be met only by requiring proof of a specifically pleaded overt act.
of course,this panel can not refuse to follow frank unless and until its holding is overruled by our court en banc or by the supreme court.see jones coughlin,cir.in any event,benussi argument that proof of a pleaded overt act is necessary to serve the staleness concerns of the statute of limitations overlooks the fact that statutes of limitations presumably serve the same purpose for conspiracies without overt act requirements.see,united states spero,cir noting that racketeering conspiracy,see d,does not require proof of an overt act united states grammatikos,cir holding that conspiracies to import or distribute controlled substances,see,do not require overt acts to be pleaded or proved.in such cases,once the government proves the conspiracy existence,the scheme continued operation into the limitations period is presumed,see united states spero,at,without the jury having to find proved the timely commission of any overt act,alleged or unalleged,see united states grammatikos,at.
this body of law reinforces frank conclusion that there is no sound reason to devise a special rule for overt acts as they relate to the statute of limitations.in the matter of the statute of limitations,as in the case of overt acts generally,the law principal concerns are that a defendant have fair and adequate notice of the charges against him and have suffered no undue prejudice as a result of the proof offered.united states frank,at.accordingly,the rule for pleading and proof remains the same the statute of limitations may be satisfied by proof of an overt act not explicitly listed in the indictment,as long as a defendant has had fair and adequate notice of the charge for which he is being tried,and he is not unduly prejudiced by the asserted variance in the proof.id.we address the question of fair notice in the next section.see id.at observing that issue of whether conspiracy may be proved by an unalleged overt act frequently reduces to the question whether there was a variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.
constructive amendment and variance 
benussi submits that even if an unalleged overt act can satisfy the statute of limitations,in his case the government impermissibly amended and varied the indictment by relying on evidence that the charged conspiracy continued by virtue of pasciuto sale of warrants whereas the indictment referred only to the sale of stolen warrants.appellant br.at.
constructive amendment 
to prevail on a constructive amendment claim,a defendant must demonstrate that either the proof at trial or the trial court jury instructions so altered an essential element of the charge that,upon review,it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand jury indictment.united states frank,at see also united states wallace,cir.where charges are constructively narrowed or where a generally framed indictment encompasses the specific legal theory or evidence used at trial,there is no constructive amendment.united states wallace,at internal quotation marks omitted stirone united states,d noting that indictment written in general terms may support conviction on alternative bases.in short,not all modifications constitute constructive amendments.in this case,the limitations element of the charged conspiracy required the prosecution to prove a timely overt act.but,as already discussed,the prosecution could carry its burden on this element by proving any alleged or unalleged overt act that fit within the core of criminality identified in the indictment.united states frank,at see also united states patino,cir citing approvingly united states robison,cir upholding c conviction where indictment charged use of a magnum but proof showed use of a shotgun,because the specific type of firearm used by the conspirator was not an essential element of the crime.
the core criminality pleaded in this indictment was a fraud scheme,operating between october and june,whose ultimate purpose was the conspirators realization of millions of dollars in illegal profits from their sales of inflated stripped warrants.see indictment at.indictment identified occasions on which conspirators,including pasciuto,engaged in the sale of such warrants.id.at.under these circumstances,proof of other unalleged sales of stripped warrants during the conspiratorial period hardly constitutes a constructive amendment of the pleadings.
contrary to the argument advanced on appeal by benussi,nowhere did the indictment allege that warrant sales within t
