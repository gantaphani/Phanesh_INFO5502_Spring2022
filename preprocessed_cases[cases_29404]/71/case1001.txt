defendant appellant carl jasper is the former chief financial officer cfo of maxim integrated products,a semiconductor company based in silicon valley.following revelations that the company had issued backdated stock options without properly expensing them the sec instituted this civil enforcement action against jasper,alleging that jasper violated various provisions of the securities laws.
the case proceeded to a jury trial the jury found in favor of the sec on most counts.as a result,the district court permanently enjoined jasper from future violations of the same provisions of the securities laws,barred him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for two years,and imposed a civil penalty of.the court also ordered,pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox,codified at,that jasper reimburse maxim for about million in bonuses and profits from the sale of maxim stock that jasper received during the period that he certified maxim false financial statements.
jasper appeals on three grounds.first,he contends that the district court made several evidentiary errors that require reversal.second,he contends that the sec lawyers committed misconduct during the trial that requires reversal.third,he contends that the reimbursement order pursuant to sox violated his seventh amendment right to a jury trial in civil cases.we affirm the district court in all respects.
background on options backdating 
the gravamen of the sec complaint in this case is the allegation that jasper engaged in a scheme to illegally stock options granted to maxim employees and directors,concealing millions of dollars in expenses from investors and significantly overstating the company income.thus,before turning to the facts and history of this case,we briefly explain the practice known as stock options backdating.
a stock option grants the recipient the opportunity to purchase a certain number of shares of company stock at a given price called the exercise price on or after a predetermined date.state inv.council ernst young llp,cir.the recipient may exercise the option by purchasing stock from the company at the exercise price,and he is then free to sell the same stock at its current market price.if the option is issued at an exercise price equal to the current market price,the option is referred to as having been issued at the money.conversely,an in the money option is issued at an exercise price that is lower than the current market price.this latter type of option is in the money because it is immediately profitable the price at which the stock may be bought is lower than the price at which it may be sold.last,an out of the money option is issued at an exercise price that is higher than the current market price.perhaps needless to say,none of the options at issue during trial were either at the money or out of the money.
during the time period relevant to this case,at the money and in the money options were treated differently for accounting purposes pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles gaap.for in the money options,accounting principles require the company to record an expense for the option recipient profit,the difference between the exercise price and the market price of an in the money option is treated as compensation to the option recipient over the vesting period.id.this is because the company could have sold its treasury stock at the market price,rather than grant an option on such stock to another.if the company does grant an option at a price below market,it is transferring a potential company profit to the option recipient.the difference between exercise price and market price must be added to the firm costs,usually as employee compensation,since the option recipients are usually employees.
backdating of options occurs when the company official responsible for administering a company stock option plan monitors the price of the company stock and awards an at the money stock option grant as of a certain date in the past when the share price was lowest.id.this lock s in the largest possible gain for the option recipient but also does not require the company to recognize as an expense the difference between the backdated exercise price and the market price of the stock as of the legitimate date of the option award.id.this practice is therefore akin to betting on a horse race after the horse has already crossed the finish line.id.backdating options is not in and of itself improper under the law or accounting principles,but it often leads to violations of the securities laws because i f the company does not properly record the options,then the company reported net income is overstated for each of the years the options vest,potentially deceiving the market and investors.id.that is what the jury found occurred here.
we relate the facts here in the way most favorable to the jury verdict.united states hicks,cir.
maxim is a semiconductor company listed on the nasdaq stock exchange.it is therefore required to file with the sec form q quarterly reports and form k annual reports,both of which must include audited financial statements,prepared in accordance with gaap.see.from until,jasper was maxim principal accounting officer,cfo,and vice president,and he was responsible for maxim accounting,including the accuracy of its financial statements and internal controls.during that time,maxim ceo,jack gifford,served as the interim option committee and had sole authority to grant stock options to directors and employees.approximately seventy percent of maxim employees received stock options when they were hired or as part of an annual review process.
the evidence showed that,from through,maxim employees and officers,including jasper,regularly backdated stock options granted to employees and directors,and that they created false paperwork to conceal the true grant dates for those options.for instance,for ten consecutive quarters,maxim granted backdated options with an exercise price equal to the lowest price of maxim stock for each quarter.sheila raymond,the manager of maxim stock administration program,testified that in that time period t he processes at the company,the way the company worked was to grant options at the lowest possible price without taking expense for it.
in september,following an internal investigation prompted by an analyst report,maxim announced that it was unable to file timely periodic reports because of the backdating investigation.in january,both jasper and ceo gifford resigned.after a lengthy investigation,on september,maxim announced that p reviously filed financial statements for our fiscal years ended in through should no longer be relied upon,and that earnings for those years had to be restated.in the restated document,known as the k,maxim disclosed an million reduction in its income for the period,which resulted primarily from the inclusion of million in additional expenses incurred as a result of compensation.of the million in misstated compensation expenses,the sec expert accountant testified that maxim operating income for fiscal years,and alone had been overstated by a minimum of million and as much as million due solely to failure to recognize the true expense of unrecorded,backdated stock options.
jasper was the cfo of maxim during this entire period,and,on appeal,he does not dispute his knowledge of or involvement in this fraudulent scheme.perhaps that is because the evidence is overwhelming.to take one specific example the record shows that in late february or early march of,when maxim stock was over per share,jasper sent a memorandum to ceo gifford proposing that to ensur e that a certain employee stays with maxim,gifford should grant the employee an option now at the oct price so that he gets a favorable price.the employee received an at the money options grant backdated to october,with an exercise price of.because of the roughly increase in the company stock price between october and march,the grant was immediately profitable for the employee,and therefore truly a company expense for employee compensation,but the difference between and per share was never recorded as a transfer of money otherwise readily available to maxim.
jasper signed all of maxim sec filings in that time period.the filings all stated that jasper had reviewed the k or q in question,and that the filings all fairly present in all material respects the financial condition,results of operations and cash flows of the company and do not contain any untrue statement s of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made,not misleading.jasper himself received more than million in bonuses from tied to the company profitability,including growth in stock price and earnings per share.
the case proceeded to a jury trial.the jury found that jasper committed fraud in violation of a,b,and sec rule,codified at b,when he participated in a scheme to maxim net income by failing properly to account for the issuance of backdated stock options aided and abetted maxim filing of materially false and misleading reports with the commission in violation a aided and abetted maxim failure to keep accurate books and records in violation of b a aided and abetted maxim failure to devise and maintain sufficient internal accounting controls in violation of b b falsified maxim books and records in violation of made false statements or omissions to an accountant or auditor in connection with a required audit of maxim financial statements in violation of and signed false certifications included with maxim quarterly or annual reports in violation of a.the jury also found jasper not liable on three counts.
as a result of the jury findings,the district court permanently enjoined jasper from future violations of the same provisions of the securities laws,barred him from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company for two years,imposed a civil penalty of,and ordered,pursuant to sox,that jasper reimburse maxim for million in bonuses and profits from the sale of maxim stock that jasper received during the period that he certified maxim false financial statements.
jasper timely appealed.
a.the evidentiary rulings 
jasper primary challenge on appeal is to three of the district court evidentiary rulings.a district court evidentiary rulings should not be reversed absent clear abuse of discretion and some prejudice.jauregui city of glendale,cir.the district court was within its discretion with all three rulings.
in a motion in limine,jasper moved to exclude any mention of the k which was actually released on september,long after jasper had resigned as cfo in january in which maxim restated its financial statements.the district court ruled the government could introduce the k into evidence.the court said that,if properly authenticated at trial,the k would be admissible under federal rule of evidence the business records exception to the hearsay rule because it was a report made at or near the time of the accounting review by those with knowledge of maxim books,and t he circumstances of its creation do not indicate that it lacks trustworthiness.the district court admitted maxim k only after alan hale,maxim interim cfo during the restatement process,laid a foundation for its admission.
on appeal,jasper contends that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit into evidence the k,because it was hearsay and not admissible under rule.according to jasper,the k should not have been admitted into evidence as a business record because t he restatement is not a record of historical facts prepared by people with personal knowledge,at or near the time of the events,who were just doing their ordinary jobs.it is the culmination of an extraordinary investigation costing tens of millions of dollars,and represents the technical accounting conclusions prepared many years after the facts,by teams of outside investigators and accountants with no personal knowledge,using newly promulgated accounting guidance.further,the preparation of the k took place in a context of tremendous liability risk,and was explicitly created with an eye toward pending litigation.
jasper argument fails.the k like virtually all ks was admissible as a business record so long as it was properly authenticated,which the k here was.jasper error is in arguing that the restated k was introduced as evidence of the state of mind of jasper during the relevant time periods.it was not.rather,as the district court found,it was introduced as a report made at or near the time of the accounting review by those with knowledge of maxim books.that is,the k is a business record of the accounting review itself,not of the misconduct that gave rise to the need for the restatement.it was a review of what the books of maxim showed for the period of the stock options backdating,a comparison of the exercise price to the market price when the options were actually granted,and the consequent to maxim.thus,with regard to the detailed accounting review,the restated k assuredly was prepared by people with personal knowledge,at or near the time of the events,who were just doing their ordinary jobs.framed this way,admission into evidence of ks restating prior earnings is a regular practice in the federal courts the vast majority of district courts to have considered this issue have found restated financial reports to be admissible on precisely those grounds.see,in re,wl,at,in re worldcom.sec,wl,at.
in opposition to the government position suggesting the admissibility of the restated k,jasper relies heavily on a single ninth circuit case,paddack dave christensen,cir.in paddack,this court held that a special audit commissioned because of suspected impropriety in past financial reporting was inadmissible as a business record.id.at.the special audit in paddack was a report of a single accounting firm and the accountants were not requested to undertake a traditional financial statement audit.id.at.the paddack court stated that when an accountant performs a financial statement audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards to express an opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements present financial position,results of operations,and changes in financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles it is it is generally admissible as a business record of the audited entity under.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
paddack supports our conclusion.the record here shows that the restated k was a paradigmatic financial statement audit and not a special audit.alan hale,the interim cfo who was in place during the filing of the k,testified as follows 
q as a company that wanted to have its shares publicly traded,was maxim required to prepare this annual report,the k 
q and as a company that wanted to have its shares publicly traded,was maxim required to prepare and provide to investors financial statements that complied with gaap,generally accepted accounting principles 
thus,because the financial statements in the k had to comply with gaap,that document falls into the category of admissible financial statement audits under paddack,not inadmissible special audits.
we also reject jasper contention that the k was explicitly created with an eye toward pending litigation and therefore should have been excluded.this argument has no limiting principle the filing of an accurate k was and continues to be a legal requirement for maxim.in today climate,the filing of any k can always subject companies to legal exposure.that is why lawyers pore over ks every year at substantial expense to shareholders.were this court to accept jasper contention,virtually every document a public company releases to the public would be inadmissible as a business record merely because companies are worried about litigation risks.that is not the law under the federal rules of evidence.
jasper also contends that the k should be excluded as improper expert testimony under rules and because of the accounting judgments involved.however,even assuming the k contained expert opinion,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit it without affirmatively stating that the requirements of rule were satisfied because rule expressly provides for the exclusion of a business record if the source of information indicates a lack of trustworthiness.see united states licavoli,cir.also,there is nothing in the record showing that jasper objected to any failure to disclose the k authors under.a or was prejudiced by it.there was no plain error in not excluding the k on that ground.united states sioux,cir plain error review proper when defendant did not raise the specific objection he now presses.
finally,jasper contends that the k scant probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under rule because it reflects an exercise of judgment under new accounting guidance,and because it encompasses more than just jasper charged conduct.however,the k is probative of the falsity of the previously filed documents and the magnitude of the corrections.that an exhibit contains ambiguities generally goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the evidence,united states scholl,cir,and the sec expert testified to the amount of restated compensation expense that was attributable to jasper involvement in the backdating scheme.
for these reasons,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to admit the k into evidence.
in two particular circumstances at trial,the district court allowed the sec to introduce evidence of jasper repeated invocation of the fifth amendment and instructed the jury that it could,but was not required to,draw an adverse inference from the invocations.the sec introduced a videotape of jasper deposition,where jasper repeatedly invoked the fifth amendment and the court also allowed the sec to introduce written discovery responses in which jasper invoked his fifth amendment rights an additional times.the discovery responses contained exchanges such as 
interrogatory from may,through january,please describe in detail the process by which option grants were made at maxim,including,without limitation,the identification of all relevant people,documents,and communications.
response jasper declines to respond personally based on his rights under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution,as described in his general objections above.we refer the sec,however,to jasper initial and supplemental disclosures under federal rule of civil procedure and to the documents,testimony,and other information uncovered during discovery in this matter.
both at the time of the evidence introduction and at the close of evidence,the district court instructed the jury about the proper way in which it could use the evidence.for instance,following the close of evidence,the district court instructed the jury that in civil cases,you are permitted,but not required,to draw the inference that the withheld information would have been unfavorable for the defendant.any inference you may draw should be based upon all of the facts and circumstances in this case as you find them.
the supreme court has previously stated that the fifth amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them.baxter palmigiano,d.however,because there is some tension between one party fifth amendment rights and the other party right to a fair proceeding,this court has held that there are certain limits on when a court in a civil case may give an adverse inference instruction that accompanies a witness invocation of the fifth amendment.doe ex rel.rudy glanzer glanzer,cir.in glanzer,this court stated that the tension between the fifth amendment and the need for a balanced trial in a civil case is resolved by a careful balancing of interests.id.at.the glanzer court said that courts should analyz e each instance where the adverse inference was drawn,or not drawn,on a basis under the microscope of the circumstances of that particular civil litigation.in each particular circumstance,the competing interests of the party asserting the privilege,and the party against whom the privilege is invoked must be carefully balanced.id.
on appeal,jasper does not object to the jury instructions,and,for what seems to be merely illustrative purposes,he registers one specific objection to the introduction of a particular statement of his and the accompanying adverse inference instruction instead,jasper criticizes the district court for supposedly abdicat ing its responsibility to scrutinize the admissibility of these invocations,and the permissible inferences from them,on a basis applying the test from glanzer and nationwide life ins.richards,cir.according to jasper,t his was an abuse of discretion,if that discretion was exercised at all.
while the admission of such a large number of fifth amendment invocations is unusual,we hold that the district court was within its discretion to admit them under these circumstances.jasper has no legal support for the proposition that a district court must make its evidentiary rulings and tailor its adverse inference instructions on a basis.the best jasper can do is cite this court statement in glanzer that t he court must analyze each instance where the adverse inference was drawn,or not drawn,on a basis under the microscope of the circumstances of that particular civil litigation.but jasper has no warrant for treating every individual question as an instance where the adverse inference was drawn under glanzer.as properly instructed,the jury could have concluded that the sum total of his fifth amendment invocations supported the adverse inference against him.
our conclusion is supported by the fact that,in district court,both parties generally treated each session in which jasper invoked the fifth amendment as a single invocation of his fifth amendment rights.that is,jasper,the sec,and the district court treated each round of questioning as a single instance of his invoking the privilege,not hundreds of instances,as he now characterizes it on appeal.
jasper filed an opposition to the sec motion in limine requesting that the deposition and written interrogatories be admitted into evidence,and also his own motion seeking to exclude the same evidence.the sec motion described at length the nature of the evidence the commission wished to admit,and jasper had access to the full transcripts of both sessions.yet in neither document does jasper single out any particular invocation in response to a question,along with an accompanying adverse inference,that would be improper.instead,jasper simply wanted to disable the sec from using any of this evidence,and jasper did not want the district court to issue any adverse inference instructions on appeal,however,he changes the level of detail,and he asks us to hold that each is a single invocation which must be analyzed separately and,one supposes,give rise to a separate jury instructions regarding the proper adverse inference.but he has no warrant for changing the level of generality so dramatically on appeal 
the district court also dealt with the evidence of invocation of the fifth amendment privilege at a high level of generality,and it instructed the jury to do the same.before playing the videotaped deposition,the district court instructed the jury as follows 
although you are permitted to draw a negative inference from the fact that the defendant asserts his fifth amendment privilege and silence in response to questions,you not required to do so.
now,because of the nature of this case,i might interrupt the playing of the videotape after i satisfied that you have had an opportunity to review the defendant and his invocation of the privilege.
in other words,we wo just allow the sec to play it,and the point to play it just to have you hear it repeated multiple times.but it is permissible for them to play enough of it so that you can understand the nature of the questions to which the privilege was invoked.
thus,the district court properly considered the propriety of the fifth amendment invocations precisely as they were presented to the court by both sides as a whole,with inferences to be permitted as a whole based on the nature of the questions to which the privilege was invoked.in these circumstances,and in view of jasper uniting his invocations into identified groupings of questions,it was not an abuse of discretion to treat the video and responses to interrogatories as general instances of jasper invocation of his fifth amendment rights,and then admit them into evidence and instruct the jury as such 
at trial,jasper attempted to introduce into evidence hearsay statements given by timothy ruehle,the former treasurer of maxim,as part of the early investigation of the backdating scandal.jasper could not call ruehle as a witness because by the time the parties took ruehle deposition,ruehle had become unavailable as a witness.see.a ruehle had invoked his fifth amendment right against he continued to assert these rights through the trial.
jasper contended that ruehle earlier sworn testimony,taken in the course of a investigation by the sec,would help exculpate jasper.for instance,jasper points to the following exchange that he contends would have bolstered his case 
q do you know whether maxim ever did grant in the money options 
a right.i not aware of any time where,under the options plan,options were granted with an exercise price less than market price on grant date,
jasper contends this and other statements by ruehle were admissible under federal rule of evidence b,which excepts from the hearsay prohibition testimony given as a witness at a trial,hearing,or lawful deposition if the testimony is now offered against a party who had an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct,cross,or redirect examination.
the sec objected to the admission of ruehle testimony on the ground that it was inadmissible hearsay,and the district court found the testimony inadmissible for two reasons.first,the court ruled that during the investigatory stage of the proceedings,as opposed to the accusatory stage of the proceedings,which is what the trial is,the motive is different.further,it was actually the sec who sought to depose ruehle in the litigation at which he invoked his fifth amendment privilege and refused to answer any of the questions that he was asked before.second,in light of ruehle subsequent blanket invocation of the fifth amendment,the district court expressed concern that ruehle testimony was too unreliable to be admitted without the opportunity for by the sec.credibility is so important to this process,said the district court,that it can sometimes go just to the completeness of testimony and not necessarily the incorrectness of it.
the district court exclusion of this testimony was not an abuse of discretion.jasper does not directly address the district court statement that the sec had no opportunity,at a point when the sec had a motive similar to its motive at trial,to ruehle.instead,jasper simply asserts that the sec had every opportunity and motive to ruehle during its own interview process.but that assertion does nothing to contest the district court conclusion regarding the difference in the nature of the sec motivation during an early investigation,at which questions are typically asked without expectation the witness will be needed at trial,and its motivation at an adverse witness deposition,when battle lines have already been drawn and necessary witnesses identified.
moreover,the district court finding that ruehle statements were unreliable in light of his subsequent invocation of the fifth amendment was not clearly erroneous,and was thus another permissible reason to exclude the sworn interrogation.where hearsay statements would have been admissible under.b,the rule at issue here,our court noted that exclusion would still be proper if the trial court simply considered it unfair to present a version of an unavailable witness testimony without an opportunity to directly.united states lester,cir.under this rule especially,admission of evidence is a matter for the trial judge discretion,to be exercised on the basis of his evaluation of the realities of and the motive and interest with which one party carried out the prior examination.id.that is exactly what the district court did here,and we therefore affirm its decision.
attorney misconduct 
next,jasper contends that a new trial is warranted because attorney misconduct permeated the proceedings.this contention also fails.
to receive a new trial because of attorney misconduct in the civil context,defendants must meet a high standard the moving party must demonstrate adverse counsel misconduct substantially interfered with the moving party interest.cal.sansome gypsum,cir.further,t o warrant reversal on grounds of attorney misconduct,the flavor of misconduct must sufficiently permeate an entire proceeding to provide conviction that the jury was influenced by passion and prejudice in reaching its verdict.kehr smith barney,harris upham,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
jasper contends that statements made by the sec on three issues in its closing argument were improper.we need not address each in turn,since,to prevail,jasper would need to show the kind of pervasive misconduct that would permeate an entire proceeding.he has not done so.
in its decision denying jasper motion for a new trial,the district court summarized the reason that the misconduct claim fails 
the court finds that the sec conduct of which defendant complains essentially amounts to a small number of isolated statements in lengthy closing and rebuttal arguments.the fact that the verdict was not in favor of the sec on all of its claims demonstrates that the jury carefully weighed the evidence before it and did not merely presume defendant liability.thus,even assuming the sec committed misconduct during the trial,it was not of the kind or quality that would permeate the entire proceedings and taint the jury verdict.
we have reviewed the claimed instances of attorney misconduct,and we agree with the district court reasoning.no more need be said on the matter.
in addition to paying a civil fine,jasper was ordered to reimburse maxim for million in bonuses and profits from the sale of maxim stock that jasper received during the period that he certified maxim false financial statements.this reimbursement was ordered pursuant to a provision known as sox.sox was passed in as part of the sarbanes oxley act,and it is codified at.
sox provides,in relevant part 
if an issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer,as a result of misconduct,with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws,the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the issuer shall reimburse the issuer for 
any bonus or other or compensation received by that person from the issuer during the month period following the first public issuance or filing with the commission whichever first occurs of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement and 
any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer during that month period.
the district court found that maxim was required to restate financial statements originally issued in september,and because of its material noncompliance with securities reporting requirements,and ordered that jasper reimburse maxim the bonuses jasper earned during the year period following each of those misstated reports according to sox jasper contends that the jury verdict was not specific enough to support this finding because the jury was never asked to consider whether maxim was required to restate its financials as a result of misconduct.to prevail on this argument,jasper must establish that the remedy of reimbursement is a legal rather than an equitable remedy,since jasper himself recognizes that he has a right to a jury trial only on any claim for relief seeking traditionally legal,as opposed to equitable,remedies.sec rind,cir.jasper notes that f orfeiture and penalties are legal remedies,as compared to equitable remedies like restitution,disgorgement,and injunctions.
ninth circuit law is clear that the reimbursement provision of sox is considered an equitable disgorgement remedy and not a legal penalty.thus,jasper is not entitled to have a jury find all of the facts necessary to support th
