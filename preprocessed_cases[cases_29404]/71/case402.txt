cameron yost defendant or appellant was convicted of securities and wire fraud after an jury trial.he appeals from his judgment of conviction entered on november,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before chief judge michael mukasey.
yost appeal presents us with two issues to resolve.one arises from the denial of his motion for severance of his trial from that of a the other and more complex issue arises out of the denial of his motion for a new trial based on a claim of his counsel actual conflict of interest.because a lawyer owes to a client a duty of undivided loyalty,it follows that no lawyer can serve two masters,where to do so places the lawyer under inconsistent is,a duty to argue for one client that which his duty to another client requires him to oppose.
background 
yost had been indicted and charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud and to violate the travel act through commercial bribery in violation of.he was also charged with a substantive count of securities fraud in violation of b and,and with three substantive counts of wire fraud in violation of.defendant was convicted on all counts charged,and sentenced to five years probation,restitution in the amount of and a special assessment.
the charges against defendant were based on his participation in a scheme designed to create artificial demand for the common stock of banyan corporation banyan,a company which he controlled and of which he was also president.the scheme envisioned inducing stock brokers employed by the symons financial group to recommend banyan stock to their customers by offering them bribes.a,murray goldenberg,not a party to this appeal,was convicted at the same trial of participating in a parallel scheme to manipulate demand for the stock of first colonial ventures,first colonial,a company he controlled.
the indictment that charged yost and goldenberg also implicated clyde feyrer who,it was alleged,was a middleman in both schemes between yost and goldenberg,on the one hand,and the principals of the symons group,on the other.feyrer did not stand trial because,pursuant to a cooperation agreement,he pled guilty and subsequently was sentenced to five years probation.
in its case against yost,the government presented evidence that from april to december he successfully defrauded purchasers of banyan stock.the principal proof against him consisted of the testimony of feyrer and richard wolff,an associate of the symons group.both men attended a meeting at caesar palace hotel in las vegas,nevada,with yost,goldenberg,and scott symons,the symons group owner.they testified that at the meeting the conferees discussed bribing brokers to buy stock for their customers in the corporations that yost and goldenberg controlled.wolff and feyrer suggested that their brokers would recommend banyan and first colonial to their clients.the evidence further showed that feyrer,wolff,yost and goldenberg arranged to transfer shares of banyan and first colonial to feyrer control so that he could use those shares to pay the brokers at the symons group as an inducement to them to promote the banyan and first colonial stock.the testimony of feyrer and wolff was corroborated by the testimony of a symons group broker who explained that he and others at his firm received secret payments for selling stock,and that they withheld from prospective customers the fact that they were being paid to recommend those stocks.
extensive documentary proof further supported feyrer and wolff accounts of the manner in which bribes in the form of banyan and first colonial stock were routed to the brokers at the symons group.for example,brokerage and bank records reflected that beginning in april and continuing through december,large blocks of banyan stock were delivered into wolff canadian brokerage accounts from accounts controlled by feyrer.when the stock was sold from wolff accounts,the proceeds were transferred by wire to bank accounts in florida controlled by wolff,feyrer,and their nominees.the government also presented evidence demonstrating that the vast majority of the retail buying in banyan stock during the span of the stock manipulation conspiracy was generated by the clearing agent for the symons financial group brokers.
on appeal,yost contends principally that the district court erred by denying his motions for severance and his motion for a new trial.he asserts he should have been tried separately from goldenberg.defendant also urges that he should have been granted a new trial premised on an allegation that his counsel had a conflict of interest and was,in addition,ineffective in providing him assistance.because we find no error in the trial court dispositions of these issues,we affirm.
discussion 
i severance motions 
defendant motions for severance were made both before and after feyrer guilty plea,pursuant to federal rules of criminal procedure b and.yost challenges his and goldenberg joint trial as prejudicial because the indictment,in his estimation,charged them with involvement in two separate conspiracies.
rule b,which governs the joinder of two or more defendants in the same indictment,permits such joinder if the joined defendants are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.b.the propriety of rule joinder raises a question of law subject to de novo review.unless the standards set out in rule b are met,a motion for severance should be granted even absent a showing of prejudice.see united states lane,d united states turoff,cir.
in support of his contention that he and goldenberg were improperly joined,yost asserts that they were actually accused of two separate and distinct conspiracies.he maintains that the banyan and first colonial conspiracies did not involve a common object and that they were neither factually nor temporally related.appellant also points out that neither he nor goldenberg was charged in the conspiracy counts of the other,and that feyrer,the only defendant charged with participating in both conspiracies,pled guilty prior to trial.
in united states attanasio,cir,we read the language of rule b to mean that the joinder of defendants is proper when the alleged acts are unified by some substantial identity of facts or participants,or arise out of a common plan or scheme.id.at.there can be no doubt that the charges against yost and goldenberg were united by overlapping facts and participants and a common plan.for instance,feyrer,wolff and the brokers at the symons group were common and central participants in both stock manipulation plans.the fact that neither feyrer nor wolff was tried alongside yost and goldenberg does not alter the significance of their participation.moreover,the two conspiracies shared a common plan,namely,to generate income for feyrer,wolff and the symons group brokers through fraudulent stock transactions.
it is also true that the schemes were run at the same time and participating in the las vegas meeting with feyrer and and goldenberg were aware of each other participation in fraud.indeed,even if the district court had tried these two defendants separately,the evidence at one trial would essentially duplicate the evidence at the other,as the district court found.we use a common sense approach when considering the propriety of joinder under rule b and,in the instant case,we think a reasonable person would easily recognize the common factual elements that permit joinder.turoff,at.in consequence,the joinder did not violate rule b.
even with proper joinder under rule,rule provides that a district court may nonetheless grant a severance of defendants joint trial i f it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder.a.rule severance does not raise a question of law for our review rather,its application is tested under the abuse of discretion standard.the supreme court has instructed that a district court should grant a rule severance motion only when there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants,or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.zafiro united states,d.the risk of prejudice associated with joinder varies with the facts of each case.a trial court is most likely to grant a severance under rule in situations where the risk of prejudice is high.id.even in those situations,less drastic as limiting suffice as an alternative to granting a rule severance motion.id.
for reasons of economy,convenience and avoidance of delay,there is a preference in the federal system for providing defendants who are indicted together with joint trials.see zafiro,at.united states diaz,cir.and,as noted,the decision whether to sever under rule is confided to the sound discretion of the trial court.see united states weisman,cir.we rarely overturn the denial of a motion to sever.see,united states salameh,cir per curiam finding no abuse of discretion in district court denial of a severance motion.thus,a trial court denial of a severance motion under rule will be reversed for abuse of discretion only when a defendant can show such severe prejudice that his conviction may be said to be a miscarriage of justice.see united states rosa,cir.
appellant urged before trial that a joint trial with goldenberg would prejudice him because it created risks of evidentiary spillover and jury confusion.chief judge mukasey rejected this argument reasoning that because each defendant was aware of the manipulation scheme involving the stock of the other company,and in fact attended the same conspiratorial meeting in las vegas,proof of both schemes would be admissible against both defendants,even at severed trials.
the district court therefore ruled there was no prejudice to either defendant that was unique to a joint trial,and that to the extent that any prejudice arose it could be cured by jury instructions and by the careful presentation of evidence by competent counsel.at the conclusion of the trial,chief judge mukasey provided the no objection from charge properly reminding the jury that appellant was accused of the banyan scheme and goldenberg of the first colonial scheme,specifying that separate consideration was to be given to each count against each defendant.consequently,the denial of appellant rule motion for severance may not be said to be an abuse of discretion.
ii ineffective assistance of counsel 
yost principal contention on appeal is that it was error to deny his motion to set aside his guilty verdict and grant him a new trial because,as he declares,his trial had been prejudiced by the ineffective assistance of his counsel.he advances two distinct arguments with respect to this claim one of his attorneys had an actual conflict of interest and there was a potential conflict of interest and there were a number of other alleged deficiencies in the legal representation he received.we take up each of these arguments in turn.
actual conflict of interest 
six months after his conviction,appellant moved for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure alleging that one of his two attorneys,roger fidler,labored under an actual conflict of interest.this motion was made by attorney robert simels,who had been contacted by attorney fidler for assistance in handling defendant trial one month before it began.the district court initially denied the motion for a new trial in a written opinion.appellant subsequently urged the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing,which it agreed to do.after holding an evidentiary hearing,chief judge mukasey handed down an amended opinion adhering to his original denial of appellant rule new trial motion.
law governing conflicts of interest 
the sixth amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right to counsel,and with that guarantee comes the correlative right that such representation be free from conflicts of interest.wood georgia,d.whether a defendant lawyer representation violates this right is a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.see united states schwarz,cir citing united states blau,cir.
while a defendant is required to demonstrate prejudice to prevail on most claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,see strickland washington,d,the same showing is not necessary when a defendant counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest because,under such circumstances,prejudice is usually presumed.id.at.this presumption is not conclusive.in order for a defendant to prevail on a claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel based on counsel actual conflict,the defendant must still establish that a counsel actively represented conflicting interests,and b such conflict adversely affected his lawyer performance.see also cuyler sullivan,d discussing standard for obtaining relief from conviction based on an actual conflict accord schwarz,at.
we have held previously that a n attorney has an actual,as opposed to a potential,conflict of interest when,during the course of the representation,the attorney and defendant interests diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.id.at.an actual conflict of interest does not present grounds for a new trial if it does not rise to more than a mere theoretical division of loyalties.see mickens taylor,d.to obtain a new trial,a defendant must prove that the conflict manifested itself as an actual lapse in representation.see cuyler,at.to prove the lapse in representation a defendant must demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued,and that the alternative defense was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other loyalties or interests.schwarz,at see also winkler keane,cir.with respect to the substance of the plausible alternative strategy,the defendant need not show that the defense would necessarily have been successful had it been used,only that it possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.winkler,at.
appellant allegations of actual conflict 
as yost tells it,attorney fidler had an actual conflict of interest arising from his simultaneous representation of yost and paul syracuse,an associate of feyrer and banyan investor who was also under investigation by the united states attorney office for allegedly participating in a scheme with feyrer.appellant avers that fidler actual conflict of interest became apparent when syracuse offered to provide exculpatory testimony and other evidence,including taped phone conversations,at appellant trial.he says fidler led him to believe that syracuse would be an important witness for him and,in fact,that syracuse testimony would be the centerpiece of his defense.
although syracuse did initially offer to testify,this offer was withdrawn after the commencement of yost trial.syracuse withdrew his offer after retaining a second sjoblom,contacted the united states attorney office and thereafter allegedly advised syracuse that the government would come after him if he testified for yost.appellant contends that he was therefore deprived of the effective assistance of counsel because,despite the fact that syracuse had exculpatory information,under dual loyalties towards him and to secure syracuse testimony,resulting in the collapse of his defense.
we review the relevant record for proof in support of these allegations.attorney simels submitted two affidavits to the district court in support of yost motion.in them he made a litany of assertions regarding the relationships and interactions of yost,fidler,syracuse,sjoblom,and the united states attorney office.observing that simels was not a direct participant in the events that determine whether fidler had a conflict of interest,the district court ruled that simels principally of what he was told by fidler,syracuse and,for the most part,inadmissible hearsay.yost affidavit,in support of his motion,also relied heavily upon a recounting of statements made to him by fidler.hence,the district court concluded that it too is similarly inadmissible hearsay to the extent that it addresses fidler relationship with syracuse,sjoblom dealings with the united states attorney office,and what potential defense witnesses would have said at trial.
