plaintiff elizabeth latshaw appeals the district court denial of her motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for relief from a judgment.the judgment resulted from her acceptance of an offer of judgment under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.latshaw argues that she accepted the offer under coercion from and based upon fraud by her counsel,who allegedly gave her erroneous legal advice and threatened to resign from the case if latshaw did not accept the offer.we are not persuaded and affirm the decision of the district court.generally speaking,rule b is not intended to remedy the effects of a deliberate and independent litigation decision that a party later comes to regret through second thoughts or knowledge that corrects prior erroneous legal advice of counsel.the district court refusal to relieve latshaw from her decision was not an abuse of discretion.
background 
latshaw hired trainer wortham company,an investment management firm,to manage approximately million of her assets.robert vile,a trainer portfolio manager,was responsible for handling latshaw account.latshaw claims that defendants trainer and vile failed to follow her stated investment instructions and objectives,ultimately causing her to sustain substantial financial losses.
latshaw commenced an action in los angeles superior court,claiming over in damages.latshaw was represented by a attorney,diane nygaard,and local california counsel,david harrison.latshaw claims included breach of oral and written contract,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,constructive fraud,negligence,and negligent supervision.the defendants removed the action to federal district court.
six weeks later,the defendants served latshaw with a offer of judgment under rule.the events following the defendants offer and leading up to latshaw acceptance of the offer are in some dispute latshaw contends that she and her two attorneys initially considered the offer grossly insufficient.days later,however,latshaw was allegedly informed that her attorneys had lost interest in the case and hoped to convince her to accept the offer.latshaw asserts that when she confronted nygaard with this information,nygaard admitted that she and harrison intended to resign from the case and erroneously stated that latshaw would be liable for costs and attorneys fees,which would be enormous,if latshaw rejected the offer and the offer exceeded her ultimate judgment.in fact,latshaw would have only been liable for the defendants costs,not attorneys fees,if she rejected the offer and the offer exceeded her ultimate judgment.see.if the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer,the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer.
latshaw contends that erroneously b elieving i was without counsel and would be liable for all defendants attorneys fees and costs,and,moreover that i had to sign by august,i reluctantly signed the acceptance of the offer because i felt i had no choice.after latshaw completed her portion of the acceptance,nygaard signed her own name and harrison name to the document and arranged for its filing.judgment on the terms was entered by the district court soon thereafter.
latshaw claims that she subsequently learned nygaard had deceived her when latshaw discovered that her california attorney had not intended to desert the case.further,latshaw learned she would not have been liable for the defendants attorneys fees had she rejected the offer,also contrary to nygaard statement.
accordingly,two months after entry of the judgment,latshaw filed in the district court a motion to rescind and vacate acceptance of defendants offer of judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.notably,latshaw did not fault the conduct of the defendants,whom she admitted were proceeding with the agreement in good faith.rather,latshaw faulted the conduct of her own counsel.latshaw contends that she was the victim of nygaard fraud and coercion,as nygaard,for her own reasons,misled latshaw,inducing her to execute an offer of judgment,contrary to her interest,and contrary to the advice of record counsel.latshaw cited rule b,and,seeking to set aside the judgment based upon,respectively,mistake,fraud,and any other reason justifying relief.the district court denied latshaw requested relief.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review the denial of rule b motions for an abuse of discretion.see molloy wilson,cir.under this standard,we can reverse only if a district court does not apply the correct law,rests its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of a material fact,or applies the correct legal standard in a manner that results in an abuse of discretion.engleson burlington northern railroad,cir.
rule b provides,on motion the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.latshaw argues that she is entitled to relief under subsection b because,but for two mistaken understandings on her part,she would not have signed the acceptance.these alleged mistakes,both purportedly originating from nygaard,were latshaw erroneous beliefs that she might be liable for defendants attorneys fees if she did not sign the offer of judgment,and that both of her attorneys intended to resign.
the district court denied relief,noting that latshaw decision to execute the acceptance,regardless of whether that decision was founded upon bad advice or misinformation,created a binding contract,and that rule b relief is unavailable to parties who simply misunderstand the legal consequences of their deliberate acts.
our court has not yet determined whether such attorney error can provide grounds to vacate a judgment under the mistake ground of rule b.we have,however,declined similar requests for relief put forth as excusable neglect,which is another ground to set aside a judgment under subsection b.see casey albertson,cir as a general rule,parties are bound by the actions of their lawyers,and alleged attorney malpractice does not usually provide a basis to set aside a judgment pursuant to rule b.engleson,at neither ignorance nor carelessness on the part of the litigant or his attorney provide grounds for relief under rule b.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we find it proper to extend our refusal to provide relief on account of excusable neglect to the alleged mistakes of law at issue here.
other circuits have considered this question and have held likewise.in a case factually similar to ours,the seventh circuit considered whether a rule offer could be rescinded where the defendant counsel operated under a mistake of law,incorrectly assuming that costs and fees would be included in the offer amount.webb james,cir.the court concluded that the mistake was not excusable under rule b,holding that the district court was not obliged to relieve the defendant of the burden of a mistake of law regarding the effect of the governing supreme court case or the attorney fees provision of the ada.id.at see also,cir holding that a mistake of law is not a mistake for rule b purposes mccurry ex rel.turner adventist health,cir holding that lawyer type of action or inaction that leads to successful malpractice suits by the injured not qualify as mistake or excusable neglect within the meaning of rule b citation and quotation marks omitted yapp excel,cir a party who simply misunderstands or fails to predict the legal consequences of his deliberate acts can not later,once the lesson is learned,turn back the clock to undo those mistakes.cashner freedom stores,cir if the mistake alleged is a party litigation mistake,we have declined to grant relief under rule b when the mistake was the result of a deliberate and counseled decision by the party.united states bank of new york,cir when a party makes a deliberate,strategic choice to settle,she can not be relieved of such a choice merely because her assessment of the consequences was incorrect.
we agree that rule b is not intended to remedy the effects of a litigation decision that a party later comes to regret through knowledge that corrects the erroneous leg
