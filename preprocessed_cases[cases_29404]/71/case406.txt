michael robles appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,the honorable richard berman,presiding.on october,after a jury trial,robles was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit securities and tender offer fraud count pursuant to and thirteen individual securities and tender offer fraud counts counts,and pursuant to b,a,and on appeal,robles principally contends that the district court erred in giving a conscious avoidance instruction with respect to the conspiracy charge and venue was improper in the southern district of new york as to all counts.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
at trial,the government sought to prove that robles and his friend richard svoboda engaged in a conspiracy to commit securities and tender offer fraud for profit between approximately november and december.during that period,svoboda was employed in dallas,texas,as a credit policy officer at nations bank,a financial institution engaged,inter alia,in commercial lending.as a credit policy officer,svoboda was charged with structuring and approving loans to corporate clients.in the course of his duties at nations bank,svoboda was privy to confidential information about nations bank clients,such as earnings information and merger and acquisition plans.svoboda testified that he obtained confidential information about certain securities and tender offers through his position at nations bank that he passed the information to robles,who,in turn,used the insider information to make trades and that he and robles shared the profits realized from their illicit trading.svoboda further testified that he and robles discussed and agreed upon the details of the scheme and that robles was fully aware that he was trading on the basis of unlawfully obtained insider information.robles,however,took the stand in his own defense and denied knowledge of the unlawful source of svoboda information.
at the close of evidence,the government requested a conscious avoidance instruction,an instruction to the effect that the government could satisfy its obligation to prove robles knowledge of the unlawful source of the information by proving that he deliberately avoided acquiring that knowledge.over robles objection,the district court granted the government request and included a conscious avoidance instruction in the jury charge 
ii.discussion 
a.the conscious avoidance instruction 
the instant case requires us to determine whether and under what circumstances the doctrine of conscious avoidance may be employed in a conspiracy prosecution.robles principal contention on appeal is that the conscious avoidance doctrine can not be employed in the course of establishing a conspiratorial agreement between two persons.we disagree.
proof of a conspiratorial agreement 
robles was convicted of conspiracy to engage in insider trading under,the general federal conspiracy statute,which provides that 
i f two or more persons conspire either to commit any offense against the united states,or to defraud the united states,or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose,and one or more of such persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
a conspiracy conviction under requires proof of three essential elements an agreement among two or more persons,the object of which is an offense against the united states the defendant knowing and willful joinder in that conspiracy and commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy by at least one of the alleged.see,united states pinckney,cir citing united states montour,cir see also wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed sand et,modern federal jury instructions that the defendant knowingly and willfully became a member of the conspiracy 
the gist of conspiracy is,of course,agreement.united states nutrition,cir see iannelli united states,d conspiracy is an inchoate offense,the essence of which is an agreement to commit an unlawful act.citations omitted.a conspiracy need not be shown by proof of an explicit agreement but can be established by showing that the parties have a tacit understanding to carry out the prohibited conduct.united states samaria,cir quotation omitted.in either case,the evidence must be sufficient to permit the jury to infer that the defendant and other alleged coconspirators entered into a joint enterprise with consciousness of its general nature and extent.nutrition,at citing united states alessi,cir.
conspiracies are secretive by their very nature,and it is thus that the elements of a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence.see samaria,at citation omitted see also united states desena,cir the elements of a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence.citation omitted.
in certain conspiracy prosecutions,the government often seeks to prove that a particular defendant joined a preexisting conspiracy.see,united states reyes,cir united states ciambrone,cir.in other cases,the question is whether a conspiracy existed at all and,if so,whether a particular defendant was a party to the alleged conspiratorial agreement.see,nutrition,at discussing evidence of single versus multiple conspiracies united states gaviria,cir.of course,the nature of the evidence used to establish the existence of a conspiratorial agreement may vary slightly,depending on the circumstances of the case.in the case of a preexisting conspiracy,the critical evidentiary question is often whether the defendant joined in the charged conspiracy with some knowledge of the conspiracy unlawful aims and with the intent of helping the scheme succeed.see reyes,at citations omitted.in other cases,the evidentiary question is frequently whether there is proof that the defendant had knowledge of the unlawful aims of the charged scheme and evinced,by his actions,an intention to further or promote its unlawful aims.see nutrition,at a conspiratorial agreement may be inferred where there is some indication that the defendant knew of and intended to further the illegal venture quoting united states zambrano,cir.the difference is not one of legal substance but only of evidentiary emphasis depending on the circumstances of the case.in either case,the fundamental legal question is the same whether the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that a particular defendant entered into an agreement with others with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the scheme and with the specific intent to aid in the accomplishment of those unlawful ends.
the conscious avoidance doctrine 
the conscious avoidance doctrine provides that a defendant knowledge of a fact required to prove the defendant guilt may be found when the jury is persuaded that the defendant consciously avoided learning that fact while aware of a high probability of its existence.samaria,at quoting united states finkelstein,cir.in such circumstances,a conscious avoidance instruction to the jury permits a finding of knowledge even where there is no evidence that the defendant possessed actual knowledge.id.quoting united states ferrarini,cir.
the application of the conscious avoidance doctrine in the conspiracy context 
relying on dictum in one of our opinions,united states reyes,cir,robles contends that the doctrine of conscious avoidance can not be used at all in the context of a conspiracy.appellant brief at.we disagree.the reyes decision does not mean what robles reads into it.even if it did,it would not support his argument.
in reyes,we upheld the defendant conviction by the jury,overturning the district court grant of a directed verdict.the defendant was in the business of selling auto parts.the jury found him guilty of engaging in the transportation and sale of stolen airbags and conspiracy to do the same.there was evidence that the defendant,when being interviewed by an fbi agent,said he was aware that the bags were stolen,making an analogy to when you see a friend using drugs,you see what happening,but you turn the other way.reyes,at.in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction,we found that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant knew the airbags were stolen,or in any event thought the airbags were stolen,but deliberately avoided confirming that fact.reyes,at.we further found that evidence supported the defendant intentional participation in the conspiracy.
prior to analyzing the evidence,our opinion discoursed on the nature of the conscious avoidance doctrine and observed,we do not permit the doctrine to be used to prove intent to participate in a conspiracy.id.at.this observation played no role in the decision.
robles relies on this sentence for his argument.his argument is essentially that conspiracy by definition requires the participation of two or more conspirators,both of whom must intend to participate.if intent to participate may not be proved by reliance on conscious avoidance,then in a case of only two conspirators where the prosecution must rely on the doctrine of conscious avoidance to prove intent to participate on the part of one,the necessary proof of intent to participate by at least two conspirators will be lacking.
this argument fails for three reasons.first,the statement in reyes on which robles relies was pure dictum.as noted,it played no role whatever in the decision,which was to uphold the defendant conviction upon the jury guilty verdict reyes stands for the proposition that the conscious avoidance doctrine may be invoked to satisfy the requirement that a defendant know of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy.see reyes,at the jury may use the conscious avoidance doctrine to establish the defendant knowledge of the aims of the conspiracy.
second,the district court instruction did not conflict with the reyes dictum.the court instructed the jury,as quoted above,only to the effect that,i n determining whether the defendant acted knowingly,you may consider whether the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.emphasis added.in giving the instruction,the court made no reference to the defendant intent to participate.
finally,we doubt that the dictum in reyes intended what the defendant reads into it.the broad assertion that conscious avoidance may not be used to prove intent to participate has a capacity to cause confusion,and robles argument draws on that confusion.properly understood,intent to participate is a shorthand phrase used to encompass both aspects of the joinder element of conspiracy,a defendant knowledge or awareness of the illegal nature of the charged activity and his intent to advance the illegal objective 
thus,when reyes states that conscious avoidance can not prove intent to participate,we do not understand it to mean that conscious avoidance can not be used to prove any aspect of intent to participate it simply means that just as actual knowledge of the illegal purpose of a conspiracy is insufficient to prove a defendant joinder in a conspiracy,so conscious avoidance of such knowledge is also insufficient.there must be further proof that the defendant joined in the illegal agreement with the intent of helping it succeed in its criminal purpose.
in sum,we can see no reason why the factfinder may not rely on conscious avoidance to satisfy at least the knowledge component of intent to participate in a conspiracy.moreover,we firmly reject robles contention that a conscious avoidance charge may not be used in a conspiracy.whether the conspiracy is among two members or more,a defendant conscious avoidance of knowledge of its illegal purpose may substitute for knowledge of the illegal purpose 
in making this argument,robles contends that a conspiracy requires proof that each alleged possessed actual knowledge of the unlawful objectives of the charged,he argues,there can be no illicit agreement.this argument presupposes that a finding of conscious avoidance stands on a lesser legal footing than a finding of actual knowledge.our precedents,however,establish that knowledge consciously avoided is the legal equivalent of knowledge actually possessed.see,united states finkelstein,cir one who deliberately avoided knowing the wrongful nature of his conduct is as culpable as one who knew.the defendant conscious avoidance of knowledge of the unlawful aims of the conspiracy thus may be invoked as the equivalent of knowledge of those unlawful aims.in the context of a conspiracy,intent to participate may be shown by a finding that the defendant either knew,or consciously avoided knowing,the unlawful aims of the charged scheme and intended to advance those unlawful ends.
factual predicate for the conscious avoidance instruction 
having found no doctrinal obstacle to employing a conscious avoidance instruction in the context of a conspiracy,we now turn to the question of whether the facts in the instant case support such an instruction.
we note at the outset that robles raised his challenge to the factual predicate for the conscious avoidance instruction in a footnote.see appellant brief at.it is in this circuit that w e do not consider an argument mentioned only in a footnote to be adequately raised or preserved for appellate review.united states quinones,cir quoting united states restrepo,cir other citations omitted.in any event,for the reasons that follow,we find robles argument on this point unpersuasive.
a conscious avoidance instruction may only be given if the defendant asserts the lack of some specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction,and the appropriate factual predicate for the charge exists,the evidence is such that a rational juror may reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.ferrarini,at internal citations omitted.the second prong of this test thus has two must be evidence that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the disputed fact and deliberately avoided confirming that fact.see,cir quoting united states alvarado,cir footnote omitted.of course,the same evidence that will raise an inference that the defendant had actual knowledge of the illegal conduct ordinarily will also raise the inference that the defendant was subjectively aware of a high probability of the existence of illegal conduct.id.at.moreover,the second prong may be established where,a defendant involvement in the criminal offense may have been so overwhelmingly suspicious that the defendant failure to question the suspicious circumstances establishes the defendant purposeful contrivance to avoid guilty knowledge.id.citations omitted emphasis in original.
here,the first prerequisite is easily met,as robles denied knowledge of the unlawful source of svoboda investment advice.the second prerequisite is also easily met.first,the source of svoboda information was knew that svoboda was a credit officer at nations bank and would thus be privy to confidential financial information.second,the timing of robles trades was example,some of robles trades occurred as little as a day before a tender offer announcement.third,the success of the trades was realized large returns,up to,on trades based on svoboda advice.these facts suggest a high probability that svoboda tips were based on inside information and that any lack of actual knowledge on robles part was due to a conscious effort to avoid confirming an otherwise obvious fact.we thereforefind that there was a sufficient factual predicate in the instant case to warrant a conscious avoidance instruction 
substance of the conscious avoidance instruction 
finally,robles argues that,even if the conscious avoidance instruction was theoretically proper,its content impermissibly diluted the mens rea requirement for the conspiracy charge,specific intent to engage in the proscribed conduct,and thus allowed the jury to convict on a negligence theory.we need not reach the merits of this contention,however,as robles trial counsel specifically requested the charge that was given.see tuttle equifax check,cir citing lavoie pacific press shear,cir failure to object to a jury instruction or the form of an interrogatory prior to the jury retiring results in a waiver of that objection.united states young,cir n ot even the plain error doctrine permits reversal on the ground that the trial court granted a defendant request to charge.other citations omitted see also.a party who objects to any portion of the instructions must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate failure to object in accordance with this rule precludes appellate review.
even if we were to consider the merits of robles challenge to the content of the conscious avoidance instruction,his argument is unavailing.to begin,the conscious avoidance instruction itself made clear that guilty knowledge may not be established by demonstrating that the defendant was merely negligent,foolish or mistaken.see united states lalley,cir rejecting the argument that a conscious avoidance charge allowed the jury to convict on a negligence theory where charge clearly cautioned that a finding of negligence,mistake,or carelessness was insufficient citing united states uphoff,cir.moreover,the jury charge,taken as a whole,repeatedly and emphatically instructed the jury that it had to find that robles intentionally engaged in the charged scheme.see,t he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that robles knowingly,willfully and unlawfully entered into the conspiracy willfully means to act with knowledge that one conduct is unlawful and with the intent to do something that the law forbids,emphasis added.accordingly,although the conspiracy charge made reference to knowledge of the illegal scheme,it also clearly and conjunctively required a finding of intent to participate.ferrarini,at although this definition of willful includes references to knowledge,it also clearly and conjunctively requires a finding of intentional purposefulness.we therefore perceive no error in the substance of the charge 
with respect to venue,all thirteen of the trades underlying the substantive securities and tender offer fraud counts were executed on the new york stock exchange nyse or american stock exchange amex,both of which are located in the southern district of new york.after each trade was completed,robles received a written confirmation indicating the exchange at which the trade was executed.see,trade confirmation corresponding to count of the indictment.
robles asserts that this is too tenuous a connection to the southern district to establish venue.in addition,robles contends that the jury instruction on venue was fatally flawed.we disagree.
whether venue was proper in the southern district of new york 
questions of jurisdiction and venue are questions of law,and this court reviews them de novo.see united states kim,cir citing united states white,cir.
a criminal defendant has the right to be tried in the district wherein the crime shall have been committed.const.amend.vi see.w here the acts constituting the crime and the nature of the crime charged implicate more than one location,the constitution does not command a single exclusive venue.united states reed,cir.rather,venue is proper in any district in which such offense was begun,continued,or completed.a.
where a federal statute defining an offense does not explicitly indicate where a criminal act is deemed to have been committed,the site of a charged offense must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it united states cabrales,d quoting united states cabrales,cir quoting united states anderson.this court has therefore held that,i n a conspiracy prosecution,venue is proper in any district in which an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed by any of the coconspirators.united states smith,cir quoting united states naranjo,cir quotation and citation omitted.with respect to the individual securities and tender offer fraud counts,the venue provision of the securities exchange act of the act provides that a ny criminal proceeding may be brought in the district wherein any act or transaction constituting the violation occurred.
robles likens the instant case to united states bezmalinovic,in which the court held that purely ministerial functions that are unintended and unforeseeable to a defendant are insufficient to establish venue.see id.at venue in bank fraud prosecution improper in the southern district of new york where the defendant committed all relevant acts at banks in the eastern district of new york and the only contact with the southern district was the banks cashing and payment of checks through their clearing houses in manhattan.robles argues that he neither intended nor could he have reasonably foreseen that the trades in question would be executed on the nyse or amex.
the government,on the other hand,relies on united states kim,in which this court held that knowingly causing an act in furtherance of the charged offense to occur in the district in question is sufficient to establish venue.see kim,at venue proper where the defendant approved fraudulent invoices knowing that the victim paid its vendors from a bank located in the southern district of new york.
taken together,kim and bezmalinovic indicate that venue is proper in a district where the defendant intentionally or knowingly causes an act in furtherance of the charged offense to occur in the district of venue or it is foreseeable that such an act would occur in the district of venue.see kim,at finding venue proper where the defendant caused communications to be transmitted into and out of the southern district when he approved fraudulent invoices knowing that the victim paid its vendors from new york banks bezmalinovic.at finding venue improper because the defendant neither intended nor could have foreseen the acts that occurred in the district of venue.
in the instant case,there is nothing in the record to indicate that robles intended the trades in question to be executed on either nyse or amex.however,the fact that robles was a savvy investor means that he could reasonably foresee that his trades would likely be executed on either nyse or amex.more importantly,however,robles had actual notice that his trades were being executed on nyse and amex the government introduced individual trade confirmations from robles broker,charles schwab,reflecting that eight of the transactions in question were executed on nyse or amex.see.accordingly,unlike bezmalinovic,there is evidence suggesting that robles either knew,or could reasonably foresee,that his trades would be executed in the southern district of new york.at a minimum,as soon as robles received the first trade confirmation,it became foreseeable that his trades could be executed in the southern district.this case is thus more analogous to kim,as robles ordered trades knowing that they would be executed in the southern district 
for the foregoing reasons,we find that the execution of trades on the new york stock exchange and american stock exchange is sufficient to establish venue in the southern district of new york 
the venue instruction 
robles additionally argues that,even if venue in the southern district was theoretically proper,the jury instruction on venue was fatally flawed to begin,because defendant failed to object to the substance of the venue instruction,our review is for plain error.see.d,b united states crowley,cir for an error to be a plain error or a defect affecting substantial rights.b,it must be a clear or obvious deviation from current law that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.crowley,at citing united states olano,d.
since we conclude that the jury instruction on venue properly stated the law in this circuit,we find that there was no error,plain or otherwise,in this aspect of the charge.first,robles argues that venue is an essential element of a criminal charge and must,therefore,be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.see generally united states gaudin,d holding that materiality of allegedly false statements is an essential element of the crime of making material false statements to a federal agency and thus must be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.however,this court has repeatedly held that venue is not an essential element of
