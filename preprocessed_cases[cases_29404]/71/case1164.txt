this appeal challenges the district court decision to dismiss this action with prejudice for failure to prosecute pursuant to.b.the district court dismissed this case,which originally was commenced in,as a sanction for the alleged dilatoriness of appellant ecclesiastes,ecclesiastes.this delay allegedly precluded the parties from preserving the deposition testimony of john delorean prior to his death.at times material to the dismissal,delorean was ecclesiastes sole director,its corporate designee pursuant to.b,and ecclesiastes only witness with knowledge of the factual underpinnings of the litigation.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants motion for dismissal pursuant to rule b.thus,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
asset purchase agreement 
on december,delorean and three corporations he directly and indirectly controlled,logan manufacturing company logan delorean manufacturing company delorean manufacturing,and cristina cristina collectively plaintiffs,entered into an asset purchase agreement apa with lmc holding lmc holding for the sale of plaintiffs equipment business paul wallace specifically formed lmc holding to acquire plaintiffs assets.delorean and wallace negotiated the terms of the apa.
pursuant to the apa,lmc holding was to pay a purchase price of,subject to certain closing and adjustments the adjustments.the apa placed responsibility on plaintiffs for producing the necessary financial documentation to calculate the adjustments.this included audited financial statements for the fiscal year that ended on november.because closing took place after december,plaintiffs also were responsible for furnishing the following documents within days of closing a balance sheet,a statement of operations,retained earnings and statements,and inventory assessments for the new fiscal year through the closing date documentation a report from plaintiffs independent accountant,kpmg peat marwick kpmg,containing the results of its audit of this documentation and plaintiffs computation of the adjustments based upon the audited documentation.thereafter,the parties would make arrangements for the transaction final payment.
delorean was plaintiffs sole representative at the january,closing.at closing,plaintiffs transferred their assets to lmc holding,which,in response,paid plaintiffs in cash,provided them with a promissory note for,and transferred to an escrow agent other notes and shares of preferred stock.days later,however,plaintiffs did not deliver to defendants the documentation and their related calculation of the adjustments,as contemplated by the apa.
the documentation was never completed.nevertheless,delorean apparently attempted to negotiate the adjustments with defendants,offering a variety of seemingly contradictory methodologies and calculations to conclude the agreement.ultimately,defendants tendered no additional payment.
in january,ecclesiastes filed a complaint against lmc holding and wallace.on march,an amended complaint was filed,and delorean,delorean manufacturing,and cristina were added as plaintiffs.the amended complaint named lmc holding,lmc operating corporation lmc operating lmc tenant corporation lmc tenant lawrence lopater and wallace as defendants collectively defendants.a second amended complaint was filed on december.
plaintiffs brought claims for,inter alia,breach of contract,common law fraud,securities fraud,and violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.plaintiffs alleged that wallace perpetrated a fraudulent scheme to induce delorean to enter into the apa.according to plaintiffs,defendants further perpetrated this scheme after the january,closing by impermissibly dissipating ecclesiastes assets to avoid satisfying defendants financial obligations to plaintiffs,by demanding fraudulent offsets to the balance of the purchase price,and by preventing plaintiffs from accessing the business premises and the requisite records to calculate the adjustments.
plaintiffs claims placed delorean at the center of the litigation.according to the second amended complaint,delorean negotiated the apa,misunderstood the terms of this purposefully ambiguous and confusing contract,was misled by the methodology for calculating the adjustments,and personally participated in the purported closing.app.at.
in response,defendants filed an array of counterclaims,including claims for breach of contract,and negligent misrepresentation.defendants asserted that delorean made several fraudulent representations to induce them to enter into the apa.defendants specifically alleged the following after closing,defendants discovered that ecclesiastes inventory of machines,parts,and supplies was both inadequate and obsolete plaintiffs inflated the sales and revenue figures ecclesiastes machines yielded significant undisclosed warranty liabilities due to defective design and plaintiffs failed to make contributions to ecclesiastes pension plan and never discontinued its pension plan.
delorean declared personal bankruptcy in september.approximately seven months later,lmc operating filed for bankruptcy.on february,following these bankruptcy filings,the district court administratively closed the action.little discovery had been completed at that point.
on november,plaintiffs moved to the case and to dismiss the bankrupt parties.plaintiffs filed a memorandum in support of this motion on july.on september,defendants filed a rule b motion to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute,arguing that plaintiffs inexcusably failed both to advance the litigation in the years prior to the administrative closure of the action and to proceed against the remaining defendants while the case against lmc operating was stayed in accordance with bankruptcy law.on march,the district court granted plaintiffs motion to the case and to dismiss the bankrupt parties,including delorean.despite denying defendants motion to dismiss the action pursuant to rule b,the district court warned that sanctions may be appropriate upon proof of the loss of evidence,and orally directed the parties to proceed in this case with all dispatch.app.at.
on march,defendants served ecclesiastes with a notice of deposition pursuant to.b.the rule b notice identified april,as the date for the deposition of ecclesiastes corporate designee.defendants sought to depose ecclesiastes corporate designee on a number of issues,including the negotiation,content,execution,and performance of the apa the preparation,accuracy,and of ecclesiastes financial statements between january,and january,communications between ecclesiastes and ecclesiastes between january,and the date of the deposition the calculation of the purchase price and the allegations in plaintiffs second amended complaint and defendants counterclaims.by the time defendants served their rule b notice,ownership of ecclesiastes had moved from delorean to his brother,charles delorean,a creditor who acquired the interest in partial satisfaction of unpaid debts.
shortly before the scheduled deposition,ecclesiastes counsel,edgar boles,asked defendants counsel,christopher johnson,for a postponement.on may,defendants continued the deposition without scheduling a new date.then,in a july,letter,boles tendered three individuals for depositions,delorean and two former employees of ecclesiastes,bryce patterson and mel mitchell.boles did not expressly indicate whether the three were being designated as rule b deponents.the district court interpreted the july,letter as effecting the rule b designation of the three.in any event,in an october,letter,boles left no room for doubt that the three were being provided in response to defendants rule b notice app.at.
between october and december,the parties engaged in discussions concerning the scheduling of depositions.the parties agreed to propose and confirm discovery dates prior to noticing depositions,due in part to the geographical distance between the parties and their respective counsel.johnson sought without objection to depose delorean both in his personal and rule b capacities.johnson sent approximately ten separate letters to boles requesting that plaintiffs identify dates for the taking of depositions of ecclesiastes corporate designees,including delorean.boles delayed in responding to defendants requests,due in part to his absence from work for a family medical matter.on the three occasions when boles did respond in writing,he never confirmed an exact date for delorean deposition testimony.
defendants took additional steps to secure delorean testimony.on october,defendants moved to transfer venue to the united states district court for the southern district of new york.defendants requested the change in venue to ensure that,if necessary,they could subpoena delorean presence at trial pursuant to.b.defendants labeled delorean as probably the single most critical witness in this case.app.at.
on november,boles withdrew ecclesiastes designation of two of its rule b deponents,peterson and mitchell,asserting that as former employees they could not serve as designees.on december,one day after receiving johnson tenth letter requesting a date for delorean rule b deposition,boles withdrew delorean name,stating that he can not formally designate any witness under rule b or otherwise for,among other reasons,all such persons are witnesses and none are under the direction and control of my client.app.at.
defendants quickly filed a motion to compel and requested the costs of the motion as a sanction.opposing defendants motion to compel,ecclesiastes argued that potential rule b witnesses could not be compelled to appear and indeed,could not be designated because a ll were third parties who were former employees.app.at.in contrast to this representation,boles filed an affidavit stating that delorean is the only remaining officer or director of ecclesiastes,and,as ecclesiastes sole representative at the time of the apa execution,the only witness who could testify as to some of the subject areas in defendants rule b notice.app.at.
on january,the district court held a hearing on the motion to transfer venue.ecclesiastes local counsel,reid lambert,agreed that delorean was vital to plaintiffs claims,stating a s counsel accurately points out,delorean is essential to our case.it would be silly to think we could put on our case without him.app.at.in addition,lambert represented that because delorean was still a corporate officer of ecclesiastes,the district court would possess the authority to command his appearance at a trial in utah 
delorean is still affiliated with ecclesiastes.i suppose it would be practicable for this court under those circumstances to direct ecclesiastes to default if they did produce him 
you know,i guess what i suggesting is this i think in this case it is practical for this court to say delorean is an officer of your company,if you do produce know,you are the company,you are the officers,you the director,i guess you would say,if you do produce him,i going to default you.
app.at emphasis added.
the district court found that delorean presence at trial was absolutely essential,but held its ruling on the motion to transfer in abeyance pending consideration of whether delorean presence could be guaranteed.app.at.on february,ecclesiastes filed a statement with the district court agreeing that if delorean fails to appear in person as a witness at trial,absent compelling reasons satisfactory to the court,the court may dismiss ecclesiastes claims with prejudice.app.at.defendants objected to this statement,contending that ecclesiastes knew of delorean advanced age and poor health for several years and should therefore bear any and all risks if delorean is unable to attend the trial for whatever reason.app.at.
on march,delorean died.defendants renewed their rule b motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute and advised the district court that their pending motion to transfer venue was moot.the district court admonished ecclesiastes counsel to take the motion serious ly.app.at.on may,following oral argument,the district court granted defendants motion and dismissed the entire action with prejudice as to all plaintiffs.this ruling was later embodied in a written order,dated june.the district court acknowledged that dismissal should be a measure of last resort,but reasoned that the test of ehrenhaus reynolds,cir,mandated this outcome.only ecclesiastes appeals the judgment.
ii.discussion 
this court has jurisdiction under to review the district court order of dismissal pursuant to rule b.ecclesiastes asserts that the district court erred in two ways.first,ecclesiastes argues that the district court wrongly applied rule b to a discovery dispute that falls exclusively within the ambit of.second,ecclesiastes argues that,even if rule b is applicable,the district court failed to apply correctly the factors for involuntary dismissal.
applicability of rule b 
ecclesiastes argues that the district court committed a fundamental error by using rule b to dismiss the action under a theory.relying upon societe internationale pour participations industrielles et commerciales,rogers,d,ecclesiastes contends that,due to the extreme consequences of dismissal,disputes regarding the production of discovery must be exclusively resolved under rule.because ecclesiastes never violated an order to provide or permit discovery within the meaning of rule b it reasons that the district court lacked authorization to dismiss the action 
in response,defendants argue that ecclesiastes forfeited this argument by failing to raise it before the trial court.we agree.
an issue is preserved for appeal if a party alerts the district court to the issue and seeks a ruling.see,century real estate meraj int l inv,cir.this court will not consider a new theory advanced for the first time as an appellate issue,even a theory that is related to one that was presented to the district court.see,hiner deere,cir.nor does the vague and ambiguous presentation of a theory before the trial court preserve that theory as an appellate issue.okland oil conoco,cir see,comm r of internal revenue,cir t o preserve the integrity of the appellate structure,we should not be considered a second shot forum where secondary,theories may be mounted for the first time.
ecclesiastes did not preserve this issue for appeal.although ecclesiastes claims that the question of whether the case should be dismissed under rule b was the whole focus of the matter in the district court,aplt.reply br.at,there is a palpable distinction between challenging the correctness of the district court rule b analysis and challenging the applicability of rule b itself.lyons jefferson bank trust,cir raising of related theory before district court insufficient to preserve issue for appeal.the district court never addressed the latter,the applicability vel non of rule b in its may,ruling or in its june,opinion.ecclesiastes appellate briefs,moreover,do not identify a place in the record where ecclesiastes or any other plaintiff argued that rule b is inapposite.see cir.c for each issue raised on appeal,all briefs must cite the precise reference in the record where the issue was raised and ruled on.see also state ins.fund ace transp,cir refusing to consider argument when appellant fails to show where in record issue was raised and resolved.
ecclesiastes conceded at oral argument that this issue was not raised with specificity before the district court.ecclesiastes nonetheless identified pages in the record where this contention allegedly was raised by implication.see app.at.our review of those pages,however,fails to confirm ecclesiastes representation.for the most part,ecclesiastes simply argued that it was improper for the district court to dismiss plaintiffs action on any ground other than the substantive merits,id.at i f the case is going to be dismissed because john delorean died,it ought to be dismissed because substantively the case ca be proven without delorean present.
ecclesiastes also invoked at oral argument the plain error doctrine.yet,this doctrine provides no aid.although the plain error doctrine is typically applied in the civil context to address errors,see.d and.d,we have performed a analysis in civil litigation to address alleged errors.see employers reinsurance cas,cir applying plain error analysis to alleged error in resolution of summary judgment motions.
however,like the plaintiff in employers reinsurance,ecclesiastes has failed in seeking review to carry its nearly insurmountable burden.quigley rosenthal,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the use of the component of rule b,rather than rule a,was not plainly erroneous,based upon the history of this litigation and the district court inventory of the myriad forms of ecclesiastes dilatory behavior following the recommencement of discovery on march,rogers,at.holding that rule is the exclusive mechanism for dismissal of complaint due to singular issue of noncompliance with order requiring production of discovery.
furthermore,assuming arguendo that there was error,this error certainly did not result in a miscarriage of justice that seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.sloan state farm mut.auto.ins,cir see employers reinsurance,at.significantly,the same test that district courts employ in our circuit in considering motions for dismissal under rule b the ehrenhaus have been used by the district court here to dismiss the action under its inherent authority,without regard to the availability of a rule sanction.chavez city of albuquerque,cir ehrenhaus dismissal analysis applies when district court invokes inherent power to dismiss jury verdict due to plaintiff perjury at trial see chambers nasco,d noting that inherent power of a court can be invoked even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same conduct.consequently,we would be hard pressed to conclude that the district court invocation of ehrenhaus under the rule b framework resulted in a miscarriage of justice and rendered its dismissal of the case fundamentally unfair.
appropriateness of dismissal 
this court reviews for an abuse of discretion a district court decision to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute,nasious two unknown agents,cir we review dismissals under rule b for abuse of discretion.see gripe city of enid,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court makes a clear error of judgment or exceed s the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.mcewen city of norman,parks,cir.this occurs when a district court relies upon an erroneous conclusion of law or upon clearly erroneous findings of fact.see ashby mckenna,cir.applying this deferential standard,we affirm the district court dismissal order.
rule b states,for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with these rules or any order of court,a defendant may move for dismissal of an action or of any claim against the defendant.b.the sanction of dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute is a severe sanction,a measure of last resort.jones thompson,cir see meade grubbs,cir.
we have identified a list of factors that a district court ordinarily should consider in determining whether to dismiss an action with prejudice under rule b the degree of actual prejudice to the other party the amount of interference with the judicial process the litigant culpability whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal would be a likely sanction for noncompliance and the efficacy of lesser sanctions ehrenhaus,at see mobley mccormick,cir rule b involuntary dismissals should be determined by reference to the ehrenhaus criteria.under this flexible framework,established in our ehrenhaus decision,dismissal is warranted when the aggravating factors outweigh the judicial system strong predisposition to resolve cases on their merits.ehrenhaus,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting meade,at.
ecclesiastes concedes that the district court addressed each factor of the ehrenhaus test.ecclesiastes nonetheless challenges the correctness of the district court application of each factor and,hence,its ultimate conclusion.
degree of actual prejudice 
the district court found that the loss of delorean deposition product of ecclesiastes prejudiced defendants.the district court reasoned that the content and credibility of delorean testimony was essential to ecclesiastes claims and defendants defense of those claims,and also to defendants counterclaims.the district court noted,moreover,that both parties recognized the critical value of this testimony.
ecclesiastes contests this finding,arguing that delorean death only injured the likelihood of success of plaintiffs claims.in fact,ecclesiastes reasons that delorean death inured to defendants benefit,relieving defendants of the task of impeaching his credibility or rebutting his statements at trial.according to ecclesiastes,the extent of defendants loss was the opportunity to conduct what they hoped would be a successful cross examination of ecclesiastes primary witness.aplt.br.at.
we agree with the district court analysis.ecclesiastes position overlooks the crucial function of the discovery process.for instance,defendants were entitled to investigate the merits of the allegations in plaintiffs complaint.according to these averments,delorean possessed information concerning,inter alia,the negotiation of the apa,the meaning of allegedly ambiguous provisions in the apa the defendants allegedly fraudulent statements,and the extent of ecclesiastes compliance with its obligations.
in fact,as the district court noted,delorean was alleged to have been the only negotiator of the transaction on behalf of the corporate plaintiffs and the recipient on their behalf of the alleged fraudulent statements delivered by defendants.app.at.the loss of delorean deposition testimony prevented defendants from fashioning an effective defense to ecclesiastes and claims.
similarly,defendants had considerable need to explore,through delorean,ecclesiastes knowledge of facts relevant to defendants counterclaims.for instance,defendants filed breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and counterclaims.to establish these claims,defendants needed to depose delorean.the topics of particular significance to them,as to these counterclaims,included delorean representations delorean notes and correspondence regarding the execution of the apa the unexpected and arguably suspicious emergence of corporate documents purporting to show that the pension plan was terminated in delorean preparation of arguably conflicting calculations of the adjustments and delorean correspondence with ecclesiastes accountants.
indeed,ecclesiastes asserted that delorean was the only person with information relevant to certain subjects in defendants rule b notice.its failure to permit delorean knowledge to be memorialized prior to his death consequently deprived defendants of the ability to gather facts essential to the success of their counterclaims against ecclesiastes.
this prejudice is further confirmed by the parties express recognition of delorean integral role in this litigation.in order to secure delorean attendance at trial,defendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the southern district of new york,labeling delorean as probably the single most critical witness in this case.app.at.in defending against this motion,ecclesiastes conceded not only that delorean testimony was essential to its case,but also that i t would be silly to think we could put on our case without him.app.at.furthermore,the district court acknowledged the indispensability of delorean testimony,going so far as to command plaintiffs to file a statement guaranteeing that,absent legitimate health reasons,ecclesiastes would produce delorean at trial.app.at.
in sum,even if delorean testimony would not have facilitated the success of defendants defenses and counterclaims,defendants lost forever the opportunity to make that determination.at least equally as important,they lost an opportunity to gain relevant information as to ecclesiastes perception of the factual basis of the parties claims.under the standards of our caselaw,defendants clearly suffered prejudice.see gripe,at concluding that district court rested its dismissal order on appropriate considerations under ehrenhaus test when it found on at least two occasions that plaintiff failure to follow court orders and rules had inconvenienced and prejudiced defendants and the court jones,at using ehrenhaus test and noting that,due to plaintiffs discovery,defendants suffered prejudice in preparing for trial without the opportunity to depose the plaintiffs.
degree of interference 
the district court itemized ecclesiastes unilateral,misconduct.the district court found this misconduct to be willful and aimed,at least in significant part,at avoid ing having delorean deposed as ecclesiastes corporate representative.app.at.it ultimately ruled that ecclesiastes misconduct interfered with its process.id.
ecclesiastes responds that it was engaged in a legitimate,good faith dispute over the propriety of defendants invocation of rule b and that such a dispute does not equate to interference with judicial process.aplt.br.at.we reject ecclesiastes position.
as an initial matter,ecclesiastes dilatoriness during the discovery process went beyond a mere discovery dispute over whether ecclesiastes was required to designate rule b representatives.the district court thoroughly documented the litany of dilatory conduct ecclesiastes failure to designate corporate representatives until at least four months after defendants rule b notice ecclesiastes failure to communicate in a timely and responsive fashion with defendants during the discovery period ecclesiastes failure to produce delorean for a rule b deposition,even after designating him,despite repeated written attempts by defendants counsel to secure an exact date for his deposition and ecclesiastes sudden and inexplicabl e withdrawal of delorean as a rule b designee.app.at see id.at.this behavior clearly violated the district court mandate to proceed with all dispatch.app.at.and,consequently,we can not conclude that the district court erred in finding that ecclesiastes interfered with its process.see,archibeque atchison,topeka and santa fe ry,cir upholding district court finding that plaintiff willful failure to disclose requested information during discovery amounted to a serious interference with the judicial process.
furthermore,ecclesiastes contention that it operated under a belief that it could decline to make rule b designations because it lacked control of potential designees strains credulity.the law is that corporations have an affirmative duty to make available as many persons as necessary to give complete,knowledgeable,and binding answers on the corporation behalf.reilly natwest mkt.group,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting sec.exch.comm morelli,see.b organization so named shall designate one or more officers,directors,or managing agents,or other persons who consent to testify on its behalf emphasis added.
this duty is not negated by a corporation alleged lack of control over potential rule b deponents.see resolution trust union,cir noting that rule b places the burden of identifying responsive witness for corporate deposition on corporation roger fendrich and kent sinclair,discovering corporate knowledge and contentions,noting that a ny witness who can gather responsive information may be designated by the company and that,in one common scenario,corporations designate individuals who lack personal knowledge of the events giving rise to the litigation but who have otherwise been educated about it 
we also note that,insofar as lack of control is a consideration in the operation of rule b,this absence of control is not established by an individual status as a corporate officer or director.see.b advisory committee note,amendment evincing that officers,directors,or managing agents are typical rule b designees and others may be designated but only with their consent.indeed,the amendments to rule expressly removed the previous distinction between directors,on one hand,and managing agents and officers,on the other a corporation now is deemed to have legal control over its directors,like its managing agents and officers,for deposition purposes.see also charles alan wright,arthur miller,richard marcus,federal practice procedure,at discussing the effects of the complimentary amendments to rule b and rule d that,respectively,rejected the notion that a corporation lacks power over its directors,and,therefore,mandated that a corporation is responsible for producing its directors if notice is given emphasis added.the text and history of rule b clearly defeat ecclesiastes contention that delorean status as only an officer or director on paper had the effect of eliminating its legal control over him.aplt.reply br.at.accordingly,ecclesiastes can not reasonably predicate its purported belief on this theory.
to show good faith,ecclesiastes had to promptly respond in some fashion to defendants rule b notice.ecclesiastes could have promptly informed defendants of its alleged concerns about the propriety of their rule b notice.or ecclesiastes could have explained its purported inability to provide information responsive to the notice.then,failing a negotiated resolution with defendants,ecclesiastes could have sought a protective order from the district court.see eeoc thurston motor lines,imposing rule sanctions on successor to corporate party served with rule b notice because successor had absolutely no right to refuse to designate a witness.if it had an objection to discovery,its opportunity was to request a protective order.b advisory committee note,amendments noting availability of protective orders to curb possible excesses in corporate discovery practices and specifically stating that a court decision whether to issue a protective order may take account of the availability and use made of the procedures provided in this subdivision.yet,the record reveals no sign that ecclesiastes followed this or a similarly responsive path.
instead,ecclesiastes delayed for at least four noting any legal it offered a roster of rule b witnesses,including delorean.then,ecclesiastes allowed weeks to elapse before it withdrew these witnesses.in particular,it allowed a considerable period to pass before it withdrew the unquestionably most important rule b witness,delorean.significantly,these withdrawal decisions were not based upon facts or circumstances.rather,ecclesiastes withdrew its designees based upon concerns regarding their alleged that should have been apparent to ecclesiastes when defendants first issued their rule b notice in march.
therefore,we reject ecclesiastes argument that the district court erred in basing its interference finding on ecclesiastes alleged dispute over rule b discovery.put simply,ecclesiastes conduct involved more than a simple discovery dispute over rule b designations,and we can not conclude that ecclesiastes acted in good faith.
culpability of ecclesiastes 
the district court found that,as a consequence of ecclesiastes willful effort to avoid delorean rule b deposition,his critical testimony was not preserved.app.at.ecclesiastes contests this finding,arguing that it was not required to designate delorean as its corporate designee because he was not within its control,and that it offered to arrange deposition dates for delorean in his personal capacity on multiple occasions.
ecclesiastes protestations ring hollow.as indicated above,ecclesiastes argument rests on a dubious legal foundation.furthermore,irrespective of whether ecclesiastes was required to designate delorean,it did designate delorean inexplicably,it waited at least four months to do so.
ecclesiastes must have understood delorean central role in the negotiation and closing of the apa.indeed,during the course of the litigation,ecclesiastes conceded that delorean was ecclesiastes sole remaining officer and director,and the only individual who could address certain topics in defendants rule b notice.accordingly,delorean should have been front and center for ecclesiastes as a rule b designee.
then,after it finally designated delorean,ecclesiastes willfully and unreasonably failed to communicate with defendants to nail down deposition dates for him and the other rule b witnesses.during all of this time,moreover,ecclesiastes was well aware of delorean advanced age and fragile health.even more egregiously,ecclesiastes chose to withdraw its rule b designation eight months after bein
