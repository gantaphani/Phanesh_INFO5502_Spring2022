javier salas salas and stephen patrick patrick appeal from the judgments entered upon patrick conviction by jury of one count and salas convictions by jury of four counts of selling unqualified securities,subd.a the jury also found the special allegation that each of the offenses was not discovered until after july,subd.c to be true.the trial court sentenced patrick to months in state prison,suspending sentence and placing him on three years formal probation on the condition that he spend one year in county jail.it sentenced salas to an aggregate term of three years to be served in the department of corrections los angeles restitution center.
appellants contend that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the statute of limitations on the charged offenses was four years instead of three even if a statute of limitations is applicable,it expired prior to initiation of the prosecution the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the sale of unqualified securities is a strict liability crime and the trial court instruction on the defense that the securities were exempt from qualification was erroneous.
we hold that violation of section is a general intent crime which carries a knowledge requirement.although the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding general intent,it neglected to advise the jury of the knowledge requirement.as to patrick,this error warrants reversal and a new trial to allow patrick to present evidence that he lacked knowledge of the facts establishing that the securities were not exempt pursuant to section,subdivision f.as to salas,however,the error was harmless.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment against salas and reverse the judgment against patrick and remand the case for retrial.
factual background 
the people casea.american joint ownership interests.
in,salas formed american joint ownership interests,ajoi,to acquire properties in the belmont district of los angeles for development.he was its president,secretary,treasurer,sole shareholder and the only person authorized to disburse money from its bank accounts.he boasted that he ran ajoi by himself.codefendants rick berry berry and patrick joined ajoi in approximately and,respectively,to procure investors to purchase partnership interests in entities formed to acquire the properties.david and carol melland,mary donovan,and edward burke were investors in boylston street associates,an entity formed to purchase the property at boylston street.
the parties stipulated that these investment transactions were securities within the corporate securities law of the act and that the department of corporations had no record of any application to qualify to offer securities in the name of salas,berry,patrick,ajoi or equity management,
the examiner from the department of corporations,michelle tse tse,examined the bank records of boylston street associates.she determined that people wrote checks,in round number amounts totaling,some with boylston written in the memo section,that were placed in the boylston street associates account.in january,as a result of a civil suit against salas and ajoi by several investors,a receiver was appointed for ajoi.lisa kalaydjian kalaydjian,the receivership administrator,determined from boylston street associates records that there were people invested in boylston with various amounts of money placed next to their names.she did not know whether those people had transferred money from boylston street associates to other ajoi properties in connection with which some of their names also appeared.
david and carol melland 
sometime before march,david and carol melland the mellands received an unsolicited telephone call from salas,seeking their investment in boylston street associates.the mellands did not know salas or anyone else at ajoi before the call.he told them that they would obtain a big return in a short period of time.he also told them he had obtained their telephone number from a list of people who made investments.the mellands did not consider themselves sophisticated investors.
in august,the mellands invested for a percent interest in boylston street associates executing a subscription agreement that made no mention of any partnership interest,although they had been told that they were investing in limited partnerships.they never received any partnership agreement.the mellands believed ajoi owned boylston street when they invested,as salas said nothing about having to acquire it.in or,they learned from melland,ron schweder schweder,that ajoi did not own that property.that revelation concerned melland,but she did not think there was fraud or misappropriation of money,only that the project was off to a slow start.salas reassured the mellands that they should hang on,he was going to acquire the property,but there were insufficient funds to do so at that time.
in,when melland was told that he would not realize profit for a couple of years,he became concerned about the investment,questioning whether it was a good one.he did not think,however,there was any mishandling of his funds.he called salas several times and was satisfied with what he was told.he testified that he did not know if he was aware that something was amiss at ajoi in.melland also believed it was taking too long for them to receive a return on their investment.other than the delay,however,she did not think salas was doing anything wrong until or.in,she believed there was some impropriety involved because it was taking too long without getting anything back on their money.
between september and january,the mellands received numerous letters from ajoi,some signed by salas and some by berry,repeatedly reassuring them and representing that boylston street would soon be purchased.it never was.
the mellands received a letter dated may,the may,letter,from berry,on cp development letterhead,advising that berry was no longer affiliated with ajoi.d ue to certain disagreements he tendered his resignation.the letter concerned melland that there may be a problem but did not cause melland concern because she thought it simply meant that berry was leaving ajoi.melland did not think much about whether the portion of the letter referring to full disclosure meant that the mellands were not receiving full disclosure from ajoi and did not contact berry after receiving it.
the mellands denied receiving a letter from berry,similar to the one sent to another investor,dated september,the september,letter,stating that suit was being filed against ajoi and salas regarding improprieties fraudulent activities regarding your investments with him.they also denied receiving or seeing any other letters referring to fraud or illegal activities at ajoi or letters from other investors seeking a return of their money.
in,at approximately the same time they were contacted by the receiver for ajoi,early lincoln,a sheriff investigator,contacted the mellands regarding a criminal investigation of possible fraud.before that,they had received no information that ajoi was involved in any fraudulent or criminal activities.
mary donovan 
in january,mary donovan donovan received a telephone solicitation from someone at ajoi whose name she did not recall.however,during her dealings with ajoi,she dealt with salas,patrick and berry,who told her of their project and that she would earn two to four times her investment.she invested in boylston street associates in january,and another the following month,in both instances signing subscription agreements.before investing in that property,she believed she was told that ajoi already owned it.in july and june,she invested and,respectively,in two other ajoi properties.
donovan first became aware of problems at ajoi three or four years before trial when a law enforcement investigator,keith cook,contacted her,and she received letters from the receiver of ajoi.before she heard from them,the only suggestion of any problems was the may,letter she received.it indicated to her that something was rotten in denmark,but she took no action,and made no effort to contact berry,nor did she receive a telephone call from him or from anyone telling her that there was fraud or other impropriety at ajoi.she never saw the september,letter.
edward burke 
in february,edward burke burke,who held a degree in business administration,invested in boylston street associates after receiving a cold call from an unidentified person who turned him over to patrick with whom he ultimately invested.he was told ajoi was going to invest in several properties that would be packaged for sale.
between and,burke received correspondence and other communications from ajoi,mostly from berry.before,he received no information from anyone that there was a problem with ajoi.he received the may,letter,which he took to mean that berry was no longer affiliated with ajoi.he too never saw the september,letter.
the defense case 
appellants testified in their defense.salas testified that he considered applying to qualify the securities but ultimately decided not to do so because he believed that it was unnecessary.he was aware that ajoi was required to limit the number of investors to no more than,raise less than a million dollars have a preexisting relationship with each investor,and not advertise in order to be exempt under section,subdivision f from having to register with the department of corporations.he intended to limit the number of investors to or fewer and denied that there were investors in boylston street associates as testified to by tse,claiming that her number included people whose investments had been refunded and investors who were not part of that entity.ajoi did not advertise.all investors in ajoi properties had prior contact with him,berry or others affiliated with ajoi none resulted from cold calls.there was never more than million invested in any one property.he claimed that the investors did not invest in any particular property,but that he could place or move their money into any of ajoi investments,although the subscription agreements executed by each investor referred to a specific property.while he averred that investors were general partners and controlled the entities,even testifying that they had input in the amounts he offered to purchase properties,he admitted that they were not expected to do anything except pay money.he testified that all of the investors who testified at trial had complained to him about possible fraud,commingling and mismanagement in.
patrick held the title of and sales manager at different times during his tenure at ajoi.they were only throw away titles as he had no control or management authority.he testified that he was not trying to cheat anyone and did not intend to encourage,facilitate or commit any crime.he did not know the investments were securities requiring registration,but believed they were exempt.
berry testified that in may or june,he spoke with donovan and advised her of salas illegal,immoral and unethical activities.she did not believe him,told him that if she needed him she would call,and hung up.in,he also telephoned burke and told him the same things.burke responded that he thought as much.berry admitted that although he tried to do so,he did not send the september,letter to all investors.
discussion 
appellants convictions are not barred by the statute of limitations.
the parties stipulated that the first notice to law enforcement of the alleged crimes was july.a complaint was first filed on july,appellants moved to dismiss various counts pursuant to penal code section and to acquit pursuant to penal code section on the ground that the applicable statute of limitations barred prosecution of the charges against them.the trial court denied these motions.
the trial court instructed the jury in accordance with caljic that the applicable statute of limitations was four years from discovery of the offense by the victims or law enforcement authorities the jury found the special allegation that each of the offenses was not discovered until after july,to be true with respect to the four counts of which appellants were found guilty.
appellants contend that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a statute of limitations applied to violations of section they argue that penal code section providing for a statute of limitations for offenses punishable by imprisonment in state prison,is applicable and that law enforcement authorities first notice of the alleged offenses on july,was more than three years before prosecution was begun on july.appellants also contend that even if a statute of limitations is applicable,it began to run,at latest,after receipt of the may,letter,more than four years before the prosecution was initiated,because investors had sufficient information at that point to make a reasonably prudent person suspicious of criminal conduct.these contentions lack merit.
section is subject to a statute of limitations 
salas was convicted of one count of selling unregistered securities to the mellands in,of two counts of selling them to donovan in january and february,and of one count of selling them to burke in,in violation of section.patrick was only convicted on the latter count.at the time appellants committed the offenses,the applicable statute of limitations was three years,from the date of discovery of the offense,subd.c the jury found that the offenses were not discovered until after july,thus commencing the running of the statute of limitations,at the earliest,after that date.
effective january,before the statute of limitations had even commenced to run on appellants offenses,the legislature amended penal code section to provide for a statute of limitations in lieu of that statute previous limitations period and,for the first time,applied it to any offense listed in penal code section,subdivision c,which included violations of section by virtue of it being within the penalty language of section,subdivision a this new limitations period in penal code section became applicable to appellants offenses because the original period had not yet expired.falter united states cir,justice learned hand upheld the right to prosecute within a period extended by an amendment to an existing statute if the amendment was adopted prior to the expiration of the original period of limitations people callan d,disapproved on other grounds in people lopez cal th,d,people eitzen d.
in support of their theory that the statute of limitations governs,appellants point to the following language in people fine th,d penal code section requires that prosecution of a violation of section must be commenced within three years after commission of the offense.but the fine court was not called upon to consider the limitations period applicable to section.at issue only was whether the tolling provision in penal code section,subdivision c applied to section.it is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.people jones cal th,fn,d.furthermore,it appears that the prosecution in fine was commenced prior to the amendment of penal code section,when the penal code section statute of limitations was applicable to violations of section.and,in making the quoted statement,the court of appeal in fine cited no authority,conducted no analysis,and even failed to refer to penal code section.
because the trial court correctly applied a statute of limitations period,discovery by law enforcement of the charged offenses on july,was less than four years before a prosecution was initiated,and the charges were not barred.
b.the jury statute of limitations finding is supported by substantial evidence 
appellants contend that the statute of limitations began to run more than four years before initiation of the prosecution because the may,letter provided the victims with facts sufficient to make a reasonably prudent person suspicious of criminal activity.but the jury found otherwise.thus,appellants contention can only be sustained if there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding.when a statute of limitations issue has been tried to a jury,on appeal the question becomes whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury implied findings.citation.people le th,d.
we thus review the record to determine if there was substantial evidence to support the jury finding.in assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the jury finding to determine whether it discloses evidence that is reasonable,credible,and of solid value citations.people bolin cal th,d.we resolve all conflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the jury finding,and indulge every reasonable inference the jury could draw from the evidence.people autry th,d.
the statute of limitations does not begin to run until after discovery of the commission of the offense,subd.c.reasonable diligence must be exercised in discovering crimes.people zamora cal d.the statute commences to run after one has knowledge of facts sufficient to make a reasonably prudent person suspicious of fraud,thus putting him on inquiry id.at.the crucial determination is whether law enforcement authorities or the victim had actual notice of circumstances sufficient to make them suspicious of fraud thereby leading them to make inquiries which might have revealed the fraud.id.at.
substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the violations of section w ere not discovered until after july.the mellands,donovan,and burke all received the may,letter from berry,a disgruntled former employee of ajoi who resigned under obviously unhappy circumstances disagreements and several other issues.the may,letter comments that the practices of berry new company,cp development,are candid and give investors their money back first were not obvious suggestions that ajoi had acted otherwise.the letter could reasonably have been viewed as nothing more than a solicitation of the victims business.
in fact,none of the victims interpreted the letter to be a sign of wrongdoing at ajoi.it was the only hint of a problem that donovan received before,when she was contacted by law enforcement investigators.while it suggested to her that something was rotten in denmark,it did not suggest,and no one told her,that there were any fraudulent practices occurring.she took no action as a result of the letter and invested another with ajoi more than a year and a half later.burke understood the letter to simply mean that berry would no longer be affiliated with ajoi.likewise,melland was unconcerned by the may,letter because she had interpreted it to mean only that berry had left ajoi.although the letter concerned melland that there might be a problem,he did not think that its reference to full disclosure was a comment on ajoi or salas conduct.none of the victims contacted berry about the letter or received a telephone call from him to elaborate on its contents.
apart from the may,letter,none of the victims believed that there was fraud.none received or saw the september,letter,which contained direct accusations of fraud and other wrongdoing by salas and ajoi.even when the mellands learned from schweder that,contrary to their understanding when they invested in boylston street associates,ajoi did not own boylston street,melland believed that only meant the project was off to a slow start.she did not believe that there was fraud or misappropriation of money.moreover,all of the victims received a series of letters painting a rosy picture about the projects and reassuring them that ajoi was acquiring the property.this evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding that the offenses were not discovered until after july.
ii.the trial court did not properly instruct the jury on the elements of a section violation.
section is a general intent crime 
appellants contend that the trial court committed reversible error in giving instructions that erroneously informed the jury that selling an unqualified security is a strict liability offense.thus,we must first consider whether a violation of section is a general intent or strict liability crime.s ince we are considering a penal application of section,a statute whose language is susceptible of two constructions,the court must ordinarily adopt the construction more favorable to the offender.the defendant is entitled to the benefit of every reasonable doubt,whether it arises out of a question of fact,or as to true interpretation of words or construction of language used in a statute.citations.people simon cal th,d,simon.
a strict liability crime is one which dispense s with any mens rea,scienter,or wrongful intent.simon,supra,cal th at,d,people malfavon th,d.traffic violations are examples.people vogel cal d,fn.drivers are responsible for violating traffic regulations whether or not they intend the conduct that violates the statute or whether they even know that they have engaged in such conduct see people rubalcava cal th,d,rubalcava a defendant may be guilty of a strict liability offense even if he does not know the facts that make his conduct fit the definition of the offense.citation.
a general intent crime,on the other hand,requires mens rea.the intent required is the purpose or willingness to do the act or omission in question.people johnson th,d.the fact that a general intent criminal statute provides for a presumption of the requisite criminal intent merely from the doing of the act which the law declares to be a crime,even though the defendant may not know that his act or conduct is unlawful,does not make such a statute a strict liability offense.rather,such a statute simply shifts the criminal intent a n unlawful intent is presumed from the doing of the unlawful act.such presumption has the legal effect of being a conclusive presumption because it is settled that,t o constitute general criminal intent it is not necessary that there should exist an intent to violate the law.when a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be a crime,he is acting with general criminal intent even though he may not know that his act or conduct is unlawful.people lujan,d supp.
to determine whether section constitutes a strict liability offense,as the people argue,we must determine the legislative intent in adopting those statutes by considering the entire regulatory scheme of the act.our starting point in divining this intent is the ancient requirement of a culpable state of mind for imposition of criminal punishment.morissette united states.the contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion.it is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individuals to choose between good and evil.ibid.generally,t he existence of mens rea is the rule of,rather than the exception to,the principles of criminal jurisprudence people coria cal th,d,coria.this notion is embodied in penal code section,which provides in every crime or public offense there must exist a union,or joint operation of act and intent,or criminal negligence.
further,the prevailing trend is away from the imposition of criminal sanctions in the absence of culpability where the governing statute,by implication or otherwise,expresses no legislative intent or policy to be served by imposing strict liability.coria,supra,cal th at,d.courts are reluctant to construe offenses requir ing the defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful conduct as containing no mens rea requirement.id.at,d.
the most significant factor in discerning whether the legislature intended section to be a strict liability offense is the severity of the penalty imposed.we generally presume that the legislature would not attach a substantial penalty to a strict liability offense.harsh penalties are a significant consideration in determining whether the statute should be construed as dispensing with mens rea.citations.simon,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also coria,supra,cal th at,d.historically,the penalty imposed under a statute has been a significant consideration in determining whether the statute should be construed as dispensing with mens rea.certainly,the cases that first defined the concept of the public welfare offense imposing strict liability almost uniformly involved statutes that provided for only light penalties such as fines or short jail sentences,not imprisonment in the state penitentiary.staples united states,d,italics omitted.
section,subdivision a provides the penalty for violations of section.in,at the time of salas first violation of section for which he was convicted,section,subdivision a made violation of section a felony,punishable by up to three years in state prison and a fine of the penalty was made even harsher in,when the potential fine under section,subdivision a was increased to million.by any assessment,a felony conviction providing for up to three years in state prison and a million fine is sufficiently severe so as to invoke the longstanding and fundamental notion that an individual must be aware of the conduct in which he or she is engaging before being convicted.
the language of section also belies the people claim that violation of section is a strict liability offense.section provides that selling such securities is criminally punishable only if a person willfully violates section.penal code section explains that w illfully,when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted,implies simply a purpose or willingness to commit the act,or make the omission referred to.it does not require any intent to violate law,or to injure another,or to acquire any advantage.generally,a statute proscribing willful behavior is a general intent crime.people johnson,supra,th at,d see also people dollar d.use of words willfully and maliciously usually signals a general intent crime.
further indication that the legislature did not intend the sale of unregistered,unexempt securities to be a strict liability offense comes from the federal security acts.the act was based on the federal model.the legislature may also have been aware of the legislative history of the federal acts,therefore,and in that history there is no indication that any type of criminal or civil liability is to attach in the absence of scienter.simon,supra,cal th at,d.further,although the definitive interpretation of the federal law requiring mens rea for its violations did not come for many years after the adoption of the act,when that interpretation became clear,the legislature made no effort to clarify that it was inapplicable to the act.simon,decided nearly a decade ago,concluded that knowledge was required to establish the violation of at least some provisions of the act and unequivocally articulated its concern with imposing the harsh penalties provided in section without a showing of knowledge.simon noted the modern trend away from strict liability offenses and expressly solicited the legislature clarification of which of the criminal violations of the act are strict liability offenses and what mental states are elements of those which require scienter.simon,supra,at,fn,d.the legislature has remained silent,suggesting its concurrence with the modern trend requiring mens rea for criminal liability under the act.
a notable,albeit narrow,exception to the requirement of a culpable state of mind,has been recognized for public welfare offenses.see morissette united states,supra,at.ahmad cir,staples united states,supra,at.dis.opn.of stevens.those are offenses pertaining to violations of statutes regulating dangerous or deleterious devices or products or obnoxious waste materials.ibid.examples include dangerous narcotics,hazardous substances and impure or adulterated foods and drugs.staples united states,at.the rationale of the doctrine of strict criminal liability is that,although criminal sanctions are relied upon,the primary purpose of the statute is regulation rather than punishment or correction,and that the interest of enforcement for the public health and safety requires the risk that an occasional nonoffender may be punished in order to prevent the escape of a greater number of culpable offenders.people travers d.
our supreme court has recently stated under many statutes enacted for the protection of the public health and safety,traffic and food and drug regulations,criminal sanctions are relied upon even if there is no wrongful intent.these offenses usually involve light penalties and no moral obloquy or damage to reputation.coria,supra,cal th at,d,see also people vogel,supra,cal d at,fn.but,the public welfare exception has not been applied in this state to offenses which,like section,do not involve conduct which threatens the public health or safety and are punishable with lengthy prison terms.the exception continues to be restricted to crimes of the type described in vogel storage of hazardous waste,transportation and disposal of hazardous waste discharge wastes into watercourses,and unlicensed possession of such waste material.simon,supra,cal th at,d.the provisions of the act have not traditionally been viewed to be public welfare offenses subject to the narrow exception of the mens rea requirement.the act regulates neither health nor safety matters.
another aspect of section distinguishes it from public welfare statutes.public welfare statutes render criminal a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the community health and safety.citation.staples united states,supra,at.such public welfare offenses that dispense with awareness of some wrongdoing have been created by congress,and recognized by this court,in limited circumstances.citation.typically,our cases recognizing such offenses involve statutes that regulate potentially harmful or injurious items in such situations,we have reasoned that as long as a defendant knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of a character that places him,in responsible relation to a public danger citation,he should be alerted to the probability of strict regulation,and we have assumed that in such cases congress intended to place the burden on the defendant to ascertain at his peril whether his conduct comes within the inhibition of the statute.id.at.see,united states freed,d regulation of unregistered grenades does not require proof the defendant knew the grenades were unregistered.o ne would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act.unlike traditional public welfare offenses which by their nature alert a reasonable person that the conduct they proscribe may seriously threaten health and safety,appellants conduct in seeking investors for real estate projects is traditionally lawful conduct that provides no such notice.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that violation of section is not a strict liability offense but rather a general intent offense,requiring proof that the proscribed conduct was intentionally accomplished.
the attorney general,relying on the decision by our colleagues in division four of this court in people corey th,d corey,argues that selling unregistered,unexempt securities is a strict liability offense corey provides courts have long considered a violation of section to be a strict liability offense we conclude that section does not include scienter as an element which must be proved to establish that a person who offers or sells an unregistered and unexempt security is in violation of the statute.corey,supra,at,d.we reject the attorney general contention and take issue with corey on this point.
corey was premised upon the faulty assumption that the magnitude of potential criminal penalties for violation of section is up to million in fines and up to one year imprisonment.corey,supra,th at,d,italics added.in fact,the maximum penalty for violation of section,as provided in section,subdivision a is three years.while section provides for imprisonment in state prison without specifying the duration of such imprisonment,penal code section provides except in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by any law of this state,every offense declared to be a felony,or to be punishable by imprisonment in a state prison,is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison for months,or two or three years thus,appellants faced,and salas received,a maximum sentence of three years.because the harshness of the penalty is a significant factor in assessing whether a statute is a strict liability statute,corey miscalculation led its analysis astray.corey focused its attention on attempting to distinguish between characteristics of section,which it was considering,and section,which simon considered,rather than assessing whether the policy considerations articulated in simon were applicable to a violation of section.corey gave too little weight to the factors we find significant.we therefore decline to follow it.
selling unregistered,nonexempt securities includes a knowledge requirement 
having concluded that the violation of section is a general intent crime,we next consider whether that crime also carries a knowledge requirement.we recognize that sections and do not expressly include a knowledge requirement,but t hat the statute contains no reference to knowledge or other language of mens rea is not itself dispositive.in re jorge cal th,d,jorge.the logic flowing from the nature of general intent crimes,as illustrated in a series of california supreme court cases,establishes that knowledge of the facts that bring a defendant conduct within the prohibition of a criminal statute,or criminal negligence in not knowing those facts,is an element of such crimes 
for example,in simon,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether the legislature intended sections and,which criminalize the willful sale or purchase of securities by means of false or misleading statements or omission of material facts,to be a strict liability offense.simon,supra,at,d.in determining that a violation of section was not a strict liability offense,our high court held that knowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of a statement or of the materiality of an omission,or criminal negligence in failing to investigate and discover them,are elements of the criminal offense described in section simon,supra,at,d,and the trial court consequently erred in failing to so instruct the jury 
similarly,in coria,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether health and safety code section,subdivision c,manufacturing methamphetamine,required the defendant to know that the substance the defendant was manufacturing was methamphetamine.the supreme court interpreted the statute to require that the accused know the facts bringing his conduct within the prohibition of the statute,that is,the character of the substance being manufactured.it reasoned that the statute,unlike strict liability public welfare statutes which usually involve light penalties and no moral obloquy or damage to reputation coria,supra,at,d,was a felony,which is as bad a word as you can give to man or thing.ibid.w here dispensing with mens rea would require the defendant to have knowledge only of traditionally lawful conduct,a severe penalty is a further factor tending to suggest that the legislature did not intend to eliminate a mens rea requirement.id.at,d,italics omitted.
likewise,in rubalcava,supra,cal th,d,the defendant was convicted of carrying a concealed dirk or dagger in violation of penal code section,subdivision c.a dirk or dagger was defined by statute as a knife or other instrument that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death.at the time of the defendant arrest,the penalty for violating penal code section,like section,subdivision a here,was imprisonment in county jail for one year or state prison.the defendant contended on appeal that penal code section,subdivision a was a specific intent offense,requiring as an element of the offense an intent to use the concealed instrument as a stabbing weapon.the supreme court rejected this contention,stating when the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act,without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence,we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act.this intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent.rubalcava,at,d.the court continued that even though the offense before it was a general intent crime,because it criminalizes traditionally lawful conduct,we construe the statute to contain a knowledge element.id.at,d.thus,to commit the crime,a defendant must still have the requisite guilty mind that is,the defendant must knowingly and intentionally carry concealed upon his or her person an instrument that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon.citation.a defendant who does not know that he is carrying the weapon or that the concealed instrument may be used as a stabbing weapon is therefore not guilty of violating section.id.at,d.
a month after rubalcava,in jorge,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court considered whether a violation of penal code section,subdivision b,which punished the possession of an unregistered assault weapon,required knowledge of the weapon characteristics which brought it within the assault weapons control act requiring registration.the supreme court held that the offense was not a strict liability offense,and that the people were required to prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known the characteristics of the weapon which brought it within the registration requirements.jorge,supra,at,d.
each of these california supreme court decisions involves general intent offenses,requiring the defendant to perform intentionally the act that brought the defendant conduct within the prohibition of the criminal statute.in other words,a defendant can not intentionally engage in proscribed conduct if he or she does not know that he or she is doing it in the first place.in simon,supra,cal th,d,the defendant could not intend to make a material misrepresentation or omission if he did not know that his or her statement was erroneous or omitted a material fact.in coria,supra,cal th,d,the defendant could not intend to manufacture methamphetamine if the defendant did not know that was the substance being manufactured.in rubalcava,supra,cal th,d,the defendant could not intend to carry a concealed dirk or dagger capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon if the defendant did not know he possessed a concealed dirk or dagger or that the object the defendant possessed was capable of the prohibited use.finally,in jorge,supra,cal th,d,the defendant could not intend to possess a prohibited firearm if he did not know that the firearm he or she possessed had the characteristics that brought it within the category proscribed by the statute.
in light of these legal principles,we hold that appellants could not have intentionally sold unregistered and nonexempt securities unless they sold such securities knowing or lacking that knowledge as a result of criminal negligence that the securities were unregistered and the facts that removed the securities from the section,subdivision f exemption we thus review the challenged jury instructions to determine whether they comply with our holding herein,namely whether the trial court gave a general intent instruction coupled with an instruction on the appropriate knowledge requirement.
c.the jury instructions 
the trial court instructed the jury on the elements of the offense of violating section as follows defendant javier salas is charged in counts,and.defendant rick berry is charged in count and defendant steve patrick is charged in count with violating california corporations code section,subdivision a in that they violated california code section.it is unlawful for any person to willfully offer to sell a security in an issuer transaction without first having obtained a qualification of such security from the commissioner of corporations of the state of california unless such security is exempted.in order to prove the commission of such crime,each of the following elements must be proved.that a security was offered or sold in this state.that such conduct was willful and.that at the time the security was offered or sold,such offer or sale had not been qualified with the commissioner of corporations of the state of california.
the trial court also instructed the jury regarding the intent required to violate section as follows in the crime of offering or selling a security that has not been qualified or exempted corporations code section,a general criminal intent need only be shown.when a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be a crime,he is acting with general criminal though he may not know that is sic act or conduct is unlawful.proof that the defendant had an evil motive or an intent to violate the law is not required.moreover,evidence that a defendant relied on the advice of counsel or that he acted in good faith is not a defense.
in addition to the foregoing special instructions,the trial court gave a number of pertinent caljic instructions including caljic the word willfully,when applied to the intent with which an act is done or omitted means with a purpose or willingness to commit the act or to make the omission in question.the word willfully does not require any intent to violate the law,or to injure another,or to acquire any advantage caljic in the crime of selling or offering to sell unqualified securities,in violation of c orporations c ode section,subdivision a,and offering to sell or selling a security by misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in violation of corporations code section,subdivision b there must exist a union or joint operation of act or conduct and general criminal intent.general intent does not require an intent to violate the law.when a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be a crime,he is acting with general criminal intent,even though he may not know that his act or conduct is unlawful and caljic this instruction applies only to counts,and.when the evidence shows that a person voluntarily did that which the law declares to be a crime,it is no defense that he or she did not know that the act was unlawful or that he or she believed it to be lawful.the trial court did not instruct in accordance with caljic,the strict liability instruction.
regarding appellants defense that the securities were exempt,the trial court instructed the jury an offer or sale of a security is exempted from the qualification requirements of corporations code section when it meets each of the following requirements.the security is not sold to more than persons not counting any officer,director or affiliate of the issuer.for purposes of this criteria,a husband and wife are counted as one person and.all purchasers either have a personal or business relationship with the offeror,or are sophisticated investors by virtue of their business and financial experience or the business and financial experience of their financial advisors.for this criteria to be met,the offeror must have made available sufficient accurate information to enable the purchaser or his financial advisor to make an informed and intelligent investment decision and.each purchaser represents that they are purchasing for their own account and not for resale of the security and.the offer and sale of the security is not accomplished by any publication of any advertisement.if any of the above criteria is not present then the security is not exempted.as used in this instruction,preexisting personal or business relationship included any relationship consisting of personal or business contacts of a nature and duration such as would enable a reasonably prudent purchaser to be aware of the character,business acumen and general business and financial circumstances of the person with whom such relationship exists.
the trial court instructions to the jury were defective.they did not advise the jury that the people were required to prove that appellants knew,or were criminally negligent in not knowing,that the securities were unregistered and that it was a defense to the charge that appellants did not know,or were criminally negligent in not knowing,the facts making the securities nonexempt.simon,supra,cal th at,d.nor did the trial court instruct that appellants needed only to raise a reasonable doubt that they sold nonexempt securities.the trial court instructed that it was no defense to the charge of selling unregistered,nonexempt securities that appellant acted in good faith.the jury might have concluded that appellants were acting in good faith if they were unaware of the facts that made their conduct criminal,that there were more than investors,but in light of that instruction,it was required to find appellants guilty.therefore,on remand,the trial court must correct its instruction.
although the trial court erred in instructing the jury,the error was harmless as to salas,but not as to patrick 
even under the more stringent beyond a reasonable doubt standard set forth in chapman california,d,the instructional error was harmless as to salas.the parties stipulated that the investments in boylston street associates were securities and that no application to register them had been filed.in light of the stipulations,by finding appellants guilty of selling unregistered,nonexempt securities within the meaning of section,subdivision f,the jury necessarily found that the securities were not exempt.in order to make that finding,it had to have concluded that one or more of the requirements for exemption was unsatisfied.
the two elements of the exemption seriously contended by the people to have been lacking were the requirements that there be no more than investors in boylston street associates,subd.f,and either the investors had a preexisting relationship with ajoi or they were sufficiently experienced to allow them to protect their own interests,subd.f.the verdict does not reveal which of the two issues the jury found against appellants,or if they found against them on both.regardless,the instructional error against salas was harmless.
on the first issue,tse,the examiner from the department of corporations,testified that there were investors in boylston street associates.she reached that conclusion by counting the number of checks that were in round number amounts,written to that entity.kalaydjian,the receivership administrator for ajoi,testified that there were people reflected on the records of boylston street associates,with various monetary amounts written next to their names.she was unable to say whether any of those investments might have been transferred to a different ajoi entity.
salas testified that he knew that the exemption required that there be no more than investors.he boldly asserted that he oversaw the investor records that he accurately maintained,and they reflected that there were no more than investors kalaydjian confiscated those records and presumably opined as to the number of investors based upon them.salas refuted the testimony of tse,claiming that her calculations did not take into account refunded investments and people who were not investors in that entity.if the jury found that the number of investors exceeded,they were not instructed to determine whether salas was aware of this fact,an element of the charges against him.
that being said,the error nevertheless is harmless.salas testified that he knew the requirements to be exempt from having to register his securities because he had been a registered representative of several.as previously discussed,he controlled every aspect of ajoi,essentially a operation,with patrick and the other employees being nothing more than salesmen.given his awareness of the exemption requirements,his total control over ajoi,his admitted personal supervision of records related to investors,and his involvement in conversations with investors,the evidence that salas was criminally negligent in not knowing that there were more than investors was overwhelming.had the jury been properly instructed on the requirement that salas know the facts bringing his conduct within the prohibition of section,that the exemption was inapplicable,or be criminally negligent in not knowing those facts,it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the same verdict would have been reached.
preexisting relationship or sufficient experience to protect own interests 
having concluded that even if properly instructed the jury would have found salas criminally negligent in not knowing that the number of investors in boylston street associates exceeded,our analysis could stop here,as his conviction would have to be affirmed.but for the sake of completeness and because another defendant differently situated is involved,we continue our discussion of whether the failure to instruct on knowledge was harmless error to salas with respect to the exemption requirement of section,subdivision f that there be a preexisting relationship with investors or investors have the requisite experience to protect their interests.
the mellands,donovan and burke all testified that they were solicited by means of cold calls.salas testified that he knew that section,subdivision f required a preexisting relationship with investors that precluded cold calls,and claimed that all of the investors in boylston street associates had prior relationships with ajoi employees.but the preexisting relationship was required to be with partners,officers,directors or controlling persons of ajoi.salas testified that only he controlled ajoi and that he made all of the decisions and controlled the finances.he was the president,secretary and treasurer.the title of,held by patrick for a short time,was apparently a meaningless title,as salas described it as a throwaway title given in lieu of salary increases,not a corporate title.hence,there was undisputed evidence that salas knew that not all of the preexisting relationships were with the statutorily mandated individuals.with regard to the preexisting relationship prong of section,subdivision f,salas was aware of facts that prevented the investments from being exempt.
with respect to the alternative element of section,subdivision f that the investors could protect their own interests,our analysis is more complex.as set forth above,the trial court instructed the jury that in order for the exemption to apply,the investor had to be sophisticated.appellants contend that this instruction misstates the law.they argue that substituting the term sophisticated investor,which does not appear in section,subdivision f,for an investor who could protect his or her own interests in connection with the transaction imposed a higher standard than required by the statute,subd.f.this contention has merit.
section,subdivision f requires that if investors do not have a preexisting relationship with the issuer of the security they,or their advisors,must have the business or financial experience to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the transaction.but the jury instruction here required more,namely that they have the business or financial experience to make them sophisticated investors.the term sophisticated connotes a higher level of experience than that necessary for investors to protect their interests.webster third new international dictionary,among other definitions of sophisticated,defines it as worldly wise,knowing supremely cultured,finely experienced and aware.webster new internat.dict.requiring a higher level of experience,the term sophisticated elevated appellants burden of showing the requisite experience of investors to qualify for the exemption.
we conclude that this error was harmless.as set forth above,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that salas knew or should have known that more than investors had invested money in boylston street associates.because salas can not satisfy this prerequisite to the exemption,it is irrelevant whether the trial court wrongly instructed the jury regarding sophisticated investors 
c.the trial court did not otherwise err in giving this instruction 
appellants also argue that part b of the jury instruction added the requirement that in order to be a sophisticated investor,the offeror must have made available sufficient accurate information to enable the purchaser or his financial advisor to make an informed and intelligent investment decision.they assert that this addition imposed a greater burden on them to prove this defense than imposed by the statute which contains no such language.this contention lacks merit.
although the challenged language added in part b of the jury instruction is not explicitly contained in the statute,we are not apprised of any requirement that a jury instruction based on a statute must blindly adhere to its every word.an instruction must only contain a clear,correct and pertinent statement of the law,see also people hernandez th,d.the challenged addition to this portion of the instruction here comports with case law interpreting the statute.see people park d.t here must be sufficient basis of accurate information upon which the sophisticated investor may exercise his skills t he shrewdest investor acuity will be blunted without specifications about the issuer.for an investor to be invested with exemptive status he must have the required data for judgment.
appellants also challenge this instruction,contending that it erroneously omitted the language in section,subdivision f that,t he commissioner may by rule require the issuer to file a notice of transactions under this subdivision provided,however,that the failure to file the notice or the failure to file the notice within the time specified by the rule of the commissioner shall not affect the availability of this exemption.an issuer who fails to file the notice as provided by rule of the commissioner shall,within business days after demand by the commissioner,file the notice and pay to the commissioner a fee equal to the fee payable had the transaction been qualified under section.appellants make the somewhat baffling argument that the omitted language was necessary so that the jury would know that appellants had no obligation to file a notice of intent to rely upon an exemption.
but there was no contention made by the prosecutor,nor evidence introduced to which we have been directed,suggesting that appellants had any such obligation.thus,it was unnecessary to instruct on a matter that was not an issue in the case.people armstead th,d a trial court must refrain from instructing on principles of law which are not only irrelevant to issues raised by the evidence but have the effect of confusing the jury.
the verdict against patrick stands on a different footing.he testified that he believed the investments he was soliciting were exempt from registration,thereby indicating that he knew the securities were unregistered.but he was merely a salesman for whom there was no evidence that he knew facts making the investments nonexempt.he had no control or management authority for ajoi which might impose upon him the duty to make certain that the exemption requirements were met or render him criminally negligent for not knowing those facts.even under the more lenient people watson cal d,standard,we can not say that there is no reasonable probability that had the jury been properly instructed regarding the knowledge requirements,the verdict would have been different.on remand,the trial court must correct the error in instructing on the exemption requirement contained in section,subdivision f and instruct the jury as follows all purchasers either have a preexisting personal or business relationship with the offeror,or by virtue of their business or financial experience or the business or financial experience of their professional advisors who are unaffiliated with the offeror,the purchasers can be reasonably assumed to have the capacity to protect their own interests in connection with the transaction.
disposition 
the judgment against salas is affirmed.the judgment against patrick is reversed and the matter remanded for his retrial.
