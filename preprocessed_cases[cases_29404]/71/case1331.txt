we address in this opinion two issues.the first is the sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint to survive demurrer.second,we address whether equitable considerations might warrant an exception to the requirement that a shareholder maintain continuous ownership of stock in order to maintain standing to bring a shareholder derivative action.we will hold that the allegations here were sufficient to survive the demurrers and that equitable considerations bear upon shareholder standing.

background 
appellants were shareholders of ahp,a medical corporation that appellants describe as an independent practice association ipa.appellants shares in ahp were forfeited when they refused to pay an assessment that they believed was part of a scheme by ibarra and barragan to force them out.
first amended complaint 
appellants filed a complaint in october.the parties subsequently stipulated to the filing of the fac,which was filed in march.in the fac,appellants stated that they collectively owned of the shares of ahp barragan and ibarra together owned shares.appellants alleged that barragan and ibarra had controlled ahp improperly and breached their fiduciary obligations to ahp and its shareholders.when appellants objected to barragan and ibarra improper conduct,barragan and ibarra devised a scheme to deny appellants their rights as fully vested shareholders of ahp.the fac alleged six causes of action.first,appellants sought declaratory relief,asking for a judicial determination of their rights and a declaration as to whether the forfeiture of their shares of ahp stock was ultra vires and wrongful.
first cause of action 
as to the first cause of action,the fac alleged that barragan and ibarra declared that appellant alarcon two shares of ahp were forfeited,with no basis or authority for the forfeiture barragan and ibarra then levied an assessment of per share of ahp stock and warned haro,meza,lemor,rodriguez and delgado that failure to pay said levy would result in the forced sale of the shares.the stated purpose of the assessment was to fund the purchase of an ipa in mexico,which appellants alleged was a radical departure from the normal business of ahp.the fac further alleged that the assessment was improper and ultra vires because it was not approved in accordance with ahp articles and the ahp directors had not disclosed all the material terms of the transaction to purchase a foreign business the acquisition of a foreign business was contrary to the stated purposes and of ahp and the assessment was not made for the reasonable needs of ahp,was not prudent,and was fraudulent.when appellants refused to pay the assessment,ibarra and barragan forfeited their shares and ousted them as shareholders.appellants contended that figueroa,hernandez,and perez were not actively involved in the wrongful conduct,but they were aware of the misconduct and failed to take any corrective action.appellants contended that,despite the forfeiture of their shares,they had standing to bring a shareholder derivative action because the assessment was void,fraudulent,and ultra vires.
second cause of action 
the second cause of action was a derivative action,alleging breach of fiduciary duty based on alpha contract to provide management services to ahp.appellants alleged that alpha had acquired or merged with mmc,and that alpha and mmc were owned by barragan and ibarra,who had enjoyed substantial personal gain from the arrangement.the fac alleged that ahp had the financial ability and economic incentive to provide for its own management services through an entity owned and controlled by itself and the pursuit of such an opportunity would have been a natural and reasonable expansion of ahp business.the second cause of action accordingly was a derivative action for breach of fiduciary duty,misappropriation of corporate opportunities,constructive fraud,and accounting.
remaining causes of action 
the third cause of action,also a derivative claim,alleged breach of fiduciary duty by constructive fraud,on the bases that alpha and mmc overcharged ahp for management services and that barragan and ibarra were knowingly overcharging ahp for rent.the fourth cause of action,a derivative claim,was for breach of fiduciary duty and sought an accounting of ahp earnings and expenses.the fifth cause of action was a personal action for conversion,in the alternative to the derivative claims.appellants alleged that ahp,barragan,and ibarra wrongly converted appellants ahp shares and sought an accounting of ahp earnings and expenses so that appellants could determine the value of the shares.sixth,appellants asked to be allowed to inspect ahp records,pursuant to corporations code section 
respondents filed demurrers to the fac.individual respondents filed a general demurrer to the entire fac.ahp demurred to appellants second,third,and fourth derivative causes of action on the ground that appellants lacked standing to bring a derivative suit because they had failed to comply with section,subdivision m,which requires that a delinquent assessment be paid in order to bring an action to recover the shares sold for the delinquent assessment ahp further argued that appellants lacked standing because they had not maintained continuous ownership of the stock.ahp also contended that the fifth cause of action,for conversion,and the sixth cause of action,for failure to produce records,were uncertain.
alpha and mmc demurred to the second and third causes of action on the basis that appellants did not have standing to bring a derivative suit because they had ceased to be shareholders.alpha and mmc demurred to the fifth and sixth causes of action,arguing that appellants did not have standing to bring personal claims against them.
appellants opposed the demurrers.appellants argued,inter alia,that section,subdivision m did not apply because the assessment was void,citing herbert kraft.bank bank of orland cal,kraft,cheney canfield cal,cheney,and other cases for the proposition that the assessment was void.
in june,the trial court held a hearing to address the demurrers.the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrers to the second,third,and fourth causes of action on the basis that appellants were no longer shareholders and therefore lacked standing to bring a shareholder derivative suit,citing grosset wenaas cal th,d,grosset.the court stated that there were no equitable considerations present to allow the derivative suit to go forward.the court sustained with leave to amend the demurrers to the first and fifth causes of action,reasoning that appellants had failed to comply with the requirements of section,subdivision m,and relying on farbstein pacific oil tool,farbstein.the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrers to the sixth cause of action for inspection of records because a demand to inspect may only come from shareholders.the court sustained with leave to amend the demurrer of alpha and mmc to all the causes of action because there were no factual allegations of any misdeeds by those parties.
ii.second amended complaint 
appellants filed the sac in july.the sac alleged two causes of action conversion against barragan,ibarra,and ahp,and declaratory relief as to whether the forfeiture was ultra vires and wrongful,such that their status as shareholders should be reinstated in order to allow a shareholder derivative action.as they argued in their opposition to the demurrers to the fac,appellants contended that section,subdivision m did not apply because under california law,a shareholder is not required to first pay or tender the amount assessed as a precondition of filing an action if the assessment was fraudulent,ultra vires void.appellants alleged that there were other shareholders who did not pay the assessment,but those shares were not forfeited.
respondents again filed demurrers,and a hearing was held in october.the court again reasoned that appellants had failed to comply with section,subdivision m,and that there were insufficient facts to support the allegations of fraud.the court therefore sustained the demurrers.the court asked plaintiffs counsel if there was any reason to allow leave to amend,but counsel replied that,based on the court ruling,there was no way he could amend the complaint.the court therefore sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.
at the hearing,counsel for alpha and mmc sought a motion to dismiss,stating that the court had sustained their demurrers to the fac with leave to amend,but appellants did not name alpha and mmc in the sac.the parties accordingly stipulated that alpha and mmc be dismissed with prejudice.a written order,signed by the court,dismissing the complaint with prejudice as to all defendants,was entered,constituting the entry of judgment.see code civ,etheridge reins intern.california,th,d.appellants filed a notice of appeal.
discussion 
appellants challenge the trial court reliance on section,subdivision m,arguing that they were not required to comply with the statute because the assessment was void.appellants also argue that the sac sufficiently alleged a cause of action for declaratory relief and conversion.appellants contend that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers to the derivative actions in the fac.

personal causes of action 
application of corporations code section 
as noted above,section,subdivision m provides that n o action shall be maintained to recover shares sold for delinquent assessments,upon the ground of irregularity in the assessment,irregularity or defect of the notice of sale,or defect or irregularity in the sale,unless the party seeking to maintain the action first pays or tenders to the corporation,or the party holding the shares sold,the sum for which the shares were sold,together with all subsequent assessments which may have been paid thereon and interest on such sums from the time they were paid.under the plain language of the statute,therefore,appellants can not maintain their action because they concededly have not paid the challenged assessment.
appellants contend,however,that section,subdivision m does not apply because the assessment was void.appellants cite several reasons to support their contention that the assessment was void not all the shares were assessed the assessment was made in violation of ahp articles and,and not all directors were given notice the assessment was part of a scheme to wrongfully freeze out shareholders the assessment was void for miscellaneous other defects.
kraft and cheney 
appellants argue that an assessment is void if it is asserted against some,but not all shares,relying on kraft,supra,cal.in kraft,the plaintiff received stock in a bank as security for a debt.the stock was forfeited after the defendant bank levied an assessment that was not paid.the shares were then sold to directors of the defendant bank.the plaintiff sued,arguing that the assessment was not collected upon any stock other than his own,but the trial court sustained a demurrer,pursuant to the predecessor to section,subdivision m the california supreme court held that the statute did not apply on the basis that the action was not for the recovery upon the ground of irregularity in the assessment,irregularity or defect in the notice of sale,or defect or irregularity in the sale.id.at.rather than being an irregular assessment,the court stated that it was void,citing two reasons.
first,the court stated that,i f one fourth of the capital stock had not been subscribed,the defendant bank had no power to levy the assessment.kraft,supra,cal.at.second,the court stated that a n assessment upon certain of the shareholders,and not upon others,is invalid.id.at,see also hollywood cemetery ass cal,stating that,if all the shares of stock in a corporation were of the same character,it must be conceded that an assessment on some,but not all the shares would clearly be void for want of equality in its levy.the court therefore reasoned that the plaintiff was entitled to an equitable remedy and reversed the judgment sustaining the demurrer against the complaint.kraft,supra,cal.at.
appellants also rely on cheney,supra,cal,in which the california supreme court cited the settled law that an assessment can be legally levied upon the capital stock of a corporation by the board of directors only at a regular meeting of the board or at a special meeting thereof regularly called.id.at,see also raisch oil,an assessment upon the capital stock of a corporation can be levied by a board of directors only at a regular meeting,or at a special meeting regularly called.citations.the proceedings by which the stock of a stockholder of a corporation is declared forfeited must be strictly pursued.the right to levy an assessment can only be legally exercised in the manner provided by law or by the charter of the corporation.citations.thus,where an assessment was levied at a meeting that was held not in accordance with the corporate and without notice to two of the directors,the assessment was void.cheney,supra,cal.at.because the assessment was void,the predecessor statute to section,subdivision m did not apply,and the plaintiff should have been allowed to bring his action.id.at.
respondent ahp contends that kraft stands only for the proposition that an assessment is void only if the forfeited shares are sold to the directors who caused the shares to be forfeited.kraft,however,is not so limited.the statement quoted by ahp is taken out of context and actually is part of the court description of the situation,stating that i t would be strange if a court of equity in such case could not grant relief.kraft,supra,cal.at.furthermore,contrary to the argument of the individual respondents,the court conclusion that the assessment was void was not based solely on the fact that one fourth of the capital stock had not been subscribed.id.at.individual respondents ignore the very
