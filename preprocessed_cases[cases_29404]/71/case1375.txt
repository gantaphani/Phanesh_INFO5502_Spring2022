corporations code sections and are part of the corporate securities law of.et in general,section prohibits insider trading by the issuer of securities or by any person who is an officer,director or controlling person of an issuer.until only purchasers or sellers of stock who could show that they had been harmed by virtue of insider trading had a right of action against violators of section.in the legislature added section,which allows the issuer or anyone acting in the name of the issuer to recover from an officer,director or controlling person who has violated section up to three times the amount such a violator earned by virtue of his or her insider trading.section is a disgorgement statute and the issuer does not need to show that it was harmed by the activities of the inside trader.
section governs only securities transactions which occur in this state.moreover,only issuers who have more than million in assets and more than shareholders may bring an action under section.however,aside from those geographic and capitalization requirements,there are no other express limitations on the scope of either statute.in particular,nothing on the face of either statute limits application of the statutes to securities issued by domestic corporations.
section,which is not a part of the corporate securities law of,provides that a director liability to a corporation is a matter of internal governance of the corporation and is governed by the laws of the state in which it is incorporated.
here,plaintiff is the successor in interest to a delaware corporation,which has its headquarters and principal place of business in california and does substantial business here.defendants are a group of former officers and directors of the corporation.plaintiff alleges that defendants violated section and are liable under section to plaintiff for up to three times the amount defendants earned by way of their insider trading.defendants argue that because the issuer was a delaware corporation and delaware has no statute analogous to section,the internal affairs doctrine as codified in section prevents defendants from being held liable under section.the trial court agreed and sustained defendants demurrers to plaintiff insider trading causes of action without leave to amend.
we issued an order to show cause on plaintiff petition for a writ of mandate.for the reasons we set forth below we grant the petition.unlike the trial court,we do not believe section provisions concerning internal corporate governance modify or limit any provision of the corporate securities law of,including in particular section.briefly,while we agree that the duties officers and directors owe a corporation are in the first instance defined by the law of the state of incorporation,such duties are not the subject of california corporate securities laws in general or section in particular.california corporate securities laws are designed to protect participants in california securities marketplace and deter unlawful conduct which takes place here.because a substantial portion of california marketplace includes transactions involving securities issued by foreign corporations,the corporate securities laws have been consistently applied to such transactions.there is nothing on the face of section or in its history which suggests that the legislature intended that it have any narrower scope than other parts of the corporate securities law of.
plaintiff and petitioner robert friese the trustee is the successor trustee of the peregrine litigation trust,which itself is successor in interest to and acting in the name and right of the estate of peregrine systems.defendants and real parties in interest defendants are former directors and former senior management of peregrine systems,peregrine,a software manufacturer.peregrine is a publicly traded delaware corporation and,as we noted,its headquarters and principal place of business are in san diego.
according to the allegations of the trustee complaint,the following circumstances support its claims in,peregrine issued its initial public offering ipo and its stock was valued at per share.before the ipo,peregrine revenue derived mostly from direct sales to end customers.after the ipo,the board of directors implemented a plan to increase revenue by expanding indirect sales to intermediaries who would then resell peregrine products to consumers.
in addition to its new sales strategy,peregrine implemented a new accounting technique.prior to the ipo,peregrine employed what is known as the accounting method under which peregrine recorded revenue when a product was sold to an end user.following the ipo,peregrine adopted what is known as the accounting method under which revenue is recorded when a product enters the distribution stream.peregrine board of directors adopted the method notwithstanding an admonition from its chief financial officer that this was not a preferred method of recording revenue.
in peregrine public announcements and securities and exchange commission filings,peregrine failed to note that it had adopted the method of recording revenue and that without the new accounting method it would not have met earlier revenue expectations.in fact in peregrine posted million in revenues,a percent increase over the increase was largely due to the use of the more aggressive accounting method.
between april,and august,defendants collectively sold more than million peregrine shares and received approximately million in proceeds from the stock sales.
in peregrine posted revenues of million,an increase of percent over the previous year,and the price of its common stock reached an all time high of per share.as reported revenues soared,defendants failed to disclose that indirect sales were exceeding the percent maximum set by peregrine auditors,that intermediaries were unable to sell inventory peregrine had already recorded as revenue,that direct sales were exceedingly low,and that peregrine was negotiating a merger defendants knew would likely be negatively received by investors.
between february,and february,defendants sold over million shares of peregrine common stock and received in excess of million from the sales.peregrine posted profits of million for,an increase of percent over.defendants again failed to disclose peregrine weak direct sales and reliance on indirect sales.
in may,after peregrine announced an internal investigation into potential accounting irregularities and the resignation of its chief executive officer,the price of peregrine stock dropped percent on april,to cents per share.in september peregrine initiated bankruptcy proceedings.during these proceedings,peregrine cancelled its previously issued common stock,costing shareholders about billion in equity.a restatement of its revenue revealed that peregrine overstated its profits by more than million,or percent,between april and december.
on february,the trustee filed a complaint in superior court,alleging violations of california insider trading laws breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty,breach of the fiduciary duty of care waste of corporate assets,conspiracy and unjust enrichment.on april,the trial court sustained defendants demurrers to the trustee insider trading violations without leave to amend.the trial court found that section and the internal affairs doctrine preclude application of section to the securities defendants sold.the trustee was given leave to amend his remaining causes of action.
on may,the trustee filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,challenging the trial court order sustaining the demurrer.we issued an order to show cause.
discussion 
iwrit relief 
writ relief is appropriate here because this case raises an important issue of statutory construction which has not yet been confronted by either this court or our supreme court.we also note that,although the trustee was given leave to amend some of his causes of action,it would be wasteful to compel him to fully litigate those claims in the trial court before obtaining a definitive ruling on his insider trading claims.under these circumstances extraordinary relief is appropriate.see barrett superior court d.
application of california securities laws to foreign corporations 
for the last years california corporate securities laws have been applied to foreign corporations who do business in this state or whose activities in this state have an impact on this state securities markets.in williams gaylord.the supreme court was asked to consider application of an california law which governed mining corporations.the act provided as follows.it should not be lawful for the directors of any mining corporation to sell,lease,or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the mining ground owned or held by such corporation,nor to purchase or obtain in any way additional mining ground,unless such act be ratified by the holders of at least two thirds of the capital stock of such corporation.such ratification may be either in writing signed and acknowledged by such stockholders or by resolution duly passed at a stockholders meeting called for that purpose.id.at.in williams gaylord a west virginia mining corporation owned mining ground in california.the plaintiff obtained a mortgage on the corporation mining ground but did not obtain the necessary shareholder consent.the mortgage secured in bonds issued by the corporation.later,the supplier of materials and labor filed and foreclosed on a mechanics lien on the same property.the holder of the mechanics lien argued that the mortgage was unenforceable because the corporation shareholders had not ratified it.the circuit court and court of appeals agreed with the holder of the mechanics lien.on certiorari the supreme court affirmed.the court noted that the california supreme court had previously held that the act applied to foreign corporations.the court then rejected the mortgage holder contention that the statute improperly intruded upon the internal affairs of a foreign corporation.the court stated w hen a corporation sells or encumbers its property,incurs debts or gives securities,it does business,and a statute regulating such transactions does not regulate the internal affairs of the corporation.williams gaylord,supra,at,italics added.
the scope of california securities regulation was considered again in western air lines,sobieski d.sobieski.in sobieski the management of a delaware corporation,which had its headquarters and principal place of business in this state,was engaged in a dispute with minority shareholders.in an effort to frustrate the minority shareholders ability to elect directors,the management proposed that the corporation amend its delaware articles of incorporation to eliminate cumulative voting.the california commissioner of corporations determined that any solicitation of proxies approving the elimination of cumulative voting was a sale of securities within the meaning of the corporations code and would require a permit from the commissioner.thereafter,the commissioner denied the corporation application for a permit.by way of a writ of mandate,the corporation challenged the commissioner assertion of authority over its attempt to amend its articles.the trial court granted the writ and found,among other matters,that the amendment of the articles of incorporation was an internal affair of the corporation and its shareholders.sobieski,supra,d at.the court of appeal reversed.in rejecting application of the internal affairs doctrine,the court stated it is true that the courts in california can not control the internal affairs of any foreign corporation.such matters are to be conducted in pursuance of and in compliance with the provisions of the charter of the foreign corporation,and the laws of the country where it was created but in the management and method of its business affairs in california with the citizens and residents thereof,in the sale or disposition or transfer of the shares of stock,it must conform to the laws of california in relation to such matters,and is bound thereby sobieski,supra,d at.
more recently,the scope of california securities laws was considered in diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d,diamond multimedia.in diamond multimedia the defendants in a nationwide class action lawsuit brought under the unlawful market manipulation provisions of sections and argued that california could not provide a remedy for shareholders who did not purchase their shares in california.in rejecting this contention the court found that unlike section,which is expressly limited to intrastate securities transactions,section is limited only to unlawful manipulative conduct which occurs in this state.the court found that when such unlawful conduct in california harms investors,section provides them with a remedy even if they did not buy or sell securities in this state.diamond multimedia,supra,cal th at,d.in rejecting the defendants contention that california had no interest in providing nonresident investors with a remedy,the court stated california also has a legitimate and compelling interest in preserving a business climate free of fraud and deceptive practices.california business depends on a national investment market to support our industry.the california remedy for market manipulation helps to ensure that the flow of capital necessary to the growth of california business will continue.the court of appeal rejected a claim similar to that of petitioners and recognized the importance of extending remedies to parties harmed by wrongful conduct occurring in california in clothesrigger,d.there the plaintiff sought damages for fraud,negligent misrepresentation and unfair business practices in the charges made by defendant for long distance telephone calls.the trial court denied certification of a nationwide class on the ground that a nationwide class was not suitable as california had no interest in providing greater protection to residents of other states than that provided by their home states.the court of appeal reversed that order,noting that defendant had identified no interest of any other state that might be affected by extending california law to the injured nonresidents,and recognizing that california may have an important interest in applying its law to punish and deter the alleged wrongful conduct.citation.diamond multimedia,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
sections,and 
insider use of confidential information not available to the trading public to purchase or sell prohibited under federal law by section b of the securities exchange act and rule adopted by the securities commission pursuant to that statutory provision.such conduct is also prohibited under provisions of the california corporate securities law of.
the traditional theoretical justification for prohibiting insider trading is based on the notion that allowing persons who have access to information to use it for securities trading will discourage individual investors without access to such information from trading in the securities markets.thus,even though persistent arguments have been made by some economists that insider trading is good for the trading markets as a whole and should be permitted,the overwhelming reaction in fact has consistently been to regard it as unfair because it destroys the level playing field among participants in the trading markets.
in recent years,however,the public objections to insider trading have assumed larger dimensions.while at one time governmental prosecution of insider trading might have been regarded by the general public as overzealous,the discovery of persistent,systematic insider trading activities yielding millions of dollars in profit to securities professionals such as ivan boesky and dennis levine has changed the underlying objection to insider trading to one of basic morality and cultural values as described by one leading writer,congress has begun to see the problem in more fundamental cultural terms as a manifestation of undue greed among the already,worthy of legislative intervention if for no other reason than to send a message of censure on behalf of the american people.berger,issuer recovery of insider trading profits under section of the california corporation code berger pac.law journal,fns.omitted.
by adoption of sections,and california has supplemented federal regulation of insider trading.section provides as follows it is unlawful for an issuer or any person who is an officer,director or controlling person of an issuer or any other person whose relationship to the issuer gives him access,directly or indirectly,to material information about the issuer not generally available to the public,to purchase or sell any security of the issuer in this state at a time when he knows material information about the issuer gained from such relationship which would significantly affect the market price of that security and which is not generally available to the public,and which he knows is not intended to be so available,unless he has reason to believe that the person selling to or buying from him is also in possession of the information.
section was enacted in as part of the corporate securities law of.the face of the statute does not restrict its application to securities issued by domestic corporations.rather as noted at the outset,by its terms section is only limited to securities transactions which occur in this state.this literal reading of section is consistent with the intention of the drafters of the corporate securities law of.in enacting the corporate securities law of,including section,the drafters agreed that the basis of jurisdiction and regulation should be the offer or sale of securities in this state and should not be related to the principal place of business or corporate domicile.marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws marsh volk history of cal.law,italics added.
as part of the corporate securities law of,the legislature provided in section a civil remedy for violation of section.section states any person who violates section shall be liable to the person who purchases a security from him or sells a security to him,for damages equal to the difference between the price at which such security was purchased or sold and the market value which such security would have had at the time of the purchase or sale if the information known to the defendant had been publicly disseminated prior to that time and a reasonable time had elapsed for the market to absorb the information,plus interest at the legal rate,unless the defendant proves that the plaintiff knew the information or that the plaintiff would have purchased or sold at the same price even if the information had been revealed to him.
the remedy provided by section is problematic because private plaintiffs must establish privity between themselves and violators of section.see marsh volk,supra,civil liabilities.indeed,there is no record of any cases being brought under the provisions of sections and between and.berger,supra,pac.law journal at.however,in the the integrity of the securities markets was threatened by revelations of extensive insider trading.berger,supra,pac.law journal at.in response to these threats congress enacted the insider trading sanctions act,c,o,t,u,ff and the insider trading securities fraud enforcement act,b,c,k,o,t,u,kk.as professor berger notes,our legislature also felt a need to address the issue of insider trading.berger,supra,pac.law journal at.our legislature response to the insider trading scandals of the was enactment in of section.
section provides in pertinent part a any person other than the issuer who violates section shall be liable to the issuer of the security purchased or sold in violation of section for damages in an amount up to three times the difference between the price at which the security was purchased or sold and the market value which the security would have had at the time of the purchase or sale if the information known to the defendant had been publicly disseminated prior to that time and a reasonable time had elapsed for the market to absorb the information and shall be liable to the issuer of the security or to a person who institutes an action under this section in the right of the issuer of the security for reasonable costs and attorney fees.
d this section shall only apply to issuers who have total assets in excess of one million dollars and have a class of equity security held of record by or more persons.
shortly after enactment of section professor berger made the following observation except for new section of the california corporations code,no other state presently has a statutory provision making a person using inside information liable to the issuer of that security.the controversial aspect of such liability is that normally the issuer in whose favor the monetary recovery for insider trading is sought has sustained no monetary damages from the insider use of confidential information for trading purposes.the enactment in california of section thus seems to be an important legislative decision that the absence of monetary injury to the issuer of the traded security is less important than the deterrent of insider trading by superimposing profit disgorgement to the already existing liability towards the person whose securities the insider purchased or towards the person to whom the insider sold.berger,supra,pac.law journal at,fn.omitted,italics added.
section and the internal affairs doctrine 
section states the directors of a foreign corporation transacting intrastate business are liable to the corporation,its shareholders,creditors,receiver,liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy for the making of unauthorized dividends,purchase of shares or distribution of assets or false certificates,reports or public notices or other violation of official duty according to any applicable laws of the state or place of incorporation or organization,whether committed or done in this state or elsewhere.such liability may be enforced in the courts of this state.as applied to directors liability,section is a codification of the internal affairs doctrine.see in re flashcom.
the internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation internal peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers,directors,and otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.citation.states normally look to the state of a business incorporation for the law that provides the relevant corporate governance general standard of care.citation.
internal affairs include steps taken in the course of the original incorporation,the adoption of,the issuance of corporate shares,the holding of directors and shareholders meetings,the declaration and payment of dividends and other distributions,charter amendments,mergers,consolidations,and reorganizations,the reclassification of shares and the purchase and redemption by the corporation of outstanding shares of its own stock.citations.
as stated in the restatement second of conflict of laws it would be impractical to have matters which involve a corporation organic structure or internal administration governed by different laws.it would be impractical,for example,if an issuance of shares,a payment of dividends,a charter amendment,or a consolidation or reorganization were to be held valid in one state and invalid in another in the absence of an explicitly applicable local statute to the contrary,the local law of the state of incorporation has been applied to determine issues involving corporate acts of the sort mentioned.citations.state farm mutual automobile ins.superior court th,d state farm.
