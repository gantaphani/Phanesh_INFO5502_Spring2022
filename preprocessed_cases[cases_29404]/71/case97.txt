in,purolator products,a publicly held manufacturer of automotive parts,was the target of acquisition efforts by mark iv industries,incorporated.defendant shepard and anthony aldrich against whom the commission did not file a complaint were the sole shareholders of a consulting firm.aldrich,a member of the board of directors for the target,had nonpublic information that purolator and mark iv were involved in negotiations regarding mark iv acquisition proposal.in july,aldrich shared the information with shepard.shepard agreed not to disclose the information and indicated that he understood his obligation to maintain its confidentiality.
on saturday,september,shepard told sargent,his friend and dentist,that aldrich was on the purolator board and he stated,i am aware of a company right now that is probably going to be bought,but even if i had the money i ca buy stock in this company because i am too close to the situation.the following monday,sargent contacted his broker and asked him to do some research on purolator.sargent thereafter purchased a total of shares of purolator.sargent also notified his close friend scharn of his purchases in purolator.scharn then purchased shares of purolator.within a few days of the tender offer announcement,sargent sold all of his purolator stock at a profit of.scharn sold his shares at a profit of.

ii.standard of review 
in an sec enforcement case,we review the district court decision regarding injunctions,prejudgment interest,and civil penalties for abuse of discretion.riseman orion research,cir.under this rubric,a buse occurs when a material factor deserving significant weight is ignored,when an improper factor is relied upon,or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed,but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.indep.oil chem.workers of quincy,procter gamble,cir.further,a district court abuses its discretion if it incorrectly applies the law to particular facts.am.bd.of psychiatry neurology,cir.
iii.injunctive relief 
the sec argues that the district court relied on an erroneous legal standard in refusing to grant an injunction against future violations of securities laws.the agency claims that the court believed that defendants must pose a relatively imminent threat of recidivism in order to justify permanent injunctive relief.we disagree,finding instead that the district court reached the proper conclusion under the correct standard.
the securities and exchange act permits the sec to seek an injunction in federal district court to prevent violations of securities laws.d.such an injunction is appropriate where there is,at a minimum,proof that a person is engaged in or is about to engage in a substantive violation of either one of the acts or of the regulations promulgated thereunder.aaron sec,d.this court has upheld issuance of injunctions in cases where future violations were likely.see,sec fife,cir accord sec ingoldsby,civ,wl.may,issuing an injunction where there is a reasonable likelihood that the defendants will violate the same law again.the district court,although it did not provide a detailed basis for its decision,properly articulated the legal standard for issuance of an injunction as reasonable likelihood of recidivism,not an imminent threat of it.
the reasonable likelihood of future violations is typically assessed by looking at several factors,none of which is determinative.sec youmans,cir.courts consider,among other things,the nature of the violation,including its egregiousness and its isolated or repeated nature,as well as whether the defendants will,owing to their occupation,be in a position to violate again.sec first city fin,sec universal major indus,cir.the courts also take into account whether the defendants have recognized the wrongfulness of their conduct.sec manor nursing,cir.
under these factors,the district court acted within its discretion in denying an injunction with respect to shepard.shepard disclosed confidential information to sargent,but this was a violation.ingoldsby,wl,at indicating that even a past violation by the defendant does not demonstrate a realistic likelihood of recurrence.as the sec admits,shepard violation was not an egregious one,particularly where he neither traded on the information himself nor derived any direct personal profit.see,sec sayegh,aff sub nom.sec militano,cir finding conduct egregious where defendant accomplished the manipulation by buying and having other market makers buy shares sec lorin,vacated in part on other grounds by cir finding defendant acted egregiously where,breaching his fiduciary duties to his customers pursuant to the agreement,he caused his customers accounts at hutton to have a negative net worth of million by november,just after the collapse of the scheme.further,his current position as president of a company does not put him in a position where future violations are likely.sec shapiro,cir affirming grant of injunction where defendant regular business as a corporate marriage broker will likely expose him to many temptations in the future.we therefore affirm the denial of an injunction against shepard.
with respect to sargent,there was also no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in denying an injunction.sargent violation was isolated and unsophisticated he simply put two and two together and,based on a casual conversation,invested in one company without attempting to conceal his trades.sargent is unlikely to be privy to insider information either through his occupation as a dentist or because of his wife position as a consultant.further,sargent acceptance of the jury verdict without further appeal is sufficient acknowledgment of the wrongfulness of his conduct.the district court denial of an injunction against sargent is affirmed.
iv.prejudgment interest 
the sec argues that,although the lower court correctly held sargent and shepard jointly and severally liable for disgorgement,it erred in refusing to assess interest covering the prejudgment period.prejudgment interest,like disgorgement
