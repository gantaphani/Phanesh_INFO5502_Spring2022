ameritrade provides online securities price information and stock brokerage services.in addition to providing stock price information related to individual online trades,ameritrade offers its customers,for a twenty dollar monthly fee,its quote service.this service allows a paid subscriber to receive real time,last sales information for up to thirty five sic stock or option symbols at a time with the same one click of the mouse or hit of the enter button.class action petition.real time,last sales information describes the delivery to ameritrade subscribers of a composite of the most recent price paid for a stock or option.
mitchell green subscribed to ameritrade quote service in february.in march,green sued ameritrade in the douglas county,nebraska,district court.green sought to bring the suit as a class action on behalf of a ll persons classified as nonprofessional subscribers who have paid per month for real time last sales information with defendants ameritrade,and ameritrade holding to obtain last sales information or real time market quotes for stocks or options.class action petition green alleged in his complaint that ameritrade did not provide its real time quote subscribers with actual real time,last sales information with respect to option quotes.class action petition.green asserted that the actual quotes provided lagged up to hours behind the actual last sale of a particular option on any and all exchanges.id.he further alleged that ameritrade led subscribers to believe that the option quotes were obtained from all option exchanges and market makers,though in fact they were not so obtained.finally,and significantly,green complaint alleged that quote service subscribers are making investment decisions to purchase or sell options based upon stale last sale information.id.upon these facts,green brought claims for breach of contract,fraud by intentional misrepresentation,fraud by negligent representation,deceptive trade practices,and violation of the nebraska consumer protection act.
ameritrade timely removed green suit to federal district court and moved to dismiss green complaint as preempted by slusa.in reply to ameritrade motion to dismiss,green moved to remand the action to state court.relying on green allegation that subscribers made investment decisions to purchase or sell options based upon stale last sale information,the district court concluded that green case deal t with the purchase or sale of securities and green complaint was therefore preempted by slusa.the district court denied,however,ameritrade motion to dismiss,and gave green thirty days to file an amended complaint.
green subsequently filed an amended complaint,purporting to state a single claim for breach of contract under nebraska law.the factual allegations of green amended complaint differed from his initial complaint in two significant ways.first,instead of alleging that ameritrade falsely represented that its quote service provided stock and option information from all stock exchanges and market makers,green alleged that ameritrade promised in the quote agreement that it would provide that information to subscribers,including green,but failed to do so.second,green removed all references to any investment decisions to purchase or sell made by subscribers in reliance on this allegedly faulty information.green amended complaint alleges only that ameritrade contract said it would provide a certain kind of price information,ameritrade did not in fact provide that information,and ameritrade therefore breached its subscriber agreement.
ameritrade moved to dismiss green amended complaint on the ground that it too is preempted by slusa.green responded and moved to remand the amended complaint to state court pursuant to c supp.iv for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court determined that the amended complaint did not allege that ameritrade misrepresented or omitted a material fact or used a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance.the court concluded that slusa therefore did not cover the substance of green suit.the court also concluded that even though green amended complaint dropped all federal claims,the remaining claim was still subject to the court supplemental jurisdiction if the court chose to invoke it.exercising its discretion,the court chose to remand the case to the state court.see c.
although the parties have not raised any question about our power to hear this appeal,we must in the first instance satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction to review the district court remand order.although as a general rule d prohibits appellate review of an order remanding a case to state court,in re atlas van lines,cir,there are exceptions.where,as here,the district court remand order is based on its authority under c,the prohibition of review on appeal found in d does not apply.see things remembered,petrarca,d o nly remands based on grounds specified in c are immune from review under d.the district court had federal question jurisdiction over the complaint removed from state court by ameritrade because it was.see caterpillar williams,d explaining basis for federal court jurisdiction where complete preemption exists.green amended complaint alleges a claim for breach of contract that was pleaded as part of the larger original complaint.after green amendment of his complaint,the district court still had supplemental jurisdiction over this claim and therefore appropriately considered whether to exercise its discretion to retain the claim in federal court under.see cohill,d john int l ass of machinists aero.workers,cir petkus chicago rawhide.we therefore are not barred by from reviewing the district court remand order,and we have jurisdiction to consider the merits of ameritrade appeal.john,at.
our review of the case law has revealed only one case in which this court has had the opportunity to examine slusa provisions,see in re bankamerica.sec,cir upholding injunction staying proceedings because injunction fell within exception to act,but our discussion in that case has no bearing on the issues raised in this appeal.we turn to a recent case from a federal district court in minnesota explaining,quite accurately,we believe,that congress designed slusa to close a perceived loophole in the pleading requirements of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,stat.
in recent years,congress passed two statutes designed to alleviate the problems corporations suffered as a result of class action lawsuits.the first of these,the pslra,was designed to curb abuse in securities suits,particularly shareholder derivative suits in which the only goal was a windfall of attorney fees,with no real desire to assist the corporation on whose behalf the suit was brought.the pslra immediately drove many plaintiffs to file their claims in state court,based on state law,in order to circumvent the strong requirements established by the statute.motivated by a purpose to keep such lawsuits in federal court,congress quickly passed slusa in order to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade the protections that federal law provides against abuse litigation by filing suit in state,rather than federal,courts.with some exceptions,slusa made the federal courts the exclusive fora for most class actions involving the purchase and sale of securities.primarily,slusa mandates that any class action based on an allegation that a covered security was sold or purchased through misrep
