this case concerns sufficiency of the pleadings in a securities fraud case.
the district court dismissed this case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,so we state the facts as they are stated in the complaint to determine whether the complaint states a claim upon which relief could be granted.in the context of securities litigation under the private securities litigation reform act we may also properly consider sec filings incorporated by reference in the complaint nothing has been proved in this case because it was dismissed before the occasion arose for any proof,so,as in any decision reviewing a b dismissal,our statement of facts should not be understood as a true description of anything that actually happened.
larkin and the other defendants were officers and directors of nellcor.it made medical devices for people with breathing difficulties.in may of,nellcor announced that it was making a very large acquisition,paying million for a company called puritan bennett.puritan bennett had been losing money and had just laid off a sixth of its personnel.this raised the obvious question of how nellcor could expect to make money by spending almost a half billion dollars to acquire a company that was losing money.but nellcor principals said they expected the combined company to make money because it would dominate the market for respiratory care products,would have much greater financial strength because of its size,and would have lower overhead than the combined overhead of the two companies operating separately.
the theory of the complaint is that the merger was a failure and that the nellcor principals knew that almost from the start.but they repeatedly lied to the market through stock analysts and press releases,misleading the stock market into overvaluing their stock based on a false impression that the merger was going well.meanwhile,the principals sold off their personal stock as the time approached for the truth to come out.they made a great deal of money from the people who were misled by their false statements,and when the bad news came out,the price of the stock dropped.
plaintiffs brought a class action suit on behalf of shareholders who purchased the stock of the combined company between the time nellcor filed an optimistic report about the merger and the time it announced that earnings would be well below expectations,driving the price of the stock down.the district judge concluded that the pleadings lacked adequate specificity and dismissed the complaint.he dismissed with prejudice,because the plaintiffs had already had an opportunity to amend the complaint to cure the defect.he did not reach the issue of class certification.plaintiffs appeal.
ii.analysis 
securities fraud class actions are not all good or all bad.in a large public securities market,dishonest insiders may be able to cover their tracks fairly well,and falsely claim to be as surprised as the ribbon clerks,when they take the market for a ride.unless reasonable inferences from circumstances suffice to get a case to a jury,the welfare of victimized investors and the integrity of the stock market may be insufficiently protected from deceptive manipulators.capital may be inefficiently diverted from honest to dishonest enterprises.but plaintiffs can also be undeserving,and lawsuits can extort a great deal of undeserved settlement money if the courts do not filter out the unfounded ones early enough to avoid huge litigation expenses.juries can make mistakes,especially in matters of great complexity where the trials are lengthy.if a defendant is entirely innocent of wrongdoing,yet faces a chance of a million dollar jury error,the rational course,if the case can not be kept from a jury,may be to pay million undeserved dollars.that just wastes capital and unfairly transfers money from those who have earned it to those who have not.securities fraud cases typically claim that optimistic statements were lies.but business decisions have to be based on predictions about the future that can only be taken as a result of animal spirits,and if the animal spirits are dimmed and the spontaneous optimism falters,leaving us to depend on nothing but a mathematical expectation,enterprise will fade and die.
a.the private securities litigation reform act.
there is but one issue raised in this appeal,whether the complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted this inquiry is governed by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,which altered our pleading requirements in private securities fraud litigation by requiring that a complaint plead with particularity both falsity and scienter pursuant to the pslra,a complaint must specify each statement alleged to have been misleading,the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading,and,if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief,the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.the complaint must also state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind that is,that he acted with intentionality or deliberate recklessness or,where the challenged act is a forward looking statement,with actual knowledge that the statement was false or misleading.
because falsity and scienter in private securities fraud cases are generally strongly inferred from the same set of facts,we have incorporated the dual pleading requirements of b and b into a single inquiry.in considering whether a private securities fraud complaint can survive dismissal under rule b,we must determine whether particular facts in the complaint,taken as a whole,raise a strong inference that defendants intentionally or deliberate recklessness made false or misleading statements to investors.where pleadings are not sufficiently particularized or where,taken as a whole,they do not raise a strong inference that misleading statements were knowingly or deliberate recklessness made to investors,a private securities fraud complaint is properly dismissed under rule b.
sufficiency of the allegations.
september and october.
on september,nellcor annual report to the shareholders said that growth opportunities will be significantly enhanced by the merger and that we expect earnings accretion in the first year and anticipate cost savings through consolidation of facilities and operations.on october,defendants larkin and downey,nellcor chief executive officer and chief financial officer,told securities analysts that 
international and homecare markets were driving nellcor growth.homecare revenues,which represent of nellcor business,were up in the quarter.
the consolidation of nellcor and puritan bennett sales and distribution efforts would be completed by the end of the second quarter and corporate staff consolidation by the end of the third quarter.
nellcor expected to reduce headcount by at least as merger synergies were effected.this would set the stage for leveraged earnings per share growth to and for fiscal year,respectively.
numerous other optimistic predictions about the merger were made to the public by defendants during this first couple of months the new company will be the leading provider,growth opportunities will be significantly enhanced,we expect higher earnings and cost savings.the merged company plan to cut about jobs by consolidating sales forces largely in the quarter then beginning was on track and would cut expenses.
the complaint alleges that these statements were false and misleading when issued,because the merger would hurt nellcor earnings and provide no revenue and cost benefits.it was not true that the sales force consolidation would be completed by the end of the quarter nor would earnings grow as much as predicted.but no facts are alleged in the complaint that would support an inference that the company more optimistic predictions were known to be false or misleading at that time by the people who made them.the complaint does not plead facts that show that company insiders knew what the complaint says would occur in what was then the future that a pessimistic argument could have been made against the merger,and that had they known in september what they learned by the following may they would not have spoken so optimistically,does not raise a strong inference that defendants actually knew their forward looking statements to investors were false or misleading when made 
in late december,defendants larkin and downey told analysts that nellcor sales growth was accelerating,that nellcor expected earnings per share growth of,with even higher growth in the near term,and that t he nellcor and puritan bennett administrative and marketing positions had already been rationalized.the complaint alleges that these statements were false when made,because sales growth was not accelerating,nellcor did not expect earnings to grow as predicted,and consolidation of the sales forces had encountered problems.
it is difficult to see how claimed knowledge of problems consolidating the sales forces is material.much of any business consists of having problems and dealing with them.anyone,insider or not,would expect to encounter problems if they planned to fire people from their jobs.there is nothing about the problems attendant upon firing people that suggests intentional or deliberately reckless falsity or deception in the statement that the company expected to make more money by doing so.
the statement that sales growth was accelerating,though,is specific,and the complaint states a reason why it is false that sales growth was not accelerating.the statement is material and descriptive of historical fact,rather than forward looking.the statement that growth is accelerating means that a graph of sales against time shows a concave line.prospective investors deciding whether a business is doing well look at whether sales revenue is flat,increasing,or declining,and if it is increasing or declining,whether the change appears to be accelerating or flattening out.sales that are not only growing,but growing faster and faster,matter to an investor.
plaintiffs,however,merely assert that the statement was false at the time it was made.they do not specify facts or evidence that show why the statement was false at the time it was made nor that defendants knew or with deliberate recklessness disregarded that it was false.the complaint fails to describe,chart or graph what sales actually did.nor does the complaint identify any documents or facts suggesting that the defendants knew that the growth rate was not accelerating.it is not sufficient simply to allege that a statement was false plaintiffs must state with particularity all facts upon which their belief that sales were not accelerating was based the complaint does not meet that statutory requirement.
january through march.
a consolidation issues.
on january,nellcor issued a press release.the press release stated a major achievement during the second quarter was the consolidation and restructuring of the company and international field sales organizations.the company now has in place a unified and very customer focused sales organization dedicated to meeting the needs of patients worldwide.also on january,defendants larkin and downey spoke with securities analysts and stated that t he consolidation of nellcor and puritan bennett sales and distribution efforts had been completed.then,on march,defendants larkin and debuono spoke with more securities analysts relaying that nellcor homecare organization was in place.
plaintiffs allege that the defendants misstated the historical facts of how and when the consolidation was completed.first,they claim that the defendants said that the consolidation of the sales and distribution units had been completed by the end of the second quarter,when,in fact,the units were not consolidated until the third quarter.to show that these statements were deliberately misleading when made,the plaintiffs rely on the defendants april statement that third quarter earnings were below expectations due to revenue shortfalls due to the termination of the company independent homecare distribution network and its transition to a newly integrated direct sales force.
this press statement does not,however,raise a strong inference that defendants intentionally or with deliberate recklessness misled investors.it says,a lthough sales levels across most of the home care business product lines were higher than the prior year,revenue growth rates for the third quarter were significantly impacted by the termination of the company independent home care distributor network at the end of the second quarter,and the transition to a newly integrated direct sales force.a practical translation,shorn of euphemism,would be we fired the salespeople we had planned to get rid of,but our sales growth is slowed because the remaining salespeople do yet have as much selling ability yet with some customers.plaintiffs seem to concede this point when they allege that the defendants statements were false because the two companies were not,in fact,successfully consolidated.honest optimism followed by disappointment is not the same as lying or misleading with deliberate recklessness.
plaintiffs allegations simply do not state a set of facts raising a strong inference that the statements were intentionally false,misleading or made with deliberate recklessness.to meet this pleading requirement,the complaint must contain allegations of specific contemporaneous statements or conditions that demonstrate the intentional or the deliberately reckless false or misleading nature of the statements when made the complaint does not meet this standard.
plaintiffs attempt to meet the specificity requirement by pleading that the consolidation of the sales forces and marketing operations had not gone well,significant problems persisted which were resulting in inefficiencies and cost excesses,and that the consolidation was plagued by continuing difficult problems resulting in cost inefficiencies,waste and lack of revenue growth.nowhere does plaintiffs complaint state what these significant or difficult problems were or how they show that the two companies were operating separately at a time when they were claimed to have been consolidated.nowhere does plaintiffs complaint state what kind of inefficiencies existed,identify an amount of cost excesses or lack of revenue growth,or state how these inefficiencies,cost excesses,and lack of revenue growth show that the companies were not consolidated.we can not discern what statements the complaint says were false or misleading nor the basis for concluding they were made intentionally or with deliberate recklessness.
plaintiffs argue that the defendants statement about third quarter earnings being less than expected due to the termination of the independent homecare distribution network and transition was a later statement by the defendant along the lines of i knew it all along.the statement arguably implies that the consolidation of marketing had not worked out as well and as rapidly as hoped.the statement does not support an inference that company insiders knew or with deliberate recklessness disregarded that the problems would be so substantial.
our decision in yourish supports this analysis.there,the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants statement that it knew it was not going to repeat some very heavy shipments to southeast asia was an admission that its earlier statements about the company strong international sales were false.we rejected this argument,because not repeating heavy shipments was not necessarily inconsistent with having strong international sales.
the complaint never alleges a statement by defendants that would indicate such heavy shipments as the million system launch order from ibc were expected to repeat in southeast asia.only such a specific statement could be contradicted by the october statement.without such a specific statement,the october statement does not approach the i knew it all along admission envisioned in glenfed 
here,the later statement admits only that the earnings in the third quarter were a result of the prior integration of the two companies sales forces,which concedes no intentional or deliberately reckless falsehood or deception at all.the s
