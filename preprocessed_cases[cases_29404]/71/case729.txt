plaintiffs in this putative class action,all of whom are investors in class b shares of morgan stanley mutual funds,appeal the district court order of dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in connection with their federal law claims against defendants,morgan stanley distributors,morgan stanley investment advisors,morgan stanley investment management,morgan stanley investments,morgan stanley dw,and morgan stanley.
specifically,plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of their claim that defendants violated federal securities law,including of the federal securities act of,b of the securities and exchange act of,and rule b of the securities and exchange commission sec regulations promulgated under the act,by failing to disclose information in their prospectuses regarding the relative value of class b shares in mutual funds offered by defendants their claim that defendants violated sec rule a and rule c,by selling class b shares in mutual funds,which plaintiffs allege assess unnecessary fees and their claim that defendants violated a and sec rule b by failing to disclose a broker compensation scheme which they allege works a conflict of interest.plaintiffs also appeal from the district court denial of their motion,filed after the entry of judgment in this case,for leave to file an amended complaint.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court in all respects.
background 
substantive.the facts set forth in the complaint 
this case is before us on an appeal from a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in reviewing such a dismissal,this court must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.inge rock fin,cir citing turker ohio dep t of rehab,cir.the facts alleged by plaintiffs in their second amended complaint are set forth below.
defendants operate over sixty mutual funds,the shares of which are marketed to investors.the morgan stanley funds are marketed as a family of mutual funds.investors are permitted to exchange shares in one morgan stanley fund for shares in another morgan stanley fund at no cost.most morgan stanley fund shares are marketed and sold to investors who have brokerage accounts with morgan stanley dw.
the majority of morgan stanley funds are offered in different share classes,designated as a,b,c,and other share classes.the share classes are for the same underlying portfolio of investments,but each class differs in its expense structure.
for class a shares in equity funds,morgan stanley typically charges a load,paid at the time of the initial investment.the load is for investments less than,decreases incrementally as the amount of the investment increases,and is eliminated altogether for investments of at least one million dollars.class a shareholders are charged an annual distribution fee of.
class b shares,which are at the center of the dispute in this case,are offered with no initial sales charge,but are subject to a load,or contingent deferred sales charge cdsc,ranging from five percent in the first year the shares are held to one percent in the sixth year.there is no cdsc for class b shares held for more than six years.class c shares are also offered with no initial sales charge,but are subject to a cdsc of one percent if sold within a year of purchase.class c shares never convert to class a shares.according to plaintiffs,morgan stanley claims to normally charge class b and c shareholders an annual distribution fee of one percent,but in practice many morgan stanley funds charge slightly lower annual fees for class c shares than for class b shares.
plaintiffs allege that class b shares are inferior to class a c shares for any type of investment strategy,whatever the amount of the investment or intended holding period.we emphasize here that plaintiffs are not asserting that class b shares are always inferior to both class a or class c shares,but rather that class b shares are always inferior to at least one of either class a or class c shares.in other words,plaintiffs contend that b shares are never the best option,but not that they are always the worst.plaintiffs further allege that defendants promote class b shares even though they know that class b investors will pay more fees and earn less profits than if they had chosen,depending on their circumstances,either class a or class c shares,and that defendants knowingly fail to inform investors of this fact.
plaintiffs also allege that morgan stanley earns more money per dollar invested in class b shares than in other class shares,and that its broker compensation structure creates more attractive incentives for the sale of class b shares and for the sale of mutual funds generally,but that this information is not disclosed to investors.
additionally,the complaint alleges facts related to the individual claims of each of the eight named plaintiffs.because those individual claims are not before us,we will not engage in an extensive discussion of those allegations.it will suffice to note that all of the plaintiffs assert that morgan stanley financial advisors inappropriately invested their money in class b shares,without explaining the differences between the share classes or explaining that class b shares involved unnecessary fees,and that they sustained significant losses as a consequence.
a note on the prospectus 
in addition to the facts set forth in the complaint,the district court considered the prospectus at issue in this case ordinarily,when a district court considers evidence outside the pleadings,a b motion will be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule.fed.civ.b.however,a written instrument attached as an exhibit to a pleading is considered a part of the pleading,and thus does not fall under the rule.see fed.civ.c.the district court and the parties apparently assumed that the prospectuses attached to the motion to dismiss constitute written instruments,as they all agreed that the prospectuses should be considered,and yet did not suggest that the b motion was thus converted into a summary judgment motion.we will also consider the prospectuses in our review,as neither party objects and they are obviously central to plaintiffs claims that the prospectuses include material omissions and misrepresentations.see meyer pincus assocs.oppenheimer,cir court examine s prospectus together with the allegations contained on the face of the complaint where claims within the complaint are based only on an alleged written misrepresentation appearing within the prospectus.
many facts disclosed in the prospectus are set forth in the complaint and therefore have already been discussed.we note that defendants point out in their brief on appeal that,in addition to the facts included in the complaint,the prospectus states that investors in b shares,but not a shares,may make annual withdrawals of up to twelve percent of their investment in b shares without paying a cdsc.the prospectus also states that b shares,unlike c shares,automatically convert to a shares after ten years.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed their first complaint in this case in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee on february,asserting class action claims under the federal securities laws on behalf of the named plaintiffs and all others who purchased class b shares of morgan stanley mutual funds between february,and the present.specifically,the complaint alleged that defendants violated a of the federal securities act of fsa,a,by failing to disclose material facts necessary to make statements made in connection with the sale of securities not misleading defendants violated of the fsa by omitting material facts in the registration statements of morgan stanley mutual funds necessary to make the statements therein not misleading defendants intentionally recklessly employed devices,schemes,and artifices to defraud in violation of b of the securities and exchange act of,and rule a of the sec regulations promulgated under that act defendants intentionally recklessly omitted to state material facts necessary to make statements made to plaintiffs not misleading,in violation of b of the securities and exchange act of,and rule b of the sec regulations promulgated under that act and defendants intentionally recklessly engaged in acts,practices,and a course of business which operated as a fraud or deceit on plaintiffs,in violation of b of the securities and exchange act of,and rule c of the sec regulations promulgated under that act.in addition to their class claims,plaintiffs also asserted individual state claims,including violations of ohio,tennessee,and north carolina securities laws and common law fraud claims.again,the district court dismissal of the individual claims is not on appeal to this court.
on march,plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint,adding two new plaintiffs.defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint and to compel arbitration of plaintiffs individual claims on september.on october,plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss,and,the following day,a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.that motion was granted by the magistrate judge,and the second amended complaint was filed on october.the second amended complaint included expanded factual allegations regarding plaintiffs claim that defendants failed to disclose that its broker compensation structure creates more attractive incentives for the sale of class b shares and for the sale of morgan stanley mutual funds relative to mutual funds sold by companies unaffiliated with morgan stanley,thus creating a financial conflict of interest for morgan stanley brokers.
oral argument on defendants motion to dismiss was heard on december.on january,the district court granted defendant motion to dismiss plaintiffs federal claims under rule b.having done so,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs state law claims,and dismissed them without prejudice,pursuant to c.
on january,plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,and for leave to amend their claims against morgan stanley dw,in order to assert claims under sec rule on behalf of all who purchased morgan stanley class b mutual fund shares during the class period whose purchase was solicited by a morgan stanley broker.on february,the district court denied plaintiffs motion to alter or amend the judgment,for the reasons stated in its memorandum of january,and denied as untimely and moot plaintiffs motion for leave to file an amended complaint.
on february,plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to this court from the district court order dismissing the action and from the district court order denying plaintiffs motion to alter or amend judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint.

plaintiffs claim of disclosure violations regarding the relative value of b shares 
regulations and statutes cited by plaintiffs 
class claims one and four of plaintiffs second amended complaint relate to the issue of whether defendants violated federal securities law by failing to disclose information in their prospectuses regarding the relative value of class b shares in mutual funds offered by defendants 
count one alleges that under of the federal securities act of,defendants had a duty to disclose,but did not disclose,material information concerning the superiority of class a class c shares,as compared to class b shares.second amended complaint,at.section imposes liability on any person who 
offers or sells a security by the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails,by means of a prospectus or oral communication,which includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements,in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading the purchaser not knowing of such untruth or omission,and who shall not sustain the burden of proof that he did not know,and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known,of such untruth or omission.
in count four,plaintiffs allege that defendants intentionally recklessly omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements to plaintiffs not misleading,in violation of b of the securities and exchange act of,and rule b of the sec regulations promulgated under that act.second amended complaint,at.plaintiffs argument before this court centers on their claim that defendants violated rule b,which makes it 
unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly,by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange 
b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,in light of the circumstances under which they were made,not misleading.
plaintiffs argument 
plaintiffs argument is essentially that reasonable jurors could conclude that statements in defendants prospectuses are misleading,and that under of the securities act of and sec rule b,defendants consequently have a duty to make further disclosures in order to make the statements in the prospectus not misleading.plaintiffs argue that they are entitled to relief because defendants did not comply with this duty.
plaintiff cites from defendants prospectus,which includes the following statements which plaintiffs find objectionable 
each class has a different combination of fees,expenses,and other features,which should be considered in selecting a class of shares.pl.brief at at.
because every investor has different immediate financial needs and investment goals,the fund offers investors four classes of shares each class of shares offers a distinct structure of sales charges,distribution and service fees,and other features that are designed to address a variety of needs.pl.brief at at.
in deciding which class of fund shares to purchase,investors should consider the following factors,as well as any other relevant facts and circumstances the decision as to which class of shares is more beneficial to an investor depends on the amount and intended length of his or her investment.investors who prefer an initial sales charge alternative may elect to purchase a shares.investors qualifying for significantly reduced,or,in the case of purchases of million or more,no initial sales charges may find class a shares particularly attractive because similar sales charge reductions are not available with respect to class b or class c shares.moreover,class a shares are subject to lower ongoing expenses than are class b or class c shares over the term of the investment.as an alternative,class b and class c shares are sold without any initial sales charge so the entire purchase price is immediately invested in the fund.any investment return on these additional investment amounts may partially or wholly offset the higher annual expenses of these classes.pl.brief at,at emphasis added 
the fund will generally not accept a purchase order for class b shares in the amount of or more.pl.brief at,at.
plaintiffs argue that these statements are misleading because they suggest to investors that defendants have carefully created its four share classes to meet different investment objectives and that each class is a legitimate,rational choice that may be best for certain types of investment strategies.this proposition is simply not accurate with respect to class pl.brief at.plaintiffs contend that defendants mislead investors into believing that it may be a rational strategy to invest amounts up to in b shares,when it is a mathematical fact that class a shares will yield higher net returns on investments over than class b shares.
according to plaintiffs,defendants misleading discussion gave rise to an obligation to disclose certain specific facts about the holding periods and investment amounts with respect to which different share classes will perform best.pl.brief at.plaintiffs suggest that the prospectuses should have disclosed,with respect to investments of less than,that class c shares would produce a greater net return for holding periods of less than six years,that shares in classes b and c would produce equal returns for periods of six to eight years,and that there is a great likelihood that class a shares would produce a greater net return than shares in either b or with respect to investments of more than,plaintiffs contend that the prospectuses should have disclosed there was a great likelihood that class a shares would produce a higher net return than class b shares,regardless of the holding period,and that for holding periods of more than ten years,class a shares would produce a net return thousands of dollars greater than a comparable investment in b shares.pl.brief at.
disclosures contained in the prospectus 
defendants repeatedly and inaccurately claim that it is undisputed that their prospectuses contain a completely accurate disclosure of all of the information required in form.def.brief at.form is promulgated by the sec and sets forth detailed requirements for information to be included in a prospectus.plaintiffs do argue that defendants failed to comply with form,contending that defendants failed to meet requirements of a balanced disclosure of positive and negative factors,and a clear explanation of the features of different share classes.we disagree with plaintiffs,and conclude that defendants satisfied those requirements.
the prospectus does clearly comply with form requirement of a fee table,which sets forth the maximum sales charge,the maximum cdsc,and all annual fees for the different share classes.additionally,as required,the prospectus includes an example setting forth the costs of investing in the fund in various share classes,for one,three,and five years.the prospectus explains that while class b and class c shares do not have any sales charges,their higher ongoing annual expenses due to higher fees mean that over time you could end up paying more for these shares than if you were to pay sales charges for class a shares.
indeed,as defendants point out,all of the information that plaintiffs needed in order to support their claim that class b shares are never the best option for an investor is available in the prospectus 
alleged omissions were not material 
in order to be actionable,a misrepresentation or omission must pertain to material information that the defendant had a duty to disclose.city of monroe bridgestone,et,cir citing basic levinson,d in re burlington coat factory sec,cir.the district court correctly determined that federal securities law does not require defendants to make statements of the type suggested by plaintiffs regarding the relative merits of different class shares.
all of the information from which plaintiffs claims regarding defendants failure to make statements regarding the relative merits of different class shares are drawn is available in defendants prospectuses.plaintiffs argue that this information was not presented clearly enough to satisfy the requirements of form.having reviewed the prospectuses,we reject that contention.the information needed to compare the relative merits of the three class shares is presented in tables and straightforward narratives describing those tables.although,in reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss,we must accept facts as true,we need not accept as true unwarranted factual inferences.morgan church fried chicken,cir.
given that all of the information necessary to compare the different class shares was in the prospectuses,the alleged omissions in this case are not material.materiality depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on the withheld information.helwig vencor,cir en banc.while statements of the type proposed by plaintiffs might have facilitated an investor task in comparing the share classes the critical question is whether they would have significantly altered the total mix of information made available.id.at quoting basic,at.given that the disclosures plaintiffs propose are merely interpretations drawn from the facts presented in the prospectuses,and do not actually provide new information,they would not have significantly altered the total mix of the information already presented in the prospectuses.
a note on defendants merits regulation argument 
defendants argue that plaintiffs inappropriately seek a ruling that class b shares are disadvantageous compared to class a and class c and that,irrespective of the accuracy of disclosure of all objective facts about their salient characteristics,it is fraud to offer them to the public,and that the securities laws are not designed for such merits regulation.def.brief at.
we agree that plaintiffs argument that defendants failed to make required disclosures regarding the relative merits of different share classes represents an attempt to shoehorn plaintiffs real quarrel,which is that defendants offered these class b shares at all,into a disclosure violations argument.plaintiffs disclosure claim is,effectively,that defendants should have informed investors that class b shares were less valuable than other class shares such a disclosure requirement would presumably have the effect of ending sales of class b shares.for the reasons just discussed,plaintiffs argument is unavailing under of the federal securities act and sec rule b.whether plaintiffs can make what is essentially the same claim under rule a or c is the subject of the next part of this opinion.
plaintiffs claims under sec rule a and c.
the district court failure to consider plaintiffs claims under sec rule a and c 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by failing to address plaintiffs claims under sec rule a and c,and that they are entitled to relief under those subsections of rule,which provide 
it shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud 
c to engage in any act,practice,or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
we must first determine whether the district court considered a and c.plaintiffs argument is that the district court opinion only dealt with whether defendants complied with their disclosure obligations and that rules a and c do not require the making of a material misstatement or omission,do not require a showing of a disclosure violation.
defendants counter that the securities laws are about disclosure,such that the district court determination that defendants were not required to make additional disclosures with respect to the relative value of the different class shares,though addressed only to plaintiff b claim,actually disposes of all claims.this argument finds some support in the case law.see,affiliated ute citizens united states,et,d the act
