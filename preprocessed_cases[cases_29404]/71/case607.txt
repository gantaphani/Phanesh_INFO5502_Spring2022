in this appeal,we address the requirement that the plaintiffs prove a pattern of racketeering activity under the rico statute.plaintiffs ge investment private placement partners ii ge investment and ardhouse,llc,sued defendants for violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c and d,violation of the federal securities laws,and several state law claims for fraud,negligent representation,and unfair business practices.defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,which the district court subsequently adopted.the district court dismissed plaintiffs rico claims for failure to allege a pattern of racketeering activity,dismissed the federal securities claim,and denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.the district court dismissed without prejudice the pendent state law claims.
plaintiffs appeal only the dismissal of their rico claims.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
because the complaint was dismissed pursuant to rule b,we assume the facts alleged in the complaint are true.mylan,matkari,cir.plaintiffs allege as follows 
defendant ted parker parker founded and was the ceo and sole shareholder of ted parker home sales tphs,a retail manufactured housing company that operated in north carolina,south carolina,and mississippi.the remaining defendants all held various positions within tphs.plaintiffs ardhouse and ge investment were investors in tphs.
defendants engaged in a variety of fraudulent practices that allowed parker to siphon off cash from the company and inflate tphs value.tphs purchased its mobile homes directly from manufacturers,and each purchase was fully financed by a floor plan lender.the floor plan lender remitted the full invoice price directly to the manufacturer in exchange for a security interest in the home,periodic interest payments,and a promise by tphs to repay the purchase price when the house was sold.tphs,however,had secret arrangements with the manufacturers whereby the manufacturers gave tphs cash rebates and kickbacks but did not lower their invoice prices to cover the rebates.because it obtained financing through floor plan lenders,tphs did not need to have cash up front to purchase new homes.because the manufacturers gave tphs the cash rebates immediately,tphs thus was able to increase its cash on hand by purchasing inventory.tphs recorded the rebates and kickbacks as income upon receipt,but did not offset its liability to the floor plan lenders,thereby creating a false impression of profitability.parker also siphoned off cash from tphs through affiliated businesses and through.
to keep sales going,tphs instructed its sales personnel to engage in the practice of short down payments.according to this practice,tphs would issue checks to customers for worthless homes.the customers would cash the checks from tphs and use the cash to obtain a bank check.the customers then would give the bank check to tphs as a phony cash down payment,which would allow the customer to qualify for a mortgage.ultimately,however,sales could not keep pace with the purchase of homes from the manufacturers,and the company would not be able to sustain itself under the burden of massive loans by floor plan lenders.
in spring of,parker decided to sell a majority of his investment in tphs and hired geneva corporate finance,geneva to find potential buyers.defendants provided geneva with false financial information to include in an offering memorandum,which geneva circulated on parker behalf.ardshiel,an investment firm that locates investments for plaintiffs,received a copy of the memorandum in april.in reliance on the memorandum and its false information,ardshiel concluded that tphs was a promising investment and began negotiating for the acquisition of an interest in tphs by plaintiffs.
during the negotiations,defendants provided false information concerning tphs average and projected sales.defendants successfully concealed their fraudulent revenue recognition practices and the nature of the inflated rebates received by tphs from home manufacturers.on december,plaintiffs executed agreements whereby they acquired ownership of a substantial interest in tphs.through a series of holding companies,plaintiffs acquired of the common stock of tphs and a million note.in return,parker,through a holding company,received million in cash plus notes with a potential value of million,million in preferred stock,and million in tphs assets.tphs itself received million in cash.some of the defendants received new employment contracts that included stock options in tphs.after the closing,tphs paid defendants substantial bonuses.
after the closing,defendants remained involved in tphs operations and continued to conceal tphs declining financial condition.as a result,in summer,plaintiffs loaned to tphs and related companies to help tphs through what plaintiffs believed were temporary liquidity problems.defendants hoped to conceal their fraud long enough to conduct an initial public offering.tphs and the holding companies were unable to stay afloat,however,and filed for bankruptcy protection in june and july of.in september,tphs liquidated most of its assets for million and the assumption of various liabilities.
on november,ge investment and ardhouse filed the instant suit against defendants in federal district court they filed their first amended complaint on december.on august,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss under rule b and denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint.
ii.standards of review 
this court reviews the dismissal of claims pursuant to rule b de novo.mylan,at.on a rule b motion to dismiss,a court must accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and must view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.id.the court should not affirm a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief unless it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.northwestern bell,d quoting hishon king spalding,d.
we review the district court denial of leave to amend the complaint for an abuse of discretion.hcmf allen,cir.leave to amend may properly be denied where amendment would be futile.id.at.
iii.discussion 
the rico statute creates civil liability for those who engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.the statute defines racketeering activity to include,among other acts,acts of mail and wire fraud.the district court struck several of plaintiffs allegations of predicate acts of mail and wire fraud for failure to satisfy the specificity requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court then denied plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint on the ground that amendment would be futile.we do not reach plaintiffs challenge to the district court rule b determinations because,as we explain below,even when all the allegations in plaintiffs complaint are considered,they nonetheless fail to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.thus,amendment to cure the rule b deficiencies,if any,would be futile,and we need not reach the issue.
the district court also struck plaintiffs allegations of fraud against the floor plan and consumer lenders because plaintiffs did not rely to their detriment on defendants misrepresentations to the lenders.in chisolm transouth financial,cir,we held that where a rico plaintiff alleges predicate acts of mail and wire fraud as a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury,the plaintiff also must have justifiably relied to his detriment on the defendant material misrepresentation.id.at.plaintiffs do not allege such reliance.yet although plaintiffs could not recover based solely on predicate acts of fraud directed at the lenders,it does not follow that plaintiffs are barred from using such allegations of fraud to establish a pattern of racketeering activity.where,as here,the plaintiffs allege acts of fraud for which they satisfy chisolm reliance requirement,the plaintiffs properly may allege acts of related fraud against other victims to e
