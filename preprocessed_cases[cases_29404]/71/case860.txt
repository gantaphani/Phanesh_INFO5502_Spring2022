plaintiff commodity trend service,now known as cts financial publishing,cts,appeals the determination that it is subject to the antifraud provisions of the commodity exchange act cea.the principals of cts,dennis blitz and nick van nice,appeal the enforcement of an administrative subpoena issued by the commodity futures trading commission cftc.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm both of the district court decisions.
background 
cts provides impersonal advice about the commodities markets to its customers through a number of publications and other means,such as faxes and telephone messages.cts does not tailor its advice based on the particular circumstances or financial goals of its customers,nor does it execute any trades on their behalf.in additions to these products,cts distributes advertisements that both provide information regarding its wares and testimonials about the profits that can be generated by following cts recommendations.in july,the cftc began investigating cts to determine whether the business should be required to register as a commodity trading advisor cta under.the cftc sought to subpoena a wide range of documents from nice and blitz regarding cts advertisements,publications,and other products.cts filed a complaint claiming on first amendment grounds that the cea registration requirements were both overbroad and could not be applied to cts.the district court held that cts claims were unripe,but we reversed in the first decision regarding this case.see commodity trend service cftc,cir.
on remand,cts continued its facial and first amendment challenges to the registration requirements and added new arguments attacking and,which are antifraud provisions of the cea,as well as,which is an antifraud regulation promulgated by the cftc that applies to advertising.after considering cts arguments,the district court found that the registration requirements of the cea as applied to an impersonal advisor such as cts are a prior restraint that violates the constitution.however,the court also held that and regulation apply to cts,rejecting cts statutory and constitutional arguments the court did not reach the question of whether covers cts.on the basis of its decision,the district court granted the cftc motion to enforce its administrative subpoenas to the extent that the cftc was seeking to investigate cts regarding activities prohibited by the cea antifraud laws.the court denied cts motion to stay the enforcement of the subpoenas pending this appeal,and cts was required to turn over various products and documents to the cftc.
cts appeals the district court decision that it is subject to the cea antifraud provisions,and nice and blitz appeal the subpoena enforcement based on that decision cts does not challenge the determination that it falls within the definition of a cta.shortly before oral argument in this case,the cftc,in part because of the materials discovered through its subpoenas,issued a complaint against cts,initiating an administrative enforcement proceeding.cts filed a motion to enjoin these proceedings until this court decided the instant case.cts request for an injunction is rendered moot by this decision.
ii.discussion 
this case presents three stages of analysis.initially,we must determine whether cts challenges are ripe for resolution by the courts.if this case is ripe,then we must consider if two provisions of the cea and one cftc regulation apply to cts as a matter of statutory interpretation.finally,if cts is covered by any of these statutes or regulations,we must determine whether these laws are constitutional as applied to cts.
the cftc argues that neither cts statutory and first amendment challenges nor its identical claims in the subpoena enforcement proceeding are ripe for judicial decision.analyzing each case under the applicable legal standards,we reject the cftc contentions and find that both cases are susceptible of judicial resolution with the exception of one constitutional issue discussed below.
cts complaint.
the legal standards for determining when an constitutional challenge is ripe are set forth in commodity trend service,at,and need not be reiterated at length here.an administrative determination is ripe for review if it is fit for judicial resolution,and the parties would endure hardship from the withholding of court consideration.see ohio forestry ass sierra club,d citing abbott labs.gardner,d.cts is still suffering from the same hardships of curbing the content of its publications,being chilled from engaging in speech,and undergoing costly compliance with the cftc investigation that we previously found sufficient to satisfy the hardship prong of the abbott laboratories test.at.thus,the second part of the ripeness test is satisfied.
the cftc focuses its challenge on the first part of the ripeness determination.the cftc claims that this case presented a purely legal question the first time because cts admitted that it was covered by the registration requirements of,and so no facts were in dispute.by contrast,in the current stage of this litigation,cts does not admit that it is committing fraud punishable under the relevant provisions of the cea.the cftc argues that further factual development through administrative procedures in order to determine whether cts is committing fraud is necessary before a court should intervene.
the cftc argument is foreclosed by this court prior decision,where we held that a case is ripe under abbott laboratories when babbitt united farm workers union,d is satisfied.at.in babbitt,the plaintiffs challenged a statute that made dishonest,untruthful,and deceptive publicity an unfair labor practice when used to discourage consumers from purchasing agricultural products.at.the plaintiffs alleged that they did not deliberately intend to publicize falsely,but that erroneous statements are inevitable in the course of public speaking.these innocent falsehoods could subject the plaintiffs to prosecution under the statute,which could be avoided only by the plaintiffs curtailing the exercise of their first amendment rights.the supreme court stated that these circumstances were sufficient for the plaintiffs to have a reasonable fear of prosecution and that no further factual development was necessary.the court thus held that the challenge in babbitt was ripe.id.at.
cts position is identical in all relevant respects to the babbitt plaintiffs.cts alleges that it does not intend to make false statements about the commodities markets,but given the volume of its publications some misstatements are inevitable.such falsehoods would subject them to administrative investigation and proceedings by the cftc.because cts had a reasonable fear of being subject to administrative proceedings at the time cts filed its complaint,given cftc investigation and subpoenas,no further factual development is necessary.we hold that the purely legal question presented by cts,is an impersonal trading advisor subject to the fraud provisions of the with these facts showing a reasonable fear of prosecution satisfy the first part of the abbott laboratories test.thus,cts complaint is ripe.
subpoena enforcement proceedings.
a court exercises only limited review of an agency actions in a subpoena enforcement proceeding and does not normally consider the merits of a party claim that it has not violated a statute administered by the agency.as a general rule,courts enforce an administrative subpoena if it reasonably relates to an investigation within the agency authority,the specific inquiry is relevant to that purpose and is not too indefinite,the proper administrative procedures have been followed,and the subpoena does not demand information for an illegitimate purpose.see cftc tokheim,cir eeoc,cir.an agency may investigate to determine whether it has jurisdiction over a party as long as the party conduct superficially appears to bring it within the jurisdiction of the agency,that is,as long as the agency is not engaged in impermissible overreaching.see tokheim,at.however,this general rule of limited judicial scrutiny of administrative subpoenas is subject to certain exceptions.in particular,judicial review to determine whether a party has violated the statute or regulations is appropriate at the subpoena enforcement stage if the investigation is excessively burdensome so as to threaten the normal operation of the party business.see id.at,at.
we hold that the cftc subpoenas satisfy the test,but that the excessive burden exception applies.a gives the cftc the power to investigate persons that are covered by the cea cts does not contest that it is a cta and so subject to the cea.the subpoenas are reasonably definite in requesting materials from cts that are relevant to investigating whether the cea antifraud provisions have been violated.there is no allegation that the cftc has not followed the proper procedures or is acting in bad faith.however,the issuance of the subpoenas has altered the normal operations of cts business,as related in this court first opinion,and their enforcement would and did exacerbate these effects.at.cts has diluted its current publications,and has decided to abandon plans to expand its business to produce additional products.between and,cts sales decreased by more than percent,a drop that cts attributes to the cftc investigation and subpoenas.cts has been forced to phase out three of its employee positions in response to its declining revenues.in addition,two of cts columnists have refused to write articles for fear of government reprisal.such facts demonstrate that the subpoenas have changed the normal operations of cts business,and thus the merits of cts legal challenge can be considered at the enforcement subpoena stage 
statutory interpretation 
having found that cts challenges are ripe,we address its statutory arguments.cts claims that the antifraud provisions of the cea do not apply to impersonal commodity advisors as a matter of interpretation.the cftc construction of the cea is entitled to chevron deference.see cftc schor,d indosuez carr futures,cftc,cir geldermann,cftc,cir.under chevron,we first determine whether congress has addressed the question at issue.see fda brown williamson tobacco,d.if not,then we defer to the cftc construction of the cea as long as it is reasonable.id.
states in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for a commodity trading advisor by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,directly or indirectly 
a to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client or 
b to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client 
the relevant part of a contains nearly identical language and prohibits ctas from advertising in a manner that violates.both the statute and the regulation speak of defrauding clients.cts argues that the plain meaning of client is one who receives personalized advice within a fiduciary relationship or one on whose behalf a broker executes trades.because cts provides only impersonal advice and is not a broker,cts claims that holding it liable under or regulation would be contrary to the intent of congress.under the first step of chevron,we must determine whether the word client as used in the statute is ambiguous cts provides a number of reasons as to why client unambiguously refers to only brokers or those who provide personalized advice,but none of these is convincing.
cts first argues that the supreme court has held that client is limited to personalized relationships or to brokers in a similar statute.lowe sec,d held that impersonal advisors are exempt from regulation under the investment advisers act iaa.the court stated that two factors were significant in reaching its conclusion that the iaa applies only to those who provide personalized advice attuned to a client concerns.id.at.first,the court noted that the iaa repeatedly refers to clients,not subscribers.id.at.see also id.at.second,the sec did not establish that lowe and the other petitioners had authority over the funds of subscribers,been delegated decisionmaking authority to handle subscribers portfolios or accounts,or individualized,interactions with their subscribers.id.at.also,the court concluded by stating that lowe and his corporations were presumptively not within the iaa as long as the communications between petitioners and their subscribers remain entirely impersonal and do not develop into the kind of fiduciary,relationships that are characteristic of investment relationships.id.at.
however,at least two reasons exist for deciding that the word client in the cea is not limited to personalized relationships or brokers.first,the cea has a broader scope than the iaa.in lowe,the supreme court held that impersonal advisors are excluded from the key definition of investment adviser ia in the iaa because they fit within the exception for publishers.a d at.while some persons are excluded from the definition of an ia only if their advice concerning securities is solely incidental to their other activities,the exceptions for publishers is not so limited.a.thus,bona fide publishers are not ias even if their entire business concerns giving impersonal securities trading advice.moreover,because impersonal advisors are excluded from the definition of ias,they are wholly exempt from the iaa because the antifraud and other provisions of that act apply only to ias.
by contrast,the cea exempts publishers from the definition of cta only if their giving of advice concerning the commodities markets is solely incidental to their publishing business.impersonal publishers such as cts,whose commodities advising is conceded to be more than solely incidental to its publishing activities,are included within the definition of cta,even though an analogous publisher would be excluded from the definition of ia.because cts is a cta,all of the provisions of the cea regarding ctas,including and regulation,are applicable to cts.if the antifraud provisions did not apply to cts because the use of the word client limited these provisions to only personalized relationships,then cts would be subject to the cea because of its status as a cta,but almost none of the cea provisions would apply to it the significance of the one part of the statute that appears to draw a distinction between subscribers and clients is addressed below.this anomalous result casts doubt on cts claim that client refers only to those with whom an advisor has a personalized relationship or for whom a person serves as a broker.
second,in the cea section that announces congressional findings,congress states that ctas advice,counsel,publications,writings,analyses,and reports and their contracts,solicitations,subscriptions,agreements,and other arrangements with clients are affected with a national public interest.the breadth of the language used in this statement indicates that congress intended to include impersonal advisors within the definition of cta and intended to subject such advisors to the antifraud provisions of the cea.in particular,this section shows that subscriptions are a kind of arrangement with clients,indicating that even those who merely subscribe to impersonal publications are clients of a cta.admittedly,this section does not explicitly state that clients includes those who receive impersonal advice,but its broad language brings the opposite assertion into question.
cts second claim is that the definition of client in everyday language includes only those with whom one has a personalized or fiduciary relationship.the cea does not define client,so we assume that congress intended the word to have its ordinary meaning.see,williams taylor,d.the primary definition of client in modern dictionaries is a person who receives services or advice from a professional such as an attorney,indicating personalized advice.however,dictionaries also include customer,which is one who simply purchases a product without any personalization,as a definition of client.see encarta world english dictionary customer a person or organization to whom goods or services are provided and sold the american heritage dictionary.ed a customer or patron clients of the hotel the oxford english dictionary.ed a customer the random house dictionary.ed a customer webster third new international dictionary patron,customer all capitalization and italics in originals.the existence of alternative dictionary definitions of a word,each making some sense under the statute,itself indicates that the statute is open to interpretation and the word is ambiguous as between the two meanings.national passenger boston maine,d see also mci telecommunications v.at t,d.
the use of both client and subscriber in one provision of the cea,a,and in some of the cftc regulations,a,c,forms the basis of cts third contention.cts claims that subscriber covers customers who receive only impersonal advice while client means customers who receive personal advice.if client includes those who receive impersonal advice,then subscriber will be rendered mere surplusage in contravention of the interpretive canon that all words in a statute should,if possible,be given effect.see dunn cftc,d bailey united states,d.however,the surrounding context of the statute can overcome the presumption of a canon.see,dewsnup timm,d.as described above,indicates that subscriptions are a type of arrangement with clients for the purposes of the cea and so subscribers are a type of client.thus,the statutory text implies that the word subscriber is subsumed by the word client,which is sufficient to rebut the canon that each word or phrase in a statute should be given independent meaning.therefore,the presumption against treating statutory terms as surplusage does not aid cts.
cts fourth argument is that interpreting client to include impersonal advisors would lead to absurd results because the cftc has interpreted the cea antifraud provisions to impose fiduciary duties.cts posits examples such as parties on opposite sides of a commodities transaction each relying on cts products,in which case cts would have violated its duty of loyalty to both parties.the cftc agrees that the cea imposes fiduciary obligations,but claims that the content of these duties varies depending on the type of cta.
however,the cea does not impose fiduciary duties on impersonal advisors.the leading authority for the proposition that the cea imposes fiduciary obligations on all ctas is savage cftc,cir.however,savage can not be read so broadly the party in that case offered personalized advice,id.at,and so would be considered a fiduciary under the common law.nothing in indicates an intent on the part of congress to impose fiduciary duties on impersonal advisors.section a of the securities act of,a,which contains language similar to,does not impose fiduciary duties.see trussell united underwriters,see also sec maio,cir holding that a breach of a fiduciary duty connected with trading on material nonpublic information is necessary for a violation a,indicating that a does not impose any independent fiduciary duties by its own language.similarly,of the iaa,does not impose any new fiduciary duties,but only enforces already existing duties between clients and ias.as the supreme court held in lowe,the definition of ias is limited to personalized advisors who have fiduciary relationships with their clients as a matter of common law.see sec capital gains research bureau,d congress recognized the investment adviser to be a fiduciary.id.at.the statute,in recognition of the adviser fiduciary relationship to his clients,requires that his advice be disinterested.emphasis added.an analogous interpretation applies to the cea,which effectuates the extant fiduciary duties of personalized advisors and other agents but does not impose fiduciary obligation on impersonal advisors.see generally hlavinka cftc,cir stating that a commodities advisor is not a fiduciary for purposes of the cea where the customer makes his own independent trading decisions cftc heritage capital advisory,cir rejecting breach of fiduciary duty claim under the cea because only brokers who operate discretionary accounts are fiduciaries.section does not permit the cftc to impose fiduciary duties on impersonal ctas such as cts.rather,these provisions permit the cftc to bring proceedings against impersonal ctas who commit fraud or engage in practices that operate as fraud and impose remedies to correct such violations.thus,cts fear of being subjected to fiduciary duties is not a persuasive reason to decide that client unambiguously refers to only those who provide personal advice.
fifth and finally,cts claims that the antifraud provisions of the cea raise serious constitutional questions and we should interpret the statute to avoid such issues.see,jones united states,d.however,the parts of the cea at issue do not present such grave questions that the constitutional avoidance canon should be employed.see rust sullivan,d see also united states,d stating that the avoidance canon must be applied judiciously in order to avoid distorting policy choices of elected representatives.cts claims that constitutional questions led the supreme court in lowe to hold that the iaa applies only to impersonal advisors.to the extent that constitutional concerns motivated the majority opinion in lowe,these were directed at the iaa registration requirements.at.registration for impersonal advisors raises much more serious constitutional questions than antifraud provisions because registration operates as a form of prior restraint,which bears a strong presumption of unconstitutionality.see schultz city of cumberland,cir.because of the cftc recent regulation exempting impersonal advisors from registration under the cea,a,the constitutional issues that concerned the supreme court in lowe are not present in the instant case.we find that the antifraud provisions alone,detached from the registration requirement,do not raise the grave constitutional concerns that would require this court to determine that client unambiguously refers to only those receiving personalized advice.see r w technical servs.cftc,cir.
none of cts contentions demonstrate that the word client as used in the cea unambiguously means only those who receive personalized advice.instead,the definition of client is uncertain because it can refer to merely those who receive tailored advice from professionals or those who receive any kind of service regardless of whether it is personalized.thus,the first step of chevron is satisfied in favor of the cftc and we proceed to the second step determining whether the agency interpretation is reasonable.cts does not make any arguments on this point,and we find no reason to conclude that the cftc construction is unreasonable.indicates that congress intended for the cea to have a broad reach,and the cftc appears to be effectuating that purpose.thus,we defer to the cftc interpretation of client in applying the cea and conclude that and regulation can be applied to cts.
the relevant part of a states that 
it shall be unlawful for any person,in or in connection with any order to make,or the making of,any contract of sale of any commodity for future delivery,made,or to be made,for or on behalf of any other person if such contract for future delivery is or may be used for b determining the price basis of any transaction in interstate commerce in such commodity to commit fraud,willful deception,or certain manipulative acts.
cts claims that the for or on behalf of language relates back to any person.according to cts,only applies to people who make contracts for or on behalf of other people,that is,brokers and other agents.the cftc claims that this key phrase relates back to any contract,and thus any person,not just a broker,who commits fraud in connection with a contract made for another person has violated 
cts is correct regarding the meaning of.the cftc reading would render the for or on behalf of language mere surplusage.according to the cftc,this phrase only specifies that the contract must be made on behalf of someone other than the party committing fraud.since a person can not defraud him or herself through contract or otherwise,congress could have omitted for or on behalf of and the statute would have the exact same meaning as the cftc now proposes.thus,the cftc construction contravenes the aforementioned canon that each word or phrase in a statute should be given eff
