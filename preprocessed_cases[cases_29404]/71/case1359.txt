nsmia,the national securities markets improvement act of,prohibits the states from limiting or imposing any conditions upon the use of any offering document that is prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of a covered security a a but permits certain state officers to bring enforcement actions with respect to fraud or deceit,or unlawful conduct by a broker or dealer,in connection with securities or securities transactions c.the issue on this appeal is whether nsmia savings clause is sufficiently broad to permit the attorney general of california to pursue injunctive relief and penalties against a covered security investment advisor and wholesale who allegedly made inaccurate or inadequate representations to purchasers.we conclude that the savings clause applies,and therefore reverse a judgment based on a finding that this action is preempted by federal law.
a.the declaratory relief action 
capital research and management company crmc,an investment advisor and american funds distributors,afd,a registered and wholesale distributor sued the attorney general of the state of california for injunctive and declaratory relief concerning the legality of certain commissions and fees paid to selling shares in american funds af fund crmc manages af fund mutual funds with combined assets of about billion,and afd distributes af fund shares through selling group agreements with more than unaffiliated.
according to afd,its are paid principally through receipt of dealer commissions and service fees but about of its top selling dealers are paid an additional amount to defray the costs of training the dealers registered representatives who help dealers match appropriate investments to their clients long term investment needs.the terms of the brokers compensation are disclosed in af fund prospectuses and other offering documents,including statements of additional information sai,issued by af fund and disseminated to prospective investors crmc and afd allege that af fund complies with its disclosure obligations by stating in its prospectus that afd may pay or sponsor informational meetings for dealers as described in the sai,and by stating in its sai that afd at its expense from a designated percentage of its income,currently provides additional compensation to dealers.currently,these payments are limited to the top dealers who have sold shares of af fund these payments are based principally on a pro rata share of a qualifying dealer sales.afd will,on an annual basis,determine the advisability of continuing these payments.
according to crmc and afd,they sought declaratory relief because the attorney general claims the compensation disclosures are inadequate and materially false and misleading in violation of corporations code sections and,notwithstanding that according to crmc and afd the additional compensation payments to their are perfectly lawful because no state or federal law,rule or regulation bans or otherwise regulates the practice.the declaratory relief complaint alleges that any effort by the attorney general to stop the payments would be expressly preempted under the national securities markets improvement act of nsmia,stat.codified in part at or,if not preempted,would be entirely without legal or factual merit.
b.the enforcement action 
on the same day the declaratory relief action was filed,the attorney general filed an enforcement action against crmc and afd et,alleging that crmc and afd were participating in undisclosed agreements,thereby increasing af fund shareholders costs and creating conflicts of interest the attorney general alleges that undisclosed agreements adversely affect the relationship between and mutual funds on the one hand,and their customers on the other,and that the secrecy of these agreements prevents prospective mutual fund investors from recognizing this potential conflict of interest,and prevents mutual fund directors from effectively regulating their funds distribution practices to protect shareholders.
more specifically,the attorney general alleges that,between january and the present,afd maintained approximately agreements with,the majority of which were undisclosed oral agreements entered into between afd and the brokers with express,reciprocal terms that were understood by both parties to the agreements.pursuant to the formula stated in these agreements,afd subsidized by crmc paid cash and directed brokerage to the brokers who sold af fund shares and,in turn,received preferred access to the brokers registered sales representatives.the agreements are not accurately or fully disclosed in af fund disclosure documents.
based on the facts summarized above,the attorney general enforcement action pleads two causes of action against afd and crmc,one for violations of section,the other for violations of section,subdivision a,alleging that in selling af funds shares,afd with the connivance of crmc violated these statutes by failing to disclose to purchasers and prospective purchasers of af funds shares the facts about the agreements that would allow them to understand the import of the statements made by af fund in its disclosure documents.
the attorney general complaint seeks injunctions enjoining afd and crmc from engaging in any conduct in violation of sections and,civil penalties,disgorgement of profits,and restitution to the purchasers.
c.the trial court proceedings 
the declaratory relief and enforcement actions were consolidated and discovery was stayed pending a determination of the preemption issue.
crmc and afd demurred to the enforcement complaint,contending nsmia expressly or impliedly preempts any action challenging the adequacy of af fund disclosures.the attorney general filed opposition,pointing out that it had sued crmc and afd,not af fund,and that its complaint challenged the alleged fraud,not af fund disclosures.for its part,the trial court overruled the demurrer based on express authorized a second demurrer on the implied preemption theory,and crmc and afd demurred again.the trial court accepted the implied preemption argument,found the savings clause did not salvage the enforcement action,and on that basis sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.crmc and afd then dismissed their declaratory relief action,and the court entered a final judgment in their favor,from which the attorney general now appeals.
discussion 
the attorney general contends his enforcement action is not preempted.we agree.
preemption occurs three ways where federal law states expressly that state law is preempted where federal law is so comprehensive that it leaves no room in the covered field for supplementary state regulation and where there is an actual conflict between state and federal law.california federal guerra,d.the issue is one of congressional intent jevne superior court cal th,d,county of los angeles smith th,d,and our task is to divine that intent by examining nsmia language as well as its structure and purpose mcclendon,d 
the primary purpose of nsmia was to preempt state blue sky laws which required issuers to register many securities with state authorities prior to marketing in the state congress recognized the redundancy and inefficiencies inherent in such a system and passed nsmia to preclude states from requiring issuers to register or qualify certain securities with state authorities.lander hartford life annuity ins.cir,emphasis added.to that end,nsmia provides for exclusive federal registration of nationally traded securities,b,including the mutual fund shares at issue in this case a,b,and provides as relevant
