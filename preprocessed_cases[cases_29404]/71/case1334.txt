this appeal presents the issue of whether commodity futures sales that are made to hedge against price fluctuations should be included in the sales factor of the uniform division of income for tax purposes act,et seq uditpa apportionment formula.we conclude that,in the tax years at issue,the full sales price of these futures contracts number of bushels times price per bushel are gross receipts within the meaning of the uditpa sales factor and we vacate the trial court denial of the taxpayer claims for refund.
background 
general mills and its subsidiary corporations hereafter,general mills seek refunds from the california franchise tax board for the tax year ending may,through the tax year ending may.because general mills is a unitary group of corporations operating both within and outside of california,the proportion of its income that is subject to california taxation is determined by the uditpa.the franchise tax board calculates general mills total business income as distinguished from its nonbusiness income,and uses an apportionment formula to determine the percentage of the income that will be subject to california taxation,subds.a,d.
the apportionment formula recognizes three factors property,payroll,and sales.each factor is a fraction where the numerator is the amount attributable to california and the denominator is the total amount.when combined the factors establish the fraction apportionment percentage of the unitary business total business income that is subject to california taxation.collectively,the property,payroll and sales factors are intended to represent the taxpayer business activity within california.see.if the taxpayer or the franchise tax board can demonstrate that the factors do not fairly represent the taxpayer business activity within california,the taxpayer may request and the franchise tax board may require that an alternative allocation and apportionment formula be applied.see generally microsoft,supra,cal th at,d.
only the sales factor is at issue in this litigation.as to the sales factor,the only issue is the treatment of general mills sales on commodity futures markets.all of those sales take place outside of california and affect only the denominator of the sales factor.any increase in the denominator of the sales factor decreases the percentage of general mills business income that is taxable in california.that is,it reduces general mills california taxes.
for tax years beginning before january,the udipta defines sales as all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated as nonbusiness income,subd.e.general mills argues that the full sales price of each of its futures sales contracts,the number of bushels sold under the contract multiplied by the price per bushel in the contract should be counted as gross receipts for purposes of calculating the sales factor,regardless of whether the contract results in actual physical delivery of the commodity,is offset before delivery,or is used to offset an open futures purchase contract.we describe offset below.the franchise tax board maintains that no amount from these futures sales contracts should be counted as gross receipts in the sales factor.
we will first describe general mills trading activity on the commodity futures markets.as the parties agree the relevant facts are undisputed,our description is based on the parties joint stipulation of facts and trial court testimony and exhibits.we then describe how general mills accounts for the transactions in its financial books and on its tax returns,as well as the procedural background of this appeal.finally,we address the substance of the appeal.
general mills futures trading 
general mills is engaged in the principal trade of manufacturing and marketing branded finished consumer food products.it also sells raw grain and grain products to third parties.
the company engages in futures trading as a hedger.as we will explain,the process of hedging protects it against the risk of fluctuations in the price of agricultural commodities general mills uses in its business.to understand general mills hedging transactions,we define several concepts involved in the hedging process.a futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery in the future at a price that is determined at initiation of the contract that obligates each party to the contract to fulfill the contract at the specified price that is used to assume or shift price risk and that may be satisfied by delivery or offset.offset means liquidating a purchase of futures contracts through the sale of an equal number of contracts of the same delivery month,or liquidating a short sale of futures through the purchase of an equal number of purchase contracts of the same delivery month.
hedging means taking a position in the futures market opposite to a position held in the cash market to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change or purchasing or selling commodities on the futures market as a temporary substitute for a cash transaction that will occur later.the purpose of hedging is to smooth out price fluctuations so general mills can operate despite the price volatility in the agricultural commodities it uses to manufacture its consumer products.if general mills did not hedge the price of grain,it would encounter severe fluctuations in its costs of goods.in such instances,general mills would have to choose between selling at a loss or not selling at all,particularly for products such as flour where the cost of grain is about percent of the selling price.although general mills may not make any profit on its futures trades,and may in fact experience a net loss,it would not be able to achieve its current profit margins on its ultimate product,flour and cereal sales without the price protection of hedging.general mills hedging activities contributed to its business income for each of the tax years in issue.
in percent of its futures transactions,general mills offsets the original futures contract rather than letting the contract result in actual delivery of the commodity,and it obtains almost all of the commodities it needs for manufacturing on the cash market.all of general mills futures trades are triggered by planned or actual purchases or sales of commodities in the cash market.futures exchange rules,commodities futures trading commission policy,and general mills internal risk management policy require futures trading volume to match general mills commitments in the cash market.
mechanics of the futures market 
the mechanics of the futures market include trading platforms physical locations or computerized networks where buyers and sellers or their brokers agree to buy and sell a certain amount of a commodity at a certain price in a given month,and a clearinghouse that thereafter acts as the counterparty for the transactions and assumes the credit risk that traders will default on their contracts.the clearinghouse becomes the buyer for each seller and the seller for each buyer.see vickers commissioner of internal revenue,wl describing mechanics of futures exchanges vickers.traders must maintain margin accounts with the clearinghouse in order to trade on a futures exchange.that is,they must deposit money or collateral as a performance bond to ensure that they can meet their financial obligations,typically between percent and percent of the value of their outstanding contracts at the end of each trading day,all open positions,outstanding futures purchase or sales contracts that have not been satisfied or closed by offset or delivery on a futures exchange are marked to market at the settlement price,with net gains and losses posted to the trader margin account if a futures contract is offset,the only money exchanged is through the process no other money changes hands and no commodities are delivered.
general mills books and tax returns 
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and securities and exchange commission requirements,which apply to financial as distinct from tax accounting,general mills includes its futures and forward sales as adjustments to costs of goods rather than sales in its annual reports and financial statements.similarly,on its federal tax returns general mills includes its futures and forward sales as adjustments in its costs of goods rather than sales.when general mills filed its initial california tax returns for the tax years in issue,it did not include amounts from its futures trading in the uditpa sales factor.
between and,general mills amended its california tax returns for the tax years in issue and claimed tax refunds.in recalculating its tax obligation,general mills included the full sales price,the number of bushels of the commodity multiplied by the price per bushel in the contract of all of its futures sales contracts in the denominator of the sales factor pursuant to section,subdivision a.the increase in the sales factor denominators changed the apportionment formulas from about percent to percent for tye,from percent to percent for tye,from percent to percent for tye,from percent to percent for tye,from percent to percent for tye,and from percent to percent for tye.under these reduced apportionment percentages,general mills would be entitled to a total refund of.
claims for refund and tax refund litigation 
in early,the franchise tax board denied the refund claims,refusing to include any receipts from general mills futures sales contracts in the sales factor denominator.on march,general mills filed a complaint for a refund pursuant to section.the parties agreed on a joint stipulation of facts and various witnesses testified at a court trial.
the trial court concluded that general mills receipts from futures trading should not be included in the sales factor at all under the plain language of udipta,the court concludes futures trading does not qualify as sales income and can not be used for tax apportionment purposes testimony established that at inception,futures have no value.rather they acquire value when marked to market daily,at which point they are zeroed out.because futures have no value at inception,they can not qualify as the total amount of money received under microsoft gross receipts definition.secondly,the nature of futures is revocable at any time prior to delivery.if futures are an obligation to buy or sell a commodity in the future,general mills has not established that this obligation is binding,that withdrawal or defection from this obligation is legally prohibited or necessarily entails a legal consequence for the party withdrawing t herefore futures contracts can not be said to be supported by consideration although the court did not reach the section issue,it cited evidence demonstrating that great potential exists for a finding of distortion under the statute.general mills claims for tax refunds were denied.
discussion 
we consider whether and to what extent general mills receipts from its futures sales contracts should be included in the sales factor of the standard apportionment formula and,if any,whether a different formula could be imposed under section.general mills takes the position that the full sales price number of bushels times price per bushel of all of its futures sales contracts whether opening or closing and if opening whether closed by offset or delivery should be included and that no alternative formula may be imposed under section.the franchise tax board defends the trial court position that no receipts from futures sales contracts should be included in the sales factor under the standard apportionment formula.alternatively,it argues that only net gains on futures purchase or sales contracts should be included in the sales factor under the standard formula and that it properly imposed the alternative formula of including no receipts from general mills futures trades pursuant to section.
i.the uditpa sales factor 
the uditpa defines sales as all gross receipts of the taxpayer not allocated as nonbusiness income,subd.e.a regulation interpreting section,subdivision e reads,t he term sales means all gross receipts derived by the taxpayer from transactions and activity in the regular course of such trade or business,tit,subd.a.
the meaning of gross receipts has been considered in two recent cases by the california supreme court microsoft,supra,cal th,d,and general motors franchise tax bd.cal th,d,general motors.in general motors,g ross receipts was defined as t he total amount of money or other consideration received by a business taxpayer for goods sold or services performed in a year,before deductions.citations.general motors,at,d.the court explained that g ross implies the whole amount received,not just the amount received in excess of the purchase price.to only consider the net price difference as gross receipts is an awkward fit with the statutory language,at best.to the extent the language is ambiguous,we generally will prefer the interpretation favoring the taxpayer.citation.microsoft,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.considering the legislative history of the uditpa,the decision pointed out that the drafters rejected a definition of sales as all income of the taxpayer,instead defining sales as all gross receipts of the taxpayer.id.at,d.this amendment suggests the choice of gross receipts was intentional and the drafters had in mind a definition of sales that encompassed more than just gross income.ibid.
the court also held,in deciding how to apply section which defines sales,we look as well to the economic reality of the taxed transaction.for purposes of taxation,what matters is substance,not form.in applying this doctrine of substance over form,the united states supreme court has looked to the objective economic realities of a transaction rather than to the particular form the parties employed.citation.thus,we focus on the actual rights and benefits acquired,not the labels used.microsoft,supra,cal th at,d.microsoft found that the redemption of a marketable security at maturity was equivalent to a sale of the security to a third party before maturity when the transaction was evaluated from the perspective of the taxpayer.therefore,the entire amount received upon redemption which included the initial capital outlay were gross receipts for purposes of calculating the uditpa sales factor.id.at,d.on the other hand,general motors concluded that a repurchase hybrid of the sale of a security and a secured be characterized as a secured loan for purposes of the uditpa sales factor and repayment of the loan should not be counted as gross receipts.general motors,supra,cal th at,d.the court reached this conclusion by examining the transaction once again from the perspective of the taxpayer.id.at,d.
ii.general mills futures sales 
following the supreme court analysis in microsoft,supra,cal th,d,and general motors,supra,cal th,d,we conclude the full sales price number of bushels times price per bushel of all of general mills future sales contracts should be counted as gross receipts in the uditpa sales factor.inasmuch as the facts regarding general mills futures trading activity are undisputed,application of the uditpa to these undisputed facts is a question of law and our review is de novo.microsoft,supra,cal th at,d.
a.a futures sales contract is a legally binding obligation to sell a commodity and a trader receives consideration at offset 
the record establishes that a futures sales contract is a legally binding obligation to deliver a specified amount of a specified commodity at a specified price in a specified month.the parties stipulated that a futures contract is an agreement to purchase or sell a commodity for delivery in the future that obligates each party to the contract to fulfill the contract at the specified price and that may be satisfied by delivery or offset.and the franchise tax board leading expert witness whose testimony provided the framework for the trial court decision acknowledged at trial that if a trader is still holding a futures contract on the contract delivery date,the trader is obligated to deliver or accept delivery of the commodity at that date.it is also well established as a matter of law that futures contracts are binding contracts.board of trade christie grain stock.there is no doubt that the contracts made between the members of the futures excha
