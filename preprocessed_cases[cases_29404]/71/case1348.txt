factual and procedural background 
in november the defendants,paul koch,victoria koch,patricia manolis and acquvest,acquvest,retained luce forward to represent them in complex securities litigation involving millions of dollars.other than their initial retainer,the defendants paid luce forward no fees,and in october it sued them for breach of contract and related counts.luce forward successfully petitioned to compel arbitration under the fee agreement,and the parties agreed to the appointment of retired superior court judge richard haden,who was with judicial arbitration and mediation services jams,as the arbitrator.
two attorneys with luce forward,pamela wagner and todd kinnear,were listed on the complaint and other pleadings as the attorneys for the firm.judge haden sent the parties a written disclosure that he had served as a mediator in three cases in which luce forward was a party,other members of the luce forward firm participated as counsel,and none of those mediations concerned the issues in this case.the disclosure also stated the arbitrator does not believe this prior work as a mediator would impact his ability to be fair to both sides in this arbitration.no party challenged the disclosure.
arbitration was scheduled to begin january.on january,when he was preparing for the matter,judge haden discovered that robert steiner,a senior partner with luce forward,was listed in the caption of the firm brief above kinnear name.he also discovered that luce forward listed maureen hallahan as an expert witness.
the arbitration was held on january,and april and,and steiner appeared for luce forward.roland bye was the attorney of record for the defendants,but he did not appear and had notified judge haden they planned to retain thomas malcolm of the jones day firm.malcolm,however,was unable to appear because of a family emergency.paul koch koch appeared without an attorney and was allowed to represent himself and his wife victoria koch.manolis was allowed to appear through her son.because an attorney must represent a corporation in court proceedings,judge haden advised koch it would be much better if bye or counsel of your choice were here to represent acquvest.
judge haden then questioned steiner on whether he planned to call hallahan.steiner responded i do think she is necessary.she is a rebuttal witness only and she testifies as to reasonableness and necessity.her opinion is in the file.but in the event that the court wants to hear evidence on reasonableness and necessity,her written opinion says that she has reviewed the files and has formed that opinion.
judge haden explained,i did not know the witness list until i reviewed the materials over the weekend,and i need to let you know that hallahan is a lawyer of long standing in san diego with whom i have served on the board of what is called the business trial lawyers association abtl,as i have served with steiner.i was aware steiner was going to be the trial counsel.i thought kinnear was.but this is a board that a great many lawyers and judges have served on through the years.judge haden explained there were between and members of abtl and at any given time,three dozen members of the board.
judge haden clarified that he served on the board with steiner as well as hallahan.he also stated he served with steiner through the years on the board of the american inns of court.he stated t his would in no way affect my ability to be fair and impartial to all sides in this case,but i like you to hear that from me rather than hear that from somebody else and have you wonder why i did tell you.judge haden added that is why i like to make that disclosure.had i known this earlier,hallahan was on the witness list or steiner was going to be trial counsel,i would have told bye earlier so i wanted to make that disclosure for the record.
koch responded,your i am sure that you can be nonpartial,but it still a little bit of a shock to me that the two of you had participated on a board together.they bring in their top gun,probably one of the best trial attorneys at the luce,forward firm.koch then requested that judge haden disqualify himself because of his disclosures pertaining to steiner and hallahan.steiner offered to withdraw hallahan from luce forward witness list,and he argued disqualification was not required.judge haden stated,w e are not talking about a social relationship.i have never been in his home,nor he in mine.we have participated in professional boards together we are not talking about close personal friendships or any kind of business relationships.we are talking about the fact that i have been actively involved in the legal community for over years,steiner over.any time you talking with lawyers or judges who have been around that long,they know each other.in an abundance of caution,as i told you this morning,i like people to hear that from me and not from others.judge haden also said he had not read hallahan report,would not do so,and would strike her name from the witness list.
steiner added as follows i make representations to the court and to opponents that judge haden and i have never exchanged personal favors,to my knowledge,never had lunch together,never have given each other any kind of consideration.i have appeared in his court on several occasions.that is all public record available to the county clerk.i have argued matters and i have won some and lost some in front of him.but there is nothing in a professional relationship of lawyer and judge and the boards upon which i have served or do serve that in any way raises any issue of impropriety.
judge haden denied koch challenge.koch then moved to disqualify him for cause under jams rules.judge haden called a recess so koch could put his request in writing.judge haden denied the challenge and provided no additional written disclosure regarding steiner or hallahan despite koch requests.koch argued the disclosures created a reasonable belief that y our h onor can not be neutral.your h onor has a duty to update his disclosures.koch asked that jams decide the disqualification issue rather than judge haden.judge haden contacted jams counsel who concurred in his decision.
at judge haden urging,koch telephoned bye,and he agreed to represent acquvest.the court allowed him to appear by telephone the first day of the hearing,and on following days he was to appear in person.malcolm appeared for koch and his wife on the final two days of the proceeding,and during closing argument he stated i would like to thank the court.as is typical of my experience with you,judge haden,you extremely courteous,and it is really a pleasant job to present a case in your court here,an arbitration or whatever,and there is certainly no way my clients will ever challenge or question your impartiality.
in june judge haden issued his final arbitration award.he found the defendants breached their contract with luce forward and awarded the firm in fees,the full amount it sought.
luce forward petitioned to confirm the arbitration award,and the defendants,all of whom bye represented,petitioned to vacate the award on the ground judge haden was disqualified from hearing the matter because of his disclosures pertaining to steiner and hallahan.the court confirmed the award,determining that because judge haden was not required to disclose he served on professional boards with steiner,there was no basis for his disqualification on the ground he nonetheless revealed that information.on october,judgment was entered against the defendants on a joint and several basis.
discussion 
california favors arbitration as a speedy means of settling disputes,and to facilitate the policy it is essential that arbitration judgments are binding and final.classic construction,development th,d.accordingly,arbitration judgments are subject to extremely narrow judicial review and the exclusive grounds for vacating an arbitration award are the statutory grounds set forth in section marsch williams th,d,citing moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,such as the award was procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means,or the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers,subd.a.unless one of the enumerated grounds exists,a court may not vacate an award even if it contains a legal or factual error on its face which results in substantial injustice.marsch williams,supra,at,d.
precisely because arbitrators wield such mighty and largely unchecked power,the legislature has taken an increasingly more active role in protecting the fairness of the process.azteca construction,adr consulting,th,d azteca.in the legislature added section to the california arbitration act,which as amended in stats,ch,requires a proposed neutral arbitrator to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,subd.a.the required disclosures specifically include the existence of any ground specified in section for disqualification of a judge any matters required to be disclosed by the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators adopted by the judicial council pursuant to this chapter.any professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding or lawyer for a party,subd.a.
under section,subdivision a a judge shall be disqualified if any one or more of the following is true a for any reason i the judge believes his or her recusal would further the interests of justice.ii the judge believes there is a substantial doubt as to his or her capacity to be impartial.iii a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.
further,standard d of the california rules of court,ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration standards requires,in relevant part,the disclosure of a significant personal relationship with any party or lawyer for a party.std.d.a significant personal relationship includes a close personal friendship.std.s.standard also requires the disclosure of a ny other professional relationship not already disclosed under paragraphs.std.d.neither the code nor standard defines professional relationship.see guseinov burns th,d.
a proposed arbitrator must make required disclosures within days of the date of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment,subd.b.further,an arbitrator duty of disclosure is a continuing duty,applying from service of the notice of the arbitrator proposed nomination or appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding.std.f.
section,subdivision a provides that a proposed neutral arbitrator shall be disqualified if he or she fails to comply with section.subdivision b of section provides if the proposed neutral arbitrator complies with section,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall be disqualified on the basis of the disclosure statement after any party entitled to receive the disclosure serves a notice of disqualification within calendar days after service of the disclosure statement.
section confers on both parties the unqualified right to remove a proposed arbitrator based on any disclosure required by law which could affect his or her neutrality.citation.there is no good faith or good cause requirement for the exercise of this right,nor is there a limit on the number of proposed neutrals who may be disqualified in this manner.citation.as long as the objection is based on a required disclosure,a party right to remove the proposed neutral by giving timely notice is absolute.azteca,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
now,section,subdivision a requires that an arbitration award be vacated if the arbitrator either a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware or b was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in section but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision.on its face,the statute leaves no room for discretion.if a statutory ground for vacating the award exists,the trial court must vacate the award.ovitz schulman th,d.
defendants contend the court erred by denying their petition to vacate the arbitration award because judge haden was required to disqualify himself pursuant to koch written notice.luce forward agrees that if judge haden was legally required to make the disclosures he made pertaining to steiner and hallahan,judge haden was subject to disqualification.
luce forward contends,however,that serving on the board of directors of a professional organization with a party,party attorney or expert witness is not the type of relationship an arbitrator must disclose,and since judge haden was not required to make any disclosure pertaining to steiner or hallahan,the award is not subject to vacatur.luce forward asserts that only disclosures required by law may support a petition to vacate an award.defendants respond that judge haden was required to disclose his board memberships,and even if he had no such duty,his voluntary disclosures were sufficient to trigger a party right of disqualification.
we independently review the question of whether there is a statutory ground for vacation of the arbitration award.california faculty superior court th,d.however,the issue whether the arbitrator had a duty to disclose information which might indicate bias,is a question of fact.our review as to that issue is deferential.guseinov burns,supra,th,d.
was disclosure required 
the defendants characterize judge haden relationships with steiner and hallahan as close relationships,complex relationships,close professional relationships,and too close for comfort.they rely on johnston security ins.d.johnston,for the proposition that an arbitrator must disclose even an acquaintanceship with a party attorney or expert witness 
johnston involved an arbitration under an insurance policy.the insurer and the insureds each named one appraiser the insureds named burgard,and the two appraisers selected an attorney walsh as the competent and disinterested umpire.johnston,supra,d at.walsh made an award to one of the insureds,and only burgard concurred.the insurer successfully petitioned for vacatur of the award on the ground that walsh failed to disclose his acquaintanceship with the claimants counsel and burgard and of the business dealings past and projected with burgard.id.at.burgard declaration in support of a petition to confirm the award stated he met walsh in during litigation in a civil action in which he was the opposing counsel.since that time burgard has been associated with walsh on various cases and has been referred cases by walsh.on the date of the hearing burgard was representing a client referred to him by walsh in a matter pending in the san diego court.id.at.
the court of appeal affirmed the judgment vacating the arbitration award,adopting the rule enunciated in commonwealth coatings continental cas,d commonwealth.johnston quoted justice black language in commonwealth it is true that arbitrators can not sever all their ties with the business world,since they are not expected to get all their income from their work deciding cases,but
