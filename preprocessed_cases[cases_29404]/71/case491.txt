opinion of the court 
in this securities fraud class action,plaintiffs allege that defendants violated b and a of the securities exchange act of by making,with scienter,materially false statements about a clinical study of celebrex,a popular medication.in particular,defendants are alleged to have misled investors by distorting the study results with the intent to show that celebrex had a better safety profile than similar medications.finding the action to be untimely,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.this appeal and followed.
factual background 
celecoxib,known and marketed commercially as celebrex,is an prescription drug sold by defendant pharmacia corporation.substantially more expensive than many other nonsteroidal drugs nsaids,celebrex promise was rooted in the hope that it would cause fewer gastrointestinal gi than the less costly nsaids to help the hope become a reality,defendants commissioned a clinical study of celebrex effect on the gi system,the celecoxib arthritis safety study class study.this litigation focuses on the aftermath of that study.
according to the complaint,the results of the class study were a disappointment to defendants celebrex did not show the desired reduction in gi as compared to the other drugs studied.fearing a decrease in sales and stock price,defendants allegedly undertook to distort the results of the study so that it would appear that celebrex possessed a better gi safety profile than,in fact,it did.towards this end,in april,defendants released only the results from the first six months of the class study those results,divorced from the entire set of data,were capable of positive construction.
defendants released the truncated results of the class study with great fanfare,declaring that the study shows that celebrex has a truly exceptional safety profile,and that the outcome data paints a clear and compelling picture of celebrex safety versus nsaids.joint app.ja.some documents issued by defendants noted that the class study lasted a full thirteen months,but the reason for excising the last seven months from the analysis was not revealed.
scientists affiliated with defendants then drafted an article based on the truncated results and submitted it for publication to the journal of the american medical association jama.as would become known only later,however,neither defendants nor the article authors informed jama that the data in the article was incomplete.in september,jama published the article,which reached the following conclusion the overall incidence of gi symptoms experienced by patients taking celebrex was significantly lower than by those taking nsaids,as was the rate of withdrawal from the study due to gi intolerability.id.at.
defendants hoped to convince the fda to allow celebrex to be marketed without the standard gi warning label required for other nsaids,and so submitted the complete data from the class study to the fda in june.fda staff members,in preparation for hearings on the warning label issue,reviewed the data.on february,the reports of those staff members were published on the fda website,alongside defendants own report.defendants report defended the decision to use only the truncated data,asserting that data after the point was biased in favor of the comparator drugs 
the gi safety data presented are for the treatment timepoint based on the analysis of risk factors prespecified in the protocol.in brief,a disproportionate withdrawal of patients at high risk of an ulcer complication from the entire study was observed after six months depletion of susceptibles.additionally,a significantly greater withdrawal of patients on diclofenac for gi intolerance occurred during the initial six months of the study.the withdrawal of patients for gi intolerance prematurely removed a group at high risk for ulcer complications and symptomatic ulcers from the diclofenac treatment arm informative censoring.
the fda staff reports,stating in part as follows,disagreed with defendants reliance on the truncated data 
a rheumatologist report stated that it was unclear that the rationale put forth by defendants represented a significant bias in assessment of the outcome.id.at.
a gastroenterologist report stated that defendants rationale for analyzing the first months as a meaningful endpoint independent of the success at the study completion is not convincing.id.at.however,this report also stated that t he analysis will be reviewed only as a potentially supportive analysis.id.at.
a statistician report rejected the analysis as not valid,and asserted that there was no reason to include information only in the first months.id.at.
these reports were prepared to assist the fda arthritis advisory committee advisory committee in deciding whether to recommend the label change sought by defendants.the day after the publication of the reports,the advisory committee held hearings on the issue,and ultimately declined to recommend the label change.the staff reports and the advisory committee recommendation received substantial media attention.the market also took note of the disappointing outcome between february,the price of pharmacia stock dropped approximately.
after these events,defendants issued a series of positive statements about celebrex gi safety profile as well as about the chances for a label change.defendants claimed,for example,that the class study data presented a compelling case for a label change,and that because the class study was an extremely rigorous and complex trial,it was difficult for the advisory committee to analyze.id.at.
financial analysts also continued to rate pharmacia stock positively.even while noting the reduced chances for a label change and the disagreement over the results of the class study,jp morgan,merrill lynch,lehman brothers,and bank of america all continued to rate pharmacia stock as a buy or strong buy.several analysts noted the challenge to defendants use of truncated data jp morgan wrote that the staff reports called the analysis unjustified and invalid,and bloomberg news wrote that defendants were only able to show a benefit by looking at selected parts of the practice discouraged by the fda.id.at.
months later,on august,the washington post reported that defendants had withheld the full class study data from jama.in the article,jama editor described herself as disheartened and stated that a level of trust was,perhaps,broken.id.at.additionally,a scientist who wrote an editorial published in conjunction with the jama article stated that he was flabbergasted when he saw the complete data another scientist said he complained to jama after noticing differences between the published jama report and the data presented to the fda.id.at.
after the washington post article raised the red flag of impropriety,other sources began to question defendants good faith.for example,an article from the sunday times noted that the scandal involving the class study had inspired medical journals to stop drug firms from cheating on medical studies.id.at.on june,an article in the british medical journal called the explanations for the serious irregularities in the jama article inadequate.id.at.the article also stated that p ublishing and distributing overoptimistic short term data using post hoc changes to the protocol,while omitting disappointing long term data of two trials is misleading.id.following the publication of this article,the price of pharmacia stock dropped in three days.
ii.procedural history 
this action was initiated on april,when the first securities fraud class action complaint was filed.related actions were shortly thereafter consolidated into it.the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss and granted plaintiffs motion for class certification,but shortened the class period by more than a year,finding that investors could not have reasonably relied on defendants alleged misrepresentations after february,the date on which the fda staff reports were published.
defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,asserting that if reliance was unreasonable after february,plaintiffs must necessarily have been on inquiry notice of their claims at that time.because the first securities fraud suit was filed on april,and the statute of limitations for b claims is two years,see b,defendants asserted that plaintiffs claims were untimely.the district court agreed,and granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
the of the parties are now before us for our consideration.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we exercise plenary review over the court decision to grant defendants motion for summary judgment and the decision to deny their motion to dismiss.see,mest cabot,cir farber city of paterson,cir.the decision to certify a class action and the determination of the class period are reviewed for abuse of discretion.holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir.
iv.legal analysis 
there are a number of issues before us on these appeals.plaintiffs challenge,first and foremost,the district court grant of summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.plaintiffs also dispute the court determination of the class period.on,defendants assert that the court erred in denying their motion to dismiss,and in granting plaintiffs motion for class certification.we address each of these issues in turn.
inquiry notice and the statute of limitations 
the district court determined that investors were on inquiry notice of possible securities fraud as of february.the statute of limitations will begin to run when the plaintiff is on inquiry notice.whether the plaintiffs,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,should have known of the basis for their claims depends on whether they had sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to place them on inquiry notice or to excite storm warnings of culpable activity.benak ex rel.alliance premier growth fund alliance capital,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.the inquiry notice determination requires a totally objective analysis that pinpoints the time at which a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have discovered the information demonstrating possible liability and recognized it as a storm warning.mathews kidder,peabody,cir.
in line with this objective analysis,plaintiffs are presumed to have read prospectuses,quarterly reports,and other information relating to their investments.id.however,the hypothetical reasonable investor need not be a scientific expert to the contrary,the relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable investor of ordinary intelligence would have recognized the available information as indicative of possible fraud.id.
inquiry notice seeks to deter putative plaintiffs from sitting on their hands,awaiting the discovery of the elusive smoking gun.inquiry notice will thus be triggered when plaintiffs should have discovered the general fraudulent scheme,in re nahc.secs,cir internal citations and quotations omitted,and can not avoid the time bar simply by claiming they lacked knowledge of the details or narrow aspects of the alleged fraud.benak,at internal citations and quotations omitted.
our recent decision in in re merck.securities,derivative,erisa litigation,cir hereinafter merck informs our decision here.in merck,we were faced with a similar set of factual circumstances after a clinical study of merck own blockbuster drug,vioxx,the company published a questionable interpretation of the study results,allegedly in order to boost vioxx sales and merck stock price.the questionable interpretation advanced by merck attempted to explain why patients taking vioxx experienced a higher rate of negative cardiovascular events than patients taking the study comparator drug,naproxen.this naproxen hypothesis emphasized the possibility that naproxen had a positive impact on the cardiovascular system,and discounted the possibility that vioxx had a negative impact.
the science behind this explanation was debatable,and,consequently,the fda scolded merck for its repeated promotion of the naproxen hypothesis.in a public warning letter issued to merck,the fda called the marketing campaign for vioxx false,lacking in fair balance,or otherwise misleading and minimizing of the potentially serious cardiovascular findings.id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.the fda ordered merck to send letters to doctors in order to correct false or misleading impressions and information.id.at.despite the public nature of these strong words,as well as,inter alia,news reports questioning the naproxen hypothesis and consumer lawsuits alleging negative cardiovascular effects from vioxx,we found that investors were not on inquiry notice of securities fraud.
most importantly for our purposes here,merck found that inquiry notice,in securities fraud suits,requires storm warnings indicating that defendants acted with scienter.thus,to trigger storm warnings of culpable activity,in the context of a claim alleging opinions or beliefs,investors must have sufficient information to suspect that the defendants engaged in culpable activity,that they did not hold those opinions or beliefs in earnest.id.at emphasis added internal citations and quotations omitted.
accordingly,for investors to be on inquiry notice of b claims,there must be some indication that defendants did not,in fact,hold the views expressed.inquiry notice requires storm warnings of culpable activity.see benak,at.under b,a corporation does not engage in culpable activity unless it acted with scienter scienter is not incidental to b,it is elemental 
in support of a finding of inquiry notice in february,defendants point to the drop in the price of pharmacia stock,the fda staff reports,the advisory committee meeting,analyst reports discussing the events at the fda,and the fact that the full length of the class study had long been publicly known.whatever else those facts may have indicated,they did not provide storm warnings of possible fraud.
for one thing,the drop in stock price following the events of february,did not indicate fraud or even the possibility of fraud.rather,the drop in price is easily explained by the fact that the market had been expecting that the fda would approve a label change.when the advisory committee issued a negative recommendation,the market reacted accordingly.but mere investor disappointment does not ipso facto imply fraud.
neither,in our view,does the content of the fda staff reports suggest fraud.defendants rely on a handful of words in those reports to wit,not valid,unclear,and not convincing.ja.but the staff reports span over pages of highly complex scientific and statistical analysis.these few words and phrases,lacking in accusatory intent and buried like needles in a haystack,could not give rise to storm warnings of fraud 
the advisory committee meeting and concomitant negative recommendation also could not give rise to storm warnings of fraud indeed,the transcript of the advisory committee meeting explicitly supports a finding that the experts believed that the dispute between defendants and the fda was a good faith,legitimate scientific dispute.we note,for example,the following statements made at the advisory committee meeting 
fda representative just to add a couple of other comments to that,i do think that there were differences between us and the company that were meaningful in terms of the findings of the analyses that were done.
we spent more time describing certain analyses and the company spent more time describing other analyses,but i do think there is any dispute that we have with what the company presented,and i think that the company understands where we were coming from with our analyses,and i do think that they are off target either in terms of how the company sees them.
advisory committee consultant the challenge here for me is that it seems to me everybody is speaking truth.i agree with everyone who speaks.i agree with the sponsor and their emphasis,i agree with the fda in their description it depends on which piece of this you pick out.
id.at emphasis added.
as should be evident by these statements,the advisory committee simply did not believe that anything untoward had occurred,and we obviously will not expect more of the reasonable investor
