appellants laborers pension trust fund for northern california and pension trust fund for operating engineers the shareholders appeal the district court order dismissing their class action securities law claims against jabil circuit,jabil and its officers and directors collectively appellees under.b.we affirm the district court order dismissing the complaint and all of the claims included because its allegations fail to meet the heightened pleading standards imposed by the private securities litigation reform act pslra,and.b.
background 
the shareholders represent a class of investors who purchased publicly traded jabil stock from september,to december,the class period.jabil is a publicly traded electronics and technology company headquartered in petersburg,florida.the remaining individual appellees held a directorship or officership at jabil for some portion of the class period,including appellee timothy main,who served as ceo,president,and a director of the company.
part of jabil compensation program during the class period involved issuing stock options to officers,directors,and employees of the company.jabil own corporate policy required the exercise price of these options to be at least equal to fair market value.the shareholders allege in their complaint that jabil violated this policy by issuing backdated options.the issue price of backdated options comes from a day where the trading price was lower than that on the actual date it is issued,resulting in an instant paper gain to the issuee.the specific allegations of backdating in the complaint rely almost exclusively on circumstantial evidence analyst commentary and comparative graphs to show that stock option grants to executives were backdated.at no point does the complaint identify any particular transaction or scheme of backdating or specific recipients of such a scheme.
backdating options is not itself illegal under the securities laws,nor is it improper under accounting principles.under generally accepted accounting principles gaap board opinion apb,however,backdated options must be recorded as a compensation expense to the corporation because they effectively give recipients immediate compensation in the form of options redeemable in the marketplace for profit.a corporation that fails to follow apb and record backdated options as a compensation expense will necessarily misstate its expenses and income in its financial reports.
during the class period,jabil represented in several financial reports that it had followed apb in constructing its periodic accounting statements.furthermore,in requesting approval of its employee compensation practices via proxy solicitations during the class period,jabil represented in those proxy statements that the policy for which it sought approval included granting stock options only at fair market value,and in the past,all stock options were granted at fair market value.
in march,the wall street journal reported on various technology companies whose executive officers received stock options that seemed consistently timed to grant the executives stock options at a low price in the period,followed by a in the stock price.the timing aroused the author suspicions,raised the possibility of backdated options,and led an expert to conclude that the likelihood of the options granted to appellee main occurring randomly were one in one million.
the securities and exchange commission launched an informal investigation of jabil stock option practices,and the company itself assembled a special committee to review the allegations.though the committee found no evidence that employees had been issuing themselves backdated options,it did conclude that jabil had misapplied apb to many of the stock options it had granted for fiscal years through.this misapplication resulted in an overstatement of earnings by million during that period,forcing jabil to restate its earnings for each of those years.
the company explained that the restatement resulted from misdating stock options,not backdating them.specifically,jabil cited three primary causes of the accounting errors changes to groups of people receiving grants,though the initial measurement date was not changed correspondingly new grants issued after initial grants had gone underwater but not properly accounted and improperly accounted stock option grants to a director for consulting services.the company denied,and continues to deny,that it ever purposely backdated stock options to its directors.of the restated amount,million actually resulted from increased compensation expense for employees.
shortly after the allegations of backdating appeared in the wall street journal,jabil issued a press release raising projections for the third quarter in fiscal year.the shareholders allege that jabil raised these forecasts in order to divert attention from the allegations concerning backdating,and that jabil knew that the factual bases for its improved forecasts were false even at the time it made the projections.the complaint relies on the testimony of several confidential witnesses described to have access to corporate information at the time of the revised projections.the witnesses allege that the appellees must have known that the factual bases for the improved forecasts were false.only one of those witnesses,however,identifies a single individual appellee,main,as having any specific knowledge.
the shareholders allege that the appellees securities law violations caused them economic loss during the class period.after the first voluntary amendment,the district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice on april.edward goodman life income trust jabil circuit,d.the shareholders amended and refiled their complaint,which the district court dismissed with prejudice,edward goodman life income trust jabil circuit,d goodman,leading to the instant appeal.

we review the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim de novo.rosenberg gould,cir.
iii.discussion 
section b and rule claims policy statements and financial reports 
to state a fraud claim under section b of the securities exchange act,b,and rule,a plaintiff must allege the existence of a material misrepresentation or omission,made with scienter,in connection with the purchase or sale of a security,on which the plaintiff relied,and which was causally connected to the plaintiff economic loss.dura,broudo.as with any fraud claim,a plaintiff must plead the circumstances of the conduct with particularity.see.b garfield ndc health,cir.complaints alleging falsity shall specify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading.b.additionally,a complaint must present facts from which a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.tellabs,makor issues rights,see also b.
the district court held that the shareholders failed to adequately plead that jabil statements about its practices during the class period were fraudulent under section b and rule.goodman,d at.specifically,the district court held that the shareholders failed to adequately plead falsity of the allegedly fraudulent statements,failed to raise a sufficient inference of scienter on the part of the appellees,and failed to plead enough facts to show loss causation.id.at.because we agree with the district court conclusion about the insufficient inference of scienter raised by the complaint,we need not address its conclusion on loss causation.
the district court viewed the complaint as an attempt to construct a narrative based on a scheme of backdating options and granting them to corporate officers.as a result,the district court concluded that the speculative allegations in the complaint fail to adequately allege backdating because they detail neither any particular defendant role in the backdating scheme nor when or how any particular stock option was backdated.goodman,d at.
the shareholders respond that the falsity they allege is not false option grants,but rather false statements about the dating of those grants contained in financial and policy statements.they contend that jabil decision to restate financial reports during the class period is an overt admission that the prior statements were in fact false.the appellees insist that the district court conclusion was correct because the shareholders failed to comply with the pslra and explain why each of the statements was false.specifically,they contend that the complaint explains the errors in the restatement as a result of an intentional backdating scheme,not as the result of an accounting error.because the shareholders have not pled the intentional backdating scheme with particularity,the appellees contend that the complaint inadequately pleads falsity because there is no allegation about why the statements are false.
we agree with the shareholders and conclude that the complaint adequately presents a claim of falsity.our review of the complaint leads us to depart from the district court narrow construction of the complaint.though we concur with the district court initial conclusion that the shareholders failed to plead any particularized facts about the alleged backdating scheme,their failure to show a backdating scheme only limits the actionable conduct hereit does not foreclose all potential claims.here,a contention that the financial reports and policy statements were false is plausible,but there is no plausible case of an intentional backdating scheme that can be constructed from the complaint.
the shareholders allege a number of facts that they contend raise a substantial inference of scienter.they allege insider trades by the jabil officers during the class period and point to the insider status of each appellee,financial benefits and motivation to artificially inflate the stock price,the admitted gaap violation,the membership of several appellees in the corporate committee that directed stock option grants,and the accounting expertise of several of the appellees.the district court evaluated all of these circumstances and concluded that,taken together,they failed to create a strong inference of scienter.goodman,d at.
in this circuit,scienter consists of intent to defraud or severe recklessness on the part of the defendant.mcdonald alan bush brokerage,cir.
severe recklessness is limited to those highly unreasonable omissions or misrepresentations that involve not merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,but an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,and that present a danger of misleading buyers or sellers which is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.the shareholders offer a mixed set of circumstantial facts that they claim indicate intent to defraud,or at least the appellees severe recklessness in failing to discover the accounting errors.
the shareholders charge the district court with failing to aggregate their factual allegations in evaluating the inference of scienter,as permitted by our decision in phillips,cir.they effectively concede that no single allegation,standing alone,is sufficient to meet the tellabs standard,see at.at,which requires the complaint to offer a cogent and compelling inference of scienter,but contend that the district court erred by considering each allegation in a vacuum.jabil responds that all of the allegations here,even after aggregation,fail to raise a cogent and compelling inference of scienter.
in rosenberg gould,cir,we recently confronted the specific question of whether similar allegations in a complaint that alleged a backdating scheme satisfied the standard for pleading scienter.there,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant fraudulently issued backdated stock options,signed false securities filings,and overstated earnings during the plaintiff stock ownership.to provide a strong inference of scienter,the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had responsibility to make decisions about stock option grants the mismeasurement of stock option grants resulted in substantial additional compensation expenses the defendant himself was granted allegedly misdated stock options the defendant made materially false statements the defendant sold approximately percent of his shares during the class period and the defendant resigned from the corporation after the discrepancies came to light.id.at.
we held that all of these allegations failed to create an inference of scienter that exceeded other inferences of nonfraudulent intent.id.we reasoned that it was most plausible that the defendant did not realize that the backdated options would affect later financial statements because he had no accounting experience.id.we also concluded that the restatement,as a percentage of total revenue during the class period,was de minimis and would not have alerted the defendant to the false statements.id.finally,we rejected the assertion that backdating stock options is inherently an intentional fraud that demonstrates scienter.id.
the allegations in this case are strikingly similar to those we encountered in rosenberg.the shareholders contend that the accounting expertise of several of the appellees in this case distinguishes the two cases,because some jabil executives should have known about the proper accounting practices.the accounting experience of some of the jabil executives,however,fails to provide the critical distinction here because the shareholders do not plead any facts that indicate that any individual appellee knew about the accounting irregularities during the class period.as a result,the allegations of misrepresentations,responsibility for granting misdated options,and personal profiteering fail to raise a strong enough inference of scienter here,just as they failed to do so in rosenberg.
the shareholders strongly insist that the million accounting error was too large for jabil to ignore without some fraudulent intent.in their complaint,they detail the restated amounts during the class period as a percentage of net income during each fiscal year,reaching nearly in one year.these allegations fall short of those evaluated in rosenberg,however,because they present the restated amounts as a percentage of net income and not total revenue.because net income can vary so widely period to period,using it as a baseline for comparison provides the court no real standard on which to judge the significance of the accounting error.this pleading strategypicking the metric that will yield the highest percentage valuesadds nothing to the inference of scienter that the shareholders attempt to create.
we will,however,address the weight of scienter allegations cumulatively,and next consider several individual allegations not addressed by our decision in rosenberg.the shareholders contend that the district court improperly resolved a factual dispute by determining that the gaap provision at issue here,apb,was not a simple accounting policy,a violation of which would be reckless.see goodman,d at.evaluating whether alleged conduct rises to the required level of scienter is not prohibited.because we permit recklessness to suffice as scienter only when highly unreasonable and an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care,it is necessary for a court to determine at the pleading stage whether the conduct alleged conformed to standards that exist outside the face of the complaint.mcdonald,at.
the shareholders demand that we accept all allegations in the complaint as truethat we must credit not only the allegation that jabil violated apb but also that doing so is so severely reckless as to raise a compelling inference of scienter.the former is a factual allegation,but the latter is a legal conclusion that we are not required to accept.under the pslra,it is our duty to determine whether the facts alleged raise a cognizable claim.we emphasize that the unique nature of the plsra requires us to resolve this question,whether the alleged conduct is severely reckless,at the pleadings stage,though doing so would be improper in most other contexts.but evaluating the complexity of apb is not necessary in this case,because the shareholders have failed to allege any facts indicating that any individual appellee knew that the accounting standard was being violated.
in ziemba cascade international,cir,we noted that a violation of gaap by a corporation can raise an inference of scienter when the defendants also ignored red flags warning them of the accounting irregularities.here,the shareholders contend that the gross amount of the error was itself a red flag that should have pointed jabil insiders to the accounting error.without an allegation that puts this amount in context of total corporate business,however,it is impossible for us to determine from the complaint whether any insider should have noticed the errors.
the shareholders also insist that the wall street journal article alleging backdated stock options received by main was a red flag recklessly ignored by jabil insiders.this red flag does not match the allegations that the shareholders now pursue in the complaintthat this is a case of known accounting fraud,not intentional backdating of stock options.the wall street journal article may support a case for actual backdating,but would not raise suspicion that numerous stock options had been misdated and misaccounted.the article raised the claim that one particular insider received intentionally backdated options it did not raise the claim that numerous options granted by jabil to many classes of employees were improperly recorded in jabil financial statements throughout the class period.
the shareholders also note a large number of stock trades made by the insider appellees during the class period.they claim that these trades serve as evidence that the officers knew that the financial statements were false and intended to capitalize on that knowledge at the expense of the uninformed public.stock sales by insiders are only relevant to scienter when they are suspicious.mizzaro home depot,cir.the complaint must allege some information about the insider trading history for us to determine whether the level of trading is dramatically out of line with prior trading practices at times calculated to maximize the personal benefit from undisclosed inside information.see id.quoting in re navarre.sec,cir see also metzler inv.gmbh corinthian,noting that whether the sales were consistent with the insider trading history is a relevant factor.workers pension trust fund ibew shaw group,cir noting that suspicious sales are those made out of line with earlier trading customs.
the shareholders failed to plead any information about any appellee trading history before the class period.as a result,there is no way to determine from the complaint that the sales of large numbers of shares is suspicious enough to add to an inference of scienter.we give the conclusory allegations of insider trading no weight in considering the inference of scienter raised by the complaint.
ultimately,we hold that the allegations contained in the complaint do not create an inference of scienter that is at least as probable as a explanationnamely that none of the appellees knew of the accounting errors until the investigation began in.the allegations here fit almost entirely within the confines of rosenberg,and we have in other circumstances rejected the additional allegations contained in the complaint not addressed by the rosenberg decision.the shareholders are correct to insist that the inference of scienter be aggregated from all of the complaint allegations,but we simply have no substantial allegations to aggregate.the section b and rule claims based on the financial restatements fail because of they lack sufficient allegations of scienter.
section b and rule claims insider trading 
the shareholders next contend that the district court erred in dismissing their section b and rule claims against the individual appellees for insider trading.though we recognize that an insider trading scheme can itself be a deceptive act or practice under the provisions,see chiarella united states,the complaint inadequately alleges fraudulent insider trades.the district court correctly noted that the plaintiffs fail to state which defendant knew what information and why the information was material.goodman,d at.
scienter is a component of section b and rule insider trading claims.sec adler,cir.scienter necessarily requires that the insider have possession of material nonpublic information at the time the insider trades.id.and,because of this state of mind requirement,the complaint must state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with scienter.b.though the complaint contains numerous allegations of trades made by individual appellees during the class period,it fails to make any particularized allegation that any individual appellee knew about the accounting errors at the time of trading.
the shareholders also allege that the individual appellees knew about execution problems at jabil that would cause it to miss quarterly projections,but traded jabil stock anyway despite their duty to disclose the information or abstain from trading.through a litany of confidential witnesses,the shareholders contend that the jabil insiders,collectively,knew at the time of the disputed projections that jabil would be unable to meet those projections.our review of the complaint allegations reveals,however,a dearth of facts indicating any individual appellee knowledge about the execution problems at jabil during the relevant times.
in fact,in only one paragraph of the complaint relevant allegations is a single appellee mentioned by name.there,the shareholders allege that appellee main knew about jabil delayed performance on a single contract before jabil revealed that it had missed its third quarter projections.the shareholders specifically allege trades by main in january and march,while stating that main knew as early as february about the contract execution issues.this is hardly a particularized allegation that main knew about material issues at jabil before he traded.the complaint,by its very terms,admits that main may or may not have known about the execution issues when he traded in jabil stock.this inadequate allegation of scienter fails to preserve the insider trading claim against main.we affirm the dismissal of all the section b and rule insider trading claims.
section and rule claims business condition projections 
the shareholders contest the district court conclusion that the quarterly projections about which they complain are not a basis for liability because jabil and its officers and directors are shielded by the pslra safe harbor provision.see goodman,d at see also c exempting from liability statements accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the statement.we consider jabil cautionary statements that accompanied the projections in reviewing the dismissal in accordance with e permitting consideration of cautionary statements on a motion to dismiss.
the shareholders contend that the safe harbor provision is inapplicable when the defendant makes the statement with actual knowledge of its falsity,no matter how accurate the accompanying cautionary language.by pleading that jabil insiders knew the falsity of the statements when they made them,the shareholders claim that they have precluded the jabil officers and directors from invoking the safe harbor in their motion to dismiss.the shareholders do not contend on appeal that the risk factors jabil enumerated were not meaningfully cautionary within the meaning of the statute.
the shareholders rely on lormand unwired,in which the fifth circuit held that the pslra safe harbor provision is not available to defendants who have actual knowledge that their statements are false at the time they are made,cir.the court cited the statutory safe harbor for the proposition that a defendant may only seek shelter if the plaintiff fails to plead that the defendant had actual knowledge of the statement falsity when he made it.id.at.because all allegations are considered true at the pleadings stage,the lormand court accepted the plaintiff assertion that the defendant knew his projection was false before he made it.
