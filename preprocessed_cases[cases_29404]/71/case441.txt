in this uncertified securities fraud class action,plaintiff richard kalnit,on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,alleges that defendants violated section b of the securities exchange act of,b section b and rule promulgated thereunder,rule,by fraudulently failing to disclose material information in connection with a proposed merger between mediaone group,mediaone and comcast corporation comcast.kalnit and the purported class members sold shares of mediaone stock during the period from march,through april,inclusive,at an allegedly artificially deflated price due to defendants alleged fraud.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york shira scheindlin,judge dismissed plaintiff amended complaint for failure to allege the element of scienter with adequate particularity.see kalnit eichler,d,kalnit ii.the district court dismissed plaintiff first complaint for the same reason,but granted plaintiff leave to amend.see kalnit eichler,d,kalnit i.plaintiff appeals the district court second dismissal,contending that his amended complaint adequately set forth scienter allegations.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the decision of the district court to dismiss plaintiff complaint without leave to amend.
background 
factual background 
mindful that we are reviewing a dismissal pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the following facts are contained in the plaintiff amended complaint and are assumed to be true.see press chem.inv,cir.
richard kalnit was an investor in mediaone,who sold shares of mediaone stock on april.he purports to represent a class comprised of those who sold shares of mediaone stock during the period between march,and april,
mediaone,is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in colorado.mediaone provides telecommunications services,including local,long distance and cellular telephone services.the individual were,at the time relevant to this action,mediaone officers or members of mediaone board of directors.defendant lillis was the chairman of the board,president and chief executive officer,and a director.defendant eichler was mediaone executive vice president,general counsel and secretary.
in,mediaone acquired a company called continental cablevision continental.as part of this acquisition,mediaone entered into a shareholder agreement with amos hostetter,continental.this agreement included a standstill provision which limited hostetter ability to propose mergers,directly or indirectly,involving mediaone the standstill restriction.at all times relevant to this suit,hostetter owned million shares,or approximately of all outstanding mediaone shares,and was mediaone largest shareholder.hostetter also possessed considerable clout in the telecommunications industry.
on march,mediaone announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with comcast,whereby comcast would acquire mediaone for approximately billion.pursuant to this agreement,each mediaone shareholder would receive shares of comcast common stock for each share of mediaone common stock.the agreement allowed mediaone days to accept a superior proposal,subject to payment of a billion termination fee to comcast.this agreement also contained a provision that prohibited defendants from directly or indirectly soliciting acquisition proposals that would compete with the comcast proposal.this provision,section of the agreement,also referred to as the no shop provision,stated 
from the date hereof until the termination hereof,mediaone will not,and will cause the mediaone subsidiaries and the officers,directors,employees or advisors of mediaone and the mediaone subsidiaries not to,directly or indirectly i take any action to solicit,initiate,facilitate or encourage the submission of any acquisition proposal and ii other than in the ordinary course of business and not related to an acquisition proposal,engage in any discussions or negotiations with,or disclose any information relating to mediaone or any mediaone subsidiary or afford access to the properties,books or records of mediaone or any mediaone subsidiary to,any person who is known by mediaone to be considering making or has made,an acquisition proposal.
section of the agreement provided that comcast could terminate if mediaone breached its no shop obligation.in short,mediaone could accept a superior offer within days,but could not directly or indirectly solicit such offers.
on march,hostetter sent a letter to the defendants,expressing his dissatisfaction with the terms of the comcast agreement,and seeking to be released from the standstill restriction to permit him to develop a superior proposal.on march,defendant eichler,on behalf of all defendants,wrote to hostetter and agreed to waive the standstill restriction.eichler informed hostetter that mediaone had no objection to his speaking with third parties about participating in any superior proposal.additionally,eichler confirmed an agreement of march,between mediaone and hostetter that hostetter would not make any public announcement of his efforts to develop a superior proposal without the board written consent,and to respond with no comment if a press inquiry is made.
in the meantime,on march,mediaone filed its annual report form with the securities exchange commission sec for the fiscal year ending december.this report included information about the comcast agreement,similar to the information previously released to the public,but did not disclose the hostetter letter or defendants response.
on april,mediaone filed a proxy statement pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act,a supp.v,informing shareholders that a special meeting regarding the proposed comcast merger would likely occur.this statement did not disclose any of the communications between hostetter and mediaone board of directors.
on april,kalnit sold shares of mediaone stock at approximately per share,with no knowledge about hostetter release from the standstill restriction or about his desire to seek a superior proposal.
on april,at t corporation at t publicly proposed to acquire mediaone in a transaction valued at billion,approximately billion more than the value of the comcast proposal.also on april,hostetter filed a schedule with the sec,disclosing,for the first time,mediaone waiver of the standstill restriction.the schedule also revealed that hostetter had discussed with at t,among others,the possibility of a superior proposal for mediaone and that at t current proposal resulted from these discussions.
on april,mediaone stock opened at per share and closed at per share,up from a value of per share on april.four days later,mediaone stock closed at per share.
on may,mediaone board voted unanimously in favor of terminating the comcast agreement in order to accept at t proposal.a few days later,at t and comcast negotiated a transaction where comcast would not interfere with at t efforts to acquire mediaone,and at t and comcast would exchange certain cable properties resulting in a net increase in comcast cable subscribers.
on may,mediaone officially terminated the comcast agreement.appellant filed his complaint that same day.
proceedings below 
kalnit filed this complaint as a class action,purporting to represent himself and all others who sold mediaone securities during the period from march,through april,inclusive.he asserted claims under sections b and a of the exchange act,b,a,alleging that defendants fraudulently failed to disclose hostetter march,letter and their subsequent decision to release hostetter from the standstill restriction.
on december,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss the original complaint,concluding that the complaint failed to plead scienter adequately.see kalnit i,d at.the court granted plaintiff leave to amend his complaint to cure the noted deficiency.see id.at 
on january,kalnit filed an amended complaint,containing added scienter allegations.defendants again moved to dismiss this complaint,contending that the amended complaint failed to cure the defects noted in the original complaint.the district court agreed and concluded that the amended complaint still failed to give rise to a strong inference of defendants intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud mediaone shareholders.kalnit ii,d at.the district court also declined,on futility grounds,to give plaintiff leave to amend the complaint a second time.see id.at.
judgment was entered on april,and plaintiff appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
kalnit argues on appeal that the district court dismissal was in error because his complaint adequately alleged scienter 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint pursuant to rule b,accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.ganino citizens utilities,cir.a dismissal is upheld only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.citation omitted.
to state a cause of action under section b and rule,a plaintiff must plead that the defendant made a false statement or omitted a material fact,with scienter,and that plaintiff reliance on defendant action caused plaintiff injury.san leandro emergency med.group profit sharing plan philip morris,cir citing in re time warner.secs,cir the requisite state of mind,or scienter,in an action under section b and rule,that the plaintiff must allege is an intent to deceive,manipulate or defraud.ganino,at quoting ernst ernst hochfelder,d.
a complaint asserting securities fraud must also satisfy the heightened pleading requirement of federal rule of civil procedure b,which requires fraud to be alleged with particularity.ganino,at see also.b in all averments of fraud,the circumstances constituting fraud shall be stated with particularity.additionally under rule b,however,m alice,intent,knowledge and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.b.
in,congress enacted the private securities litigation reform act of the pslra,stat,which,among other things,imposed heightened pleading requirements for plaintiffs in securities fraud actions.the pslra scienter provision provides 
in any private action arising under this chapter in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind,the complaint shall,with respect to each act or omission alleged to violate this chapter,state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.
b supp.v codifying pslra b,stat.at.
the pslra language echoed this court scienter standard.before the pslra enactment,we held that,to be adequate,scienter allegations must give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent.novak kasaks,cir.a plaintiff can establish this intent either a by alleging facts to show that defendants had both motive and opportunity to commit fraud,or b by alleging facts that constitute strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness.acito imcera group,cir quoting shields citytrust bancorp,cir.
in novak,we concluded that the pslra did not change the basic pleading standard for scienter in this circuit.novak,at.thus,both options for demonstrating scienter,either with motive and opportunity allegations or with allegations constituting strong circumstantial evidence of conscious misbehavior or recklessness,survive the pslra.see ganino,at.we therefore examine kalnit complaint under both methods of establishing scienter.
motive and opportunity 
as the district court noted,it is undisputed that the individual defendants,as directors of mediaone,had the opportunity to commit fraudulent acts.kalnit ii,d at.the central issue,therefore,is whether plaintiff has sufficiently alleged motive.
plaintiff points to several allegations in the complaint in his attempt to demonstrate defendants motive to defraud the mediaone shareholders.first,plaintiff contends that,by failing to disclose the hostetter release,defendants were allowed to obtain another per share when mediaone entered into the agreement with at t,appellant br.at protected the significant change of control payments that would be jeopardized if it became known that defendants violated the comcast agreement,appellant br.at and protected defendants lillis and eichler specifically,because they had lucrative provisions in the comcast agreement,including a large lump sum payment and vested pension benefits,appellant br.at.second,plaintiff asserts that defendants were motivated by a desire to avoid personal liability for the breach of the comcast agreement.finally,plaintiff alleges that defendants were motivated by a desire to ensure that hostetter would be able to obtain a superior proposal,because disclosure of the hostetter release would jeopardize this possibility.
sufficient motive allegations entail concrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.novak,at quoting shields,at.motives that are generally possessed by most corporate directors and officers do not suffice instead,plaintiffs must assert a concrete and personal benefit to the individual defendants resulting from the fraud.novak,at.insufficient motives,we have held,can include the desire for the corporation to appear profitable and the desire to keep stock prices high to increase officer compensation.id.citing cases.on the other hand,we have held motive sufficiently pleaded where plaintiff alleged that defendants misrepresented corporate performance to inflate stock prices while they sold their own shares.id.citing cases.
to allege a motive sufficient to support the inference of fraudulent intent,a plaintiff must do more than merely charge that executives aim to prolong the benefits of the positions they hold.shields,at.noting the absence of insider trading allegations,in shields,we rejected as insufficient plaintiffs allegations that the defendants concealed and misrepresented the corporation financial condition to inflate the price of the common stock and to maintain artificially high prices in order to protect their executive positions and compensation.id.such motive allegations,we observed,were common to all corporate executives and,thus,too generalized to demonstrate scienter.id.
likewise,in acito imcera group,cir,we rejected as insufficient motive allegations plaintiff assertion that the officers were motivated to inflate the value of stock to increase their executive compensation.we concluded 
plaintiffs allegation that defendants were motivated to defraud the public because an inflated stock price would increase their compensation is without merit.if scienter could be pleaded on that basis alone,virtually every company in the united states that experiences a downturn in stock price could be forced to defend securities fraud actions.i ncentive compensation can hardly be the basis on which an allegation of fraud is predicated.
id.alteration in original quoting ferber travelers.again,plaintiffs motive allegations were too generalized to demonstrate defendants concrete and personal benefit from the alleged fraud.
in chill general electric,cir,plaintiffs alleged that ge interest in justifying to its shareholders its over billion investment in its subsidiary gave ge a motive to willfully blind itself to facts casting doubt on the subsidiary purported profitability.we held that this allegation did not sufficiently demonstrate ge motive to defraud shareholders.id.at.we stated that such a generalized motive,one which could be imputed to any,endeavor,is not sufficiently concrete for purposes of inferring scienter.see also san leandro,at company desire to maintain a high bond or credit rating does not qualify as sufficient motive,because this desire can be imputed to all companies.other courts have rejected similar generalized motives in other cases.see,phillips lci int l,cir in merger context,plaintiffs allegations that director sought to depress the stock price to assure the success of a merger to retain a position on the board and obtain a higher price for his stock did not constitute an adequate motive leventhal tow,d,plaintiff allegations that defendants had a motive to artificially inflate stock price to get more fa
