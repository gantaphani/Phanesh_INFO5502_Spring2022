factual and procedural 
schraders were directors and majority shareholders of ebc,a company planning to make theater installations for shopping malls.wade was the company ceo.with the business on the verge of failure,wade was fired and his ebc stock was revoked.wade sued schraders and the minority shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion,seeking damages for the value of the stock,which wade alleged to be more than million.after wade settled with the minority shareholders,wade and schraders entered into an oral agreement under section to submit the disputes presently pending in the superior court to binding arbitration.the parties agreed that all rights and claims they had as a result of the pending litigation would be resolved by the arbitration.
at the arbitration of wade claims against schraders,the arbitrator concluded that schraders had not breached a fiduciary duty but that the stock wade had acquired when the company was founded was given to him as a gift from schraders and,therefore,revocation of the stock was conversion of wade property.in determining the value of the stock,the arbitrator rejected the testimony of wade expert,who had valued the shares in the millions of dollars.the arbitrator explained,under the circumstances valuation is difficult there was no real market for the shares other than the interested parties schraders believed there was some value to the company just as they had believed when it was still in its conception stage.for this reason i find the value to be what they had placed on the value of founders stock at that time.it was cents penny stock then,as stock with little development but great expectations it is still cents penny stock at this time,as stock with substantial development but little expectations.although this was a gift from schraders,a gift is a gift.based on the above the value of the stock is.the arbitrator ruled an award shall be entered in favor of wade and against schrader in the amount of and simple interest at the rate of from march to the date of the final award wade is prevailing party and entitled to costs as against schrader.the award specified the procedure wade was to use to claim costs and that,thereafter a final award shall be entered.
wade moved in the superior court to confirm the award and schraders raised no substantive objection.the superior court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of wade and against schraders for,which represented the arbitration award,interest on the award,and in costs.
after judgment was entered,schraders asked wade to file an acknowledgement of satisfaction of the judgment based upon a credit they claimed they were owed due to wade settlements.wade had received a total of through settlements with the minority shareholders.wade did not dispute the fact or amount of the settlements.nevertheless,he refused to acknowledge satisfaction of the judgment and opposed schraders motion for an order compelling acknowledgment,subd.d on the ground that it was,in effect,a belated attempt to correct the arbitration award.
the superior court granted schraders motion,in part.the court noted that in syverson heitmann d.syverson,t he settlement completely offset the damages assessed against the nonsettling defendant,and the settlement reduced the judgment to zero by operation of law.the only difference in this case was that the judgment included an award of costs,which would not be offset by the prior settlements accordingly,the court concluded that schraders were entitled to a partial satisfaction of the judgment,leaving unsatisfied only the portion of the judgment attributable to costs.the court observed that it would have been perhaps wiser,at the time of confirmation of the arbitration award to judgment,to have brought this up,rather than to wait,but in any event,that seems to be the most appropriate way to handle this.wade has timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
contentions and standards of review 
section provides that where a release,dismissal,or covenant not to sue is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort a it shall not discharge any other such party from liability unless its terms so provide,but it shall reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated by the release,the dismissal or the covenant,or in the amount of the consideration paid for it whichever is the greater,subd.a,italics added.notwithstanding this express provision of section,wade maintains that using his settlement proceeds as a credit in satisfaction of the judgment was,in effect,an untimely and impermissible attempt to correct the arbitration award.schraders argue that the superior court ruling did not change the arbitration award but merely determined how to apply the settlement credit afforded them under section.
wade appeal boils down to two questions do the arbitration statutes et prohibit the use of a section settlement credit to satisfy a judgment based upon an arbitration award and does section permit the nonsettling defendants to wait until after judgment to take advantage of the credit afforded them by section

application of the settlement credit does not modify the arbitration award 
as wade correctly points out,the superior court is very limited in its ability to vacate or correct an arbitration award.et moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.furthermore,a petition to vacate or correct an arbitration award must be served and filed within days of service of the award on the petitioner.therefore,according to wade,since schraders did not file their motion to compel satisfaction of the judgment until many months after the award was served,and since they have not alleged any of the statutory bases for correcting the award,they can not apply the settlement credit against the resulting judgment.we have found no case precisely on point but one case is strikingly analogous.
