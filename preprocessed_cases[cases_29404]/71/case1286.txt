as a general rule,issuers of securities must register their securities with the securities and exchange commission before offering or selling them to the public.the commission,finding that gene geiger and charles kirby improperly sold to the public unregistered securities,or participated in such a sale,sanctioned them for violating of the securities act,a c in these petitions for judicial review,geiger and kirby claim the transactions were exempt from the registration requirement and that the sanctions the commission imposed were improper.
in,ron knittle and mary erickson were the controlling shareholders and,respectively,the president and ceo,and the secretary and treasurer,of beneficial capital financial services corporation,then a shell corporation.that year they changed the corporation name to golden eagle international.the company intended to acquire,develop,and operate mines.in three transactions,nearly million unregistered shares of golden eagle ended up in the hands of the investing public.
the transactions consisted of three blocks of shares.the first two blocks,totaling shares,were nominally held by kimi hunsaker.knittle and erickson actually controlled these shares.hunsaker,a clerical employee of golden eagle,never paid for the shares and,at least initially,did not know they were in her name.the certificate representing of the hunsaker shares bore a restrictive legend stating that the shares could not be sold without registration.the certificate representing the remaining hunsaker shares also once bore a restrictive legend,but a new,unrestricted certificate had been issued when knittle and erickson acquired the company.
the third block consisted of million shares held by david hills,a former golden eagle executive.hills severance agreement required him to return million of these shares to golden eagle once the company satisfied certain obligations.the certificates representing hills shares bore restrictive legends.
a.the transaction 
in june,knittle approached petitioner gene geiger,then a salesman at the brokerage firm of spencer edwards.he asked geiger to find a buyer for the hunsaker shares whose certificate did not have a restrictive legend.geiger offered the shares to petitioner charles kirby,the head trader at spencer edwards.kirby agreed to buy the shares for for the account of ckc partners,a partnership jointly owned by kirby and a trust he administered on behalf of his children.when kirby sought to pay for the shares,geiger told him he was unclear as to who the seller was or who the check was to be made out to.kirby therefore left the payee line on his check blank.geiger later filled in the line,making the check payable to erickson.in short order,kirby resold the shares to the public for.
that the shares kirby sold were unregistered did not necessarily render the transaction unlawful.the securities act focuses primarily on initial offerings,rather than on secondary transactions among members of the public.see thomas lee hazen,the law of securities regulation ed blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d.section of the act thus exempts from registration transactions by any person other than an issuer,underwriter,or dealer.the exemption did not apply,the commission decided,because kirby was an underwriter.kirby had the burden of proving otherwise.sec ralston purina.
section of the act defines underwriter as any person who has purchased from an issuer with a view to,or offers or sells for an issuer in connection with,the distribution of any security,or participates in any such undertaking.the term issuer includes not only the issuing company,but also any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the issuer.id.the statute does not define distribution.
kirby purchased the shares from a person controlling the issuer,and he intended to sell those shares to the public,as he did.his argument is that he was not an underwriter excluded from the exemption because his sale was not a distribution within the meaning of.the sale was not a distribution,he claims,because he sold only percent of golden eagle more than million shares.according to kirby,a sale qualifies as a distribution only if it involves a substantial or significant percentage of the issuer outstanding shares.
registration of securities protects investors by promoting full disclosure of information thought necessary to informed investment decisions.ralston purina,at.at.to the purchaser of securities,the potential loss and the need for disclosure is the same regardless whether the securities represent one percent,five percent,or ten percent of the outstanding shares.the applicability of the exemption turns not on the percentage of shares involved,but on whether the particular class of persons affected need the protection of the act.id.at.at.in ralston purina,the supreme court relied on this reasoning to reject the notion that the term public offering,as used in another exemption to the registration requirement,contemplated any particular quantity of stock.the same reasoning applies to distributions under.every court to consider this question has so ruled.ackerberg johnson,cir sec dolnick,cir quinn sec,cir gilligan,will sec,cir.
in arguing to the contrary,kirby cites two opinions supposedly supporting the idea that distributions must involve a substantial percentage of the outstanding shares.the first case,pennaluna sec,cir,actually hurts rather than helps him.the pennaluna court upheld the commission finding of a violation on the basis of sales that amounted to a mere percent of the outstanding shares.at.the second opinion,sec american beryllium oil,discussed the meaning of a regulation,not the term distribution in.at.
kirby alternative argument is that even if the sale violated a of the act,he did not violate c,which makes it unlawful for any person to offer to sell any unregistered security.c.according to kirby,he did not offer to sell the hunsaker shares,but merely accepted outstanding offers from market makers to buy golden eagle shares at a particular price the argument fails under common law price quotations are commonly understood as inviting an offer rather than making one.restatement second of contracts cmt.c.it fails as well under the securities act,which is what governed the legality of kirby conduct.as used in,the term offer to sell shall include every attempt or offer to dispose of,or solicitation of an offer to buy,a security or interest in a security,for value.there is no doubt that kirby sale of the shares constituted an attempt to dispose of them.
substantial evidence supports the commission finding that kirby conduct was willful.true,there is no evidence kirby actually knew the shares were controlled by a statutory issuer.the share certificate bore no restrictive legend,and geiger assured kirby that the shares were.kirby problem is that he failed to inquire sufficiently into the circumstances of the transaction.wonsover sec,citing distribution by of unregistered securities,securities act rel,wl.w hen a dealer is offered a substantial block of a security,either by persons who appear reluctant to disclose exactly where the securities came from,or where the surrounding circumstances raise a question whether or not the ostensible sellers may be merely intermediaries for controlling persons or statutory underwriters,then searching inquiry is called for.id.even if,as kirby argues,this sale was not substantial,all the other warning signs were present.golden eagle was and lightly traded,and geiger was reluctant to disclose the true party in interest.if kirby had simply insisted on knowing the identity of the seller,he would have uncovered the illegal nature of the transaction.by giving geiger a blank check,kirby abandoned even the pretense of due diligence.
b.the transaction 
in december,knittle approached geiger again,hoping to dispose of the remaining hunsaker shares.geiger offered the shares to his client alfred peeper.peeper agreed to buy the stock on behalf of lasalle investment,an irish corporation whose trading he controlled.the terms of the deal were extremely favorable to lasalle it would buy the shares at a substantial discount,even less
