in this case,the securities and exchange commission obtained a judgment against arnold johns,for,which represented the profits he reaped from insider trading in the shares of vista.johns appeals the judgment,contending that the procedure the district court employed in determining the profits he should disgorge denied him due process.we agree and therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
johns was president and a director of vista,vista,a delaware corporation based in roswell,georgia,from february to the summer of vista designed and sold a variety of consumer safety products,including trigger guards for firearms and radon and carbon monoxide detectors for homes.when johns joined the company,vista was a public company,having completed an initial public offering in october.johns answered to richard smyth,vista ceo and the officer primarily responsible for the company operations.
johns signed on with a starting annual salary of,and he received options to purchase vista to an exercise price of per share.as president,johns acquired a wealth of material and adverse inside information about the company,and he ultimately exercised some of his options and sold the resulting shares of stock before any of this information became public.
almost immediately after coming to vista,johns was called upon to perform functions in the role of chief financial officer.specifically,smyth charged him with signing and filing the quarterly form for the period ending march,although vista hired michael becker in june to take over its financial reporting duties,johns also signed and filed the for the period ending june.both quarterly forms had been prepared by other employees at vista and contained materially incorrect information due to the method used to calculate quarterly earnings and shares outstanding.johns felt that the content of the june was misleading and expressed his concern to smyth,telling him that he would not sign the document.smyth instructed him to sign it,and johns relented,and he signed and filed the.
in may and august,vista issued press releases indicating that it had acquired alabaster.the may release stated that the product lines of the two companies had already been integrated the august release gave an effective acquisition date of june.both of these statements were false.johns confronted smyth,insisting that the press releases were inaccurate,but the misstatements stood uncorrected.
in december,steven cunningham,vista outside counsel,advised becker that the company would have to be restated because of the improper method vista had employed in computing earnings per share.becker went to smyth,and smyth disregarded cunningham advice.the were not amended.later that month,johns contacted cunningham to discuss the possibility of exercising his options.on december,johns exercised some of his options in a cashless exercise.around the same time,vista new controller,mary beth warwick,told johns that the company books were not in order.
on february,cunningham sent a letter to johns and smyth reiterating his concerns about the company for the periods ending march,june,and september,and instructing them to tell the officers and directors not to sell any vista securities until the misstatements in the had been cured.two days later,johns exercised additional options he sold stock the exercises had yielded at various times over the remaining days of the month.altogether,the sales yielded nearly.at johns selling points,vista stock was trading at prices ranging from to a share.
on march,cunningham resigned as vista counsel,citing the company continued refusal to follow his advice on the conduct of its affairs.on march,vista issued a press release indicating that it would be amending its and other filings to reflect a net loss of for on march,vista stock was trading at a share.the next day,on a volume nearly five times that of march,the stock declined percent in value to close at a share.
on april,vista issued another press release stating that smyth had resigned and that its audit committee had found material accounting and financial improprieties that the company will have to remedy through the issuance of restated financials for several historical periods.the stock,which had been in a steady decline since the march press release,declined further,sliding to a share by april.
at some point during,the securities and exchange commission sec launched an investigation into vista financial affairs.its investigation culminated in this lawsuit,which the sec brought against johns,smyth,and two other vista officers on may,
in its complaint,the sec alleged that johns violated various provisions of the securities act and the securities exchange act,and rules promulgated thereunder,and engaged in insider trading while an officer at vista as remedies,the sec sought a permanent injunction barring johns from further violation of the securities laws and the disgorgement of his profits.johns,in his answer,denied liability and asserted several affirmative defenses,none of which is relevant here following some discovery,johns and the sec entered into a stipulation under which johns withdrew his answer to the extent that it denied liability and consented to the issuance of a permanent injunction.the stipulation reserved for further proceedings the amount of the profits johns would disgorge that is,johns reserved the right to litigate the amount of the disgorgement and prejudgment interest the parties attached to the stipulation the order of permanent injunction they would present to the district court.
on october,the district court entered the order of permanent injunction hereafter consent decree or decree.the consent decree contains sweeping injunctive provisions,each of which enjoins johns,his agents,servants,employees and attorneys,and those persons in active concert or participation with him who receive actual notice of this order of permanent injunction from disobeying one or more of the securities laws cited in the sec complaint regarding the sec claim for disgorgement and prejudgment interest,the decree replicates the stipulation by providing that the claim would be resolved upon motion of the sec commissioner at a later date.
on july,the sec moved the district court to determine the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest and to enter final judgment against johns.the motion asserted that the sec was entitled to disgorgement in the sum of.the sec arrived at this amount by calculating the losses johns avoided,using the april,value of the stock a the baseline,and reasoning that by that date the market had absorbed the negative information announced by vista on april using this disgorgement amount,the sec claimed that in prejudgment interest was also due.
johns opposed the sec motion.treating it as a motion for summary judgment,johns argued that the motion should be denied since material issues of fact concerning the appropriate disgorgement figure remained to be litigated.although he had admitted facts sufficient to make out a case for disgorgement,he had not stipulated to any specific amount due,and thus the calculation of the amount of losses avoided,if any,we re in material dispute.johns concluded his opposition to the sec motion by stating that the court must consider the unrelated events,not even addressed by the sec,that led to the sharp decline in vista stock price of approximately percent between the time of his last transaction in february and the public announcement of april.according to his formula,johns avoided losses of only.he also contended that he was entitled to offset any amount owed by,the cost of the exercise of the options at issue in the case.thus,if his position prevailed,he would owe nothing in avoided losses.johns formally moved the court to hold an evidentiary hearing to establish the facts essential to his unrelated events legal argument.he also informed the court that he was still waiting to depose one of the sec key witnesses.
the district court denied johns request for an evidentiary hearing on the grounds that he failed to detail the unrelated events that led to the decline in the price of vista shares,and the position he espoused had no support in the law.the legal effect of the court ruling was that the sec submission was unassailable the sec need only establish a reasonable approximation of losses johns avoided,and,in the court view,its submission did that.the court therefore entered judgment against johns in the sums the sec requested in disgorgement and in prejudgment interest.johns now appeals.because johns withdrew his answer to the complaint allegations of liability and consented to the entry of a permanent injunction barring him from further disobedience of the securities laws,this appeal presents only one issue whether the district court should have granted his request for an evidentiary hearing.
in appealing the district court refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve the disgorgement issue,johns is actually challenging the manner in which the district court chose to resolve that issue.we therefore review the court failure to convene an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion.cliff payco am.credits,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when,in reaching a decision,it applies an incorrect legal standard,follows improper procedures in making the determination,or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.martin automobili lamborghini exclusive,cir.
johns contends that the sec motion for the entry of a judgment of disgorgement and prejudgment interest was actually a motion for summary judgment,and that the court should have denied it because the amount he should have been required to disgorge was in dispute.the sec,responding,says that its motion was not a motion for summary judgment,filed pursuant to,motion but simply a motion for judgment.the sec points us to nothing in the rules of civil procedure,however,that would authorize such a motion.the district court nonetheless accepted the motion as if authorized in effect,the court minted a new rule.the court did so notwithstanding precedent that holds that district courts may not promulgate an ad hoc procedural code whenever compliance with the rules proves inconvenient.med.ass of health,educ.welfare,cir 
the rules of civil procedure provide guidance for the district court handling of the sec motion for judgment in the form of rule rule b permits entry of judgment by the clerk without any hearing when the plaintiff claim against a defendant is for a sum certain or for a sum which can by computation be made certain.in this case,however,the disgorgement and prejudgment interest sums are contested and,as the district court acknowledged,even the sec formula for determining those sums represents only a reasonable approximation of the losses avoided by johns.in other words,this case involves neither a sum certain nor a sum that could be made certain by computation.
rule b,which covers all other cases,requires the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of losses avoided,adolph coors movement against racism and the klan,cir j udgment of default awarding cash damages could not properly be entered without a hearing unless the amount claimed is a liquidated sum or one capable of mathematical calculation.quoting united artists freeman,cir lowe,cir the federal rules of civil procedure make a clear distinction between the entry of default and the entry of a default judgment.the default is entered upon the defendant failure to plead or otherwise defend.a,but if an evidentiary hearing or other proceedings are necessary in order to determine what the judgment should provide,such as the amount of damages that the defaulting defendant must pay,those proceedings must be conducted before the judgment is entered.see rule b.
basic notions of due process underpin this requirement.as the supreme court noted in mullane central hanover bank trust,t he fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.quoting grannis ordean.we believe that the right to be heard is of little value unless the party has some point of reference in established procedural rules to guide his continued participation in the proceedings,particularly when final judgment looms.in this case,rule b required the evidentiary hearing that the district court did not grant.thus,the court abused its discretion when it granted the sec motion for judgment.
the sec argues that johns was not entitled to a hearing because district courts have discretion not to hear oral testimony on motions and that johns waived the right to a trial when he stipulated to the facts in the sec complaint for purposes of disgorgement johns consented to a procedure whereby the last remaining issues in the case were to be resolved by motion of the commission.the court properly denied the motion for a hearing,the sec continues,because johns motion stated only in vague terms what evidence he planned to elicit in the hearing and that he neither identified the factual issues,the expert witness or the topic,other than trading matters,nor did he specify what the expert would testify.the sec specifically disavows having sought judgment pursuant to the rules of civil procedure,noting that it moved in accordance with the stipulation and that its motion was governed by the standards applicable to motions generally,where,unlike in a summary judgment context,the district court may,when appropriate,resolve the disputed issues of fact on the papers.
we do not agree with the sec that johns agreed to a novel summary proceeding for the determination of disgorgement.the consent decree indicates that johns shall pay disgorgement and interest in amounts to be resolved upon motion of the commission at a later date.this language indicates a couple of things.first,it establishes that the amounts remain to be resolved,that resolution was still necessary at the time the stipulation was entered.second,it sets the context in which that resolution will take place upon motion of the commission at a later date.we do not read this to mean that the resolution will be exclusively by motion,but that the resolution will begin at a later date upon motion by the,at the instance of the sec.although we do not find this language ambiguous,any lingering ambiguity is laid to rest by other language in the consent decree,which expressly states that johns still contests the amount owed to the sec in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.
the sec is correct that a hearing is not always required in cases like this one.as we have explained,however,this was not a case where all essential evidence was already of record,and it did not present one of the limited circumstances under which the district court could properly exercise its discretion not to hold a hearing.a hearing was required.
the district court erred in granting the sec motion for judgment without an evidentiary hearing.the district court judgment is accordingly vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings 
so ordered.
