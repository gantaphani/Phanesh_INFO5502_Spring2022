holding itself out to the investing public as an energy company,basic energy and affiliated resources,bear was actually a ponzi scheme,paying earlier investors out of funds raised from subsequent investors.before the district court enjoined bear officers and agents on november,from soliciting any additional investments,bear had successfully bilked thousands of investors out of millions of dollars.in december,at the request of the securities and exchange commission sec,the district court appointed lewis mosburg,as conservator receiver and charged him with marshaling bear assets and devising a plan for the disgorgement of the proceeds to bear investors.in may the district court approved the preliminary distribution plan proposed by the receiver,and in september the district court finalized the distribution list and disgorgement plan.the present appeals involve bear investors challenges to the district court orders pursuant to this distribution plan.
in case,james brunackey argues that the district court erred in classifying him as an insubstantial marketer under the classification scheme established in the distribution plan.instead,brunackey argues that he should be classified as a nonmarketer,as someone who never received any commissions for selling bear securities.under the distribution plan,nonmarketers are entitled to receive a greater percentage of their net contributions than are marketers.brunackey was classified as an insubstantial marketer by the district court because bear records indicated that he had received a commission payment from bear.brunackey argues that this payment was actually a rebate and thus that he should be reclassified as a nonmarketer.he was unable,however,to present any evidence that the payment at issue was in fact a rebate thus,the district court finding of fact can not be said to have been clearly erroneous.for this reason,we affirm.
in case,bear investors hereinafter the escrow investors challenge the district court order treating a fleet bank escrow account as a bear asset,to be distributed with the rest of bear assets under the distribution plan.this escrow account was established with funds that the escrow investors advanced after the district court had enjoined bear and its officers and agents from further soliciting of funds.we affirm the district court order treating the escrow account as a bear asset.we conclude that the escrow investors were not denied due process and that the district court finding that the escrow account was a bear asset was supported by the evidence.
background 
brunackey,a bear investor,appeals the order classifying him as an insubstantial marketer.under the distribution plan devised by the receiver and approved by the district court,each bear investor is assigned an investment number,a net investor claim nic,and an adjusted nic anic.each investment is assigned an nic by subtracting any commission payments,interest payments,return of principal payments,or similar payments made by bear to that account from the aggregate investment.investors are then classified into one of four categories defendants,substantial marketers,insubstantial marketers,and nonmarketers.the anic for all defendants in the underlying sec action is set at zero.thus,defendants are not entitled to receive any percentage of their nics as part of the distribution plan.the anic for a substantial marketer defined as an investor who received more than in commissions is equal to his nic reduced by ninety percent.thus,substantial marketers are entitled to receive up to ten percent of their nics as part of the distribution plan.the anic for an insubstantial marketer defined as an investor who received commissions less than is equal to her nic reduced by fifty percent.thus,insubstantial marketers are entitled to receive up to half of their nics under the distribution plan.finally,nonmarketers nics are not reduced,and thus they are potentially entitled to receive their entire nics under the plan.
according to the preliminary investor list compiled by the receiver dated october,brunackey investments in bear totaled.joint appendix at.this appeal,however,involves only one of those investments,designated as by the receiver,worth.brunackey received a return on this investment of.thus,under the distribution plan,his nic for this investment is.for,brunackey was originally classified as a substantial marketer,because the bear records indicated that two separate commission payments had been made to brunackey on this account,one for and the other for.thus,his nic for was reduced by ninety percent,and brunackey was only entitled to receive up to ten percent of this investment approximately under the distribution plan.
proceeding pro se,brunackey objected to his classification as a substantial marketer,and the matter was referred to magistrate judge virginia morgan.at the hearing,held in october,brunackey persuaded judge morgan that the payment had been a rebate on an investment he had made.the payment from bear to brunackey was contemporaneous with his investment in a bear project and equaled four percent of that investment.given these facts,judge morgan determined that this payment had in fact been a rebate on that investment.brunackey was unable to present similar evidence regarding the payment,however.at the hearing,he unsuccessfully argued that he had not marketed any bear programs and that the court should place greater weight on his oral testimony than on the records of bear.on this point,judge morgan september,order states 
no evidence was presented that the payment was contemporaneous with any investment.the payment is shown on the bear check ledger as a commission,which is confirmed by the commission.the investors brunackey and other members of his family have not sustained the burden of proof that such payment should not be considered a commission.investor should be classified as an insubstantial marketer.
at.after the district court approved this order,brunackey filed a notice of appeal.
the escrow investors.
even after the bear principals had consented to the preliminary injunction on november,which enjoined them from raising further funds on behalf of bear,a number of individuals contributed approximately in an effort to maintain bear as a viable entity.this effort apparently involved an attempt by bear attorney bernard mcclorey and bear president michael schouman to secure a million dollar loan to make the defrauded bear investors whole.the current appeal involves the claims of of these individuals,the escrow investors.
the funds at issue were deposited in an escrow account in the fleet bank in massachusetts.this escrow account was subject to the terms of an escrow agreement,dated january,between larry smith,president of the boston group,the firm hired to find a lender for bear,and mcclorey and schouman,on behalf of bear.after thirty days,if an acceptable loan had not been secured for bear,the escrow agreement required that the in the escrow account be returned to mcclorey.in agreeing to forward these funds,the escrow investors had been promised that mcclorey would return their money if an acceptable loan had not been secured within thirty days in addition,mcclorey and schouman promised the escrow investors a return on their deposits with mcclorey.
not surprisingly,no acceptable loan was found in the period,and the escrow investors funds were never returned.the release of the funds required the approval of both mcclorey and smith,and,for some reason,smith failed to approve the release after the period had expired.mcclorey sued smith in michigan state court,seeking an order to smith to show cause for failing to approve the release of the funds.mcclorey state complaint was filed on april.
neither the receiver nor the district court were aware of these events until may,when an employee of the receiver opened a letter from fleet bank to mcclorey.all bear mail was at that time being forwarded to the receiver.the receiver quickly intervened in the state action,and in august the michigan state court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the escrow account because it consisted of bear funds,which were under the federal court jurisdiction.
in january,the receiver moved the district court for an order to transfer the escrow account to the receiver account for distribution to the bear investors.this issue was briefed by the parties,including the escrow investors,and a hearing on the transfer of the escrow account to the receiver was held before district judge gilmore on march.at this hearing,the escrow investors attorney,ralph musilli,argued that the escrow account was not a bear asset.musilli argued that the escrow investors were not,in fact,investors,but merely depositors who had put forward earnest money in an effort to secure a loan for bear.the district court rejected this account of the facts.on the issue of whether the escrow investors were in fact investors,the district judge emphasized that,under the terms of their agreement with mcclorey,the depositors were to receive interest on their deposits every thirty days.this weighed in favor of a finding that the escrow investors were in fact investing in bear rather than putting up earnest money on bear behalf.the district judge also questioned musilli about the motives of the escrow investors,most of whom had marketed bear programs in the past.in addition,the district judge apparently interpreted mcclorey failure to return the money to the investors after thirty days as evidence of yet another bear swindle.
on april,the district court issued the transfer order.the district court held that,as the term of the escrow agreement had lapsed,bear ha d absolute title,free of all claims to the.at transfer order.under the terms of the transfer order,the escrow investors were to be treated the same as any other bear investors thus,they would ultimately receive a distribution from bear total asset pool,if they were otherwise entitled to a distribution under the distribution plan.the district court created a separate procedure,however,for those escrow investors who could show that they were completely and totally innocent and had no knowledge of the sec litigation against bear and that they were not marketers for any bear programs.at.two investors attempted to meet this burden,but the district court subsequently found that both had been aware of the sec litigation at the time of their investments.a majority of the escrow investors,in fact,were classified as bear marketers under the distribution plan eventually adopted.
the escrow investors appealed the transfer order to the sixth circuit,but the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on november.at that time,this court held that the transfer order was not an appealable final judgment,an appealable interlocutory order,or an appealable collateral order.
on may,the district court issued another order involving the escrow account funds.the district court docket described this order as regarding establishment of preliminary procedure for determination of bear investor claim and for plan of initial distribution of disgorgement proceeds.at.this distribution order adopted the distribution plan proposed by the receiver.the distribution order also reiterated that the escrow investors would be treated in the same manner as all other bear investors,unless the escrow investors could demonstrate that they had been unaware of the sec litigation at the time of their investment.in addition,this distribution order established procedures for the referral of objections to magistrate judge morgan.the distribution order indicated that an initial distribution of would be made after the receiver had finalized the investor lists and after entry of a final order by the court.at.
despite its tentative nature,the receiver argues that this order,unlike the transfer order,was a final appealable order.the escrow investors did not appeal the distribution order,however.instead,the escrow investors returned to the district court in october,filing a motion for a hearing to argue for a revision of the transfer order and for certification under federal rule of civil procedure b.the escrow investors persisted in their argument that the escrow account was not a bear asset and thus that the district court had erred in approving the transfer order.at the motion hearing on march,magistrate judge morgan agreed with the receiver that the distribution order had been a final appealable order.judge morgan issued an order on march,denying the escrow investors motion.the escrow investors filed a notice of appeal of that order on april.
subsequently,the district court issued an order on september,approving the proposed final investor list and distribution of disgorgement proceedings.neither the escrow investors nor brunackey filed a notice of appeal of that order.
ii.analysis 
given the district court subsequent final distribution order,the appeals in the present case are timely.
the receiver argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider this case because the escrow investors failed to file a timely appeal of the final order in this case,which the receiver identifies as the may distribution order we conclude,however,that the may distribution plan was not a final appealable order.
a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.the may distribution order,however,left a number of matters to be resolved before the judgment,the distribution,could be executed.most importantly,the order did not include a final investor list,but instead established procedures for the referral of objections by investors.in this regard,the order clearly contemplated a subsequent final decision once all referrals are completed,the court shall receive a finalized investor list which shall constitute a final and binding determination of the investors and the amount of their claims for purposes of this proceeding.at emphasis added.similarly,the may order concludes with the following two sentences,which clearly indicate that the district judge did not treat the order as a final decision this order shall be sent to all investors or their attorneys who filed objections prior to the december,hearing.the final order shall be sent to all bear investors.at.moreover,the district court docket described the may order as regarding establishment of preliminary procedure for determination of bear investor claim and for plan of initial distribution of disgorgement proceeds.at.
the receiver argues,however,that the may distribution order was final with respect to the issue on appeal,the transfer of the escrow account into the receiver general account and the decision to treat the escrow investors as bear investors under the plan.the receiver cites united states christunas,cir,for the proposition that even a preliminary order can be a final,appealable order when that preliminary order terminates all issues presented with respect to a particular party and leaves nothing to be done except for the execution of the judgment with respect to that individual.in christunas,an individual convicted of drug charges filed an appeal in challenging a final order of criminal forfeiture.this appeal was filed almost two years after the preliminary forfeiture order had been issued.we determined that the preliminary forfeiture order had been final with respect to christunas in,although it had not been final with respect to claims to the seized properties until.id.at.as a result,we concluded that the appeal was untimely and thus the court lacked jurisdiction to review the forfeiture order.id.at.
the present case,however,presents facts very different from those in christunas.christunas involved a criminal forfeiture,a different,and,in many respects,much simpler,process than the complex disgorgement proceeding at issue in the present case.moreover,in christunas we relied heavily on a amendment to the federal rules of criminal procedure,which makes clear that a forfeiture order,whether preliminary or final as to claims,is a final order as to the defendant.id.at.there is no such clarifying rule in the context of disgorgement proceedings.most important,the may distribution plan was not final even with respect to the escrow investors,as it established a procedure by which individual escrow investors could remove themselves from the general pool by demonstrating that they were unaware of the ongoing sec litigation at the time of their investment in the escrow account.by contrast,the preliminary order in christunas had a more final effect the actual effect of a preliminary forfeiture order is clearly that of a final order as to the defendant.id.at.
thus,even though the receiver is incorrect in asserting that order was a final order,we would still lack jurisdiction if there has not yet been an appealable order in this case.we conclude,however,that the district court issued an appealable order in this case on september,after the present appeals were filed.the docket describes this order as approving amended proposed final list and distribution of disgorgement proceedings.
there is persuasive authority for the proposition that this september,order is an appealable collateral order.the fifth circuit addressed a factually similar case in sec forex asset management llc,cir.in that case,the sec brought an enforcement action against forex,which,like bear,had engaged in a scheme to defraud investors.forex assets were frozen and a receiver was appointed.see id.at.the forex receiver,like the receiver in the present case,marshaled the assets of the fraudulent entity and prepared a distribution plan.see id.at.two forex investors objected to the plan because it proposed to treat them in the same manner as all other forex investors for distribution purposes,even though of what they had invested in forex had been deposited in a separate account and was thus still traceable at the time forex assets were frozen.the forex district court considered the investors objections but denied relief thus,the at issue was added to the general pool,to be distributed to forex investors generally.see id.the district court subsequently approved the receiver plan,and the investors appealed.
the forex court considered two threshold issues before considering the merits of the investors appeal.first,the forex court determined that the investors had standing to appeal,even though they were not parties to the underlying sec enforcement action and had not sought to intervene below.see id.at.the litigants in the present case have not raised the issue of the movants standing to appeal the orders of the district court,but we raise this issue,sua sponte,because we are under an independent obligation to police our own jurisdiction.see baird norton,cir.we have held previously that a litigant has standing to appeal from an order entered in a federal receivership action if that litigant satisfies the standard for standing to appeal an order of a bankruptcy court.fidelity bank,ass group,cir.to appeal from an order of the bankruptcy court,appellants must have been directly and adversely affected pecuniarily by the order.this principle,also known as the person aggrieved doctrine,limits standing to persons with a financial stake in the bankruptcy court order.id.citations omitted.the litigants in the present case have standing to appeal under this standard,as they have a clear financial stake in the challenged orders.
second,the forex court determined that it had jurisdiction to hear the case because the district court approval of the distribution plan was an appealable collateral order.the collateral order doctrine,which was established in cohen beneficial industrial loan,authorizes appellate review of an order when it fall s in that small class of orders and decisions which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.id.at.the forex court went on to discuss the three requirements that an order must satisfy to fall within the collateral order rule,as established in coopers lybrand livesay,d t he order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.the district court distribution plan,the forex court reasoned,conclusively determine d the manner in which the receivership assets should be distributed.forex,at.next,the forex court concluded that the distribution of the assets was separate from the merits of the sec complaint against forex.id.finally,the distribution plan would be unreviewable on final appeal because the assets from the receivership will be distributed,and likely unrecoverable,long before the action brought by the sec is subject to appellate review.id.
the eleventh circuit opinion in sec elliott,cir,rev in part,cir,suggests a similar approach.as with forex,the underlying facts of elliott are similar to those in the present case.the elliott defendants had conducted an enormous ponzi scheme and defrauded hundreds of investors.id.at.as in the present case,elliott involved a disgorgement proceeding conducted by a district court,sitting in equity,with the assistance of an receiver.elliott does not address the basis of the court jurisdiction,but it is noteworthy that the elliott claimants appealed only after the district court had issued an order establishing final plan for distribution of assets.id.at.the elliott final plan differed from the may distribution plan at issue in this case in more than name,however.the elliott distribution plan was issued only after the claimants objections had been heard by the court,rather than before,as in the present case,and included findings addressing objections.along these lines,the elliott court noted just how few appeals it had to decide 
one thousand eight hundred and ninety claims were filed by one thousand claimants.this was not an easy receivership to administer 
in this context,the receiver and subsequently the district court were called upon to distribute the remains of elliott assets.in the end,of the many claimants,only claimants appealed on ten issues,of which we reverse four.
neither the escrow investors nor brunackey has filed a notice of appeal from the district court september,order.forex suggests that we have jurisdiction to hear appeals of that order by the escrow investors,and brunackey,under the collateral order doctrine.however,brunackey and the escrow investors filed their notices of appeal prior to the issuance of that order,and neither has filed a second notice of appeal.this court has held,nonetheless,that an appeal should not be dismissed because it was technically premature if in fact an appealable judgment or order was rendered below,the appellant clearly manifested his intent to appeal from it and the prevailing party below can show no prejudice resulting from the prematurity of the notice.jackson tva,cir quoting moore,moore federal practice,at ed see also gillis dep t of health and human,cir holding that an interlocutory appeal lacking rule b certification invokes appellate jurisdiction when judgment becomes final prior to disposition of the appeal,even where a second notice of appeal has not been filed.
we hold that we have jurisdiction to hear the present case.an appealable order has been issued by the district court.brunackey and the escrow investors have clearly manifested an intention to appeal the orders in question,as those orders are embodied in the district court final investor list.moreover,the receiver can show no prejudice from having to address these appeals.thus,the premature filing of the appellants notices of appeal does not deprive this court of jurisdiction in the present case.
this conclusion is consistent with this court previous order rejecting the escrow investors appeal of the transfer order.under the reasoning offered supra,the transfer order was neither a final order nor an appealable collateral order.given the equitable powers of the district court in receivership proceedings,the district court could have,at any time between issuing the transfer order and its final plan,determined to treat the escrow investors differently.the final distribution plan,however,was an appealable collateral order because it conclu
