several shell shareholders sued sir philip watts,a former shell executive,and alleged that he committed securities fraud.during discovery,which is still ongoing,watts served testimonial subpoenas under federal rule of civil procedure on three securities and exchange commission employees.watts thinks their testimony might help his defense.the sec did not permit the three employees to testify,contending that their testimony would cover privileged matters and be unduly burdensome.watts has sought review of the sec in the district court,but directly in this court.he has invoked the statute providing for direct court of appeals review of sec orders.see a see also id.a.
we lack jurisdiction to reach the merits instead,watts challenge must be decided by the district court in the first instance.as the consistent practice of courts and agencies reflects,an agency determination not to comply with a subpoena in an ongoing civil suit is simply an agency ordinary litigation decision,not an order that a court of appeals has separate jurisdiction to directly review.disputes over subpoenas to agencies in civil litigation therefore must commence in the district court under rule.we transfer this case to the united states district court for the district of columbia.see.
in march,sir philip watts resigned as the chairman of the committee of managing directors at the corporate predecessor of royal dutch shell.shell disclosed in a series of announcements during that it had incorrectly categorized as proved oil and gas reserves certain quantities of the reserves it had previously reported in its financial statements.shell those quantities,reducing the dollar value of shell proved reserves for several fiscal years.
in august,the sec settled a proceeding with shell.see in re royal dutch petroleum,exchange act release.the agency issued related findings which shell neither admitted nor denied that shell overstatement of proved reserves,and its delay in correcting the overstatement,stemmed in part from shell failure to comply with the standards of rule of sec regulation.see release,at.under rule,companies that issue federally registered securities must disclose the value of their oil and gas reserves,and they may report as proved reserves only those oil and gas quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years.a.
in describing the requirements of rule that shell allegedly failed to satisfy,the sec order repeatedly referred to informal agency guidance concerning the rule.see release,at.the sec staff had published that guidance on its website in and.employees of the sec division of corporate finance had discussed that guidance with numerous oil and gas companies,including shell.the sec employees involved in those discussions included roger schwall,an assistant director at the division,and two of his subordinates,ronald winfrey and james murphy.
following the sec proceeding,shell shareholders sued several persons,including watts.in that is still ongoing in the united states district court for the district of new shareholders alleged that the defendants had engaged in securities fraud by not earlier disclosing the overstatement in proved reserves.the shareholders complaint referenced the sec informal guidance about rule and the sec order.
in february,watts served four testimonial subpoenas under the authority of the united states district court for the district of columbia.see.he directed one subpoena to the sec.a government agency can designate a knowledgeable person to give a deposition on the agency behalf.see.b.watts also directed subpoenas to schwall,winfrey,and individual sec employees involved in administering rule.
the testimonial subpoenas sought depositions on two general topics i the development,interpretation,and application of the terms proved oil and gas reserves,reasonable certainty,and reasonable doubt,as used in rule and the guidance and ii communications between the sec and oil and gas companies concerning rule and the related guidance.watts emphasized that the depositions would support his defense in the shareholder litigation.he argued that the informal guidance and sec staff contacts with shell and other companies improperly tightened the substantive standard of rule,and that shell reserves stemmed from that regulatory crackdown,not from any fraud.
in an april letter to watts,the sec general counsel stated that the sec objected to the depositions and would not comply with the subpoenas.the general counsel asserted that the deliberative process privilege shielded the information watts sought,and that a deposition of the sec rule b designee would be unduly burdensome.citing agency regulations,see b,the general counsel also stated that the sec would not authorize the three individual employees to give depositions because of the deliberative process privilege.
watts sought to contest the general counsel determinations along two routes in may.first,regarding the subpoena directed to the sec,he filed a motion to compel in the district court for the district of columbia.the district court has stayed that proceeding.
second,regarding the subpoenas directed to the three sec employees,watts initially sought commission review of the general counsel action.the sec denied watts petition,amplifying the general counsel deliberative process argument and adding that allowing staff to appear for testimony would place an undue burden on the commission.in re royal transp.sec,exchange act release,at.watts then filed a petition in this court for judicial review of the sec action with respect to the subpoenas to the three sec employees.watts pointed to section of the securities exchange act of as the source of our jurisdiction.see a.
limits on jurisdiction keep the federal courts within the bounds the constitution and congress have prescribed,and those limits must be policed by the courts on their own initiative.ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d.in this case,we therefore must address an issue not presented to us by the parties whether watts petition for review of the sec privilege and undue burden assertions belongs in this court at this time.
congress is free to choose the court in which judicial review of agency decisions may occur.five flags pipe line dep t of,internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.because district courts have general federal question jurisdiction under,the normal default rule is that persons seeking review of agency action go first to district court rather than to a court of appeals.int l of teamsters pena.initial review occurs at the appellate level only when a statute specifically gives the court of appeals jurisdiction to directly review agency action.accord midwest indep.transmission.operator,ferc.
the sec is subject to such a statute for judicial review of sec orders.section of the securities exchange act of provides a person aggrieved by a final order of the commission entered pursuant to this chapter may obtain review of the order in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business,or for the district of columbia circuit a emphasis added.section of the securities act of similarly provides any person aggrieved by an order of the commission may obtain a review of such order in the court of appeals of the united states,within any circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business,or in this court.a emphasis added.
this case hinges on interpretation of the term order used in section of the securities act and section of the exchange act.neither the securities act nor the exchange act defines the term.we therefore look to the administrative procedure act,as we have done before when an agency statute did not define order.see apcc,sprint communications,looking to apa when interpreting order in,c.the apa provides that an order is the whole or a part of a final disposition,whether affirmative,negative,injunctive,or declaratory in form,of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.int l.local,int l of workers,d w hen congress defined order in terms of a final disposition,it
