background 
the howard gunty profit sharing plan the plan commenced this action in on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated,against bank plus corporation,its chief executive officer,and its chief financial officer.the original complaint charged negligent misrepresentation,fraud,deceit under civil code sections and,and unlawful market manipulation activity under corporations code sections and 
in march,the plan brought a motion to be appointed lead plaintiff of the class,and for certification of the class only as to the fourth cause of action,alleging violations of corporations code sections and.on may,the trial court found that the plan was a professional plaintiff,that it was not typical of the class,did not have sufficient knowledge of the facts of the case or involvement in it,and was not,therefore,an adequate class representative the court refused to appoint the plan as lead plaintiff,and continued the certification motion to an unspecified date.
on june,gary feldman sought leave to intervene in the action.the trial court denied the motion after finding feldman claims under corporations code section the matter was set for a status conference on july.at the status conference,plaintiffs were still without a candidate for lead plaintiff,and sought leave to notify the class of their need for alternative class representatives.the court allowed plaintiffs to submit a draft of the proposed communication.the court proposed its own form of notice.defendants then proposed to send a letter in response to plaintiffs,and the court proposed its own form of response 
in a series of hearings,the court heard extensive argument for and against the wording of the letters,as well as testimony regarding the accuracy of statements made in them.the court heard and made suggested changes to language which it considered to be slanted,misleading,or inflammatory,and the parties eventually arrived at language approved by the court.
plaintiffs and defendants then filed separate petitions for writ of mandate.plaintiffs petition asks that we set aside the trial court imposed edits of its letter seeking a new class representative,and its order authorizing defendants to contact putative class members in response to the letter.defendants seek to prohibit plaintiffs from any solicitation of a new representative by mass mailing or,in the alternative,to eliminate from plaintiff letter any reference to compensation,a boldface reference to loss of rights,and a boldface reference to a deadline and if plaintiffs letter is to be permitted,defendants ask that its responsive letter not be edited in any way,unless it is found to be materially inaccurate or incomplete 
we consolidated the petitions and issued an order to show cause on december,
discussion 
each party contends that the trial court should not have permitted the other to communicate with the potential class members under the circumstances presented here.thus,defendants contend that plaintiffs should not be permitted to send a letter soliciting a new class representative,and plaintiffs contend that defendants should not be permitted to send a letter urging potential class members not to participate.
plaintiffs and defendants both acknowledge that there is scant california authority regarding communication with potential class members prior to certification.plaintiffs contend that their communication with the potential class members is constitutionally protected by the first amendment,as commercial speech,so long as it is not false,misleading,or deceptive.see shapero kentucky bar,d.
defendants contend that plaintiffs proposed communication is improper solicitation,which should not be condoned by the court,because plaintiffs initiated this action with a professional plaintiff whose credibility is questionable,under circumstances which make it apparent that the attorneys are in charge of the litigation,not a genuine plaintiff.
to put the issues into perspective,we must begin,not with contentions regarding limitations on speech,but by examining plaintiffs motion to certify the class,and to approve the plan as lead plaintiff,which was heard several months before the hearings on the proposed communications.
to obtain class certification,the proponents of a consumer class action have the burden to prove not only that there are questions of law or fact common to the class,and that the claims or defenses of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,they must also prove that the representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.richmond dart industries,cal d,subd.b.after hearing the parties argument and evidence in the form of declarations and excerpts from depositions,the trial court found that there were common questions of law or fact.however,the court found the plan to be atypical of the class,and that it would not fairly or adequately protect its interests,and denied the plan motion for appointment as lead plaintiff.it did not,however,deny the motion for class certification.instead,the court continued it indefinitely to give plaintiffs the opportunity to find a suitable representative.
in its written order,the court made extensive findings.it found that the plan was a professional plaintiff,having filed approximately lawsuits alleging fraud and mismanagement in securities or derivative actions,and represented in substantially all of them by its attorneys in this action,stull,stull brody,with the assistance in some of them by weiss yourman,also counsel in this action.the court also found the plan,acting through its administrator,caesar,to be an inadequate representative,because caesar demonstrated inadequate knowledge about the case,and his credibility was weak.the court concluded,it is clear to this court that the attorneys,rather than the plan,are in control of this litigation.
as a general proposition,class actions are favored in california.city of san jose superior court cal d,see also,vasquez superior court cal d.federal law also favors class actions.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure expresses a policy in favor of having litigation in which common interests,or common questions of law or fact prevail,disposed of where feasible in a single lawsuit.citation.gulf oil bernard,fn,d.in furtherance of the policy favoring class actions,courts have allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaints to redefine the class,or to add new individual plaintiffs,or both,in order to establish a suitable representative,when the named plaintiff has been found inadequate.see,la sala american sav.loan cal d.for example,plaintiffs are permitted to conduct discovery to find a suitable representative see,budget finance plan superior court d.and they are permitted precertification communication with potential class members for the purpose of investigation and preparation of their claims or defenses.see,atari,superior court d.
