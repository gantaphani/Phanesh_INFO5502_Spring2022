we grant the respondents motion for rehearing.we withdraw our opinion dated october,and substitute the following in its place.
in this case we are called upon to construe an employee incentive plan and related stock option certificates.we must determine whether termination of employment occurred within the meaning of the incentive plan when the parent company sold all the stock of its subsidiary to another company and the employees continued to work for the subsidiary.the trial court granted summary judgment for the parent company on all claims,which consisted of breach of contract,conversion,and fraud.the court of appeals reversed and remanded all claims to the trial court,concluding that no termination of employment had occurred.we hold that the incentive plan and stock option certificates are unambiguous and that a termination of employment occurred within the meaning of those agreements.we do not consider the conversion or fraud claims because monsanto only briefed matters pertaining to the breach of contract claim in this court.we therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals,render judgment for monsanto company on the breach of contract claim,and remand the conversion and fraud claims to the court of appeals.
fisher controls international,was a subsidiary of monsanto company.monsanto granted fisher employees options to purchase monsanto stock under a management incentive plan as compensation for past performance and as an incentive to remain with the monsanto family of companies and contribute to those companies value and growth.monsanto instituted three incentive plans while fisher was its subsidiary the monsanto management incentive plan of,the monsanto management incentive plan of,and the monsanto management incentive plan of.the provisions at issue in each plan are essentially identical,and for purposes of this litigation,the parties have referred to them collectively as the management incentive plan.the employee stock options were governed by both the management incentive plan the plan and by the terms and conditions printed on the back of the stock option certificates option certificates issued under it.the option certificates expired ten years from the date they were granted or upon termination of employment,whichever occurred first.the option certificates say that termination of employment is defined by reference to the plan.the plan in turn defines termination of employment as the discontinuance of employment of a participant for any reason other than a transfer.the specific times within which options could be exercised after termination of employment were set forth in the option certificates and varied,depending on the reason for termination.
the options at issue were granted in february in each of the years,and.in october,monsanto sold all its stock in fisher to emerson electric company.the fisher employees retained their positions with fisher.monsanto executive compensation and development committee the compensation committee,whom the plan vested with the authority to administer and interpret the plan,determined that the sale of fisher constituted a termination of employment for purposes of exercising the monsanto stock options.the compensation committee concluded that a provision in the option certificates requiring options to be exercised within three months after termination of employment by monsanto and a subsidiary applied to the fisher employees,and option certificates.the committee further concluded that the option certificates expired by their own terms because they could not be exercised until at least one year had passed after the date they were granted.less than a year had passed between the date these certificates were granted in february and the sale of fisher stock in october.
however,the market price of monsanto stock was lower than the price at which the and stock options could be exercised,which meant that the employees could not profitably exercise those options within the window.the compensation committee decided to extend the time for fisher employees to exercise those options an additional nine months,until september.consequently,the employees were given one year after monsanto sold fisher to exercise their and stock options.none of the fisher employees contested the compensation committee determinations at that time.monsanto stock price rose above the and option prices within that window,and fisher employees had the opportunity to profitably exercise all of those options.some did so.
the fisher employees options had prices ranging from per share for the options to per share for the options.during the year after monsanto sold fisher,monsanto stock price reached a high of.monsanto stock thereafter continued to increase in value.by,four years after the sale of fisher,monsanto stock had reached per share.it was then that a number of fisher employees attempted to exercise options to purchase monsanto stock.monsanto maintained that the options had expired and refused to honor them.in response,fisher employees sued monsanto for breach of contract,conversion,and fraud,alleging that the sale of fisher was not a termination of employment and that monsanto decision to eliminate or shorten the period within which fisher employees contended that they could exercise their options was wrongful.
monsanto moved for summary judgment,arguing primarily that the plan and the option certificates were unambiguous,and that the sale of fisher was a termination of employment within the meaning of those agreements and delaware statute of limitations should apply to preclude all the employees causes of action.
the trial court granted monsanto motion for summary judgment as to all the employees claims without stating the grounds for its decision.the court of appeals reversed,holding that no termination of employment had occurred.at.it reasoned that the employees had continuously been employed by fisher,and that monsanto could have included a provision if it had intended for the sale of a subsidiary to constitute termination of employment.id.emphasis in original.the court of appeals also held that texas statute of limitations applied,and it remanded all the employees claims to the trial court.id.
we hold that the sale of fisher constituted a termination of employment within the meaning of the plan and option certificates.we accordingly reverse the court of appeals judgment with respect to the breach of contract claim and render judgment for monsanto on that cause of action.the merits of the conversion and fraud claims are not before this court.monsanto did argue that we should adopt section of the restatement second of conflict of laws and apply delaware statute of limitations rather than texas statute.but monsanto did not brief in this court the substance of delaware statute of limitations and whether it would bar conversion or fraud claims.we therefore do not consider whether delaware,as distinguished from texas,statute of limitations should apply.
delaware law does govern our construction of the plan and the option certificates.both the plan and the option certificates provide that delaware law applies,and all parties concur in their briefing in this court that delaware law governs the interpretation of these agreements.we apply the law of the jurisdiction chosen by the parties if the particular issue is one that they could have resolved by explicit agreement.desantis wackenhut,citing restatement second of conflict of laws.we said in desantis that parties are free to choose what jurisdiction law will apply as long as that jurisdiction has a reasonable relationship to the contract and the parties agreement does not thwart or offend the public policy of the state the law of which ought otherwise to apply.id.at.we know of no public policy in texas that would be thwarted by allowing parties to agree to the terms and conditions under which stock options may be exercised or by allowing those parties to specify that delaware law governs the interpretation of such an agreement when the stock at issue is that of a delaware corporation.
delaware law sets forth familiar principles for construing written agreements.an agreemen
