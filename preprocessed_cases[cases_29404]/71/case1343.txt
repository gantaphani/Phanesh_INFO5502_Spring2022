plaintiff ymelda patrick appeals from a judgment of dismissal entered after the court sustained defendant alacer corporation alacer demurrer to her third amended complaint without leave to amend.plaintiff asserted shareholder derivative and direct causes of action against alacer and three individuals who sit on its board of directors and serve as trustees of the trust that is its sole record shareholder 
the court erred in sustaining alacer demurrer to the derivative causes of action.alacer is the real party in interest,and only a nominal defendant.it can not demur to a derivative complaint filed on its behalf,except on limited grounds such as the shareholder plaintiff lack of standing.and here,plaintiff has standing to assert the derivative claims.she alleges a community property interest in alacer stock,which,if true,renders her a beneficial shareholder of alacer.
but the court correctly sustained the demurrer to plaintiff direct cause of action for fraud.plaintiff alleged she voted for certain alacer board members in reliance on their misrepresentations.but plaintiff fails to allege causation,as her vote was unnecessary to the directors election.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
the following facts are alleged or implied by the third amended complaint complaint.schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,on demurrer,courts must assume the truth of the complaint properly pleaded or implied factual allegations.
the director defendants allegedly take control of alacer and loot it 
plaintiff and her late husband,james patrick,founded alacer in the to manufacture vitamin supplements.together,they created the vitamin supplement formulas,served as corporate officers,and financially supported alacer during their marriage.alacer flourished under their care,partly due to the popularity of its vitamin c supplement,attaining a market value of million or more.plaintiff alleges the increased value of alacer,over a fair return on her husband original investment,is community property.
plaintiff husband,the sole record owner of alacer stock,transferred all of the shares to the james patrick revocable trust the trust in.the trust is alacer only shareholder of record.the trust documents direct the trustees to distribute up to percent of the trust alacer stock to plaintiff upon her husband death to satisfy any community property interest she may have in alacer.
the trust trustees held a meeting in february,while plaintiff husband was deathly ill.there were five trustees at that time plaintiff,defendant ronald patrick,defendant james turner,defendant thaddeus smith the director defendants and vern peck.the director defendants sought to place themselves on alacer board of directors.the director defendants asked plaintiff to support their plan.they represented to plaintiff that they would only serve as interim directors,until they retained new management.they further represented to plaintiff they would accept compensation of only per meeting.in reliance on the director defendants representations,plaintiff voted to elect them to alacer board.the new board immediately elected themselves as corporate officers.plaintiff,who had already been serving as a corporate officer,was named of sales and marketing.
plaintiff husband died three weeks later.the trust continued to hold all of the alacer shares,without distributing any to plaintiff.
a month later,the director defendants called a board meeting.they ousted plaintiff from the meeting and voted to remove all of alacer officers,including plaintiff.the director defendants then themselves as corporate officers.
after firing plaintiff as an alacer,the director defendants terminated her salary and health insurance.they seized her furniture and personal possessions from her office.they cancelled her corporate credit cards and confiscated her company car.they also attempted to remove plaintiff from alacer board.
plaintiff alleges that once the director defendants assumed control of alacer,they began looting it.they stole money from it,took bloated salaries,sold corporate assets below market value for personal gain,failed to record transactions properly or at all,added friends and family to the company payroll and forgave loans they owed to alacer,rejected bona fide offers to buy alacer in favor of pursuing secret sale discussions,and disclosed alacer trade secrets to an entity owned by defendant patrick.the board allegedly ignored plaintiff repeated demands to investigate the misconduct and pursue litigation.
plaintiff complaint and alacer demurrer 
plaintiff alleges six causes of action in the complaint.the first cause of action is styled,conspiracy to defraud against all defendants,and is labeled a direct claim.plaintiff alleges she approved reconstituting the board due to director defendants misrepresentations about their intent to serve on an interim basis and accept a per meeting salary.
the second cause of action is styled,breach of fiduciary duties against all defendants,and is labeled derivative claims.plaintiff alleges the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties as alacer directors by mismanaging and basically looting alacer.
the third cause of action is styled,imposition of a constructive trust for embezzlement against all defendants.plaintiff seeks to impose a constructive trust in favor of alacer on any revenue generated by the improper sale of corporate assets,as well as a reasonable rate of return on alacer assets improperly used by the director defendants.
the fourth cause of action is styled,injunctive relief against all defendants.plaintiff seeks to enjoin the defendants and their agents from a approving salary increases for alacer officers,directors,or employees without court approval,b selling corporate assets outside the ordinary course of business without plaintiff consent,c hiring additional officers or consultants,d denying plaintiff access to corporate books and records,e using corporate funds to pay the director defendants attorney fees,f looting the corporation,g ignoring bona fide offers to buy alacer,and h taking any action impairing alacer property and business.
the fifth cause of action is styled,unfair business practices unfair competition,and is asserted against the director defendants.plaintiff alleges the director defendants sold alacer assets below cost,offered improper discounts by forgiving loans,and misappropriated alacer trade secrets.plaintiff seeks disgorgement of funds they wrongfully acquired.
the sixth cause of action is styled,declaratory relief against all defendants.plaintiff seeks a declaration that she has a community property interest in alacer.
alacer demurred to the complaint.in an overarching contention,alacer claimed plaintiff lacked standing to assert shareholder derivative causes of action.it also challenged the specific causes of action.it contended the conspiracy to defraud cause of action failed because plaintiff failed to allege causation or damages and had not clarified whether it was a direct or derivative claim.it also claimed it could not be held liable for conspiracy due to the agent immunity rule.alacer contended the constructive trust cause of action failed because it is a claim for relief,not a cause of action moreover,plaintiff did not specifically identify any wrongfully obtained funds in alacer possession.it claimed the injunctive relief cause of action failed because it too is a claim for relief also,courts can not enjoin corporate officers from lawfully exercising their powers.alacer contended the unlawful business practices cause of action failed because plaintiff had not sufficiently pleaded the underlying business practices,alleged the loss of money or property,or identified the misappropriated trade secret.finally,it claimed the declaratory relief cause of action exceeded the scope of plaintiff leave to amend the prior complaint and failed to join indispensable parties.
the court sustained the demurrer to all causes of action without leave to amend.it held plaintiff failed to state any of the purported causes of action.it further held all the causes of action except that for conspiracy to defraud violated the scope of amendment permitted by the court prior orders the order stated,to the extent plaintiff is again implicitly requesting the court to reconsider its previous rulings on the derivative standing issues that request is again denied for failure to satisfy any of the requirements of code of civil procedure section.
discussion 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation,and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded.citations.the court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.citation.however,it is error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.citation.and it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.
alacer can not demur to derivative causes of action asserted on its behalf 
alacer demurrer presents an interesting question not squarely addressed by california case law may a corporation file a demurrer opposing a shareholder derivative if so,on what grounds the parties filed supplemental briefs on this issue at our invitation.
the issue arises from the basic nature of a shareholder derivative action.the management of a corporation owes to the stockholders a duty to take proper steps to enforce all claims which the corporation may have.when it fails to perform this duty,the stockholders have a right to do so.jones ahmanson cal d,jones.the shareholders may bring a derivative suit to enforce the corporation rights and redress its injuries when the board of directors fails or refuses to do so.grosset wenaas cal th,d,grosset.
but the particular stockholder who brings the suit is merely a nominal party plaintiff.klopstock superior court cal d,klopstock.it is the corporation that is the ultimate beneficiary of such a derivative suit.ibid.thus,t he corporation is the real party plaintiff in the action.russell weyand d.
though the corporation is essentially the plaintiff in a derivative action,w hen a derivative suit is brought to litigate the rights of the corporation,the corporation must be joined as a nominal defendant.grosset,supra,cal th at,d.the corporation must be joined because its rights,not those of the nominal plaintiff,are to be litigated beyerbach juno oil cal d,beyerbach,and to offer the real defendants res judicata protection from later suits.gagnon,nevada desert inn cal d.naming the corporation a defendant,not a plaintiff,follows from the joinder rules if the consent of any one who should have been joined as plaintiff can not be obtained,he may be made a defendant.code civ.so although the corporation is made a defendant in a derivative suit,the corporation nevertheless is the real plaintiff jones,supra,cal d at.
the question now the corporation is the real plaintiff in a derivative action and the potential beneficiary of any recovery,how can it oppose the action a demurrer may be filed only by t he party against whom a complaint has been filed.the complaint in a derivative action is filed on the corporation behalf not against it.jones,supra,cal d at,beyerbach,supra,cal d at.it is only a nominal defendant.grosset,supra,cal th at,d.the only reason the corporation is named a nominal defendant is its refusal to join the action as a plaintiff.the corporation has traditionally been aligned as a defendant because it is in conflict with its stockholders over the advisability of bringing suit.note,federal of citizenship in derivative suit must be realigned as plaintiff when not dominated by individual defendants harv,note,harv.in a real sense,the only claim a shareholder plaintiff asserts against the nominal defendant corporation in a derivative action is the claim the corporation has failed to pursue the litigation.
the standing requirements for a derivative action reflect the limited adverse relationship between the shareholder plaintiff and the corporation.the shareholder plaintiff must allege it is a record or beneficial shareholder of the corporation,it presented the basis of the litigation to the corporation board,and it tried to secure from the board such action as plaintiff desires,subd.b.demand on the board will be excused only when plaintiff sufficiently alleges the demand would have been futile,subd.b shields singleton th,d.thus,for a plaintiff to have standing to file a derivative action,it must allege the corporation knew about the claim and was urged to pursue it to no avail or,in any event,the corporation would not have pursued the claim.
the narrow dispute between a shareholder plaintiff and the corporation also underlies the special litigation committee slc defense.the corporation in a derivative action may appoint a special litigation committee of independent directors to investigate the challenged transaction.desaigoudar meyercord th,d desaigoudar.if the slc reasonably determines that it is not in the best interests of the corporation to pursue the claims asserted in the derivative action,that decision is protected by the business judgment rule.finley superior court th,d finley.if the court then determines as a matter of fact the committee members were disinterested and they conducted an adequate investigation it must dismiss the derivative action.desaigoudar,supra,th at,d court reviews committee independence and the investigation adequacy,but does not review reasonableness of the slc decision.thus,for a shareholder plaintiff to take a derivative action to trial and prevail,it must be able to withstand the corporation objection that it legitimately does not want to pursue the litigation.
the conclusion follows that a nominal defendant corporation generally may not defend a derivative action filed on its behalf.the corporation may assert defenses contesting the plaintiff right or decision to bring suit,such as asserting the shareholder plaintiff lack of standing or the slc defense,subd.b desaigoudar,supra,th at,d.we need not now enumerate what other defenses a corporation may assert in a derivative action,if any.it suffices to hold the corporation has no ground to challenge the merits of a derivative claim filed on its behalf and from which it stands to benefit.
while california law on derivative actions supports this conclusion,other jurisdictions have explicitly constrained a corporation ability to challenge a derivative action see,swenson thibaut,swenson sobba elmen d,sobba rowen le mars mut.ins.of iowa iowa,rowen meyers smith,meyers accord note,harv.at in no case may the nominal defendant in a derivative action raise defenses of the real defendants note,defenses in shareholders derivative may raise them harv,the proper party to invoke a given defense should be the party whom the defense is designed to protect see also id.at the right of the corporation to defend,however,should be limited to those aspects of the case in which it is a real defendant.
in swenson,supra,the court thoroughly analyzed the issue.in that derivative action,shareholders alleged corporate officers and directors had breached their fiduciary duty to the corporation through a pattern of and negligent acquiescence amounting to a looting of the corporation assets.id.at.the individual defendants and the corporation moved to dismiss on several grounds the trial court denied the motions.id.at.on appeal,the court raised on its own motion a threshold question to what extent,if any,is a corporation entitled to defend itself against a derivative action when it is named as a party defendant it with california law a corporation is,beyond question,a necessary party to any litigation brought derivatively in its name,citation,and is customarily captioned a nominal defendant.however,as the action is brought in the right of the corporation and any recovery thereunder accrues to the benefit of the corporation and not to the nominal plaintiffs who bring the action derivatively,it is apparent that the interests of the corporation are not necessarily adverse to those of the plaintiffs and may be identical to them.id.at.
the swenson court found apparent the anomaly of a corporation,in whose name and right a derivative action is brought,being allowed to defend itself against itself.swenson,supra,at.the anomaly is particularly apparent,the court continued,where the alleged wrongdoers are in control of the corporation.ibid.thus,it readily concluded the corporation should not be allowed to defend this action on its merits,and portions of the corporation appeal will be dismissed for lack of standing.ibid.some defenses may be available to a corporation in unusual derivative actions,however.the shareholder plaintiff lack of standing to sue derivatively for reasons of insufficient representation of shareholders and a failure on its part to make a demand upon the board of directors are defenses peculiar to the corporation alone,and may be properly raised only by the nominal defendant who,for purposes of those matters,ceases to be a nominal defendant and becomes an actual party defendant.ibid.the corporation may be able to defend on the merits an action to enjoin the performance of a contract by the corporation,to appoint a receiver,to interfere with a corporate reorganization or to interfere with internal management where there is no allegation of fraud or bad faith,or other situations where the corporation has interests adverse to those of the nominal plaintiffs bringing the action derivatively.ibid.finally,the corporation may assert lack of personal jurisdiction,lack of subject matter jurisdiction,or improper venue.ibid.
accordingly,the swenson court held the corporation,except as noted above,may not defend itself against the derivative action on the merits and must limit its defenses,if any,to the pretrial matters proper to it.where a corporation seeks to extend its defenses beyond those areas in which it may properly conduct them,dismissal will lie against it.swenson,supra,at.
swenson limitation on a corporation ability to defend the merits of a derivative action brought on its behalf was recently adopted by another court.sobba,supra,d at.the sobba court struck the corporation answer in a derivative action because it asserted affirmative defenses on behalf of the individual defendants.id.at.to be sure,a corporation can dispute the plaintiff standing by filing an answer in a derivative action.a corporation may raise the defense that the stockholder failed to comply with the condition precedent of first calling on it to file suit,that it has already filed suit,that the corporation has already achieved a recovery,that the corporation has by final adjudication failed to recover,or other similar defenses.id.at.otherwise,the court held,the general rule for corporate participation in a derivative action is that u nless the derivative action threatens rather than advances corporate interests,the corporation can not participate in the defense on the merits.id.at predicting arkansas law.because the claims asserted and the relief sought in the derivative complaint would,if proven,advance rather than threaten the interests of the nominal defendants,the nominal defendants must remain neutral in this action.id.at.
the sobba court noted a practical and ethical reason why corporations should not defend derivative suits on the merits.allowing the nominal corporate defendants to defend on the merits in effect would allow the individual defendant to shift the cost of his defense of the derivative suit to the corporations against which he has allegedly committed tortious conduct the individual defendant using his control of the nominal defendants to get them to defend on the merits would shift the cost of his defense to the corporations even if the shareholder plaintiff claims are proven.sobba,supra,d at.
two state high courts have recognized corporations limited ability to contest derivative actions.the supreme court of iowa affirmed the dismissal of a corporation in a derivative action.rowen,supra,at.it held the corporation should take no active part in the controversy,merely awaiting the outcome and reaping the fruits of any judgment for plaintiffs.ibid.similarly,the supreme court of minnesota affirmed the striking of a corporation affirmative defenses in a derivative action.meyers,supra,at.it held the corporation is a nominal party only with no right to here step in and,by answer,attempt to defeat what is practically its own suit and causes of action.nor have the two individual defendants,in control thereof,any right to use the corporation for any such purpose or to impose on the corporation the burden of fighting their battle.id.at accord slutzker rieber ch eq,striking answer filed by nominal corporate defendant in derivative action t here is no occasion for the corporation to intermeddle in the controversy as the corporation is required to take and maintain a wholly neutral position,taking sides neither with the complaining shareholder nor with the defending director.
for these reasons,much of alacer demurrer to the derivative causes of action is misplaced.it challenges the constructive trust,injunctive relief,and unlawful business practice causes of action.but it stands to benefit from these claims.in the constructive trust cause of action,plaintiff alleges the director defendants wrongly used and sold corporate assets.in the injunctive relief cause of action,plaintiff seeks to enjoin the director defendants from squandering alacer assets in a variety of ways.in the unfair business practices cause of action,plaintiff alleges the director defendants sold alacer assets below cost and misappropriated alacer trade secrets.alacer has a substantial interest in recovering on these claims,should they be proven.
in contrast,alacer asserts in its demurrer only one viable interest in opposing these alleged lack of standing.it does not otherwise show any viable ground to oppose the derivative causes of action filed on its behalf.it does not maintain that it has already filed suit,that it has already achieved a recovery,or that it has by final adjudication failed to recover.sobba,supra,d at.nor has it alleged any legitimate interests adverse to those of the nominal plaintiffs bringing the action derivatively.swenson,supra,at.allowing alacer to demur to the derivative causes of action on grounds that the director defendants could assert for themselves if they chose,and did see patrick turner,supra,would allow the director defendants to shift the cost of their defense of the derivative suit to the corporation against which they have allegedly committed tortious conduct.sobba,supra,d at.the director defendants lack any right to use the corporation to impose on the corporation the burden of fighting their battle.meyers,supra,at.the court erred by entertaining,let alone sustaining,alacer demurrer on any ground other than lack of standing.
alacer counterarguments do not hold water.first,it observes that the corporation in a derivative action is the defendant to the extent that it has determined that pursuit of the lawsuit is not in its best interests.true.this is why the corporation can raise the shareholder plaintiff failure to present a demand to the board and assert the slc defense,subd.b desaigoudar,supra,th at,d.it does not authorize the corporation to otherwise challenge the derivative action brought on its behalf.
second,alacer cites california cases allowing the corporation to defend against derivative actions.but most of these cases involved the slc defense.desaigoudar,supra,th at,d finley,supra,th at,d will engebretson d.in another case,the court noted without comment that the corporation and the individual defendants had jointly demurred and moved for summary judgment.daly yessne th,d.there was no discussion whether the corporation had any right to assert the individual defendants defenses.c ases are not authority for propositions not considered therein.roberts city of palmdale cal th,d.
third,alacer relies upon cases invoking the exception that corporations may defend against derivative actions only when the suit threatens the corporation itself blish thompson automatic arms,noting the general rule to be that a corporation may defend a stockholder derivative action although theoretically any recovery rebounds to the benefit of the corporation if the corporate interests are threatened by the suit corporation could defend derivative action seeking to cancel shares weiland distilleries,corporation is indispensable party and must be served with notice of appeal from judgment in derivative action voiding defendant shares of corporation stock corey independent ice,corporation could defend itself against derivative action seeking to overturn corporate reorganization and threatening refund of stock sale proceeds godley crandall godley,ordinarily there will be no occasion to spend considerable sums of the corporation money to defend against a derivative action brought for its benefit corporation permissibly defended derivative action seeking to place it in receivership kirby schenck,denying plaintiff summary judgment motion in derivative action challenging corporation defense of officers and directors in a prior derivative action record on summary judgment did not disclose whether prior action so injuriously threatened or involved corporation own interests as to justify it in retaining and paying counsel to protect its interests national bankers life ins.adler,if the derivative action threatens rather than advances the corporate interests,the corporation may actually defend the action see also id.at if the court at an early stage of trial can not determine who is the actual plaintiff then the corporate defendant should be permitted to raise the venue matter and to answer.this exception may well exist under california law,or it may not.we need not decide this here,as alacer does not assert any viable basis for invoking such an exception.
finally,alacer worries about a hypothetical situation in which the corporation must sit idly by while a shareholder pursues a patently meritless derivative claim.but that is not our director defendants demurred to plaintiff complaint on similar grounds as alacer.moreover,alacer has not shown what harm the corporation would incur in the hypothetical case.if the corporation opposes the action for any legitimate business reason,its disinterested directors may assert the slc defense.desaigoudar,supra,th at,d finley,supra,th at,d.and if the corporation chooses not to assert the slc defense,no substantial harm appears to befall the corporation from merely awaiting the outcome and reaping the fruits of any judgment for plaintiffs.rowen,supra,at.other than contesting plaintiff standing,this is exactly what alacer should do here.
plaintiff has standing as a beneficial shareholder to assert the derivative claims 
we turn now to the one cognizable ground for alacer demurrer to the derivative causes of action plaintiff alleged lack of standing.to have standing,plaintiff must allege she was a shareholder,of record or beneficially at the time of the relevant transaction,subd.b,and made demand upon the board,subd.b.alacer first contends plaintiff did not allege she was either a record or beneficial alacer shareholder.
but plaintiff alleged a community property interest in alacer.she alleged she and her husband both devoted substantial time and effort during their marriage to creating alacer vitamin supplements and developing its business.l ong ago our courts recognized that,since income arising from a spouse skill,efforts and industry is community property,the community should receive a fair share of the profits which derive from the spouse devotion of more than minimal time and effort to the handling of his or her separate property.beam bank of america cal d.the community is entitled to the increase in profits attributable to community endeavor,regardless of which spouse efforts and separate property are involved.in re marriage of dekker th,d community entitled to increased profits generated by husband efforts for wife separate property company.thus,even if alacer was initially her husband separate property,plaintiff may have acquired a community property interest in it through their alleged joint devotion of time and effort to it during their marriage.beam,supra,cal d at,dekker,supra,th at,d.plaintiff alleges the increase in value of the alacer stock,in excess of that attributed to a fair return on her husband original investment,is community property.and the trust directs the trustees to satisfy this community property interest by transferring alacer stock to plaintiff.
for purposes of the demurrer,assuming as we must the truth of the allegations,plaintiff alleged community property interest in alacer potentially renders her a beneficial shareholder.c ourts in california have historically given derivative suit standing requirements a liberal construction.pearce superior court d.the legislature extended standing from record owners to beneficial owners as part of the liberalization of the standing requirements,designed to bring california in line with the majority rule that it is sufficient that the plaintiff be an equitable shareholder or unregistered owner of shares.id.at.accord daly,supra,th at,d equitable ownership may confer standing upon a plaintiff to sue derivatively.while the trust may be the only record shareholder,plaintiff alleged community property interest in alacer,if true,essentially makes her an unregistered alacer shareholder.plaintiff community property interest in alacer satisfies the liberal standing requirement of beneficial ownership.pearce,supra,d at.
defendant wrongly contends plaintiff lacks beneficial ownership because no court has yet adjudicated her community property claim.it likens her interest in alacer to an unexercised stock option or undistributed inheritance.see daly,supra,th at,d stock option holder is not an equitable shareholder of the corporation klopstock,supra,cal d at,legatee of shares lacks derivative standing applying stricter,standing requirement.not so.the respective interests of the husband and wife in community property during continuance of the marriage relation are present,existing,and equal interests,italics added th,d spouses had equal interest in stock by operation of california community property laws.plaintiff alleged community property interest was created during their marriage.she allegedly has a present and existing interest in alacer stock does not need to do anything to trigger her interest.and while a court may confirm her community property interest,it can not create it.at any rate,plaintiff seeks such confirmation here in her declaratory relief cause of action.
defendant misplaces its reliance on the terms of the trust,claiming it does not make plaintiff a beneficiary this much is is not a trust beneficiary.a beneficiary is a person to whom a donative transfer of property is made,and c as it relates to a trust,means a person who has any present or future interest,vested or contingent,subd.c.plaintiff claims she has a community property interest in trust assets,the alacer stock,and that the trust directs the trustees to distribute no more than percent of the alacer shares to her to satisfy any community property interest she may have in the stock.this alleged interest might satisfy the requirement that she have a present or future interest,vested or contingent.ibid.
but plaintiff alleged community property interest does not satisfy the requirement for a donative transfer of property.the respective interests of the husband and wife in community property during continuance of the marriage relation are present,existing,and equal interests.if plaintiff has a community property interest in the trust alacer stock,then her husband,by directing the trustees to issue alacer shares to plaintiff to satisfy her community property interest if any,would not be giving plaintiff anything to which she is not already entitled.any community property interest she has in the alacer stock is already present and existing,regardless of the trust distribution provision.transferring trust assets to satisfy an existing obligation is the an
