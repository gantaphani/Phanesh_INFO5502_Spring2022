this is an expedited appeal from a final judgment entered by the court of chancery.that final judgment permitted an incumbent board of directors to adopt defense measures which changed the size and composition of the board membership.the record reflects that those defensive actions were taken for the primary purpose of impeding the shareholders right to vote effectively in an impending election for successor directors.we have concluded that the judgment of the court of chancery must be reversed.this matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
procedural background 
on august,mm companies,mm filed its original complaint in this action in the court of chancery against liquid audio,liquid audio,as well as raymond doig,gerald kearby,robert flynn,stephen imbler and ann winblad the director defendants.the original complaint sought injunctive relief against the august,action taken by the board of directors of liquid audio board to expand from five to seven members,and the purported effects that expansion might have on liquid audio annual meeting that was scheduled for september.mm alleged that the director defendants decision to expand the board violated the principles established by the decision of the court of chancery in blasius and the decision of this court in unocal at a scheduling conference on august,the court of chancery set october,as the date for trial.
on september,liquid audio held its annual meeting at which mm two nominees were elected as class iii directors replacing incumbent directors doig and kearby.on october,mm filed an amended complaint,once again seeking to invalidate the august,action by liquid audio board of directors to expand the size of the board from five to seven members and to appoint two new directors to those recently created vacancies.the amended complaint also alleges that the director defendants decision to expand the board violated the principles established by blasius and unocal.
chancery court denies relief 
following discovery and each parties submission of a pretrial brief,a trial was held on october.at the conclusion of the trial,the court of chancery ruled in favor of the defendants,holding that the board expansion did not violate delaware law under either blasius or unocal.the court of chancery rejected the plaintiff independent blasius claim on the basis that the addition of two new directors did not impact the shareholder vote or the shareholder choices in any significant way.the court of chancery rejected the plaintiff unocal claim,on the basis that plaintiff did not contend that the board expansion was coercive,the expansion was not preclusive,because the choices that the shareholders had before the board action was taken were the same as they had after,and the plaintiff failed to make a showing that the action that the board took falls outside a range of reasonable responses.
following the entry of the final judgment,mm filed a notice of appeal and a motion for expedited scheduling.the motion was granted by this court.oral argument was held on december.
issues on appeal 
mm has raised two issues on appeal.first,it contends that the court of chancery erred in ruling that the compelling justification standard,as enunciated in blasius,was not applicable to the board action.in support of that argument,mm relies upon the finding by the court of chancery that the director defendants manipulated the size and composition of the liquid audio board during a contested election for directors primarily to interfere with and impede the success of mm ability to gain directorships on the board,and,thus,to diminish the influence of mm nominees on the board.
second,mm argues that the court of chancery erred in ruling that the precepts of this court holding in unocal and its progeny were not violated by the board defensive action.according to mm,the director defendants never identified a legally cognizable threat to the corporate policy and effectiveness of liquid audio and,to the extent that a threat existed,never demonstrated that the manipulation of the size and composition of the liquid audio board was a reasonable response in relation to such threat.based upon that asserted lack of record evidence,mm submits the court of chancery erred in concluding that this court holding in unocal was not violated.
background facts 
liquid audio is a publicly traded delaware corporation,with its principal place of business in redwood city,california.liquid audio primary business consists of providing software and services for the digital transmission of music over the internet.mm is a publicly traded delaware corporation with its principal place of business in new york,new york.as of october,mm was part of a group that collectively held slightly over of liquid audio common stock.
for more than a year,mm has sought to obtain control of liquid audio.on october,mm sent a letter to the liquid audio board of directors indicating its willingness to acquire the company at approximately per share.liquid audio board rejected mm offer as inadequate,after an analysis of the offer and consultation with its investment banker,broadview international llc broadview.
liquid audio bylaws provide for a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes.only one class of directors is up for election in any given year.the effect is to prevent an insurgent from obtaining control of the company in under two years 
from november,until august,the liquid audio board of directors consisted of five members divided into three classes.class i had two members defendants flynn and imbler,whose terms expire in class ii had one member defendant winblad,whose term expires in and class iii had two members defendants kearby and doig,whose terms expired in.defendants flynn,doig and imbler were not elected to the board by the stockholders of liquid auido.they were appointed to the board by the directors of liquid audio to fill vacancies on the board.
in october,prior to the appointment of defendants doig and imbler to the board,mm requested the liquid audio board to call a special meeting of the company stockholders to consider filling the existing vacancies on the board and to consider other proposals to be presented to the stockholders.on october,the liquid audio board issued a press release which stated that it had denied mm request to call a special meeting because the board believed that under the liquid audio bylaws stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings.thereafter,the board appointed defendants doig and imbler to the liquid audio board of directors.
mm various actions 
on november,mm announced its intention to nominate its own candidates for the two seats on liquid audio board of directors that were up for election at the next annual meeting.on december,mm delivered a formal notice to liquid audio stating that it intended to nominate seymour holtzman and james mitarotonda as directors to fill the two seats on the board then held by the individuals designated as class iii directors whose terms expired at the next annual meeting.the december,notice also requested that the board adopt resolutions declaring certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws advisable and that such amendments be submitted to the stockholders.
on december,mm sent notice to liquid audio informing the board of its intention to bring before the annual meeting a proposal that would amend the bylaws and increase the size of the board by four members.the december,notice also informed the board of mm intention to nominate four individuals as directors to fill those four newly created directorships.mm subsequently demanded that the board commit to fixing an annual meeting date by february.
on february,mm renewed its october offer to acquire liquid audio.that offer,however,was at the reduced price of per share.the liquid audio board rejected that offer as inadequate.
on may,mm forwarded a written demand to liquid audio under section which requested a list of stockholders of liquid audio and related materials.liquid audio did not respond to the demand letter.on may,mm filed an action under section seeking,among other things,an order of the court of chancery directing that liquid audio forward to mm the information identified in the demand letter.a hearing before the court of chancery with respect to the section complaint was scheduled to be held on june.
on june,mm filed proxy materials with the securities and exchange commission sec and commenced soliciting proxies for a shareholder meeting liquid audio planned to have on july.in addition to proposing two nominees for the board,mm proxy statement included a takeover proposal to increase the size of the board by an additional four directors and to fill those positions with its nominees.as outlined in its initial proxy materials,mm takeover proposal sought to expand the board from five members to nine.if mm two directors were elected and its four proposed directors were also placed on the board,mm would control a majority of the board.
alliance merger 
on june,liquid audio announced a merger transaction with alliance entertainment alliance.this announcement came three days after mm mailed its proxy statement and other materials to the stockholders of liquid audio,and one day before the scheduled court of chancery hearing in connection with the section complaint.in addition to announcing the merger,the liquid audio board also announced that the july,meeting would be postponed a special meeting of stockholders of liquid audio would be held sometime in the future to vote upon the merger and,if the merger received the requisite stockholder and regulatory approval,the merger would close in the fall of.based upon this announcement,the annual meeting was postponed indefinitely by the liquid audio board.
the merger with alliance that was announced to the stockholders of liquid audio on june,and the merger agreement executed by liquid audio and alliance in connection therewith were not approved unanimously by the board.the record reflects that at a meeting of the board held to vote upon the merger and the merger agreement,defendants kearby,flynn,imbler and doig voted for the merger and the merger agreement and defendant winblad voted against the merger and the merger agreement.
after liquid audio announced that the annual meeting would be postponed indefinitely,mm filed an amended complaint,seeking an order of the court of chancery directing liquid audio to hold the annual meeting as soon as possible,and a motion for expedited and summary proceedings.on june,the court of chancery granted mm motion for expedited and summary proceedings and directed that a trial in connection with mm application for relief be held on july.
shortly,before that trial took place,the liquid audio board announced that certain terms of the merger agreement had been modified to permit liquid audio to conduct a offer under which liquid would acquire up to million shares of its common stock at per share in cash,if the merger was approved by the stockholders of liquid audio.upon consummation of the merger and a fully subscribed offer,liquid audio stockholders would own and alliance stockholders would own of the combined enterprise.the liquid audio board also announced that certain senior officers of liquid audio committed not to tender their shares in the offer.finally,the liquid audio board announced that the director defendants reduced the trigger of liquid audio shareholders rights plan or poison pill to from.the modified merger agreement was approved unanimously by the board at a meeting held on july.
after expedited discovery,a trial was held on july.the court of chancery ordered that the annual meeting of liquid audio shareholders occur on september.the record date for the meeting was august.
board adds two directors 
by the middle of august,it was apparent that mm nominees,holtzman and mitarotonda,would be elected at the annual meeting,to serve in place of the two incumbent nominees,as members of the liquid audio board.on august,liquid audio announced that the board had amended the bylaws to increase the size of the board to seven members from five members.the board also announced that defendants james somes and judith frank had been appointed to fill the newly created directorships.defendant somes was appointed to serve as a class ii member of the board and defendant frank was appointed to serve as a class i member of the board.after the board expanded from five directors to seven,mm revised its proxy statement to note that its proposal to add four directors,if successful,would have resulted in a board with eleven directors,instead of nine.
mm challenges board expansion 
on august,mm filed its initial lawsuit challenging the board decision to add two directors.in the initial complaint,mm alleged that the board expansion interfered with mm ability to solicit proxies in favor of its two nominees for election to the liquid audio board at the annual meeting.in support of this claim,mm alleged that some stockholders would believe that electing two members of a board,rather than two members of a board,would not be worthwhile,and,thus,such stockholders simply would not vote.
at the september,annual meeting,the two directors proposed by mm,holtzman and mitarotonda,were elected to serve as directors of the board.liquid audio stockholders,however,did not approve mm takeover proposals that would have expanded the board and placed mm four nominees on the board.the stockholders vote on both issues was consistent with the recommendation of institutional investor services iss,a proxy voting advisory service,which had recommended that the stockholders vote in favor of mm two nominees,but recommended against stockholders voting to give mm outright and immediate control of the board.
following the election of mm two nominees to the liquid audio board of directors at the annual meeting,mm filed an amended lawsuit,challenging the board appointment of directors somes and frank.in the amended complaint,mm alleged that the expansion of the liquid audio board,its timing,and the board appointment of two new directors violated the principles of blasius and unocal.according to mm,that action frustrated mm attempt to gain a substantial presence on the board for at least one year and guaranteed that liquid audio management will have control of,or a substantial presence on,the board for at least two years.
board primary purpose impede effective vote 
the expedited trial was held by the court of chancery,as scheduled.during pretrial discovery,the director defendants identified the primary purpose of their action in expanding the liquid audio board from five to seven members.their response to the following interrogatory request is illustrative 
summarize the complete reasons that support the decision of the board to amend the bylaws or to approve the bylaw amendment.
response subject to and without waiving the general objections stated above,defendants state that the board of directors,after receiving legal advice regarding their fiduciary duties,voted to expand the size of the board after a thorough and deliberate evaluation of the qualifications and expected contributions of judith frank and james somes to liquid current operations and business plans.furthermore,the board of directors believed that the company would benefit from having seven directors instead of only five directors.in particular,the company believed that it would benefit from creating new directorships and placing two additional outside directors on the board in light of the potential difficulties that may result from the addition of mm nominees on the board and in light of the possibility that one or more directors would decide to resign for a variety of reasons including,but not limited to,a reluctance to serve alongside a slate of directors proposed by mm 
when defendant doig was asked to elaborate upon this response to the interrogatory request,he testified 
there was concern that if the mm slate won and then it did become too acrimonious and that winblad and imbler decided to resign,that ran an undue risk to the shareholders by giving mm the ability to control the company.
the testimony of each other member of the board also reflects that the director defendants were concerned that incumbent directors winblad and imbler would resign from the liquid audio board if mm nominees were elected to the board at the annual meeting,which would result in mm gaining control of the board.the record also reflects that the timing of the director defendants decision to expand the board was to accomplish its primary purpose to minimize the impact of the election of mm nominees to the board.the court of chancery ruling from the bench states 
the board concern was that given the past acrimonious relationship between mm and liquid audio,a relationship characterized by litigation,if mm two nominees were elected,the possibility of continued acrimony might cause one or more of the current board members to resign.if one director resigned,that would deadlock the board and if two directors resigned,then mm would gain control on a basis.either scenario could jeopardize the pending merger,which the incumbent board favored.that was the primary reason.emphasis added.
after making that factual determination,the court of chancery recognized the effect of the board action in changing the size and composition of its membership immediately prior to the election of directors at the annual meeting 
by adding two additional directors,the board foreclosed the result that it feared the possibility of a deadlock or of mm taking control of the board.the reason is that even if mm two nominees were elected at the annual meeting,the current directors would still constitute a majority of five.the result of the board action was to diminish the influence of any nominees of mm that were elected,at least in numerical terms.
thus,based upon the evidence presented at trial,including an assessment of the witnesses credibility,the court of chancery concluded that the director defendants amended the bylaws to expand the board from five to seven,appointed two additional members of the board,and timed those actions for the primary purpose of diminishing the influence of mm nominees,if they were elected at the annual meeting.
corporate governance principles 
the most fundamental principles of corporate governance are a function of the allocation of power within a corporation between its stockholders and its board of directors the stockholders power is the right to vote on specific matters,in particular,in an election of directors.the power of managing the corporate enterprise is vested in the shareholders duly elected board representatives accordingly,while these fundamental tenets of delaware corporate law provide for a separation of control and ownership,the stockholder franchise has been characterized as the ideological underpinning upon which the legitimacy of the directors managerial power rests 
maintaining a proper balance in the allocation of power between the stockholders right to elect directors and the board of directors right to manage the corporation is dependent upon the stockholders unimpeded right to vote effectively in an election of directors.this court has repeatedly stated that,if the stockholders are not satisfied with the management or actions of their elected representatives on the board of directors,the power of corporate democracy is available to the stockholders to replace the incumbent directors when they stand for consequently,two decades ago,this court held 
the courts of this state will not allow the wrongful subversion of corporate democracy by manipulation of the corporate machinery or by machinations under the cloak of delaware law.accordingly,careful judicial scrutiny will be given a situation in which the right to vote for the election of successor directors has been effectively frustrated and denied 
this court and the court of chancery have remained assiduous in carefully reviewing any board actions designed to interfere with or impede the effective exercise of corporate democracy by shareholders,especially in an election of directors 
corporate governance review standards 
the defining tension in corporate governance today has been characterized as the tension between deference to directors decisions and the scope of judicial review.the appropriate standard of judicial review is dispositive of which party has the burden of proof as any litigation proceeds from stage to stage until there is a substantive determination on the merits accordingly,identification of the correct analytical framework is essential to a proper judicial review of challenges to the process of a corporation board of directors 
the business judgment rule,as a standard of judicial review,is a recognition of the statutory authority to manage a corporation that is vested in the board of directors.the business judgment rule is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis,in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.an application of the traditional business judgment rule places the burden on the party challenging the board decision to establish facts rebutting the presumption.the effect of a proper invocation of the business judgment rule,as a standard of judicial review,is powerful because it operates deferentially.if the business judgment rule is not rebutted,a court will not substitute its judgment for that of the board if the board decision can be attributed to any rational business purpose.
in blasius,chancellor allen set forth a cogent explanation of why judicial review under the deferential traditional business judgment rule standard is inappropriate when a board of directors acts for the primary purpose of impeding or interfering with the effectiveness of a shareholder vote,especially in the specific context presented in blasius of a contested election for directors 
t he ordinary considerations to which the business judgment rule originally responded are simply not present in the shareholder voting context.that is,a decision by the board to act for the primary purpose of preventing the effectiveness of a shareholder vote inevitably involves the question who,as between the principal and the agent,has authority with respect to a matter of internal corporate governance.that,of course,is true in a very specific way in this case which deals with the question who should constitute the board of directors of the corporation,but it will be true in every instance in which an incumbent board seeks to thwart a shareholder majority.a board decision to act to prevent the shareholders from creating a majority of new board positions and filling them does not involve the exercise of the corporation power over its property,or with respect to its rights or obligations rather,it involves allocation,between shareholders as a class and the board,of effective power with respect to governance of the corporation action designed principally to interfere with the effectiveness of a vote inevitably involves a conflict between the board and shareholder majority.judicial review of such action involves a determination of the legal and equitable obligations of an agent towards his principal.this is not,in my opinion,a question that a court may leave to the agent finally to decide so long as he does so honestly and competently that is,it may not be left to the agent business judgment 
in blasius,the chancellor did not adopt a rule of per se invalidity once a plaintiff has established that a board of directors has acted for the primary purpose of interfering with or impeding the effective exercise of a shareholder vote instead,the chancellor concluded that such situations required enhanced judicial scrutiny,pursuant to which the board of directors bears the heavy burden of demonstrating a compelling justification for such action.
in blasius,the chancellor then applied that compelling justification standard of enhanced judicial review in examining a board action to expand its size in the context of a contested election of directors,exactly what the liquid audio board did in this case.in blasius,notwithstanding the fact that the incumbent board of directors believed in good faith that the leveraged recapitalization proposed by the plaintiff was and less valuable than the compa
