consolidated management group,llc consolidated,consolidated leasing hugoton joint venture hugoton,and consolidated leasing anadarko joint venture anadarko consolidated,anadarko,and hugoton are hereafter referred to collectively as petitioners appeal from a judgment denying their petition for writ of administrative mandamus.the petition sought to overturn the decision of respondent california department of corporations department rejecting petitioners challenge to a department desist and refrain order with respect to offers and sales of interests in hugoton and anadarko.
the issues on appeal are whether federal law preempts the department authority to issue the desist order and whether the interests in hugoton and anadarko are securities.most of the cases that have addressed the first issue,including a recent decision by another california court of appeal,have found no preemption,and we agree with that majority view.substantial evidence supported the department determination that the interests in question are securities.we affirm for the reasons that we explain below.
background 
consolidated,a kansas limited liability company with its principal place of business in hutchinson,kansas,formed a number of kansas general partnerships,including hugoton and anadarko,that purchase oil and gas exploration and drilling equipment and lease the equipment to oil and gas operators.this case concerns the sale of units of joint venture interests in hugoton and anadarko,which have their principal places of business in wichita,kansas.the august,private placement memorandum for hugoton provided for the sale of units at per unit the october,memorandum for anadarko provided for the sale of units at per unit.
in august and november,consolidated filed with the department copies of the form d notices of private placements of securities rule of regulation d it had filed for hugoton and anadarko with the securities exchange commission sec,along with consents to service of process and notice filing fees.
consolidated retained guardian capital management guardian to raise capital in northern california for hugoton and anadarko,and the department issued a desist and refrain order in january against guardian,guardian president,kenneth keegan,and guardian operatives faber johnston and brandon taylor,as well as consolidated,hugoton,and anadarko.the order charged that these entities and individuals had engaged in general solicitation of the public for the offer and sale of hugoton and anadarko units,that the units were securities subject to qualification under california law,and that the securities had been offered and sold without being qualified in violation of corporations code section 
petitioners requested a hearing on the desist and refrain order,which was held in march before an administrative law judge alj.
department investigator jon wroten testified at the hearing that he was working undercover using an alias on december.he received a call from faber johnston.johnston obtained wroten number from a third party wroten was investigating.wroten had told the third party that he owned a sheet rocking company and that he had to to invest.on december,the third party called wroten and asked if he was interested in information about an investment unrelated to the one they had been discussing.wroten said,yes,and then received the call from johnston.
johnston told wroten that guardian was under contract with consolidated to market an oil and gas drilling project called anadarko,and that the investment could potentially return percent per annum.johnston said that consolidated personnel had been drilling for oil for years,and that when they found natural gas instead of oil they had capped the wells.the price of natural gas was rising,consolidated had drilling equipment and rights to the capped wells,and anadarko business would involve leasing the equipment to firms who would extract the natural gas from the wells.
wroten had no relationship with johnston prior to the phone call.during the call,johnston asked wroten what he did for a living and wroten said that he had a dry walling company he did not tell johnston anything else about himself.johnston asked if he could send information about the investment,wroten said,yes,and wroten received over pages of documents from johnston,including the anadarko private placement memorandum,promotional materials,and an invitation to participate in a december,conference call with consolidated president.the promotional materials included a brochure stating that demand for natural gas was increasing,that consolidated had years of industry knowledge and proven track record,and that w e are uniquely situated in areas of vast oil and natural gas reserves.johnston left phone messages for wroten and sent him a second written solicitation,but wroten did not communicate with johnston after their december conversation.
guardian president kenneth keegan confirmed at the hearing that johnston was authorized by guardian to send out promotional materials.keegan testified that shortly after he joined the los gatos chamber of commerce chamber in july or august of,he purchased mailing labels from the chamber for its members.the membership mailing list was not available to the general public.keegan said that guardian mailed invitations to over chamber members who we thought were possibly accredited investors inviting them to luncheon presentations that sought to generate interest in hugoton and anadarko.keegan said that he knew quite a few of the people invited,but admitted that guardian did not have a preexisting relationship with all of them.
keegan wrote the department a letter in october advising that guardian is compensated by consolidated for its effort in providing capital received from accredited investors keegan indicated at the hearing that guardian did not receive direct compensation from consolidated guardian was paid by balboa leasing,which was listed on anadarko form d as an entity that would be compensated for the sale of investments.keegan explained that the money flowed from consolidated through balboa leasing to guardian.
keegan testified that he told potential investors they would be required to actively participate in the management of hugoton and anadarko.he conceded that some who attended the luncheons had no experience in the oil and gas industry.he acknowledged that he was promoting investments in equipment located many states away from where the investors resided,and that the wells where the equipment would be used were in kansas and oklahoma.
the alj issued a proposed decision denying petitioners motion to dismiss the desist and refrain order on the ground of federal preemption,finding that the joint venture interests in hugoton and anadarko were securities,and concluding the securities were not exempt under regulation d.the department adopted the alj proposed decision,and petitioners filed the administrative mandate action herein.in its order denying the petition,the trial court rejected petitioners preemption argument and found that the joint venture interests were securities.
ii.discussion 
preemption 
under section,i t is unlawful for any person to offer or sell in this state any security in an issuer transaction unless such sale has been qualified or unless such security or transaction is exempted section,subdivision d exempts from section a ny offer or sale of a security with respect to a transaction that is exempt from registration under the securities act of pursuant to section b d b d of that act,provided that a copy of a completed form d and a consent to service of process are filed,and a notice filing fee is paid,as was done by hugoton and anadarko in this case.transactions are exempt from registration under the federal statute if they comply with the requirements of rule of regulation d for limited private placements,which include a prohibition against any form of general solicitation c.petitioners do not dispute the department finding,upheld by the trial court,that interests in hugoton and anadarko were offered through general solicitations in contravention of the federal rules for private offerings.
petitioners nevertheless maintain that california is preempted by federal law from requiring that the sales of those interests be qualified as provided in section.their argument is based on the national securities markets improvement act of nsmia,which preempts state laws requiring the registration or qualification of a covered security a,including a security in a transaction that is exempt from registration under this title pursuant to commission rules or regulations issued under section,rule of regulation d b d.in petitioners view,any purported offer of securities pursuant to rule of regulation d is sufficient to establish preemption,whether or not the offer is implemented in accordance with the requirements of that rule.
petitioners preemption argument presents an issue of law as to the department jurisdiction in this matter,and we must exercise de novo review with respect to that issue.see,anserv ins.services,kelso th,d usher county of monterey th,d.
petitioners argument is supported by the decision in temple gorman d temple.the plaintiffs in temple alleged that the defendants had sold unregistered securities in violation of florida law because,while the defendants had filed a form d with the sec for an exempt private placement under rule of regulation d,they did not comply with the rule requirements when they sold the securities.the court found that the plaintiffs claim was preempted under the nsmia by virtue of the form d filing regardless of how the securities were sold,and granted motions to dismiss the complaint.temple,supra,at.
temple gleaned t he purpose of congress,the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case temple,supra,d at,from a committee report stating that the nsmia was intended to further and advance the development of national securities markets and eliminate the costs and burdens of duplicative and unnecessary regulation by,as a general rule,designating the federal government as the exclusive regulator of national offerings of securities.s ecurities sold in private transactions under section of the securities act would be covered securities,and thus preempted,if offered or sold pursuant to a commission rule or regulation adopted under such section.the committee intends that the section exemption from state regulation facilitate private placement of securities consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.ibid.
after quoting this legislative history,the court wrote here,plaintiffs have alleged that defendants private placement of securities purported to be exempt from registration pursuant to rule of regulation d promulgated by the sec.construing this allegation in plaintiffs favor,the court finds that the securities in this case were offered or sold pursuant to a commission rule or regulation adopted under section.regardless of whether the private placement actually complied with the substantive requirements of regulation d or rule,the securities sold to plaintiffs are federal covered securities because they were sold pursuant to those rules a ny attempt by florida to require registration of such securities or securities transaction would be preempted by nsmia.congress expressed its intent in nsmia that federal regulations alone should govern the registration of national securities offerings.where a form d was filed with the sec for a transaction that purported to merit an exemption from federal registration pursuant to regulation d,florida law could not require duplicative registration or a transactional exemption from registration.temple,supra,d at.
temple has been followed in a few cases that have not expanded on its analysis.pinnacle communic.intern.american fam.mortg.d,lillard stockton d,risdall,review granted.lexis.however,temple has been rejected in most subsequent cases,including the recent decision in apollo capital fund,llc roth capital partners,llc th,d apollo.brown earthboard sports usa,cir,brown grubka webaccess,d,grubka hamby clearwater consulting concepts,lllp d,fn.hamby buist time domain so d,in re blue flame energy corp ohio app d,blue flame.
the decisions critical of temple have found no need to go beyond the nsmia text and consult its legislative history.brown,supra,at grubka,supra,d at blue flame,supra,at.it is unnecessary to look to the legislative history if a statute is unambiguous grubka,supra,at,and the nsmia unambiguously defines a covered security as one that is exempt from registration,not one that is sold pursuant to a putative exemption blue flame,supra,at.offerings must thus actually qualify for a valid federal securities registration exemption in order to enjoy nsmia preemption.brown,supra,at.
these decisions also note how easily state registration requirements could be circumvented if simply claiming that a transaction is exempt produced preemption.in such a world,state registration requirements could be avoided merely by adding spurious boilerplate language to subscription agreements suggesting that the offerings were covered,or by filing bogus documents with the sec.brown,supra,at see also grubka,supra,d at that a defendant could avoid liability under state law simply by declaiming its alleged compliance with regulation d is an unsavory proposition and would eviscerate the statute blue flame,supra,at any con artist could avoid state registration by telling the investor that the offering was a private placement under rule sham rule offerings would be exempt from state registration.while congress indubitably possesses the power to accomplish that end,if congress had possessed the political will to preempt state blue sky laws in their practical entirety,it would have expressed that decision in the statute plain text.brown,supra,at.
like the apollo court we are persuaded by the cases that have declined to follow temple,and we align ourselves with the authorities which have stated the obvious a security has to actually be a covered security before federal preemption applies.apollo,supra,th at,d,quoting hamby,supra,d at,fn.
petitioners contend that the department,as a state agency,lacks authority to interpret a federal exemption,but a similar argument was persuasively rejected in the blue flame case.the offeror in blue flame argued that the nsmia was implicitly intended to make the sec sole adjudicator of whether a security is a covered security.blue flame,supra,at.however,state tribunals generally have authority to decide questions of federal law,including questions of federal preemption,unless congress intends a federal forum to be the exclusive jurisdiction in an area id.at.the nsmia expresses no such intention and merely designate s a choice of federal law over state law.ibid.
petitioners contend that the relevant policy consideration under the nsmia is not evasion of state registration requirements,but rather avoidance of costly and potentially inconsistent state proceedings to determine whether purported private offerings are truly exempt.however,this reasoning is no more than a gloss on the legislative history cited in temple and rejected in the other cases.that history does not establish that the burden of state enforcement was considered so detrimental as to outweigh any state concern over sham private offerings.petitioners submit that the nsmia provision preserving state jurisdiction to prosecute enforcement actions involving fraud or deceit,or unlawful conduct by a broker or dealer c,implicitly removes any other state authority over purported private placements.however,if congress meant to preempt state blue sky laws in their practical entirety it would have done so expressly brown,supra,at,and not by mere implication.
we therefore independently agree with the department and the trial court that petitioners preemption argument is untenable.
whether the joint venture interests are securities 
petitioners argue that the department erred in finding that the joint venture interests are securities.whether an investment constitutes a security is a question of fact.people frederick th,d moreland department of corporations d.our review is therefore limited to determining whether the department finding was supported by substantial evidence.young gannon th,d.in conducting th
