jay levy appeals from a final judgment entered by the united states district court for the southern district of florida after a bench trial,finding him liable for multiple acts of solicitation fraud in violation of section b of the commodity exchange act cea,b and imposing various sanctions against him.levy contends that the court erred in multiplying the maximum civil monetary penalty for which he was liable by the number of violations proved at trial,rather than by the number of counts alleged in the complaint imposing a civil monetary penalty against him awarding restitution to the extent of his customers losses including in the restitution award invested by his customers prior to their interactions with him and freezing his assets pending satisfaction of the judgment.after thorough review,we affirm in all respects the district court final judgment except insofar as it made an award of restitution based on the amount of the victims losses rather than on levy gains.as for that matter,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the essential facts adduced at trial and found by the district court are these united investment group uig is a florida corporation located in boca raton,florida.uig is registered with the commodity futures trading commission cftc as an introducing broker ib,which the commodity exchange act defines as follows 
a ny person engaged in soliciting or in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of any commodity for future delivery on or subject to the rules of any contract market who does not accept any money,securities,or property to margin,guarantee,or secure any trades or contracts that result or may result therefrom.
prior to the commencement of this action by the cftc,uig was engaged in the business of soliciting customers for the sale of commodities options through universal financial holding company ufhc,a futures commission merchant fcm uig,which employed associated persons aps to conduct and manage its operations,hired levy in this capacity in august.
before registering as an ap with uig,levy worked at four different options trading firms,three of which were disciplined by the national futures association nfa as a result of sales practice violations.levy himself has been the subject of two nfa business conduct committee complaints,both of which resulted in the assessment of a fine against him along with three months of enhanced supervisory procedures.in settling the second of these complaints,levy consented to findings that,while serving as an ap at group one financial services,he violated nfa compliance rule a,which provides that no member shall cheat,defraud,or deceive,or attempt to cheat,defraud,or deceive,any commodity futures customer.in fact,levy agreed that,in march and april,he made a number of misleading and deceptive sales solicitations to a group one customer,specifically telling the customer that a investment in japanese yen options could suddenly be worth more than,and pressuring the customer to invest immediately before the market corrected itself.
the nfa business conduct committee found,and levy agreed,that t here was no rationale for levy recommendations that the customer purchase additional yen put options except to generate commissions for group one.the committee also found,and again levy agreed,that his solicitation painted a misleading and overly optimistic picture of the profit potential of trading yen put options.finally,the conduct committee concluded that levy solicitations included no discussion of the enormous risks and speculative nature of options trading.
on january,the cftc commenced this injunctive action against uig and five of its aps,including levy collectively the defendants,asserting that the defendants misrepresented the profit potential of commodities options in violation of b and specifically,the complaint alleged,among other things,that the defendants fraudulently solicited members of the public to open accounts by misrepresenting and failing to disclose material facts concerning i the likelihood that a customer would realize large profits from trading options ii the risks involved in trading options and iii the dismal performance record of uig customers trading options.
the district court tried this case without a jury in march.two days into the trial,the cftc entered into a consent decree with all of the defendants except levy,whose trial resumed as scheduled.soon after concluding the trial as to levy,the district court entered detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,and then entered final judgment against levy.the court found that,since at least august,levy responsibilities at uig included soliciting investments from members of the general public for the purpose of trading commodity options.generally,the district court explained,a more junior ap would contact the potential customer and misrepresent the risks and potential rewards associated with commodity options trading before turning the customer over to levy who,stressing his expertise,would guarantee lofty returns at limited cost with little or no risk.
at trial,levy vehemently denied engaging in any of these impermissible sales ploys indeed,at one point,he suggested that every witness who testified against him was absolutely lying.cftc united investors group,at.far from misleading clients with talk of large profits and risk,he claimed to have required that all of his clients acknowledge the significant risks associated with commodity options before placing trades.
the district court,however,found levy testimony incredible,describing his memory as selective and lamenting his professed inability to recall any specifics regarding the few improper sales solicitations he admitted to making,or the improper sales solicitations he recalls witnessing at uig.united investors group,at.the court added that levy testimony was rife with internal inconsistencies tripped by his self serving memorializations of material events.id.thus,for example,levy initially denied consenting to any findings of fact in resolving any claim brought by the nfa business conduct committee,before finally admitting,after the evidence was squarely presented,that a fraudulent and misleading exchange between himself and a group one customer had actually occurred.id.at.the trial court found that levy was evasive about the amount of money he earned during his tenure at uig.id.in particular,while levy bank records indicated that he received and endorsed checks totaling from uig bank accounts,he unabashedly argued,without further elaboration,that he derived these amounts from other sources.id.finally,the district court found that levy testimony was belied by the testimony of five uig customers scott anderson,carrie allsopp,david cuthbertson,charles jeffrey thompson,and sergeant lanzy williams who received sales calls from him and provided a sinister account of his solicitation tactics.id.
thus,for example,anderson,who was fully credited by the district court,testified that he was contacted in march by tony bobba,a uig ap,who advised him that the war in iraq would cause a substantial appreciation in the value of unleaded gasoline calls.relying upon this information,anderson opened a trading account with ufhc,through which he purchased worth of unleaded gasoline options.on march,bobba contacted anderson again,only this time to set up a call with commodities guru who,according to bobba,lived in an affluent neighborhood and drove expensive cars.bobba told anderson that levy consistently purchased euro currency options at a discounted price because,in addition to buying in large quantities,levy had close ties with europe financial markets.
the next day,levy called anderson himself and moved in for the kill.he engaged in what the district court called a sales solicitation.united investors group,at.levy said that he had connections in the european financial community and added that he was an expert in euro currency options.levy strongly suggested that anderson purchase euro currency options as soon as possible in light of the upcoming presidential election and the ongoing war in iraq.levy guaranteed anderson that his investment would soon triple,irrespective of any volatility in the markets,because of levy strategy of hedging put and call options.levy further told anderson that i may sound like an ass right now,but you will thank me after all of the money you made.based on levy representations,anderson,who by his own admission had no familiarity with european currency markets,invested another in march and april.of the anderson invested through uig,only was ultimately returned to him.notably,levy never advised,apparently,any of the other of levy clients realized a net loss upon closing their ufhc accounts.
carrie allsopp,the second victim,recounted a similar experience.she received a phone call in september from duane haughton,another ap at uig,who suggested that she open an account with ufhc for the purpose of trading heating oil options.haughton calculated that,in light of the upcoming winter season and the ongoing war in iraq,allsopp would earn precisely per option for every penny increase in the price of a barrel of oil.haughton also assured her that he would employ a investment strategy.based on this information,on january,allsopp invested in heating oil options through her ufhc account.
later that day,haughton told allsopp that levy,a senior,experienced officer at uig who had done well by his clients in the past,was interested in speaking with her.when levy came to the phone,he told allsopp that the war in iraq would cause the dollar to depreciate significantly over the coming months.to capitalize on this trend,levy recommended that allsopp purchase euro currency options as soon as possible.levy also said that allsopp could expect to receive per option for every cent increase in the value of the euro.
allsopp explained to levy that she had received in a legal settlement resulting from her daughter tragic death in a car accident,and that,under the terms of the settlement,she was holding the proceeds in trust for her two other daughters.levy assured allsopp that,as a result of his expert use of stop loss orders,the risks associated with euro currency investments were minimal.levy went so far as to guarantee that,if allsopp invested the full,she would receive at least that amount in returns by the end of the week.all in all,levy said he expected the net value of allsopp investment to reach.before concluding,levy added that an investment in euro options was the best way for allsopp to ensure that her two living daughters would always remember the sacrifices of their deceased sister.
based on levy recommendations,allsopp invested in euro currency options through her ufhc account.several weeks later,levy informed allsopp that she had a debit balance on her account,and told her that she should remit an additional.of the approximately allsopp invested through her ufhc account,only was returned to her.allsopp,too,was never told that all of levy customers sustained a loss upon closing their ufhc accounts.
david cuthbertson,victim three,testified that,in february,he received a call from uig ap jerry sipes,who suggested that cuthbertson open an account with ufhc for the purpose of trading heating oil options.sipes told cuthbertson that,in light of political unrest in nigeria and venezuela,he could expect to double or triple his investment in two or three weeks,and added that uig strategy of hedging put and call options allowed its customers to profit irrespective of volatility in the futures markets.based on this information,cuthbertson invested in heating oil options through a ufhc account.
shortly thereafter,sipes told cuthbertson that he was close friends with a uig executive levy who was an expert in euro currency options.when levy came to the phone,he described himself as a specialist in currency options trading,and,notably,added that his customers rarely lost any money because of his unique investment strategy,which involved purchasing both put and call options in an effort to hedge the euro market.levy also told cuthbertson that his investment would triple in value within ten days.when cuthbertson agreed to invest in euro futures options,levy assured him that the investment would be worth as much as within two weeks.of the cuthbertson ultimately invested through his ufhc account,only was returned to him.
echoing these grim accounts of levy sales practices,charles jeffrey thompson,the fourth victim,testified that,on march,he received a call from uig ap vince monti,who suggested that thompson could earn a significant profit by investing in unleaded gasoline options.specifically,monti said that thompson could realize a return of ten times the value of his investment with virtually no risk.based on this information,thompson made an initial investment of through a ufhc account.one week later,monti phoned thompson and told him that something really huge was going on in the market.monti added that a senior official at uig levy,who typically handled only large institutional clients,had agreed to speak briefly with thompson.later that day,levy contacted thompson and described himself as a millionaire.levy echoed monti pitch that something big was happening in the euro currency market.levy asked thompson whether he wanted to be rich and even said thompson could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars.levy added that his research and market information allowed him to invest in the euro currency market free of risk.of the thompson invested with ufhc,he lost all but.thompson,like the others,was never told that all of levy customers suffered a net loss after closing their ufhc accounts.
the cftc final victim witness,united states army sergeant lanzy williams,testified that,upon his return from a tour of duty in iraq,he received a call from uig ap greg atz,who suggested that sergeant williams invest in heating oil options as soon as possible.atz said he could almost guarantee that williams investment would triple or quadruple in about thirty to forty days.based upon this recommendation,sergeant williams invested through an account he opened with ufhc.some time later,atz suggested that williams speak with levy,a man who,according to atz,could make a lot of money in a very short period of time.atz then passed the phone to levy who said that williams could quadruple his investment in thirty to sixty days by investing in european currency markets.levy did not discuss any of the risks associated with currency options trading,despite williams admonition that he was looking for stable investments.in fact,sergeant williams wrote on some paperwork reviewed by levy that his goal for the account was financial stability.because sergeant williams did not have additional cash on hand,levy urged him to withdraw money from his k plan,which was just sitting there and not doing anything,in order to fund an investment in euro currency options.based on levy misrepresentations,sergeant williams invested approximately in euro currency options through an account at ufhc.in total,williams invested with ufhc and lost all of it.
all told,the five testifying customers lost as a result of their investments with ufhc,of which are directly attributable to misrepresentations made by levy.levy admitted at trial that he used daily equity runs to determine the posture of each of his clients investments,and the district court found that levy knew precisely how much money each of his clients was losing.despite this,levy never once informed any of the five testifying customers that of his clients realized a loss when they closed out their investments with ufhc.
the customers testimony was corroborated by an audiotape recording of one of levy sales solicitations,which highlighted his propensity for improper,sales tactics.on the tape,levy can be heard telling jerry,an undercover informant,that he would make a great deal of money by investing in oil futures.levy added that his perfect strategy of purchasing both put and call options ensured that jerry would profit irrespective of volatility in the futures markets.levy described his investment techniques as conservative and suggested that jerry would thank him in the long run.when jerry resisted,levy asked whether shapiro the uig ap who had initiated jerry solicitation had advised jerry against wasting levy time.in response,jerry acknowledged that he knew levy time was valuable and committed himself to a sizeable investment.
the district court was also persuaded by the admission into evidence of a sales manual entitled sales success the complete guide to selling investments around the world,which was found in levy uig office.the manual includes numerous scripts for sales solicitations,including several that are remarkably similar to the techniques described by the testifying customers at trial.thus,for example,a salesman in the manual recites the following pitch m y company has targeted an investment that we believe could double or triple your money in the next to days.a second document found in levy desk,entitled working with other brokers,features the following pitch listen,the president of the company is taking everyone off the phones in a few minutes.the top broker here is giving an emergency meeting on the markets.this does happen often but when it does it usually something big.the script continues along these lines,instructing the first broker to call the customer and inform him that a second,more senior broker is prepared to speak with him as a favor,despite the senior broker usual practice of dealing only with institutional clients.
after finding this evidence credible,the district court concluded that levy had made misrepresentations,misleading statements,and deceptive omissions regarding the profit potential and risks of trading options that he had acted with scienter and that his misrepresentations and omissions were material.united investors group,at,and.indeed,the district court characterized levy conduct as brazen and intentional.id.at.the trial court then determined that levy had committed five violations of the cea with respect to each of the five testifying customers,for a total of violations.id.at.the court observed that section of the cea,together with cftc regulation a ii,a ii,permits imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to the greater of per violation or triple the monetary gain to the violator.id.at.however,instead of unbundl ing the violations,the district court treated levy dealings with each customer as a single violation and imposed a civil monetary penalty of.id.at 
in addition,the court ordered levy to pay a restitution award in the amount of as ancillary equitable relief to compensate each of the five testifying customers for the monies they lost as a consequence of levy misconduct.id.at.finally,after finding a clear nexus between levy bank accounts and his fraudulent trading activity,the district court continue d the asset freeze it had imposed at the beginning of the litigation pending complete satisfaction of its judgment id.at.this timely appeal followed.

first,levy argues that the district court erred in multiplying the maximum civil monetary penalty for which he is liable by the number of violations proved at trial,rather than by the number of counts alleged in the cftc complaint.in other words,levy says that the cftc complaint,which contained only a single count of solicitation fraud,can yield only one violation of the cea.we are unpersuaded.
to begin with,the commodity exchange act empowers district courts to punish any violation of its provisions.it says in any action brought under this section,the commission may seek and the court shall have jurisdiction to impose,on a proper showing,on any person found in the action to have committed any violation a civil penalty d emphasis added.thus,contrary to levy suggestion,the cea does not say,expressly or otherwise,that each allegation in the cftc complaint must be separated into distinct counts.
moreover,the cftc enforcement regulations,found in a,proscribe only violations of the,without requiring that each allegation be separated into different counts.in pertinent part,the regulations state f or each violation of the cea,the district court may impose a civil monetary penalty of not more than the greater of or triple the monetary gain to such person for each such violation.a ii emphasis added.
the cftc complaint alleged plainly and unambiguously that it was charging levy with multiple violations of the commodity exchange act.indeed,the complaint explicitly said each material representation and omission of uig and its aps,including,but not limited to,those specifically alleged herein,is a separate and distinct violation of section b of the act,b,and section a and c of the regulations emphasis added.that the cftc elected to include multiple violations of the cea and the regulations promulgated thereunder in a single count in no way limits the charge to the commission of only one violation.it is undeniable that the complaint fairly informed levy that he was being charged with each material misrepresentation and omission as a separate and distinct violation of the cea and its implementing regulations.
levy insists,however,that slusser cftc,cir,supports his position.we disagree.in that case,slusser and the entities he controlled raised million by making fraudulent misrepresentations to a pool of german investors.id.at.the cftc complaint charged slusser with six counts of fraud,failure to abide by contractual limitations,and failure to register as a commodity pool operator.id.at.after trial,the cftc banned slusser from futures markets and fined him million.id.a panel of the seventh circuit vacated and remanded,observing that the cftc complaint listed six counts and charged only one violation per count.id.at.the court held that j ust as the sentence in a criminal case is limited by the number of counts alleged in an indictment so the penalty in an administrative prosecution is limited by the number of violations alleged in the complaint times the maximum fine per violation.id.emphasis added.in the absence of some charging language indicating that each count in fact represented multiple violations,a reasonable person in slusser position would have assumed that his maximum exposure was and financed his defense accordingly.id.the court concern was that the cftc had not fairly and adequately notified slusser as to the precise amount of his exposure.
here,by contrast,the cftc did not charge levy with only one violation,but rather made explicit on the face of its complaint that e ach material representation and omission of uig and its aps,including those specifically alleged in the complaint,is a separate and distinct violation of the cea.thus,after finding that levy had committed at least five violations of the commodity and exchange act,the district court properly multiplied the maximum civil monetary penalty of by five slusser suggests nothing more.
levy also says that,even if the civil monetary penalty is permissible under the commodity exchange act,the district court abused its discretion anyway,because the aggregate penalty is excessive.levy observes that the five testifying customers lost a total of,of which he himself earned only.levy argues that,like his settling,he should have been penalized only to the extent of his profits.a
