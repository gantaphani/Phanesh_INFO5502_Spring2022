at issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether promissory notes purportedly secured by accounts receivable of malaysian latex glove manufacturers constitute securities under the securities act of,a,and the securities exchange act of,a collectively the securities acts.the securities and exchange commission sec characterizes the notes as securities and part of a ponzi scheme,while the investment firm claims the notes are legitimate loans that are exempt from the securities laws.applying reves ernst young,d,we conclude that the notes are securities regulated by the securities acts.
background 
in january of,the sec filed a civil enforcement action against wallenbrock associates wallenbrock,along with its managing general partner,larry toshio osaki,its employee,van ichscinotsubo,and citadel capital management group,citadel collectively wallenbrock,to enjoin a fraudulent scheme to sell unregistered securities.
although wallenbrock story changed over time,the salient points of the plan are as follows from at least through january,wallenbrock sold promissory notes ostensibly secured by the accounts receivable of malaysian latex glove manufacturers.according to the investment materials,the glove manufacturers typically had to wait eighty to ninety days after shipment to collect from the american buyers,during which time the manufacturers might lose up to of their money due to exchange rate fluctuations.wallenbrock would step in to fill that gap when the manufacturer met with the buyer upon delivery and the buyer accepted the shipment,the buyer future payment was assigned to wallenbrock,who would then buy the account receivable for of its value.wallenbrock would carry the receivable until it received payment from the buyer,usually around ninety days after delivery.this arrangement seemed profitable for all parties manufacturers were willing to give a discounted rate in order to get cash immediately upon delivery,the buyers were able to delay their payments for eighty to ninety days,and wallenbrock would make a quick profit by paying a discounted rate up front,using the influx of cash from the investors,and collecting the full amount from the buyers ninety days later.
under this plan,the individual investor and wallenbrock would split the cost of the receivable,with each party owning a undivided secured interest in the account receivable.the notes had a maturity period with a guaranteed twenty percent return during that period.over the course of several years,wallenbrock sold more than million worth of notes to over investors in at least states.
after an investigation,the sec sought injunctive relief,alleging that wallenbrock violated the registration requirements of the act and general antifraud provisions of the securities acts wallenbrock acknowledged that it had misrepresented its role in the accounts receivables business,and explained that instead of buying the accounts directly,it actually funneled money into a checking account and then to an offshore trust,which purchased the accounts.wallenbrock consented to three orders a temporary restraining order enjoining future violations,pending a hearing on a preliminary injunction an order prohibiting the alteration of documents and permitting expedited discovery and an asset freeze.
subsequent discovery revealed that wallenbrock investment opportunity was in fact a pyramid scheme.the millions of dollars flowing through the bank account went,not to an offshore trust,as wallenbrock claimed,but to pay off earlier investors and to finance risky companies.the district court therefore granted the sec request for the appointment of a receiver.in this interlocutory appeal under a,wallenbrock challenges the not the the temporary orders and the appointment of the receiver,claiming that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the notes are not securities.
discussion 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the notes are securities.although wallenbrock frames the issue as one of the district court subject matter jurisdiction,because the question of whether the case involved a security was itself a federal question,el khadem equity sec,cir,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under.thus,wallenbrock real contention is that the injunction should not have been issued because the notes were not securities.we review these interlocutory orders for an abuse of discretion.johnson special educ.hearing office,cir.because this appeal rests on the legal question of the definition of a security,an error in that determination would necessarily constitute an abuse of discretion.id.
the act begins with the language that t he term security means any note.a.the presumption that a promissory note is a security,however,is rebuttable.reves,at.because congress was concerned with regulating the investment market,not with creating a general federal cause of action for fraud,we analyze whether the note is actually a type that congress intended to regulate.
under reves,we inquire first whether the promissory note bears a family resemblance to a list of instruments.id.at,citing exchange bank of chicago touche ross,cir.if so,then the note is not a security reves,at.if the note does not strongly resemble one of the enumerated exceptions,we then determine whether the note is a type that should be added to the list.id.although courts have treated this analysis as two separate steps,both inquiries involve the application of the same test,and so the two essentially collapse into a single inquiry although the test was originally conceived as a method of ascertaining whether an instrument resembles a,the supreme court has since framed it as an analysis of whether an instrument denominated a note is a security,and we follow the same convention.see also id.at it is impossible to make any meaningful inquiry into whether an instrument bears a resemblance to one of the instruments identified by the second circuit without specifying what it is about those instruments that makes them non securities.
we structure our inquiry,then,on an examination of the four reves factors the motivations that would prompt a reasonable seller and buyer to enter into the transaction the plan of distribution of the instrument the reasonable expectations of the investing public and whether some factor such as the existence of another regulatory scheme significantly reduces the risk of the instrument.id.at.failure to satisfy one of the factors is not dispositive they are considered as a whole.see,mcnabb,cir holding that,although the third factor supported neither side position,the notes in question nevertheless constituted securities.
based on the reves factors,we conclude that the promissory notes do not bear a sufficiently strong family resemblance to the list of,nor do they warrant addition of a new category to the list.we must also assess whether wallenbrock notes fall within the securities acts exception for notes with a maturity period of less than nine months.see a,a the term security shall not include any note which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months.because the notes are not of the nature contemplated by the exception,the safe harbor does not apply and the notes are regulated by the securities acts.
application of the reves factors 
although the notes may superficially resemble one of the listed exceptions notes secured by an assignment of accounts receivable,exchange bank,at similarity is not the end of our analysis,as wallenbrock urges,but the beginning.wallenbrock argues that we should adopt a literal approach because the notes are ostensibly secured by accounts receivable,they are exactly like the category of notes excluded from the definition of a security.in examining the notes,however,we look to the economic realities of the transaction.reves,at.it is not the moniker or label that is dispositive,but the economic characteristics of the notes.see id.
motivation for transaction 
the first factor is an objective inquiry into the motivations that would prompt a reasonable seller and buyer to enter into the transaction.mcnabb,at quoting reves,at.a note is more akin to a security i f the seller p
