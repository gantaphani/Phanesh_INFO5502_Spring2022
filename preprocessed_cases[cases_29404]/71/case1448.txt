certified accountants audit companies for many purposes,not least of which is to provide corporate directors with an objective assessment of their companies performance.audits are also prepared to give information to a specific investor who the auditor knows will rely on its contents.we must decide whether the law imposes an obligation on the auditor to provide an accurate accounting not to the corporation or known investor,but to anyone who reads and relies on it.we conclude that it does not.likewise,we hold that the particular investors involved in this case could not have justifiably relied on the audit reports as to purchases made after they knew the corporation was at risk of financial ruin,and they may not substitute their escrow agent reliance for their own without also being bound by its knowledge.finally,we reject the investors holder not that they bought or sold securities based on the auditor reports,but that they held them when they otherwise would not the absence of a direct communication with the auditors.for these reasons,we reverse in part the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that the investors take nothing.
respondents,prospect high income fund prospect,ml cbo iv cayman,pamco cayman,and pam capital funding,collectively,the funds,are bond and hedge funds.over a period,the funds bought bonds from epic resorts,llc epic,a vacation timeshare operator,at prices ranging from par value to of par value.epic is not a party to this case.
in,epic registered its bonds with the securities and exchange commission sec and sold them on the open market.the bonds,secured by epic assets,were high yield,below investment grade securities they were governed by an indenture,and an escrow and disbursement agreement with united states trust company of new york.the indenture required epic to pay the bondholders june and december interest payments of million until the bonds matured in.the indenture also mandated that epic file with the sec audited financial statements,an annual report,and an independent auditor report.epic also had to obtain a negative assurance from its auditor,confirming epic compliance with the indenture.
the indenture named trust as trustee for the bonds,and the escrow and disbursement agreement named trust as escrow agent.epic agreed to open an escrow account with trust,from the bond proceeds,at an initial amount of million.at all times thereafter,for the bondholders security,epic was required to maintain in the account funds sufficient to make the next required interest payment million.failure to maintain this minimum escrow balance for more than sixty days after receiving notice from trust constituted an event of default under the indenture.the account was to have been established in trust name,and required that all funds accepted by trust pursuant to this agreement shall be held for trust for the benefit of trust and the holders of the notes.
shortly after epic issued the bonds,of the four funds three bond purchases.epic made the requisite interest payments to its bondholders in june and december.subsequently,in march,epic retained grant thornton,llp to audit its financial statements and to review its statements for the first three quarters of.grant thornton discovered that epic had opened a trust cash management account,instead of the stipulated escrow account,and that the balance fell short of the required minimum.despite these discrepancies,grant thornton issued a report in april that confirmed epic continued compliance with the escrow requirement the financial statement showed cash in escrow,and note f stated that t he company maintains million at all times in escrow to cover the next required interest payment.according to grant thornton,epic told grant thornton that trust allowed epic to use more than one account the trust account plus a pnc account to meet its responsibilities under the indenture and escrow agreement that the combined balance of those accounts was never less than million that trust had never objected to the absence of funds in the trust account and that epic periodically transferred funds to trust to make the interest payment.
in early,highland capital management assumed the management of prospect portfolio.highland has more than billion in assets under management,with below investment grade bonds comprising about of its portfolio.davis deadman,highland senior portfolio manager,was responsible for the funds investments in epic and made all purchasing decisions for them.in december,cayman another one of the funds bought epic bonds,and epic timely made its december interest payment.around that time,epic primary lender,prudential which loaned epic million per week against its receivables,told epic that it would not be renewing its credit arrangement.according to epic president,the credit relationship with prudential was critical to epic existence and its ability to satisfy its obligations to bondholders,and prudential failure to renew the loan would devastat e epic.deadman learned early in the first quarter of of prudential but continued to buy bonds anyway,significantly increasing the funds holdings of epic debt.
on april,grant thornton issued its report,which again showed over million cash in escrow,and again confirmed that t he company maintains million at all times in escrow to cover the next required interest payment.on june,epic missed its scheduled interest payment to the bondholders.epic president testified that,although epic could have made the payment,prudential failure to renew the credit arrangement required epic to use the money to fund operations.four days later,the funds purchased more bonds and then took action to protect their investments.because epic missed interest payment constituted an event of default under the indenture,the funds forced epic into bankruptcy in july.the funds then sued grant thornton,alleging,among other things that the auditor reports misrepresented the escrow account status nevertheless,the highlands to buy epic bonds in february,in april,and again in april 
the funds alleged that grant thornton committed fraud,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,breach of contract,conspiracy to commit fraud,and aiding and abetting fraud.they sought damages equal to the full face value of all the bonds they purchased,plus five years of interest payments.the trial court granted grant thornton motion for summary judgment on all claims.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment on claims related to transactions,as well as on the breach of contract and negligence claims,but reversed on the negligent misrepresentation,fraud,conspiracy,and aiding and abetting claims.at.
on rehearing,we granted grant thornton petition for review,which asserts that there is no evidence of a causal connection between grant thornton alleged misrepresentation and the funds alleged injury that there is no evidence of actual and justifiable reliance and that liability for fraudulent misrepresentation runs only to those whom the auditor knows and intends to influence at the time the report is of which grant thornton contends were absent in this case 
the funds allege several bases for their claims that grant thornton misrepresentations led them to purchase additional bonds dissuaded them from investigating whether the minimum balance was being maintained in the escrow account,which prevented them from forcing epic into bankruptcy sooner and induced them to refrain from selling bonds holder claims.
ii.bond purchases 
we turn first to the funds complaints that they would not have purchased epic bonds had grant thornton disclosed the escrow irregularities.
scope of liability 
one of the funds,cayman,bought bonds after grant thornton issued its audit report and before the funds learned that prudential would not renew epic credit facility.but grant thornton argues that cayman,a potential investor,was not within its scope of liability when the audit report was published.to address this claim,we first examine the evolution of auditor liability law.
negligent misrepresentation 
auditor liability to third parties an overview 
for over seventy years,state courts have debated the contours of liability when an auditor negligent misrepresentation injures a third party.see generally,jay feinman,liability of accountants for negligent auditing doctrine,policy,and ideology.jodi scherl,comment,evolution of auditor liability to noncontractual third parties balancing the equities and weighing the consequences,am.for the first half of the twentieth century,the seminal case on auditor liability was justice cardozo new york court of appeals opinion,ultramares touche,niven.in ultramares,the court discussed what it termed the assault upon the citadel of privity.ultramares,at.the court refused to extend negligence foreseeability principle to economic losses caused by an auditor lapse,absent a bond so close as to approach that of privity.id.at.the court coined a phrase that would echo through succeeding opinions nationwide if liability for negligence exists,a thoughtless slip or blunder,the failure to detect a theft or forgery beneath the cover of deceptive entries,may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.id.at.
over the ensuing decades,however,courts began to stray from ultramares and expand auditors scope of liability.these cases fall along a spectrum,with ultramares on one end requiring privity,or,and a handful of cases on the other holding that mere foreseeability suffices to establish liability.the leading case in the latter camp is from new jersey,rosenblum,adler.likening a negligent audit to a defective product,the court held that the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the negligent act define the duty and should be actionable.rosenblum,at.few states have adopted this approach,and rosenblum itself was superseded by a statute replacing it with a standard,stat.ann.see,touche ross commercial union ins,so d,citizens state bank timm,schmidt,d.
new york and other states have drifted only cautiously from ultramares strict standard,adopting a predicate to auditor liability.the leading case behind this model is credit alliance arthur andersen.credit alliance applied a inquiry to determine whether an auditor and a third party have sufficient privity to implicate liability,namely a particular purpose for the accountants report,a known relying party,and some conduct on the part of the accountants linking them to that party.id.at.in applying this test,the court held that even though the auditor was aware that the third party would receive the report,it was not liable because there was no allegation that the auditor had any direct dealings with plaintiffs,had specifically agreed to prepare the report for plaintiffs use or according to plaintiffs requirements,or had specifically agreed to provide plaintiffs with a copy or actually did so.id.the high courts in maryland,montana,and idaho have explicitly adopted credit alliance reasoning.see idaho bank trust first bancorp of idaho,idaho walpert,smullian blumenthal,katz,thayer hicks.
the american law institute restatement second of torts included a section on information negligently supplied for the guidance of others.restatement second of torts.section offers a approach to auditor liability,providing that 
o ne who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information t he liability stated is limited to loss suffered 
a by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it and 
b through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.
of the various approaches taken by states,most have embraced the restatement formulation.see feinman.at.although the restatement has been criticized it provides a window through which direct victims of auditor negligence can demand accountability without unleashing potentially unlimited auditor liability.the most thorough exponent of the restatement construct can be found in a case from the supreme court of california,bily arthur young,cal.after surveying the waterfront of auditor liability to third persons,the bily court concluded that the restatement approach 
is most consistent with the elements and policy foundations of the tort of negligent misrepresentation.the rule expressed there attempts to define a narrow and circumscribed class of persons to whom or for whom representations are made.in this way,it recognizes commercial realities by avoiding both unlimited and uncertain liability for economic losses in cases of professional mistake and exoneration of the auditor in situations where it clearly intended to undertake the responsibility of influencing particular business transactions involving third persons.
for nearly two decades,we have similarly embraced the restatement approach.see mccamish,martin,brown loeffler f.appling interests,see also fed.land bank ass sloane.in mccamish,we examined whether the absence of an relationship precluded a third party from suing an attorney for negligent misrepresentation under restatement section.mccamish,at.we held that,under certain circumstances,section causes of action can be brought by third parties against attorneys,just as they have been legitimately brought against auditors,accountants,and other professionals.id.at.
we explained that a section cause of action is available only when information is transferred by an attorney to a known party for a known purpose.id.at emphasis added.under section,a known party is one who falls in a limited class of potential claimants,for whose benefit and guidance one intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it.id.quoting restatement second of torts a.this formulation limits liability to situations in which the professional who provides the information is aware of the nonclient and intends that the nonclient rely on the information.id.unless a plaintiff falls within this scope of liability,a defendant can not be found liable for negligent misrepresentation.
mccamish has served as a guidepost for our courts of appeals in analyzing the tort of negligent misrepresentation in contrast to earlier decisions applying a broader standard we reaffirm today that mccamish represents texas law under section of the restatement.
was cayman within a limited class 
cayman bought bonds in december,allegedly in reliance on the audit report,issued in april.grant thornton contends that cayman,which had never before purchased epic bonds,was indistinguishable from any other unknown potential investor,and thus outside grant thornton scope of liability.cayman counters that it falls within a limited class because few investors actually purchase high yield debt like the bonds at issue here.we find cayman argument unpersuasive.epic bonds were sold on the open market that only certain investors bought them does not make those investors a limited group.as the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit has explained,to interpret the limited group requirement as including all potential investors would render that requirement meaningless.scottish heritable trust,plc peat marwick main,cir applying texas law like the fifth circuit,we do not suggest that a potential purchaser can never be a member of a limited group,but the facts here do not support such a determination.see scottish heritable trust,at noting that potential investor with no previous connection to either the corporation or the accountant was not within such a group.cayman had no prior connection to epic or grant thornton,and predicating scope of liability on grant thornton general knowledge that investors may purchase epic bonds would eviscerate the restatement rule in favor of a de facto foreseeability approach we have refused to embrace.see id.
the court of appeals in this case held that a fact issue precluded summary judgment on the limited class issue because appellants already owned epic bonds and were not merely members of a large universe of potential investors.at noting that authorities suggest that existing investors may fall within limited class.while this may have been true as to some of the funds,it was not the case for cayman,which did not buy bonds until december.because cayman was not within a limited group when it bought bonds in december,it was outside grant thornton scope of liability.see mccamish,at.

although similar in their essential elements,fraud is more difficult to prove than negligent misrepresentation due to the added element of intent to deceive.richter,bank of america trust sav.ass n,cir applying texas law see also perenco nig.ashland,cir applying texas law.
in ernst young pacific mutual,we confirmed the intent standard for fraud under section of the restatement second of torts as a party reason to expect that its representations will affect other parties conduct.ernst young,pacific mutual life ins.in that case,pacific mutual bought notes issued by interfirst.id.pacific mutual later sued ernst young,an accounting firm,for releasing audit reports that allegedly misrepresented the financial strength of a company that merged with interfirst.id.seeking to prove that ernst young knew that investors would rely on the audit reports,pacific mutual produced affidavits stating that it is a commonly known and accepted practice in the financial industry for investors to rely on representations like those made by ernst young.id at.the court of appeals held that these affidavits alone presented a fact issue as to whether the auditor had reason to expect that institutional investors would rely on its representations.id.at.
we rejected that view,holding that the standard requires more than mere foreseeability the claimant reliance must be especially likely and justifiable,and the transaction sued upon must be the type the defendant contemplated.id.at.we observed that the evidence referred to what is commonly known or expected in the investment community,but we noted that even an obvious risk that a third person will rely on a representation is not enough to impose liability.general industry practice or knowledge may establish a basis for foreseeability to show negligence,but it is not probative of fraudulent intent.id.at citation omitted.we held that the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the accounting firm,which had no relationship with the investors and no special reason to expect the investors reliance on the audit report.id.at.
in this case,the court of appeals held that there was a fact issue regarding whether grant thornton had reason to expect that it was especially likely that the funds would receive and rely upon epic audited financial statements.at.the court based its determination on the indenture reference to epic securityholders.id.noting that the indenture provides epic shall file with the commission and shall furnish to the trustee and each securityholder copies of the quarterly and annual reports and of the information,documents,and other reports.even if this provision suggested that grant thornton may have been aware of existing bondholders as a limited class,a question we need not reach,it does not meet the requisite standard as to prospective purchasers,like cayman,who claim to have relied on the audit report.cayman claim is like the one we rejected in pacific mutual,and it fails for the same reasons.
in,several of the existing and prospective epic bonds.the parties hotly dispute whether existing bondholders are within grant thornton scope of liability.we need not resolve that disagreement,however,as we conclude that there was no evidence that those funds justifiably relied on the audit reports or the negative assurance statement.
the funds could not have justifiably relied on the audit reports after learning of prudential failure to renew epic credit facility.
both fraud and negligent misrepresentation require that the plaintiff show actual and justifiable reliance.pacific mutual,at fed.land bank ass sloane.in measuring justifiability,we must inquire whether,given a fraud plaintiff individual characteristics,abilities,and appreciation of facts and circumstances at or before the time of the alleged fraud,it is extremely unlikely that there is actual reliance on the plaintiff part.haralson e.hutton group,cir applying texas law.moreover,a person may not justifiably rely on a representation if there are red flags indicating such reliance is unwarranted.lewis bank of am.na,cir holding that plaintiff decision to enter into transaction without undertaking additional investigation into tax consequences was not justifiable,given his access to professional accountants,the amount of money involved,and the ambiguous nature of the pertinent representation quoting in re mercer,cir.
accordingly,we must examine the timing of the relevant purchases.obviously,bonds purchased before epic hired grant thornton in march could not have been bought in reliance on the audit reports with respect to bonds purchased by pam capital,pamco,prospect,and cayman after deadman learned that prudential would not renew epic credit arrangement,however,we agree with grant thornton that such reliance was unjustifiable.deadman,an experienced bond investor with a bachelor degree in finance and a masters in business administration,testified that prudential credit facility really was the lifeblood of the company.without it,the company would have to shut down or replace it.nonetheless,knowing that epic had lost its primary source of funding,the funds continued to buy bonds in april,may,and after epic failed to make its scheduled june interest payment deadman purchased these bonds at prices ranging from to of par that,deadman admitted,reflected a substantial risk that the bonds would not be redeemed for face value.if these funds relied on the or audit reports in making the purchases,that reliance would not have been justifiable in light of the funds knowledge that prudential had cut off epic lifeblood.
there is no evidence the funds relied on the negative assurance statement.
nor is there evidence that the funds relied on the negative assurance statement.the statement verified that in making the examination necessary for certification of such financial statements nothing has come to grant thornton attention which would lead it to believe that the issuers have violated any provisions of article,or of this indenture insofar as they relate to accounting matters or,if any such violation has occurred,specifying the nature and period of existence thereof,it being understood that such accountants shall not be liable to any person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation grant thornton provided the statement to epic in april,but the statement was not part of epic public filing.
it is undisputed that the funds never received or reviewed the statement.nevertheless,the funds contend that because trust,their escrow agent and trustee,received and relied upon that statement,then the funds,in effect,relied on the statement by proxy.grant thornton contends that,until the court of appeals decision in this case,texas courts have never recognized such a vicarious reliance theory.regardless,grant thornton argues,if trust reliance is to be imputed to the funds,so too should trust knowledge of the escrow account irregularities.we agree with grant thornton.
although an agent knowledge is generally imputed to its principal,the court of appeals declined to do so because trust was an escrow agent and owed fiduciary duties to both the funds and to epic.accordingly,the court held that grant thornton had not proved as a matter of law that imputation of trust knowledge was appropriate.at noting that grant thornton authorities all involve agents operating for a single principal.but when,as here,there is a dual agent,operating with the consent and knowledge of both principals,the agent knowledge is imputed to its principals 
sirojni dindial,trust officer in charge of the epic account,testified that she was unaware of the escrow agreement and did not know that it appointed trust as the escrow agent.the court of appeals held that this created a fact issue regarding trust knowledge of its role as escrow agent.id.at.we disagree.trust was a party to the escrow agreement that a trust employee was unaware of its existence does not create a fact issue as to the company knowledge of its contract.duncan.robertson,holding that in the absence of fraud or imposition,a party to a contract,which has been voluntarily signed and executed by him,with full opportunity for information as to its contents,can not avoid it on the ground of his own negligence or omission to read it quoting indem.ins.macatee sons.
finally,the court of appeals held that there was a fact issue regarding whether trust was acting adversely to the funds,precluding imputation of its knowledge to the funds.at noting that an agent knowledge is not imputed to its principal if the agent has an adverse interest in not revealing it.grant thornton argues that there is no evidence that trust interests were adverse to the funds interests at all,much less that trust was concerned only for itself.see goldstein union bank,holding that rule of imputation applies unless the agent interests are so incompatible with the interests of his principal as practically to destroy the agency or to render it reasonably probable that agent will not act on his acquired knowledge nor disclose it to his principal.but even assuming the adverse interest exception applied,the funds would not be able to claim trust reliance as their own while simultaneously asserting that its knowledge should not bind them.see id.at noting that when a principal has consummated a transaction in whole or in part through an agent,it is contrary to equity and good conscience that he should be permitted to avail himself of the benefits of his agent participation without becoming responsible as well for his agent knowledge as for his agent act quoting irvine grady.as one court has observed,in such situations 
t he principal is impaled on the horns of a dilemma.if he disclaims the agent act as unauthorized,he has no grounds to retain the fruits thereof on the other hand,if he retains the fruits of the agent act,after knowledge of the facts,he must in fairness be charged with the agent knowledge.
great american indemnity first nat.bank of holdenville,cir see also floyd mechem,a treatise on the law of agency,at ed.w here the agent is the sole representative of the corporation,the corporation can not sic claim anything except through him and that therefore if it claims through him,after notice of the facts,it must accept his agency with its attendant notice.
the funds do not is there any grant thornton colluded with trust to defraud the funds,such that the general rule of imputation would not apply.see worth pippen,see also fdic shrader york,cir.in fact,they argue quite the opposite they repeatedly refer to trust as a representative of the funds,and they assert that trust was relying on grant thornton to determine whether the indenture had been violated.the funds submitted testimony from trust representatives,who stated that trust relied on epic independent public accountants for this certification had these accountants indicated that something had come to their attention which would lead them to believe that the issuers have violated any provisions of articles,or of the indenture,u.trust would have taken whatever steps may have been required under the indenture.
because the funds may not substitute trust reliance for their own without also inheriting its knowledge,its claims based on the negative assurance statement fail.see irvine,at observing that it is inequitable for the principal to avail himself of the agent acts without being held to know what the agent knows.
iii.holder claims 
finally,we turn to the funds holder claims,in which they contend not that grant thornton misrepresentations induced them to take action,but rather that they induced them to refrain from doing so the funds allege that,but for grant thornton representations,they would have sold their bonds sooner,when doing so would have been more profitable,or they would have forced epic into bankruptcy sooner,when it had more assets to liquidate.the funds urge the court to consider the propriety of such claims,citing a texas appellate decision,later withdrawn,shirvanian defrates.lexis,at dist,holding that forbearance from selling stock,in reliance on direct communications made for the purpose of preventing plaintiffs from selling their stock,could form the basis of a cause of action for fraud under texas law,opinion withdrawn and substituted by shirvanian defrates,dist,pet.denied.we have never before considered the issue.
in a holder claim,the plaintiff alleges not that the defendant wrongfully induced the plaintiff to purchase or sell stock,but that the defendant wrongfully induced the plaintiff to continue holding his stock.as a result,the plaintiff seeks damages for the diminished value of the stock,or the value of a forfeited opportunity,allegedly caused by the defendant misrepresentations.newby enron in re enron,derivative erisa litig,d,small fritz,cal.the supreme court has refused to recognize holder claims under federal securities law,primarily due to their speculative nature and difficulties in proof.blue chip stamps manor drug stores.the court observed that a putative plaintiff,who neither purchases nor sells securities but sues instead for intangible economic injury such as loss of a noncontractual opportunity to buy or sell,is more likely to be seeking a largely conjectural and speculative recovery id.as the court explained 
the manner in which the defendant violation caused the plaintiff to fail to act could be as a result of the reading of a prospectus,as respondent claims here,but it could just as easily come as a result of a claimed reading of information contained in the financial pages of a local newspaper.plaintiff proof would not be that he purchased or sold stock,a fact which would be capable of documentary verification in most situations,but instead that he decided not to purchase or sell stock.plaintiff entire testimony could be dependent upon uncorroborated oral evidence of many of the crucial elements of his claim,and still be sufficient to go to the jury.the jury would not even have the benefit of weighing the plaintiff version against the defendant version,since the elements to which the plaintiff would testify would be in many cases totally unknown and unknowable to the defendant.the very real risk in permitting those in respondent position to sue under rule is that the door will be open to recovery of substantial damages on the part of one who offers only his own testimony to prove that he ever consulted a prospectus of the issuer,that he paid any attention to it,or that the representations contained in it damaged him.
blue chip stamps,at.the supreme court concluded that holder claims were impermissible in federal rule actions,recognizing that its holding might be viewed as an arbitrary restriction which unreasonably prevents some deserving plaintiffs from recovering damages which have in fact been caused by violations of rule.id.at.that disadvantage,however,was attenuated to the extent that remedies are available to nonpurchasers and nonsellers under state law.id.at.
and yet,a number of courts have rejected such claims.see crocker fdic,cir finding that an alleged lost profit opportunity under mississippi law was too speculative to state any injury apart from a diminution in the value of stock claim could not,therefore,be brought as a nonderivative claim newby,d at guessing that this court would not recognize holder claims or,if it did,would do so only if heightened pleading standards were satisfied wm high yield fund,dist.lexis,at,predicting that the pennsylvania supreme court would not recognize holder claims arnlund deloitte touche llp,d,e.chanoff surgical,holding that state law claims for damages based on failure to sell or hedge stock are too speculative to be actionable,aff,cir dloogatch brincat,dismissing holder claim because plaintiffs failed to plead reliance with sufficient specificity and did not show that they suffered a compensable loss holmes grubman,in many of the decisions on which appellees rely,holder claims were not categorically rejected,but the plaintiffs failed to allege or prove that they specifically desired to sell their stock at a certain time,or causation was not sufficiently alleged or proved.
conversely,courts in several states including california massachusetts new jersey and new have recognized holder claims.those decisions generally observe that fraud does not cease being so when it induces a party to refrain from acting.see,gutman howard sav.bank,lies which deceive and injure do not become innocent merely because the deceived continue to do something rather than begin to do something else.because i nducement is the substance of reliance,the form of or not critical to the actionability of fraud.id.the restatement second of torts is in accord.restatement second of torts one who fraudulently makes a misrepresentation of fact,opinion,intention or law for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it,is subject to liability to the other in deceit for pecuniary loss caused to him by his justifiable reliance upon the misrepresentation.emphasis added see also id.most recently,the georgia supreme court,on certified question from the second circuit court of appeals,held that holder claims were cognizable under georgia law.holmes,at.
but even those courts that have recognized holder claims in some form generally have demanded that plaintiffs meet heightened pleading and proof standards.see id.holding that although we have determined that holder claims should be recognized under georgia law,we further conclude that the limitations imposed in other jurisdictions are appropriate see also newby enron in re enron,derivative erisa litig,no,dist.lexis at,rogers cisco,d,guessing that florida courts would recognize holder claims but would require the specificity in allegations of reliance recently recognized by the supreme court of california small fritz decision.some require more exacting allegations and evidence of reliance while others require a showing that parties held onto securities as a result of information they received through some direct communication with the defendants 
the sole reported texas case to permit a holder claim involved just such facts.see shirvanian.lexis.in that case,the plaintiffs,after having expressed an intent to sell their majority stock,received numerous and reassurances from defendants that the company was experiencing no problems,and was in fact on the verge of profit.id.at.both the president and chief financial officer of the company insisted that it would be unwise for plaintiffs to sell their stock,and,in reliance on their statements,the plaintiffs refrained from doing so.id.immediately thereafter,the company issued several press releases reporting that it had not met its projected earnings,and the stock price plummeted.id.at.
the court held that plaintiffs claims were qualitatively different than those in cases where the basis for the fraud claims are financial statements,annual reports,sec filings or similar public communications.in those cases,in the absence of direct misrepresentations,plaintiffs often are not able to establish the requisite elements of their fraud claim.id.at.this holding is consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions that have permitted holder claims only upon proof of direct communication.see,new york city employees ret.ebbers in re worldcom.sec.litig,d,holding that there must be a sufficiently direct communication from the defendant to the plaintiff to support a claim that the fraud induced inaction gutman.at holding that a holder claim may proceed where plaintiffs allege that misrepresentations were directed at them to their injury.
in line with shirvanian,a federal district court sitting in texas refused to acknowledge holder claims in which there were no allegations of any direct or personal communication between plaintiffs and defendants.newby,dist.lexis at.in newby,institutional investors sued jpmorgan chase for allegedly misrepresenting enron financial strength in analyst reports that were reiterated in financial news outlets,and for conspiring with enron to produce fraudulent financial statements.id.at.predicting that this court would limit,if not totally exclude,holder claims under texas common law fraud,the court rejected the investors claims 
plaintiffs second amended complaint clearly indicates that the sources of information on which plaintiffs relied were enron sec financial statements,which jpmorgan transactions allegedly helped make false,and which were issued to the public at large,as well as on analyst reports,financial information services and news,all disseminated to the public at large,but not on any direct or specifically targeted contact between plaintiffs and jpmorgan.plaintiffs also claim they relied on information created by defendant and disseminated through various media outlets to plaintiffs and other investors,again a public misrepresentation,not a direct communication.furthermore none of these sources of information has been pleaded with specificity.without particularity in the pleading of the misrepresentations or of actual and justifiable reliance based on direct communication,the pandora box of vexatious and meritless suits feared by the blue chip stamps court in affirming the birnbaum rule would be realized in texas state courts under common law fraud.
we agree with those courts that have concluded that holder claims,to the extent they are viable,must involve a direct communication between the plaintiff and the defendant.those claims are less like holder claims and more like the ordinary case of deceit described by the supreme court.blue chip stamps,at noting that a misrepresentation which leads to a refusal to purchase or to sell is actionable in just the same way as a misrepresentation which leads to the consummation of a purchase or sale.but this is not such a case.
it is undisputed that the funds had no direct communications with grant thornton.rather,the alleged misrepresentations were in publicly available documents.in fact,deadman testified that his review of the audit reports and financial statements would have been via an online source available to any member of the public we need not decide today whether a holder claim involving more specific and direct communications is actionable under texas law because this is not such a claim we merely decline to permit such a claim in the absence of any direct communication.we hold,therefore,that grant thornton was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the funds holder claims.
iv.conspiracy and aiding and 
the funds argue that,even if grant thornton itself did not commit fraud,it conspired with epic in defrauding the funds.similarly,the funds aiding and abetting claim is based on grant thornton alleged assistance to epic in making false statements regarding the escrow account and the financial condition of epic resorts.both claims are premised on misrepresentations,but the only misrepresentations the funds have identified are those in the audit reports,financial statements,and negative assurance statement.because the fraud claim based on those misrepresentations fails,the conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims dependent on that fraud fails as well.see pacific mutual,at holding that because fraud claim against auditor failed,this necessarily dispose d of conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims,which were premised on the auditor alleged fraud.
conclusion 
cayman was outside grant thornton scope of liability as to the december bond purchase,and there is no evidence of justifiable reliance by any of the funds as to purchases in or as to the negative assurance statement.the funds holder claims fail in the absence of a direct communication.no evidence supports the funds conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims.we reverse in part the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that the funds take nothing.tex.c.
