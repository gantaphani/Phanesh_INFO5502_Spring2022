brokers and dealers are not subject to the requirements of the investment advisers act iaa where their investment advice is solely incidental to the conduct of their business as a broker or dealer,and the broker or dealer receives no special compensation therefor.a c.the securities and exchange commission,acting pursuant to a f and a of the iaa,a f,a,promulgated a final rule exempting from the iaa when they receive special compensation therefor.see certain deemed not to be investment advisers.the financial planning association fpa petitions for review of the final rule on the ground that the sec has exceeded its authority.we agree,and we therefore grant the petition and vacate the final rule.
the iaa was enacted by congress as one title of a bill to provide for the registration and regulation of investment companies and investment advisers,tit.ii,stat.the other title was the investment company act ica,tit.i,stat.these were the last in a series of congressional enactments designed to eliminate certain abuses in the securities industry that contributed to the stock market crash of and the depression of the.congress had previously enacted the securities act of,the securities exchange act of hereinafter the exchange act,the public utility holding company act of,and the trust indenture act of.
a fundamental purpose,common to these statutes,was to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus to achieve a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.sec capital gains research bureau,d.the iaa arose from a consensus between industry and the sec that investment advisers could not completely perform their basic to clients on a personal basis competent,unbiased,and continuous advice regarding the sound management of their all conflicts of interest between the investment counsel and the client were removed.id.at.citation omitted.according to the committee reports,t he essential purpose of the iaa was to protect the public from the frauds and misrepresentations of unscrupulous tipsters and touts and to safeguard the honest investment adviser against the stigma of the activities of these individuals by making fraudulent practices by investment advisers unlawful,at.
virtually no limitations or restrictions exist with respect to the honesty and integrity of individuals who may solicit funds to be controlled,managed,and supervised individuals assuming to act as investment advisers at present can enter contracts which are nothing more than heads i win,tails you lose arrangements.contracts with investment advisers which are of a personal nature may be assigned and the control of funds of investors may be transferred to others without the knowledge or consent of the client.
under the iaa,investment advisers are required,among other things,to register and to maintain records,c e to limit the type of contracts they enter,id.and not to engage in certain types of deceptive and fraudulent transactions,id.congress has amended the iaa on several occasions see vii louis loss joel seligman,securities regulation ed,but the provisions at issue in this appeal have remained,in relevant part,unchanged.
in a of the iaa,congress broadly defined investment adviser as 
any person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others,either directly or through publications or writings,as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities,or who,for compensation and as part of a regular business,issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities 
a.carving out six exemptions from this broad definition,congress determined that an investment adviser did not include 
a a bank,or any bank holding company as defined in the bank holding company act of which is not an investment company,except that the term investment adviser includes any bank or bank holding company to the extent that such bank or bank holding company serves or acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment company,but if,in the case of a bank,such services or actions are performed through a separately identifiable department or division,the department or division,and not the bank itself,shall be deemed to be the investment adviser 
b any lawyer,accountant,engineer,or teacher whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the practice of his profession 
c any broker or dealer whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor 
d the publisher of any bona fide newspaper,news magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation 
e any person whose advice,analyses,or reports relate to no securities other than securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the united states,or securities issued or guaranteed by corporations in which the united states has a direct or indirect interest which shall have been designated by the secretary of the treasury,pursuant to section a of the securities exchange act of,as exempted securities for the purposes of that act or 
f such other persons not within the intent of this paragraph,as the commission may designate by rules and regulations or order.
a emphasis added.subsections c and f are at issue in this appeal.
before enactment of the iaa,and others who offered investment advice received two general forms of compensation.some charged only traditional commissions earning a certain amount for each securities transaction completed.others charged a separate advice fee often a certain percentage of the customer assets under advisement or supervision.see.the committee reports recognized that the statutory exemption for reflected this distinction the reports explained that the term investment adviser was so defined as specifically to exclude brokers insofar as their advice is merely incidental to brokerage transactions for which they receive only brokerage commissions,at ha,at ha.
the final rule took a different approach.after determining in that certain new forms of adopted by were not fundamentally different from traditional brokerage programs,the sec proposed a rule very similar to the final rule,see notice of proposed rulemaking,nopr,stating it would act as if it had already issued the rule,id.at.in adopting the temporary rule,pursuant to subsection f and its general rulemaking authority under iaa a,the sec exempted a new group of from the iaa.after the rule in january,again pursuant to its authority under subsection f and a,the sec adopted a slightly modified final rule on april,codified at a.
the final rule provides,generally,in paragraph a,on programs,that a who receives special compensation will not be deemed an investment adviser if any advice provided is solely incidental to brokerage services provided on a customer account and specific disclosure is made to the customer in paragraph a,on discount brokerage programs,a will not be deemed to have received special compensation merely because it charges one customer more or less for brokerage services than it charges another customer.paragraph b lists three circumstances in which advisory services,for which special compensation is received under paragraph a,would not be performed solely incidental to brokerage when a separate fee or contract exists for advice a customer receives certain financial planning services and,generally,a has investment discretion over a client account.paragraph c states a special rule that registered under the exchange act are investment advisers only for those accounts for which they receive compensation that subjects them to the iaa.paragraph d defines the term investment discretion,which appears in paragraphs a and b,to have the same meaning as a of the exchange act,a,except for discretion granted by a customer on a temporary or limited basis.
the fpa petitions for review,challenging the sec authority to promulgate the final rule we first address the threshold issue presented by the sec challenge to fpa standing.
article iii standing is a fundamental prerequisite to any exercise of the court jurisdiction,see lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and requires,at the irreducible constitutional minimum,a showing that the litigant has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent,traceable to the challenged act,and redressable by the court.see allen wright,d simon.welfare rights,d.a petitioner must support each element of its claim to standing by affidavit or other evidence.defenders of wildlife,at.see sierra club epa.the sec maintains that the fpa fails to show because fpa assertions of injury from the final rule dual standard are conclusory.
the standard for representational standing is 
a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
united food commercial workers union local brown group,d quoting hunt.state apple adver.comm n,d.the fpa meets this test.
the court has repeatedly recognized that parties suffer constitutional injury in fact when agencies allow increased competition against them.telecom ass fcc,citation omitted.the fpa is a organization with over members that exists to advance the financial planning profession.see decl.of daniel moisand,president of the fpa,petitioner.the final rule creates a dual standard for the provision of investment advice.first,there are investment advisers who are covered by the iaa many fpa members are investment advisers,and must comply with the iaa.see fpa comment letter of.second,there is a new group of who are exempted from the iaa even though their activities do not conform to the requirements of subsection c.the two groups compete for customers,and under the final rule one of them including fpa members must continue to comply with the iaa,while the other one the in the new,exempt category need not.
additionally,contrary to the sec view,the fpa also has prudential standing.its members are within the iaa zone of interest,see clarke sec.indus.ass n,d,because one of congress purposes in enacting the iaa was to protect the ability of bona fide investment advisers to compete on a level regulatory playing field with those advisers who did not fully disclose their conflicts of interest,see capital gains,at.
accordingly,we hold that the fpa has standing to bring its petition.
the fpa contends that when congress enacted the iaa,congress identified in subsection c the group of it intended to exempt,and that subsection f was only intended to allow the sec to exempt new groups from the iaa,not to expand the groups that congress specifically addressed.the resolution of the fpa challenge thus turns on whether the sec is authorized under a f or a to except from iaa coverage an additional group of beyond the exempted by congress in subsection c,a c.subsection f of a authorizes the sec to except from the iaa such other persons not within the intent of this paragraph,as the commission may designate by rules and regulations or order.a f.as such,we review the sec exercise of its authority pursuant to subsection f under the familiar analysis of chevron,natural res.def.council,d.under step one,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.under step two,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.in reviewing an agency interpretation of its authority under a statute it administers,the court will uphold that interpretation as long as it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.see village of bergen ferc.
applying the traditional tools of statutory construction,see chevron,at,the court looks to the text,structure,and the overall statutory scheme,as well as the problem congress sought to solve.see pdk labs.dea,sierra club epa.all four elements demonstrate that the sec has exceeded its authority in promulgating the rule under a f because congress has addressed the precise issue at hand.
section a lists exemptions a e from the broad definition of investment adviser for several classes of,for example,lawyers,accountants,and others whose advice is solely incidental to their regular business and publishers of newsletters that circulate widely and do not give financial advice.among the iaa exemptions is subsection c exemption for any broker or dealer whose performance of such investment advisory services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.emphasis added.beyond the listed exemptions,subsection f authorizes the sec to exempt from the iaa such other persons not within the intent of this paragraph,as the commission may designate by rules and regulations or order.emphasis added.
in the final rule,the sec purports to use its authority under subsection f to broaden the exemption for provided under subsection c.the rule is inconsistent with the iaa,however,because it fails to meet either of the two requirements for an exemption under subsection f.first,the legislative intent does not support an exemption for broader than the exemption set forth in the text of subsection c therefore,the final rule does not meet the statutory requirement that exemptions under subsection f be consistent with the intent of paragraph of section a.second,because are already expressly addressed in subsection c,they are not other persons under subsection f therefore the sec can not use its authority under subsection f to establish new,broader exemptions for.
the final rule exemption for is broader than the statutory exemption for under subsection c.although the sec maintains that the intent of paragraph is to exempt who receive special compensation for investment advice red br.oral arg.tape at,the plain text of subsection c exempts only who do not receive special compensation for investment advice.the word any is usually understood to be all inclusive.see new york epa.as t he plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,united states ron pair,d quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d,the terms of the iaa establish the precise conditions under which are exempt from the iaa.to read out of a statutory provision a clause setting forth a specific condition or trigger to the provision applicability is an entirely unacceptable method of construing statutes.natural res.def.council epa.
no other indicators of congressional intent support the sec interpretation of its authority under subsection f.the relevant language in the committee reports suggests that congress deliberately drafted the exemption in subsection c to apply as written.those reports stated that the term investment adviser is so defined as specifically to exclude brokers insofar as their advice is merely incidental to brokerage transactions for which they receive only brokerage commissions,at emphasis added ha see also,at ha.by seeking to exempt beyond those who receive only brokerage commissions for investment advice,the sec has promulgated a final rule that is in direct conflict with both the statutory text and the committee reports.
the text of subsection f confirms this conclusion by the limiting the sec exemption authorization to other persons.we agree with the fpa that when congress enacted the iaa,congress identified the specific classes of persons it intended to exempt.as to,subsection c applied to any broker or dealer.congress,through the use of contrasting text in subsection f,signaled that it only authorized the sec to exempt other persons when consistent with the intent of the paragraph,and thus only when doing so would not override congress determination of the appropriate persons to be exempted from the iaa requirements.
as the fpa points out,the word other connotes existing besides,or distinct from,that already mentioned or implied.ii the shorter oxford english dictionary ed,republished.see key allstate ins,cir citing the american heritage dictionary.there is nothing to suggest that congress did not intend the words any or other to have their ordinary or natural meaning.smith united states,d.so understood,courts have hesitated to allow parties to use language structurally similar to the other persons clause in subsection f to redefine or otherwise avoid specific requirements in existing statutory exceptions.in liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d,for example,the supreme court noted that where federal rule of civil procedure b contained five explicit grounds for relief,and one any other reason clause,emphasis added the structure of the clauses suggested that the final clause could not be used to elude or enlarge the first clause and clauses through are mutually exclusive.emphasis added.accord pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,d hesling csx transp,cir united states erdoss,cir.similarly,in am.bankers ass sec,this court explained that 
a universal clause preceding every definition in the statute,which states only unless the context otherwise requires,can not provide the authority for one of the agencies whose jurisdictional boundaries are defined in the statute to alter by administrative regulation those very jurisdictional boundaries.to suggest otherwise is to sanction administrative autonomy beyond the control of either congress or the courts.
our dissenting colleague attempts to distinguish these two cases as limited to situations in which one agency seeks to redraw the jurisdictional boundaries of another agency.see dissenting op.at.that interpretation,however,ignores the underlying principle in each case where the statutory text is clear,an agency may not use general clauses to redefine the jurisdictional boundaries set by the statute.
just as the text and structure of paragraph of a make it evident that congress intended to define investment adviser broadly and create only a precise exemption for,so does a consideration of the problems congress sought to address in enacting the iaa.a comprehensive study conducted by the sec pursuant to the public utility holding company act of indicated that many investment counsel have strayed a great distance from that professed function of furnishing disinterested,personalized,continuous supervision of investments.securities and exchange commission,investment counsel,investment management,investment supervisory and investment advisory services,at quoting testimony of brokerage executive james white,of scudder,stevens clark.floor debate on the iaa called attention to the fact that while this study was being conducted investment trusts and investment companies had perpetrated some of the most flagrant abuses and grossest violations of fiduciary duty to investors.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of wagner.congress reiterated throughout its proceedings an intention to protect investors and bona fide investment advisers 
the overall statutory scheme of the iaa addresses the problems identified to congress in two principal ways first,by establishing a federal fiduciary standard to govern the conduct of investment advisers,broadly defined,see transamerica mortgage advisors lewis,d,and second,by requiring full disclosure of all conflicts of interest.as the supreme court noted,congress broad proscription against any practice which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client remained in the bill from beginning to end.capital gains,at.
t he committee reports indicate a desire to eliminate conflicts of interest between the investment adviser and the clients as safeguards both to unsophisticated investors and to bona fide investment counsel.the iaa thus reflects a congressional intent to eliminate,or at least to expose,all conflicts of interest which might incline an investment or render advice which was not disinterested.
id.at.this statutory scheme is inconsistent with a construction of the sec authority under subsection f that would enable persons congress determined should be subject to the iaa to escape its restrictions.
in an attempt to overcome the plain language of the statute,the sec asserts that congress was also concerned about the regulation of under both the iaa and exchange act,and that such concern was reflected in the intent of the paragraph.see.see also.the sec points to no convincing evidence that supports these assertions.at the time congress enacted the iaa in,were already regulated under the exchange act.in the iaa,congress expressly acknowledged that the it covered could also be subject to other regulation.iaa b,b.the iaa essential purpose was to protect the public from the frauds and misrepresentations of unscrupulous tipsters and touts and to safeguard the honest investment adviser against the stigma of the activities of these individuals by making fraudulent practices by investment advisers unlawful.at see also id.at.as the fpa emphasizes,there is nothing in the committee reports to suggest that congress was particularly concerned about the regulatory burdens on.
while the sec failure to respect the unambiguous textual limitations marked by the phrase intent of this paragraph and other persons is fatal to the final rule,an additional weakness exists in the sec interpretation it flouts six decades of consistent sec understanding of its authority under subsection f.commodity futures trading comm schor,d red lion broad.fcc,d subsection f is not a that authorizes the sec to rewrite the statute.rather,as subsection f terms provide,the authority conferred must be exercised consistent with the intent of this paragraph and apply to other persons.the sec can not point to any instance between the enactment of the iaa and the commencement of the rulemaking proceedings that resulted in the final rule in,when it attempted to invoke subsection f to alter or rewrite the exemptions for persons qualifying for exemptions under subsections a e.rather,the sec has historically invoked subsection f to exempt persons not otherwise addressed in the five exemptions established by congress for example,the adviser to a family trust who was otherwise subject to fiduciary duties,oral arg.tape at or new groups,such as thrift institutions acting in a fiduciary capacity.may,and world bank instrumentalities that provide advice only to sovereigns,in re int l bank for reconstr,sec lexis.as the sec own actions for the last years suggest,subsection f serves the clear purpose of authorizing the sec to address persons or classes involving situations that congress had not foreseen in the statutory to broaden the exemptions of the classes of persons such as congress had expressly addressed.
the sec unconvincingly attempts to defend its expansive interpretation of subsection f by likening it to section c of the ica,c.section c of the ica empowers the sec to grant exemptions from the ica,or any rule or regulation adopted under it,if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the ica.this court has noted that the sec has exercised this authority to exempt persons not within the intent of the ica and generally to adjust its provisions to take account of special situations not foreseen when the ica was drafted.nasd sec,vacated on other grounds,investment.inst.camp,d.reliance on nasd does not advance the sec position as the plain text of the ica is far broader than that of iaa subsection f.the ica expressly refers to the sec view of the public interest as a basis for new exemptions.w e assume that in drafting legislation,congress said what it meant.united states labonte,d.although congress amended the iaa in,see supra,and repeated the same ica language highlighted in nasd in of the iaa,the sec disavows any reliance on in promulgating the final rule,see.respondent br.at,and thus the court has no occasion to express an opinion on the sec authority under it,see sec chenery.but the broader language found in supports the conclusion that subsection f must be read more narrowly.duncan walker,d city of chicago envtl.def.fund,d.
in light of the context in which congress drafted subsections c and f,we conclude that,as indicated by the structure of a and the problems that congress addressed in the iaa,as well as the other indicators of congress intent,under chevron step one the text of subsections c and f is unambiguous,and that,therefore,the sec has exceeded its authority in promulgating the final rule.our dissenting colleague analysis fails to confront two realities of statutory construction.first,a mbiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.brown gardner,d.congress has used words having ordinary meaning any broker or dealer in subsection c and other persons in subsection f and a familiar structure to express its intent in addressing problems identified by the industry and the sec.second,the absence of a statutory definition of intent of this paragraph and other persons does not necessarily render their meaning ambiguous.see goldstein sec.again,the meaning of the text is defined by its context as set forth in the normal meaning of the words,the structure of paragraph,and the problems congress sought to address in the iaa.because the court duty is to give meaning to each word of a statute,the court can not properly treat one authorization,under subsection f,as duplicative of another authorization,under section.see supra at dissenting op.at.consequently,section a f does not lend itself to alternative meanings to conclude otherwise would undermine congress purpose in enacting the protect consumers and honest investment advisers and to establish fiduciary standards and require full disclosure of all conflicts of interests of investment advisers,broadly defined.the sec suggestion that new marketing developments fall within the scope of its authority under subsection f ignores its own contemporaneous understanding of congressional intent to capture such developments.see supra at and note.although an agency may change its interpretation of an ambiguous statute,all elements of the traditional tools of statutory interpretation confound the sec effort to walk away from its view of the limits of its authority under subsection f and our dissenting colleague attempt to find an alternative meaning at this late date.
the sec invocation of its general rulemaking authority under iaa section a is likewise to no avail because it suggests no intention by congress that the sec could ignore either of the two requirements in subsection c for to be exempt from the iaa.see am.bankers,at.paraphrasing an apt observation,while,in the sec view,t he statute may be imperfect,the sec has no power to correct flaws that it perceives in the statute it is empowered to administer.its subsection f authority and its rulemaking power s are limited to adopting regulations to carry into effect the will of congress as expressed in the statute.bd.of governors dimension fin,d.
accordingly,we grant the petition and vacate the final rule.see north carolina fed.energy regulatory comm n,k mart cartier,d.the final rule does not contain a severability clause nor does the sec suggest it is severable.paragraph b is expressly tied to paragraph a.although,absent a or b,paragraph c merely states the current law,the sec identifies paragraph c as one of three separate,yet related,parts of the final rule.respondent br.at.paragraph d defines a term used in paragraphs a and b.the sec release to the final rule states that paragraph d institutes a policy change based on its interpretation of subsection f,see,but otherwise identifies paragraph d in the release as part and parcel of the final rule,see,id.at.
the investment advisers act contains five specific exceptions,and further authorizes the sec to exempt such other persons not within the intent of this paragraph,as the commission may designate by rules.a.unlike my colleagues,i can not derive an unambiguous meaning from the terms such other persons and within the intent of this paragraph.as required by chevron,i would therefore defer to the sec reasonable interpretation of the statute it administers and uphold the commission brokerage rule.
the investment advisers act iaa imposes a series of requirements on investment advisers.see to.paragraph of section a of the act defines an investment adviser as any person who,for compensation,engages in the business of advising others as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities,unless that person comes within one of six exceptions.id.a.the first five exceptions include,inter alia,certain banks and bank holding companies,certain lawyers and accountants,relevant brokers and dealers.the exception relating to c exempts 
any broker or dealer whose performance of advisory services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation therefor.
id.a c.the sec has construed special compensation to mean any compensation other than brokerage commissions or dealers or.see certain deemed not to be investment advisers,hereinafter certain.hence,a who receives any kind of compensation other than commissions does not come within the subsection c exception,even if he,too,provides advice solely as an incident to his business as a.see id.at.
in addition to the five specific exceptions,the iaa definition of covered investment advisers includes a sixth f which reads as follows 
such other persons not within the intent of this paragraph,as the commission may designate by rules and regulations or order.
a f.that exception is the crux of this case.in the final rule currently under attack,the sec exercised its authority under subsection f to create an exception for whose provision of advice is also solely incidental to their brokerage services,but who receive a particular kind of compensation.these group that did not exist when the iaa was passed in either a fixed fee or a fee based on the amount of assets in the customer account.in return,they provide the customer with a traditional package of brokerage services that includes investment advice,execution,arranging for delivery and payment,and custodial and recordkeeping services.certain.at.because these receive compensation rather than commissions,they receive special compensation within the meaning of subsection c and hence are not covered by that exception.see id.
as the court states,the question before us is whether subsection f gives the sec the authority to except from iaa coverage an additional group of beyond the exempted by congress in subsection c.court op.at.the sec believes that it does.in the commission view,although these receive special compensation in a technical sense,they provide investment advice in the same manner as those who are exempt under subsection c,and exempting them would thus serve the same purpose.see infra part iii.
under the first step of chevron analysis,if the terms of subsection f unambiguously preclude the sec interpretation,we must reject it.see chevron natural res.def.council,d.if the terms are ambiguous,however,we must proceed to chevron second step and defer to the sec interpretation if it is reasonable.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.
the court begins and ends its analysis at chevron step one,concluding that the sec unambiguously lacks authority under subsection f to exempt any beyond those specified in subsection c.court op.at.the court reaches this conclusion based on its examination of the subsection f terms such other persons and within the intent of this paragraph.i fail to appreciate the clarity of either term.indeed,apart from the inherent ambiguity of the words themselves,clarity is particularly elusive because subsection f final clause as the commission may designate by rules expressly authorizes the sec to determine the intent of the paragraph and designate further exceptions by regulation.as the supreme court instructed in chevron,where there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,s uch legislative regulations are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.see am.council on educ.fcc.
like my colleagues,i begin with the term within the intent of this paragraph.under chevron,a statutory term is unambiguous only if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.the court is obviously correct in stating that the plain text of subsection c exempts only who do not receive special compensation for investment advice that is,who do not receive compensation other than commissions.court op.at emphasis added.but that is not the precise question before us.that question is whether congress intended subsection f to permit the sec to exempt beyond those already exempt under subsection c.
the court can not point to any words in paragraph,or in any other paragraph of the act,that suggest a negative answer to that that explain what congress intended with respect to that question at all.instead,the court appears to rely on a version of the expressio unius principle that the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of reasoning that the exception for some in subsection c means that coverage of all other must be within the intent of paragraph.but this court has repeatedly held that expressio unius is an especially feeble helper in an administrative setting,where congress is presumed to have left to reasonable agency discretion questions that it has not directly resolved.martini fed.mortgage ass n,quoting cheney icc,internal quotation marks omitted see texas rural legal aid,legal servs,t he expressio canon is simply too thin a reed to support the conclusion that congress has clearly resolved the issue.the canon negative inference is particularly implausible in subsection f congress has explicitly authorized additional exceptions beyond those specified in the statute.
turning from the statutory text to the legislative history,the court quotes a committee report stating that the term investment adviser is so defined as specifically to exclude brokers insofar as their advice is merely incidental to brokerage transactions for which they receive only brokerage commissions.court op.at quoting,at emphasis added by the court see also,at.this quotation,however,has the same problem identified above.the committee was referring only to the specific exclusion provided by subsection c,and not to the further exclusions permitted by subsection f.that is made clear by the sentence that follows the one quoted by the court in addition,the commission is authorized by rules and regulations or order,to make certain further exceptions according to prescribed statutory standards,at emphasis added see also,at.there is nothing in the committee report that explains congress intentions with respect to those further exceptions.
the court also perceives clarity in the subsection f term such other persons.according to the court,other persons excludes any person who is a member of one of the broad categories referenced in paragraph five specific exceptions.because some are referenced in subsection c,the court concludes that the subset of covered by the brokerage rule can not constitute other persons within the meaning of subsection f.see court op.at.the sec,by contrast,contends that other persons excludes only those persons who actually come within one of the five preceding exceptions.on the sec reading,the brokerage rule is a permissible exercise of the commission delegated authority because it exempts other than those exempted by subsection c.
because the iaa does not define other persons,the court turns to the dictionary to find its meaning.there,the court learns that the word other connotes existing besides,or distinct from,that already mentioned or implied.id.at quoting the shorter oxford english dictionary ed,republished.but like the text and the legislative history,the dictionary fails to resolve the precise question at issue.it can not tell us whether the persons already mentioned in subsection c are any broker or dealer,as one might reasonably conclude if one looked only at the first four words of the subsection,or instead are any broker or dealer whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business and who receives no special compensation therefor,as one might reasonably conclude if one looked at all the words of the subsection.the sec takes the latter approach,and neither the plain text nor the dictionary bars that construction.this should end the chevron step one inquiry.
turning away from the iaa altogether,the court next looks to judicial precedents construing two different rule of civil procedure b and the securities exchange act of.these cases,however,shed no light on the iaa.
in liljeberg health services acquisition,d,the supreme court interpreted rule b,which allows a court to grant relief from a final judgment for any of five sets of specific reasons,mistake,the rule sixth any other reason justifying relief.fed.civ.b.although liljeberg does state that clause and clauses through are mutually exclusive,court op.at quoting liljeberg,at,the case is wholly inapposite.first,the court was interpreting rule b de novo,not reviewing an agency interpretation entitled to chevron deference.at most,then,the court statement indicates what it regarded as the best interpretation of the phrase any other reason,not what it saw as the only possible interpretation.second,the reason the court read rule b as it did was that the rule contains a statute of limitations for seeking relief under clause,while motions under clause need only be brought within a reasonable time.hence,barring a party from basing a clause claim on the same grounds specified in clause was necessary to prevent clause from being used to circumvent the limitations period that applies to clause.liljeberg,at.there is nothing similar in the structure of iaa paragraph.finally,the reading of rule b s any other reason clause rejected by the supreme court is actually the inverse of the sec reading of subsection f.the court stated that a party may not avail himself of the broad any other reason clause if his motion is based on grounds specified in clause.id.emphasis added quoting klapprott united states.that is,a person who qualifies for relief under clause can not also obtain relief under clause.here,by contrast,the sec employed subsection f such other persons language to create an exception for persons who could not qualify for an exception under any of the preceding subsections.
this circuit interpretation of the securities exchange act in american bankers association sec,is likewise inapposite.there,the court declined to accord chevron deference to an sec interpretation because it concerned the allocation of jurisdiction between the sec and other agencies.the exchange act expressly excludes banks,which are regulated by the federal banking agencies,from the definitions of brokers and dealers,which are regulated by the sec.see id.at citing a.the act also contains a definition of banks.see id.at citing a.although all of the exchange act definitions are preceded by an unless the context otherwise requires clause,american bankers rejected the sec effort to use that clause to redefine banks so as to subject some to sec regulation.such a rote phrase,the court said,can not provide the authority for one of the agencies whose jurisdictional boundaries are defined in the statute to alter by administrative regulation those very jurisdictional boundaries.id.at emphasis added.but there is no other agency in the picture in this case.nor is the exchange act narrow direction to look to context to avoid absurd consequences,id.at,equivalent to subsection f express delegation of authority to the sec to make further exceptions to the iaa.indeed,american bankers itself suggested that,had the exchange act contained such an express delegation,the result in that case might well have been different.id.at.
in short,these cases do not illustrate an underlying principle that resolves the interpretive question in this case
