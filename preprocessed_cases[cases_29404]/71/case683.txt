plaintiffs in a state court case appeal from the order of the united states district court in charge of the enron litigation staying discovery in their related state court action and enjoining the parties from seeking further injunctions in that case without leave of the district court.based on our conclusion that the district court was authorized under the securities litigation uniform standards act of and the all writs act to issue its orders,we affirm.
the district court in this case is the litigation transferee for all litigation.the lead case for the securities group of cases consolidated under in re enron is newby,et enron,et newby.the district judge presiding over these cases has ruled on numerous motions and has been heavily engaged in the considerable task of managing this complex litigation,including issuing a comprehensive scheduling order.in addition to the securities cases,the same district judge also presides over a group of cases brought on behalf of enron employees,which are consolidated into newby.
discovery in all cases has been coordinated.once discovery is authorized,the district court has ordered the parties to confer regarding the establishment of a document depository accessible to the attorneys for all parties.in these early stages of federal court litigation,the district court has ordered defendant arthur anderson to segregate,preserve,and protect all writings and other materials relating to enron and any entities.it also denied the federal plaintiffs request for an order freezing all assets of the defendants in the newby case.all discovery in newby is stayed in accordance with the automatic stay provisions of the private securities litigation reform act pslra pending a ruling on defendants motion to dismiss 
the underlying lawsuit,bullock,et,arthur anderson,et,bullock,which precipitated the district court order being challenged in this appeal,was filed in the district court of washington county,texas in january on behalf of thirteen individual plaintiffs.the bullock case is one of seven separate lawsuits filed by appellants counsel,fleming associates fleming,in various texas state courts.enron is not a defendant in the bullock case.many of the defendants in the bullock case however are also defendants in the cases consolidated under newby.the defendants attempted to remove bullock to the united states district court for the western district of texas,but the case was remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the securities litigation uniform standards act slusa 
after remand,the bullock plaintiffs sought permission from the state court to commence discovery.the state court issued a number of rulings.it allowed immediate discovery,rejected a request by the defendants to coordinate discovery with the newby litigation and set a schedule that would result in trial in state court before the trial in the federal court.there is no dispute that the discovery sought in bullock would have fallen squarely within the discovery that may eventually take place in newby if the plaintiffs survive a motion to dismiss.the bullock plaintiffs also sought a hearing on a request for temporary injunction to freeze defendants assets.
the appellees sought emergency injunctive relief in the united states district court presiding over newby.they asked the court to stay all discovery in bullock,order appellants counsel,fleming,to withdraw their motion for temporary injunction,and prohibit appellants and fleming from seeking further temporary injunctions without leave of the court.the district court granted all requested relief,enjoined all discovery in bullock until it ruled on a motion to dismiss in the newby case and enjoined fleming from seeking any injunctive relief in state court without prior leave from the federal district court.the district court specifically found that the orders were necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,and to protect and effectuate its judgments.the bullock plaintiffs appeal.
appellants argue that the district court erred in concluding that b d gave it the authority to stay discovery in a state court action suit.relying on legislative history and the language of the statute,they contend that the pslra and slusa were designed to deal with perceived abuses in securities class actions,not with an individual action like bullock.also relying on legislative history and the plain language of the statute,we disagree.
congress passed the private securities litigation reform act in pslra.codified in part at.the pslra amended the securities act of,et and the securities exchange act of,et.it was enacted in response to an increase in securities fraud lawsuits perceived as frivolous,including shareholder strike suits and other meritless lawsuits.see generally,john olson,david macaffey,brian casey,pleading reform,plaintiff qualification and discovery stays under the reform act,bus.law.lander hartford life annuity ins,cir.the automatic stay of discovery under b b was one of the measures put into place by the pslra.the provision reads as follows 
b stay of discovery 
in any private action arising under this chapter,all discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss,unless the court finds upon the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.
the rationale underlying the stay was to prevent costly extensive discovery and disruption of normal business activities until a court could determine whether a filed suit had merit,by ruling on the defendant motion to dismiss.see reform act,bus.law at.the stay protected defendants from plaintiffs who would use discovery to substantiate an initially frivolous complaint.see,sess.the pslra also incorporated heightened pleading standards.
these safeguards did not have the desired effect.congress responded with the passage of slusa in.house report on slusa indicates that following the passage of the pslra,the number of securities lawsuits filed in state courts increased substantially.the purpose of slusa was to prevent plaintiffs from seeking to evade the protections that federal law provides against abusive litigation by filing suit in state,rather than federal,court.id.this problem was addressed in slusa in two ways by preempting certain securities fraud class actions brought under state law,and by granting the power to federal court judges to quash discovery in state court actions if discovery in the state case conflicted with an order of the federal court.id.the purpose of the grant was to give federal judges tools to combat abuse of discovery proceedings in individual actions that may be brought in state court.id.specifically as to b d subsection a of slusa,the report states that it 
amends section b to include a provision to prevent plaintiffs from circumventing the stay of discovery under the reform act by using state court discovery,which may not be subject to those limitations,in an action filed in state court.this provision expressly permits a federal court to stay discovery proceedings in any private action in a state court as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments.this provision authorizes a court to stay such proceedings in state court,regardless of whether there exists a parallel action in federal court or the state proceedings were brought prior to,subsequent to,or concurrently with,a federal filing.because circumvention of the stay of discovery of the reform act is a key abuse that this legislation is designed to prevent,the committee intends that courts use this provision liberally,so that the preservation of state court jurisdiction of limited individual securities fraud claims does not become a loophole through which the trial bar can engage in discovery not subject to the stay of the reform act.
id.emphasis added.the provision as added provides 
d circumvention of stay of discovery 
upon a proper showing,a court may stay discovery proceedings in any private action in a state court,as necessary in aid of its jurisdiction,or to protect or effectuate its judgments,in an action subject to a stay of dis
