background 
this court has previously described the details of the series of agreements between these parties,with which familiarity is assumed,in compagnie financiere merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.we set forth here only the facts relevant to this appeal.
on july,cfc then known as banque de europeenne or bue loaned prodipe,prodipe million.this loan was jointly and severally guaranteed by each of prodipe.alejandro weinstock,alfredo balli,and patrick the guarantee.prior to making the loan,cfc expressed concern about whether the guarantors had sufficient assets to fulfill the guarantee,if necessary.in response,weinstock represented to cfc that calex,a corporation of which he was the sole shareholder,held million in marketable securities in an account with merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith incorporated merrill lynch.merrill lynch confirmed this in a letter to cfc dated june.on july,weinstock sent a letter to cfc explaining that the june,letter had been provided in connection with that guarantee of patrick,alfredo balli and me,which guarantee is given to you in connection with your credit of to prodipe.
at the request of cfc,weinstock,acting on behalf of calex,arranged to maintain a minimum value of million in calex merrill lynch account.on july,weinstock implemented this arrangement with an instruction letter to merrill lynch the weinstock instruction letter that provided in relevant part 
on behalf of calex,i hereby instruct you,at the request of and for the benefit of banque de europeenne bue,not to sell,trade,transfer or otherwise dispose of any readily marketable securities held for the account of calex if such sale,trade,transfer or other disposition individually or in the aggregate would result in reduction in the value of the calex account maintained with you below the amount of unless you first receive a letter or telecopy from bue authorizing such a sale,transfer,or other disposition.
this letter is delivered at the request of bue to induce it to enter into that certain loan agreement between prodipe,prodipe and bue providing for a loan of to bue the loan agreement.in no event shall this letter of instruction have any further force or effect following payment in full by prodipe of its obligations under the loan agreement.
emphasis added.this instruction letter was countersigned by merrill lynch and forwarded to cfc merrill lynch confirmed the arrangement in a july,letter to cfc the letter agreement 
in accordance with the instructions of calex,we irrevocably agree that we shall not release any funds or securities available in the investment account which would cause the total value to fall below until receipt by us of written notice from you releasing this restriction we understand that you are relying on our compliance with the instructions from calex and we hereby agree to comply with them.
prodipe defaulted on its loan when it became due on december.by a letter dated august,cfc demanded repayment from the guarantors without result.at that time,cfc also attempted to confirm that merrill lynch would continue to abide by the letter agreement.by a letter dated october,cfc informed merrill lynch that it believed that calex investment account constitutes collateral security for the guarantee and that it considered merrill lynch to be contractually bound by the letter agreement.merrill lynch denied any contractual obligation to cfc.
on april,cfc filed this action against merrill lynch,seeking a declaratory judgment that merrill lynch remained contractually obligated to maintain at least million in calex account.merrill lynch answered and filed a counterclaim for interpleader,requesting that the district court determine whether cfc or calex was entitled to the assets in dispute.
in,cfc acquired control of of the shares of prodipe.on april,mif,a corporation controlled by one of the guarantors of the prodipe loan,purchased all of cfc rights with respect to the prodipe loan,the guarantee,the arrangement with merrill lynch,and this litigation,and also acquired voting control of prodipe.at the same time,cfc and mif released prodipe and from their obligations under the loan.mif was allowed to intervene as a plaintiff in this case.
the district court held a bench trial on june.in september,the district court entered judgment for merrill lynch and calex on the ground that plaintiffs release of prodipe from its loan obligations simultaneously released the guarantors from their obligations.see management investment funding merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,d.this court reversed the district court,holding that the general waiver of defenses included in the guarantee prevented the guarantors obligations from being discharged by the lender release of the principal debtor.see compagnie financiere merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.this court remanded for consideration of any other applicable defenses.see id.at.
on remand,calex moved for summary judgment,arguing that the following defenses to enforcement of the letter agreement entitled it to judgment as a matter of law the release terminated the letter agreement the letter agreement was not backed by consideration and plaintiffs lacked standing to enforce the letter agreement.the district court rejected calex arguments regarding its second and third defenses,a holding that calex does not appeal.in regard to calex first defense,however,the district court found that the release extinguished the obligations under the letter agreement.
specifically,the district court determined that the termination provision in the weinstock instruction letter,which states in relevant part that i n no event shall this letter have any further force or effect following payment in full by prodipe of its obligations under the loan agreement,was unambiguous and conveyed a definite and precise meaning that prodipe release terminates the letter agreement.the district court rejected plaintiffs argument that summary judgment was inappropriate because material issues of fact existed regarding whether the weinstock instruction letter was part of the parties agreement and whether calex suggested reading of the termination provision in the instruction letter was inconsistent with the letter agreement fundamental purpose such that calex interpretation could not be indicative of the parties intent.the district court held that the letter agreement incorporated the weinstock instruction letter by reference and stated that it was not convinced,in light of the limited nature of the security provided by the letter agreement,that it is necessarily inconsistent for the parties to have also agreed that the agreement would terminate upon prodipe satisfaction of its obligations under the loan.the district court concluded 
w e are persuaded that the termination provision in the weinstock letter conveys a definite and precise meaning that prodipe release terminates the letter agreement.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff,we also conclude that the weinstock letter is encompassed within the letter agreement text,and is generally consistent with the agreement fundamental purpose.because plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence upon which a rational factfinder might infer otherwise,calex motion for summary judgment is granted.
this appeal followed entry of judgment in favor of calex.
discussion 
standard of review 
the district court concluded that the provision of the weinstock instruction letter terminating its effect following payment in full by prodipe of its obligations under the loan agreement unambiguously included plaintiffs release of prodipe and therefore granted summary judgment for calex.our review of such a grant is de novo,employing the same tests as those applied at the district court.mellon bank united bank,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the primary objective of a court in interpreting a contract is to give effect to the intent of the parties as revealed by the language of their agreement.see sayers rochester.supplemental management pension plan,cir.
summary judgment is generally proper in a contract dispute only if the language of the contract is wholly unambiguous.see mellon bank,at.the question of whether the language of a contract is clear or ambiguous is a question of law to be decided by the court.see id.contract language is ambiguous if it is capable of more than one meaning when viewed objectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement.sayers,at internal quotation marks omitted.although generally interpretation of ambiguous contract language is a question of fact to be resolved by the factfinder,see mellon bank,at,the court may resolve ambiguity in contractual language as a matter of law if the evidence presented about the parties intended meaning is so that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.banco do brasil,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also shepley new coleman holdings,cir summary judgment in a contract dispute may be granted when the language is ambiguous and there is relevant extrinsic evidence,but the extrinsic evidence creates no genuine issue of material fact and permits interpretation of the agreement as a matter of law internal quotation marks omitted.a court may also grant summary judgment regarding the interpretation of ambiguous language if the party fails to point to any relevant extrinsic evidence supporting that party interpretation of the language.see mellon bank,at.
ii.termination of the security agreement 
we must decide under what conditions the letter agreement between merrill lynch and cfc terminates.the termination provision in letter agreement is incomplete it indicates how,but not when,the restrictions on calex account would be lifted.it provides that the agreement will remain in force until receipt by merrill lynch of written notice from cfc releasing this restriction,but does not explain the conditions under which cfc would be required to send such a letter.the weinstock instruction letter,however,provides for termination of the security agreement upon payment in full by prodipe of its obligations.the district court held that this provision controls the termination of the letter agreement.
calex argues that the obligations under the letter agreement expire upon the terms of the weinstock instruction letter and contends that the condition of payment in full was met by plaintiffs release of prodipe.we may treat the termination clause in the weinstock instruction letter as controlling the agreement between merrill lynch and cfc if the parties intended it to govern.see haines city of new york.whether the weinstock instruction letter controls the letter agreement termination is irrelevant,however,because we find that the phrase payment in full as used in this context has only one reasonable of the principal and interest outstanding on the loan.moreover,the overwhelming weight of the extrinsic evidence,including the natural and ordinary usage of the phrase payment in full,supports this court determination that the only conclusion to which a reasonable finder of fact could come is that the parties intended the letter agreement to terminate only upon actual repayment of the loan.
as noted above,we agree that the termination provision in the letter agreement is unclear.the parties disagree whether the termination provision of the weinstock instruction letter,assuming it governs the letter agreement,is ambiguous.the termination provision of the weinstock instruction letter provides that it will have no further force or effect following payment in full by prodipe of its obligations under the loan agreement.the district court found that the termination provision in the weinstock instruction letter conveyed a definite and precise meaning that prodipe release terminates the letter agreement,despite its observation that i t is conceivable that one might read the phrase payment in full to signify payment of the full amount of principal and interest outstanding on the loan.
we disagree with the district court finding that the termination provision of the weinstock instruction letter is wholly unambiguous.unambiguous language has a definite and precise meaning,unattended by danger of misconception in the purport of the contract itself and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference in opinion.seiden anc holdings,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as the district court initially observed,the phrase payment in full could be read to signify that the restrictions on calex account would terminate only upon payment of the full amount of principal and interest outstanding on the loan.in fact,although the parties could have chosen to give the phrase a different meaning,such interpretation is the most reasonable and natural meaning of the phrase payment in full.because we find that the term payment in full is open to a variety of interpretations in this context,we conclude that the termination provision of the letter agreement,even assuming it is governed by the weinstock instruction letter,is ambiguous.
extrinsic evidence of the parties interpretations 
our holding that the termination provision is ambiguous does not end the inquiry.this court may resolve the ambiguity in the contractual language as a matter of law if there is no extrinsic evidence to support one party interpretation of the ambiguous language or if the extrinsic evidence is sided that no reasonable factfinder could decide contrary to one party interpretation.see,at mellon bank,at.we find that calex fails to point to sufficient extrinsic evidence in support of its interpretation the only conclusion to which a reasonable finder of fact could come is that the parties intended the letter agreement to terminate only upon actual repayment of the principal and interest outstanding on the loan.
plaintiffs interpretation 
plaintiffs argue that the parties intended for the agreement regarding calex merrill lynch account to terminate only upon full payment of the loan outstanding principal and interest in support of their interpretation,plaintiffs point to the similar use of the concept of full payment in the termination provisions of both the guarantee and the weinstock instruction letter as evidence of the coterminous nature of those agreements.the termination provision of the guarantee provides that t his guarantee shall continue in full force and effect until all amounts due in principal,interest and any obligations payable as aforesaid of or in respect of the loan agreement shall be paid in full.emphasis added likewise,the termination provision of the weinstock instruction letter provides that it will terminate following payment in full by prodipe of its obligations under the loan agreement.emphasis added plaintiffs argue that because the release did not terminate the guarantors obligations under the guarantee,see compagnie financiere,at,then the release can no
