paz securities,and its president,joseph mizrachi,petition for review of an order of the securities and exchange commission sustaining the decision of the national association of securities dealers to expel paz from membership and to bar mizrachi from ever associating with any nasd member firm as sanctions for mizrachi failure to respond to the nasd repeated requests for information from and about paz.we hold the commission abused its discretion in two ways it failed to address certain mitigating factors raised by the petitioners,specifically,that their failure to respond had no potential either to injure the investing public or to benefit themselves monetarily nor did the information requested relate to conduct potentially injurious to the public or beneficial to themselves and it did not identify any opposed to for the sanctions it approved.accordingly,we grant the petition and remand this matter for the commission to consider anew whether the sanctions are excessive or oppressive in light of the factors raised in mitigation and to consider for the first time whether the sanctions serve a remedial purpose,as required by e of the securities exchange act of,e.
background 
joseph mizrachi was the president of paz securities,which was a member of the nasd,a organization registered with the commission as a national securities association under section of the securities exchange act of.the nasd adopts rules to regulate the conduct of its members,b,and may enforce those rules by imposing disciplinary sanctions upon member firms and persons associated with them,b.
in february the nasd began a routine examination of paz and reviewed materials provided by joseph mizrachi brother,simon mizrachi,in his capacity as vice president of the firm.joseph mizrachi claims he was unavailable at that time to respond to the nasd because he was experiencing mental distress caused by marital difficulties and was traveling abroad.unable to obtain through simon mizrachi everything it sought from paz,the nasd asked joseph mizrachi and paz to provide additional written information.specifically,the nasd sent three letters to the petitioners asking whether paz had implemented a continuing education program what investment banking or securities business the firm had engaged in since february what specific duties paz had assigned to,and what compensation paz had paid to,certain individuals during the period whether paz had revised its written supervisory procedures as requested apparently by the nasd why the nasd had not received the firm audit on time and whether paz had a written expense sharing agreement with a company operated by simon mizrachi that shared office space with paz.
the nasd sent the first letter on may,by overnight courier to joseph mizrachi at the address listed for paz in the nasd central registration depository crd.on may,the nasd sent a second letter by express courier to the same address requesting the same information.on july,it sent a third letter by first class and certified mail to the address listed in the crd for each petitioner.the return receipts show that one mizrachi signed for the letter sent to paz registered address,but the return receipt card sent to joseph mizrachi home address bears an illegible signature.joseph mizrachi asserted before the commission that he is not mizrachi,and mizrachi is not further identified in the record.
the petitioners do not contest that the nasd efforts to notify them comply with nasd procedural rule,which provides the nasd may send documents by first class mail,certified mail,or courier to the address listed in the crd.under nasd procedural rule d,a member of the nasd or person to whom a request for information is directed is deemed to have received that request when it is sent to the last known business address of the member firm or the last known residential address of a person associated with the firm,as reflected in the crd.therefore,the petitioners had constructive,if not actual notice of the three letters requesting information from paz.
on august,the nasd department of enforcement filed with the nasd office of hearing officers a complaint alleging the petitioners had failed to respond to a request for information,in violation of nasd conduct rule and nasd procedural rule.the department of enforcement simultaneously sent by first class and certified mail a notice of complaint,with the complaint attached,to the addresses listed in the crd for paz and for joseph mizrachi.the department repeated this drill on september.though the record is unclear whether joseph mizrachi received either of the notices,he admitted that simon mizrachi told him about the complaint,apparently no later than october.
in september simon mizrachi hired douglas westendorf,to represent the petitioners before the nasd.pursuant to a motion westendorf filed on september,the nasd gave the petitioners until october to answer the complaint.the petitioners,however,still failed to answer the complaint,and on october the nasd hearing officer found them in default.in november the department of enforcement moved for entry of a default decision and served the motion upon the petitioners and westendorf.on december the nasd hearing officer entered a default decision against the petitioners,expelling paz from membership in the nasd and barring joseph mizrachi from ever associating with any nasd member firm,the standard mitigating in the nasd sanction guidelines at.
on january,the petitioners belatedly responded to the nasd request for information and moved to vacate the default decision.in that motion,joseph mizrachi explained that from january to august he had been traveling abroad to visit family and to deal with emotional distress,for which he had received counseling from august to january he claimed he had been traveling extensively for business.joseph mizrachi claimed he and paz had relied upon westendorf to represent them and attributed their failure to respond to the negligence of the attorney.the nasd hearing officer denied the motion to vacate the default decision because the petitioners had presented no evidence that their failure to respond was attributable to negligence by westendorf and therefore failed to show good cause to vacate the default decision.
the petitioners appealed to the nasd national adjudicatory council nac,arguing the sanctions imposed by the hearing officer were unduly severe and should be reduced upon the basis of three mitigating factors the petitioners misplaced reliance upon counsel to respond to the complaint the unintentional nature of their failure to respond and the nature of the information requested,which did not involve any potential monetary gain to either of them.the nac affirmed the default decision,the sanctions,and the hearing officer refusal to vacate the default decision.it found the petitioners failure to respond to the nasd requests for information were not mitigated by the enumerated factors because joseph mizrachi had at least constructive notice of the repeated requests for information and the petitioners failure to respond was tantamount to stonewalling and a willful refusal to comply,which had undermined the nasd ability to fulfil its regulatory responsibilities.the nac did not respond to the petitioners contention that their failure to respond was mitigated because the information requested did not relate to any potential monetary gain to them,except to say,we have considered and rejected without discussion all other arguments of the parties.
before the commission,the petitioners argued the sanctions should be reduced because their failure to respond to the nasd information requests was unintentional principal consideration,nasd sanction guidelines at did not injure the investing public principal consideration,nasd sanction guidelines at,nor did the information requested relate to injurious conduct principal consideration,nasd sanction guidelines at did not stand to benefit them monetarily principal consideration,nasd sanction guidelines at,nor did the information requested relate to conduct of benefit to them principal consideration,nasd sanction guidelines at and was attributable to
