vanessa simmonds appeals the district court dismissal of related derivative complaints brought under section b of the securities exchange act of exchange act,b.simmonds complaints allege that the investment banks collectively,underwriters violated section b by engaging in prohibited transactions in connection with the initial public offerings ipos of the corporations collectively,issuing companies between and.simmonds seeks disgorgement of the underwriters alleged trading profits.
we affirm the district court conclusion rendered in the thirty cases in which the issue was raised that simmonds failed to present an adequate demand letter to the issuing companies prior to filing her lawsuits,and we remand these cases to the district court to dismiss the complaints with prejudice.we reverse the district court conclusion that the remaining cases are barred by section b statute of limitations,and we remand these cases to the district court so that all defendants,including the underwriters,have a full opportunity to contest the adequacy of simmonds demand letters with respect to the remaining twenty four cases.
factual and procedural background 
in her first amended complaints complaints,simmonds alleges that while the underwriters were acting as lead underwriters on the issuing companies ipos,they coordinated their activities with the issuing companies officers,directors,and principal shareholders collectively,insiders in order to obtain financial benefits from increases in the issuing companies stock prices simmonds alleges that the insiders entered agreements with the underwriters that prevented the insiders from offering or selling their stock for days following the ipo.the purpose of the agreements was to collectively hold and refrain from selling the insiders shares,and the underwriters and insiders intended to receive financial benefits by selling these shares into an inflated market after the agreements expired.in order to create this inflated market,the underwriters and insiders allegedly agreed to release the ipo to the general public at a discount to the price that they knew to be the likely aftermarket price range based on clear indications of ipo and aftermarket demand.the underwriters also allegedly inflated the share prices by engaging in a practice known as laddering in exchange for giving their customers access to ipo allocations,the underwriters required their customers including the issuing companies insiders to purchase shares at progressively higher prices following the ipo finally,simmonds asserts that the underwriters engaged in improper activities that were designed to inflate the market price of the shares 
according to simmonds,these allegations establish that the underwriters and insiders acted as a group and coordinated their conduct with respect to acquiring the issuing companies stock,holding the stock,and disposing of the stock so as to share in the profits gained in the aftermarket following the ipo.
simmonds alleges that the underwriters had three types of direct or indirect pecuniary interest s in the issuing companies stock that allowed the underwriters to profit from purchases and sales,or sales and purchases of that stock.the complaints define these transactions as the operative transactions for purposes of these lawsuits.first,the underwriters shar ed in the profits of customers to whom they made ipo allocations of the issuing companies stock.second,the underwriters allocat ed shares of the issuing companies stock to executives and other insiders of other companies,both private and public,from which the underwriters expected to receive new or additional investment banking business in return.finally,the underwriters creat ed the opportunity for other members of the g roup to derive personal financial benefits from the sale of the the issuing companies stock into an inflated market,in an effort by the underwriters to obtain future investment banking business from the issuing companies.
in her complaints,simmonds seeks to compel the underwriters to disgorge the profits they received from these transactions.simmonds alleges that prior to filing the complaints,she submitted demand letters insisting that the issuing companies seek this relief directly as is their right under section b.when more than sixty days had lapsed after she sent the demand letters,simmonds filed the complaints at issue in this appeal.
the underwriters jointly filed a motion to dismiss simmonds complaints under.b.the underwriters contended that simmonds claims were,that simmonds complaints failed to state a cause of action under section b,and that the underwriters are protected by various exemptions from section b.thirty of the issuing companies collectively,moving issuers filed a separate motion to dismiss under.b and.b the moving issuers argued that simmonds claims were and that simmonds lacked standing because she failed to submit adequate demand letters to the issuing companies prior to filing suit.
the district court granted the moving issuers.b motions to dismiss based on the inadequacy of simmonds demand letters,and granted the underwriters.b motions to dismiss based on the statute of limitations.in re section b,d.the court did not address the underwriters remaining arguments regarding the merits of simmonds allegations and the scope of the underwriters exemptions from section b.see id.at.the court dismissed without prejudice the thirty actions resolved by the moving issuers.b motions.id.at.the court dismissed the remaining cases with prejudice in light of its ruling on the statute of limitations.id.
simmonds filed a timely appeal,and the thirty moving issuers filed timely requesting that the district court dismissals of their cases be entered with prejudice rather than without prejudice.we granted the parties joint motion to consolidate the cases on appeal pursuant to fed.b.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
ordinarily,a dismissal of a complaint without prejudice is not a final order.martinez gomez,cir.however,the district court orders in these cases are final and appealable because leave to amend was not specifically allowed and simmonds can not amend her complaint to defeat the statute of limitations bar as construed by the district court.id.at.accordingly,we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

discussion 
congress enacted section b as part of the exchange act to prevent corporate insiders from exploiting their access to information not generally available to others.dreiling am.online,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.section b requires corporate insiders to disgorge any trading profits they obtain in any transaction,which is defined as a coupled,or purchase,completed within six months.dreiling am.express,cir citing b.there are four basic elements of a section b claim a purchase and a sale of securities by an officer or director of the issuer or by a shareholder who owns more than ten percent of any one class of the issuer securities within a period.gwozdzinsky fund,cir.
the purpose of the rule is not to punish specific instances of wrongdoing or remedy harms suffered by particular individuals.rather,the law is aimed at protecting the public by preventing corporate insiders from exploiting inside information at the expense of ordinary investors.kern county land occidental petroleum.in order to fulfill this purpose,section b is a blunt instrument,at once both over and.dreiling am.express,at.it is in that it imposes strict liability regardless of motive,including trades not actually based on inside information,and i t is in that there is no liability for trades made on inside information if more than six months transpire between purchase and sale.id.
this appeal focuses on a pair of procedural prerequisites to filing a section b lawsuit the demand requirement,and the statute of limitations.shareholders may only file a section b suit after requesting that the issuing company take appropriate action against its insiders.if sixty days pass after a shareholder demand has been made without the issuing company resolving the matter either informally or via lawsuit,shareholders may file suit on the issuing company behalf.however,shareholders must file their suit within two years of the transactions at issue,subject to the tolling rules described in greater detail infra.
demand requirement 
section b provides in relevant part that all insider trading profits shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer,and s uit to recover such profit may be instituted at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction by the issuer,or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and in behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within sixty days after request or shall fail diligently to prosecute the same thereafter b.the issuing company right to recover the insider trading profits is simply an application of an old principle in the law that if you are an agent and you profit by insider information concerning the affairs of your principal,your profits go to your principal.stock exchange regulation hearing before the comm.on interstate and foreign commerce,cong.statement of thomas corcoran,counsel,reconstruction fin.
section b does not set forth any additional details regarding the nature and scope of this statutory demand requirement.in light of this congressional silence,we turn to state law for guidance.the supreme court has explained that where a gap in the federal securities laws must be bridged by a rule that bears on the allocation of governing powers within the corporation,federal courts should incorporate state law into federal common law unless the particular state law in question is inconsistent with the policies underlying the federal statute.kamen kemper fin.applying this broad principle in the context of the investment company act of,the kamen court held that the contours of the demand requirement in that case,the standards governing demand futility must be determined by the law of the state of incorporation.id.at.
here,the adequacy of simmonds section b demand letters is disputed in the thirty cases involving the moving issuers,all of which are delaware corporations in light of the principles articulated in kamen,these thirty demand letters must be analyzed in accordance with delaware law,unless there is a conflict between delaware law and federal law that would frustrate specific objectives of section and the exchange act.kamen,at citation,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.our task under kamen is the same as in any case decided under state law after erie tompkins.we must approximate state law as closely as possible in order to make sure that the vindication of the state right is without discrimination because of the federal forum.orkin taylor,cir quoting ticknor choice hotels int l,cir.accordingly,we must follow the delaware supreme court pronouncements,or,if the delaware supreme court has not addressed the question,we must predict how the court will decide the issue,based on decisions of delaware courts,decisions from other jurisdictions,treatises and restatements.matsuura alston bird,cir per curiam.in other contexts,we have relied on the delaware court of chancery decisions as accurate statements of delaware law,id.at,and we note that there are particularly compelling reasons for following the delaware court of chancery decisions because it is widely recognized as the nation leading authority on corporate law issues,see,william rehnquist,the prominence of the delaware court of chancery in the joint venture of providing justice,bus.law.
the delaware supreme court has explained that the demand requirement exists first to insure that a stockholder exhausts his intracorporate remedies,and then to provide a safeguard against strike suits.aronson lewis,overruled en banc on other grounds by brehm eisner.the purpose of demand is to assure that the stockholder affords the corporation the opportunity to address an alleged wrong without litigation,to decide whether to invest the resources of the corporation in litigation,and to control any litigation which does occur.spiegel buntrock,these justifications are not unique to delaware.the supreme court has repeatedly highlighted these points,kamen,at daily income fund,at,as have our sister circuits and leading commentators have approved as we have previously stated,the demand rule is not merely a technical or unimportant requirement.potter,at.rather,it flows from the general rule of american law that the board of directors controls a corporation.id.indeed,the policies animating shareholder demands are particularly relevant in the section b context.anecdotal evidence suggests that well over percent of all section b claims are settled privately,without any lawsuit being filed.romeo dye,supra,c footnote omitted.this figure would almost certainty be lower if section b did not contain a demand requirement,as shareholder demands allow boards to investigate the allegations and resolve matters without resorting to costly and burdensome litigation.
to give effect to these general policies,the delaware chancery has required that demand letters specifically state i the identity of the alleged wrongdoers,ii the wrongdoing they allegedly perpetrated and the resultant injury to the corporation,and iii the legal action the shareholder wants the board to take on the corporation behalf.yaw talley,civ,wl,at.ch,unpublished opinion,reprinted in.furthermore,the party asserting that a demand was made bear s the burden of proof id.these requirements flow directly from the underlying justifications for the demand requirement i t is essential that the communication contain these three elements to enable the board to perform its duty to make a good faith investigation of claims of alleged wrongdoing,and,where appropriate,to rectify the misconduct.id.we believe that this is a correct statement of delaware law as it would be decided by the delaware supreme court.this standard was announced by a vice chancellor who was later elevated to the state supreme court,see gatz ponsoldt,no.civ,wl,at.ch,unpublished opinion,and,more importantly,this standard has been uniformly followed in subsequent chancery decisions accordingly,under kamen and our general erie jurisprudence,we apply this legal standard and the delaware courts applications of it except where it frustrate s specific objectives of simmonds federal cause of action.see kamen,at 
here,the thirty demand letters at issue in the moving issuers motion all of which were identical in all material respects stated the following pertinent facts t he company ipo underwriters,in addition to certain of its officers,directors and principal shareholders,as identified in the ipo prospectus coordinated their efforts for the purpose of acquiring,holding,disposing of securities of the company,obtained beneficial ownership of shares amounting to more than of the company outstanding common stock in the year following the ipo,engaged in purchases and sales of company within periods of less than six months during that year,and failed to report those transactions as required by section a.simmonds demand ed that the board of directors prosecute a claim against those persons for violations of b of the securities exchange act of,in order to compel them to disgorge the profits they made through purchases and sales of company stock.
in response to of the thirty moving issuers requests for additional information,simmonds explained that the challenged transactions involved the activities of the lead underwriters,the other ipo underwriters,and the officers,directors and principal shareholders of the company related to improper ipo allocation laddering and spinning and research and stock rating activities during the relevant period.as you are aware,information regarding these activities is readily available at court,law firm and sec websites.
simmonds initial demand letters satisfied the first part of the delaware test for demand adequacy,which requires the shareholder to state the identity of the alleged wrongdoers.yaw,wl,at.in fli deep marine mckim,the plaintiff demand letter stated that certain employees,officers and directors of the company and others had diverted and misappropriated the company assets.fli deep marine,wl,at quoting demand letter.the court of chancery stated that this letter was sufficient to satisfy the first prong of yaw.id.at.simmonds demand letters identify the alleged wrongdoers with a similar level of precision as in the fli deep marine plaintiff demand letter.specifically,simmonds letters identified the company ipo underwriters,in addition to certain of its officers,directors and principal shareholders,as identified in the ipo prospectus.although the moving issuers contend that their respective prospectuses listed between eleven and underwriters,officers,and directors,and we acknowledge that this is a close question,we follow the court of chancery approach in fli deep marine because simmonds demand letters identified a closed set of alleged wrongdoers,we agree with the district court that the demand letters in this case sufficiently identify the alleged wrongdoers.in re section b,d at.
simmonds letters failed,however,to satisfy the second and third prongs of the delaware test for demand adequacy,which require the shareholder to identify the wrongdoing allegedly perpetrated and the legal action the shareholder wants the board to take on the corporation behalf.yaw,wl,at simply put,simmonds demand letters presented factual theories that vary significantly from the facts alleged in the complaints.her demand letters claimed that the underwriters directly bought and sold the issuing companies shares,and accordingly requested that the issuing companies seek disgorgement of the underwriters trading profits.in contrast,her complaints do not allege that the underwriters directly participated in buying and selling the issuing companies stock,and instead seek disgorgement of the profits the underwriters received through their investment banking operations 
according to the complaints,the underwriters violated section b when they profited indirectly through their customers purchases and sales of the issuing companies shares.specifically,the complaints allege that the underwriters engaged in transactions when their existing customers purchased and sold the issuing company stock,they obtained new banking customers in exchange for giving other companies insiders favorable consideration in the issuing company ipo,and they obtained additional banking business from the issuing company in exchange for helping the issuing company insiders profit from their own company ipo.the complaints assert that these transactions violated section b,and request disgorgement of profits obtained through these transactions.none of these alleged transactions is referenced in any way in the original demand letters submitted to the moving issuers.the section b claim made out in these demand letters bears no resemblance to the elaborate scheme described in simmonds complaints.
even if we consider simmonds letters to of the moving issuers,she failed to identify the wrongful acts clearly and specifically.yaw,wl,at.the letters noted that the challenged transactions are related to improper ipo allocation laddering and spinning and research and stock rating activities.simmonds conclusory references to laddering,spinning,and research and stock rating,were vague and ambiguous,as was her open ended reference to court,law firm and sec websites,and completely failed to provide sufficiently detailed information to permit the boards to conduct a good faith inquiry into the alleged wrongdoing.
moreover,because the demand letters and the complaints contain distinct factual assertions,the demand letters also failed to set forth the legal action the shareholder wants the board to take on the corporation behalf.yaw,wl,at.the demand letters requested that the moving issuers compel the underwriters and other group members to disgorge the profits they made through purchases and sales of the issuing company stock.the complaints,on the other hand,do not mention the underwriters direct trading profits,and instead seek disgorgement of the profits the underwriters received through their investment banking operations.
the court of chancery has noted that demand letters must be sufficiently specific to enable the board to perform its duty to make a good faith investigation of claims of alleged wrongdoing and to rectify the misconduct at issue in a subsequent lawsuit.yaw,wl,at.the court further noted that to require a board to investigate claims asserted ambiguously would not be an efficient use of corporate resources,because the board would lack the information necessary to make a good faith inquiry.id.simmonds demand letters were particularly inadequate because they described a different course of conduct than the one she described in her complaints.and clearly,simmonds demand letters could have led directors to investigate facts the underwriters purchases and sales of issuing company stock that were only marginally related to the issues ultimately raised in the complaints the underwriters customers purchases and sales of issuing company stock,and associated agreements between the underwriters and their customers.
we are not persuaded by simmonds argument that the moving issuers subjectively understood what she meant in her demand letters.delaware case law sets forth an objective standard for assessing the adequacy of a demand and does not inquire whether the board of directors had independent knowledge of relevant information.to the extent that simmonds argument has been addressed by any courts,it has been soundly rejected.for example,the third circuit has rejected a shareholder argument that a conclusory demand was adequate because the directors were in a better position than the shareholders to make the investigation necessary to uncover wrongdoers.shlensky,at.in the related context of demand refusal,the delaware supreme court rejected the argument that t he board has better access to the relevant facts and plaintiffs should therefore be relieved of their burden to show that the board refusal was improper.levine smith,internal quotation marks omitted,overruled en banc on other grounds by brehm,at.
simmonds argument is an around delaware requirement that shareholders make reasonably specific demands,and were we to adopt simmonds proposed approach,delaware demand standard would be eviscerated.plaintiffs in derivative actions often seek relief for a corporate insider wrongdoing.if the demand requirements were relaxed on account of insiders subjective knowledge,then shareholders would never have to clearly and specifically describe their assertions in a demand letter.see yaw,wl,at.to the extent that simmonds believed that relevant information was readily available at court,law firm and sec websites as she claimed in her letters,it was her burden under delaware law to distill the relevant facts and present them to the board.if simmonds lacked access to necessary information that was exclusively within the corporation possession,delaware law specifically allows a shareholder to examine t he corporation stock ledger,a list of its stockholders,and its other books and records,ann.tit,b,and delaware courts have strongly encouraged shareholders to avail of such investigative tools,see king verifone holdings,nn.ch collecting cases.in short,delaware law does not allow shareholders to forego investigations in an attempt to shift costs onto the corporation.
simmonds also argues in part that these delaware rules are incompatible with section.she alleges that she was unable to obtain necessary information because the group members failed to file section a reports as required by federal law.we disagree with simmonds contention that delaware requirement is incompatible with section b.delaware law expressly permits shareholders to inspect the corporation stock ledger,which is a compilation of the transfers by and to each individual shareholder,with each transaction separately posted to separately maintained shareholder accounts.crown emak partners,llc kurz,en banc internal quotation marks omitted.in most section b cases,a request to inspect the issuing company books and records including the stock ledger would likely allow shareholders to gather enough information to submit an adequate demand to the issuing company.simmonds does not appear to have made any effort to obtain such information prior to submitting her demand letters and filing her lawsuits.accordingly,we hold that delaware state law demand requirement is compatible with section.
as an alternative to her argument that her demand letters were adequate,simmonds contends that the demand requirement should be excused as futile.however,delaware courts have repeatedly held that a shareholder concedes that a demand is not futile by submitting a demand to the board.delaware law could hardly be clearer in holding that shareholders may not invoke the futility exception after submitting a demand to the board.fli deep marine,wl,at see also id.at collecting cases.
we hold that the thirty demand letters in the record fail to satisfy the demand requirement under delaware law.accordingly,we affirm the district court order granting the moving issuers motions to dismiss the thirty cases to which they are parties.
statute of limitations 
the district court dismissed the cases involving the remaining issuers that is,the issuing companies that did not join the moving issuers motion to dismiss on account of the statute of limitations.section b provides that no suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized from the alleged transactions.b.we have previously issued a thorough decision interpreting this provision,whittaker whittaker,f d cir,and we are bound by our prior holding.
in whittaker,a corporate insider engaged in prohibited transactions between december and december.the corporation sought disgorgement in january without filing a lawsuit.the insider paid the full amount requested,but later filed suit against the corporation seeking to recover some of the money he had paid.id.at.in the lawsuit,he argued that section b statute of limitations barred the corporation from retaining any amounts that he had obtained from transactions prior to january that is,two years prior to the time that the corporation requested that he disgorge his profits.id.at.the district court agreed with the insider,and found that various corporate officers had information which put the corporation on notice throughout the relevant trading period between and.id.at.based on this factual finding,the district court allowed the corporation to recover the insider profits only for the two years prior to the disgorgement request.id.at,see also whittaker whittaker,wl,at,setting forth factual findings in greater detail.
on appeal,we explained that there were three competing approaches to section b statute of limitations a strict approach under which the statute is treated as a statute of is,a firm bar that is not subject to tolling a notice or discovery approach like the one that had been applied by the district court,under which the time period is tolled until the corporation had sufficient information to put it on notice of its potential b claim and a disclosure approach under which the time period is tolled until the insider discloses the transactions at issue in his mandatory a reports.whittaker,at.after thoroughly analyzing the merits of the competing interpretations,id.at,we held unequivocally that the disclosure interpretation is the correct construction of.id.at.under this approach,an insider failure to disclose covered transactions in the required a reports tolls the two year limitations period for suits under b to recover profits connected with such a transaction.the period for b begins to run when the transactions are disclosed in the insider a report.id.at.accordingly,we reversed the district court use of the notice approach and held that the corporation could recover all of the insider profits,even those obtained long after the corporation was on notice of the insider trading.id.
in this case,the defendants advance various arguments in an attempt to distinguish whittaker.all of these arguments are variations on a single knew or should have known of the alleged wrongful conduct many years before she filed her complaints.but despite the defendants arguments,the central holding of our opinion in in our legal analysis and our application of the law to the facts of that that the section b statute of limitations is tolled until the insider discloses his transactions in a section a filing,regardless of whether the plaintiff knew or should have known of the conduct at issue.we recently restated this holding in roth reyes,f d cir,in which we concluded that the statute of limitations begins to run when the insider files a section a report even if the contents of the filing inaccurately claim an exemption that does not actually apply.id.at.we explained that the basic act of filing a section a report satisfies whittaker disclosure requirement and supports the goals of disclosure and transparency underlying section.id.at.
the defendants advance four specific points in support of their general theory that whittaker can be distinguished.first,they argue that whittaker does not apply because simmonds knew or should have known of the relevant facts sometime around.by that time,much of the information described in the complaints had been publicly disclosed in court filings,news reports,and the issuing companies ipo registration filings.the defendants contend that w hen a party is aware of the necessary facts to bring a claim,there is no excuse for any delay beyond the statute of limitations period,let alone a delay of six years.however,this theory was plainly rejected in whittaker.our whittaker decision reversed the district court conclusion that the statute of limitations began to run at the time that various corporate officers had information which put the corporation on notice of the insider trades.whittaker,at.the defendants notice argument is an unpersuasive attempt to revive a theory that we considered and rejected nearly thirty years ago.
second,the defendants argue that the section b limitations period should not be tolled indefinitely unless the defendant actively conceal s the facts necessary to trigger a section b lawsuit.this theory overlooks the footnote in whittaker in which we explained that t he failure to disclose in a reports,whether intentional or inadvertent,is deemed concealment,thus triggering the traditional equitable tolling doctrine of fraudulent concealment.id.at.that conclusion was further bolstered by our emphasis on creating a rule that can be mechanically calculated from objective facts,id.at,which would be undermined if courts were required to conduct inquiries into the insiders state of mind about their failure to file section a reports.
third,the defendants contend that whittaker does not apply in this case because the underwriters are exempt from section a reporting requirements under the sec and exemptions.however,this argument finds no support in whittaker rule.see whittaker,at.in any event,were we to follow the defendants down this line of argument,we would soon find ourselves deciding the substantive merits of the parties dispute.the question of whether or not the underwriters are exempt from filing section a reports is identical to the question of whether they may be held liable under section b.we refrain from adopting an approach that would merge the tolling doctrine with the substantive wrong santa maria pac.bell,cir.
finally,the defendants argue that whittaker does not apply because it involved a corporation that was seeking disgorgement,rather than an outside shareholder as in the instant case.they assert that we should adopt different lines of analysis depending on whether the plaintiff is an issuing company or is an outside shareholder such as simmonds.however,our decision in whittaker created a blanket rule that applies in all section b actions.a key component of our reasoning was that section a notices allow the company are likely to be outsiders,minority holders to obtain the information necessary to bring a section b action.whittaker,at.nothing in whittaker logic or reasoning would allow us to distinguish between issuing companies and outside shareholders,and we refrain from adopting such a strained interpretation of our precedent.
in short,the fundamental holding of whittaker is that section b statute of limitations begins to run from the time that the defendant files a section a disclosure statement.because simmonds alleges that the defendants did not file any section a reports,we conclude that simmonds claims are not.accordingly,the district court decision on this ground is reversed.
in their,the underwriters contend that the district court erred by dismissing the thirty cases involving the moving issuers without prejudice on account of simmonds inadequate demand.they argue that these dismissals should have been with prejudice because simmonds claims are.although we disagree that simmonds claims are,we agree that the district court should have dismissed the thirty complaints against the moving issuers with prejudice on account of her failure to satisfy the section b demand requirement in those cases.
we have previously held that a complaint may be dismissed with prejudice on account of the plaintiff failure to satisfy the demand requirement,in re silicon graphics.sec,cir,abrogated on other grounds,tellabs,makor issues rights,and various other circuits have reached the same conclusion although the district court dismissed simmonds thirty complaints against the moving issuers without prejudice,our decision to convert the dismissal is not unprecedented.in a derivative action in which the shareholder failed to show demand futility,the first circuit sua sponte converted the district court dismissal from without prejudice to with prejudice.in re kauffman mut.fund actions,cir.the court explained that the plaintiff was barred from relitigating the issues decided in that action,and accordingly the dismissal should have been entered with prejudice rather than without.id.
we agree with the first circuit approach in kauffman.simmonds is barred from relitigating issues relating to the adequacy of the demand letters she sent to the thirty moving issuers and the letters she sent to of the moving issuers.as with any issue litigated fully on merits,shareholders may not endlessly relitigate the adequacy of their demand.accordingly,we vacate the district court order dismissing without prejudice the thirty cases involving the moving issuers,and the district court is instructed to dismiss these thirty cases with prejudice.
in the cases that were improperly dismissed as and in which the issuing companies did not join the moving issuers motion to dismiss,the district court is directed to permit the underwriters and issuing companies to seek dismissal on account of simmonds failure to comply with the demand requirement we note that our discussion in this opinion will almost certainly resolve the twenty remaining cases involving issuers incorporated in delaware.we express no opinion regarding the four cases involving issuers.however,as simmonds demands letters to those companies are not in the record,we leave it to the district court to address those cases in the first instance we note that four of the cases involve issuers incorporated in jurisdictions other than delaware two issuers are incorporated in california,one in washington,and one in bermuda.we direct the district court to analyze the adequacy of those demand letters in accordance with the principles articulated in,the court should apply the demand requirements of california,washington,and bermuda law,unless those requirements would frustrate specific objectives of section and the exchange act.kamen,at citation,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
conclusion 
we affirm the district court conclusion that simmonds demand letters to the thirty moving issuers were inadequate under delaware law,reverse the district court conclusion that all of simmonds claims are,and vacate the district court dismissal orders as to the thirty moving issuers with instructions that the district court dismiss these thirty cases with prejudice on account of simmonds failure to satisfy delaware demand requirement.we remand the remaining cases that is,the cases involving the issuing companies that did not join the moving issuers motion to dismiss with instructions for the district court to allow the underwriters and issuing companies to file an appropriate motion to challenge the adequacy of simmonds demand letters under delaware,california,washington,and bermuda law,unless that law conflicts with section b.costs are awarded to the appellees.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,vacated in part,and remanded in part.
the statutory text of section b provides that no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized.b.in my view,no suit means no suit,and two years after the date such profit was realized means two years after the insider final profitable transaction,regardless of even section a report is filed.the text of the statute sets a firm bar against section b suits filed more than two years after the transaction is completed.accordingly,i agree with the supreme court dictum that section b sets a period of repose.lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson.
this straightforward textual reading is further confirmed by comparing the language of section b with the language of the other statutes of limitations in our securities laws.see lampf,at nn.the court in lampf explained that language such as section b no such suit shall be brought creates periods of repose that are not subject to tolling.id.at.in addition,the general securities fraud statute of limitations added by the act of,stat,provides that securities fraud suits may be brought not later than years after such violation.b.the supreme court recently noted that this provision giv es defendants total repose after five years.merck,reynolds,emphasis added.there is little meaningful distinction between the language of b and section b one provides that suits may be brought not later than years after such violation,and the other provides that no such suit shall be brought more than two years after the date such profit was realized.to me,this nearly identical language should giv e defendants total repose under both statutes.see merck.at.
there are numerous reasons why congress would elect to create a firm period of repose for section b actions.although there is no direct evidence of congress intent,the legislative history has left behind an intriguing clue.when the senate and house of representatives passed their respective bills that later became the exchange act,the house of representatives version did not even provide for a private right of action under section b,whereas the senate version provided a right of action but omitted a statute of limitations.romeo dye,supra,b vi.it is reasonable to infer that the house negotiators,in reaching a compromise with the senate over the inclusion of a private right of action,might have bargained to include a stringent statute of limitations to circumscribe that right of recovery.
admittedly,the legislative history is inconclusive,but a restrictive statute of limitations is eminently logical.section b imposes an inflexible penalty on corporate insiders even if they are not at fault and third parties are unharmed.as section b critics have noted,its disgorgement provision is little more than a trap for the unwary.id.a.it makes no sense to allow individuals to be hauled into court even they unintentionally violate section.our holding in whittaker creates the possibility that a claim that affects transactions might hang forever over honest persons.litzler cc investments,cir jacobs,concurring.whittaker could lead to the anomalous situation in which a corporate officer who mistakenly calculates the period can be compelled to disgorge his trading profits decades after the fact,whereas a culpable officer who engages in fraud
