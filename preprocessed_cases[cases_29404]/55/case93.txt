in united states evanston,we recently held that a district court abuses its discretion and impermissibly coerces a jury verdict where,over defense objection and after the administration of an unsuccessful allen charge,the court inquire s into the reasons for a trial jury deadlock and then permit s supplemental argument focused on those issues,where the issues in dispute are factual rather than legal,wl,at cir.july.in this case we also address the use of supplemental closing arguments to assist a deadlocked jury,but under significantly different circumstances where the district court never gave an allen charge and never inquired into the reasons for the jury deadlock.we hold today that under these circumstances,unlike those at issue in evanston,the district court decision to permit supplemental closing argument did not result in impermissible coercion and did not constitute an abuse of discretion meriting reversal.nor do we find any plain error in the district court jury instructions.
background 
between and,rosa della porta worked as a bookkeeper for the international longshoremen and warehousemen union local in los angeles.as the union bookkeeper,della porta was responsible for maintaining the union receipt books and depositing various cash and check payments received by the union into its two bank accounts.in the spring of,the union internal auditor discovered that thousands of dollars in cash payments received by the union had not been deposited into its bank accounts.a department of labor investigation ensued,and della porta was charged with one count of embezzlement and theft of labor union assets under c.
at trial,the government sought to prove that della porta used a dual deposit slip method to conceal her theft of the union cash.under this system,she prepared two sets of bank deposit slips when she made deposits into the union accounts one for the bank and one for the union records.the union deposit slips reflected that all of the cash payments had actually been deposited in the union bank accounts,but the deposit slips submitted to the bank showed that either less or no cash had been deposited.in order to account for the difference in the cash value between the two sets of deposit slips,della porta substituted dues checks received from the union members employers in place of the cash missing from the bank deposits.the dues checks did not appear on the union deposit slips.there was a discrepancy of over between the cash received by the union and the cash deposited into the union bank account between and.the government also presented evidence that,during the same approximate period,della porta deposited more than in cash and more than in money orders into her personal bank account.the government introduced evidence of both the dual deposit scheme and the cash and money order deposits into della porta account through roberto gonzalez,the lead investigating agent from the department of labor.
della porta testified in her defense.she admitted using the dual deposit system but denied taking the union cash for her personal use.she claimed that luisa gratz,the union president,instructed her to withhold certain amounts of cash from the deposits into the union bank accounts so the union could donate the cash to overseas charities and organizations.as for the influx of deposits into her personal checking account between and,della porta claimed that her sister gave her some of the money to help her pay her household expenses,and that she also earned income on the side through work with mary kay and avon.when called as a witness by the government,however,della porta sister denied ever giving della porta cash for any household or related expenses.
after deliberating for approximately three hours over two separate days,the jury sent the court a note that read as follows 
jury requests the numbers of the exhibits where the government showed the dual deposit slips and then showed the relationship of deposits into rosa account.this was done during roberto gonzalez testimony.he showed money orders,deposit slips,into rosa account.we need the numbers of the exhibits.
the court and the parties debated how to best respond to the jury request.the court stated that it viewed the jury request as almost asking for a mini closing again where the government would juxtapose the evidence of the cash taken from the union bank deposits with the evidence of the cash and money orders deposited into della porta bank account,and della porta would argue that such a relationship could not be circumstantially inferred.the government offered to stipulate to such a process,but the court concluded that a mini closing was necessary at that juncture.with both parties approval,the court ultimately responded to the jury that it was unable to respond to this specific request as worded.the jury deliberated for the remainder of the day.
the following morning,the jury sent out a second note asking if it could have copies of the transcripts of roberto gonzalez testimony.with the parties approval,the court responded no.however,you may have the testimony of roberto gonzalez read to you in open court.after the court reporter read back gonzalez testimony,the jury returned to deliberations for about three hours.it then sent a third note to the court that stated the jury can not come to a unanimous decision.the court proposed bringing the jurors out to conduct a direct inquiry of the foreperson,and potentially the other individual jurors,to determine whether it was hopelessly deadlocked.neither party objected to the proposal.the following exchange between the court and the foreperson ensued in the courtroom 
the court please listen carefully and only answer the questions that i ask and do volunteer or give me any additional information beyond what i ask.
you have indicated that the jury is deadlocked is that correct 
the foreperson yes.
the court is there anything the court could do to further assist in the deliberations 
the foreperson what do you mean like providing is sic with some extras 
the court i sorry 
the foreperson do you mean by providing us with some other information 
the court let me give you some specific examples to follow up on that question.for example,would it be helpful to read a portion read testimony back to you read testimony back to the jurors 
the foreperson no,i do think so.
the court would it be helpful,for example,to allow the attorneys five or ten more minutes to argue each particular side 
the foreperson i do know if that would help us.
the court all right.go back to the jury room and i do know if you want to discuss any particular issues as to whether or not something else would help you come to a decision.let me know your view that you still deadlocked.thank you.
after the court excused the jury,it asked the parties whether they would object if the jury came back and asked for five minutes of argument on a point or just five more minutes of argument on either side.the government stated that it had no objection.the defense objected to any further argument,arguing that it in the jurors hands at this point.
about ten minutes later,the jury sent the court a fourth note.the note stated we would like to hear the attorneys argument again,just as you suggested.the government proposed asking the jurors if there was a particular issue they wanted to hear argument on.della porta counsel objected that such an inquiry would invade the process of independent juror deliberations.the court sided with della porta on the issue and declined to make inquiry of the jury.it ruled that each side would be allowed fifteen minutes of additional argument,and that the government could reserve a portion of that time for rebuttal.
the government argued first,followed by the defense.the government then closed with a brief rebuttal.the jury resumed deliberations and reached a unanimous guilty verdict in less than an hour.della porta now appeals that verdict.she argues that the district court employment of supplemental arguments impermissibly coerced a guilty verdict,and that the district court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury regarding her defense that her actions were authorized by the union president.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court decision to allow supplemental argument for abuse of discretion.evanston,wl,at.under this standard,the district judge discretion should be preserved unless its exercise could deprive the defendant of a constitutional right or otherwise prejudice defendant case.id.quoting united states goode,cir.we review de novo,however,the question w hether a judge has improperly coerced a jury verdict.id.quoting united states berger,cir.
because della porta never requested a jury instruction on an authorization defense at trial,we review the district court failure to give such an instruction for plain error.see united states bear,cir.to reverse under this standard,there must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson.united states,quoting united states olano.if these conditions are satisfied,we may exercise our discretion to reverse,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the district court neither abused its discretion nor coerced a guilty verdict by ordering supplemental closing argument.
in evanston,we addressed,as a matter of first impression in this circuit,the use of supplemental closing arguments to assist a deadlocked jury in a criminal trial.the case involved charges of assault resulting in serious bodily injury occurring on an indian reservation.wl,at.after a day trial,and after deliberating for five hours over two separate days,the jury advised the district court that it could not reach a verdict.id.the court then gave ninth circuit model jury instruction often referred to as an allen,or dynamite,and asked the jury to continue deliberating.id.after deliberating for almost another three hours,the jury again advised the court that it could not reach a verdict.id.the court met with the parties and proposed bring ing in the members of the jury,ascertain ing the issue on which they are deadlocked,and allow ing ten more minutes to each side to argue that point.id.the government welcomed the opportunity to reargue,but the defense objected to the proposed process.id.the court then called the jury back into the courtroom.it admonished the jury that b oth parties have a right to make sure that the judge and others do their very best to make sure that the jury empanelled sic to hear a case absolutely can not decide it before they declare a mistrial or release the jury.id.at first alteration added.it then asked whether the procedure of,without adding additional evidence,identifying particular points and rearguing those points might assist them in resolving the impasse.id.at.the jury responded affirmatively and identified two issues on which it wished to hear further argument witness credibility and how the victim injuries were caused.id.the court then excused the jury and allowed the parties to argue once more whether supplemental arguments should be permitted.the defense repeated its objections,but the court ultimately decided to allow reargument.id.the government presented its argument first,followed by the defense.after two more hours of deliberation,the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict.id.
we reversed and remanded for a new trial.specifically limiting our holding to the circumstances at issue in the case,we held that the district court employment of supplemental argument resulted in impermissible coercion,and consequently an abuse of discretion meriting reversal.id.at.we reasoned that the use of supplemental closing arguments under the circumstances infringed upon the traditional role of the jury in two important ways the judge questioning as to the reasons for the deadlock required that the jury divulge the state of its unfinished deliberations,thereby violating the jury deliberative secrecy,and the parties supplemental arguments,coupled with the judge insistence on continuing after a second deadlock,injected the court and the attorneys into the jury deliberative process,thereby raising the specter of jury coercion.id.at.furthermore,given the court decision to order supplemental arguments after an allen charge and after the jury reported a second impasse,the lawyers arguments were of perhaps increased coercive value the implication was,as with a second allen charge,that the judge believed the jury had not accorded proper deference to his prior encouragement to reach a verdict.id.citing united states seawell,cir.in sum,t he compounded coercion resulting from the combined use of the deadlock instruction and supplemental arguments targeted to the jury exact areas of dispute created a broad,impermissible opportunity for interference with the jury role as sole.id.at.
we also noted as influencing our decision the fact that the district court had available several less coercive alternatives to ordering supplemental argument,such as the original jury instructions relating to the jury areas of concern,providing supplemental instructions regarding the relevant legal standard for causation,and allowing the jury to review portions of witness testimony.id.at.in reversing the district court,however,we took pains to note that our decision was limited to the circumstances presented,id.at,and declined to foreclose the possibility that supplemental argument treating factual matters could ever be used in a permissible fashion,id.at.we also left open the question of whether the use of supplemental arguments to address factual matters is necessarily or always an error of constitutional dimension,whatever the circumstances.id.at 
using evanston as our guidepost,we hold that the district court neither coerced a guilty verdict nor abused its discretion by ordering supplemental arguments under the facts presented in this case.we so hold because the set of key circumstances rendering the use of supplemental arguments coercive in evanston are simply not present here.
first,unlike in evanston,the district court in this case never gave an allen charge.nor did it indicate to the jurors that it had to satisfy itself that they absolutely could not reach a verdict before declaring a mistrial.id.at.these distinctions are crucial.as we alluded to in evanston,see id.at,a single allen charge,without more,stands at the brink of impermissible coercion.seawell,at.although we have upheld the use of the allen charge under certain circumstances,e ven slight deviations from the language and procedure approved by this court can result in reversible error based upon likelihood of coercion.evanston,wl,at citing united states mason,cir.it is per se error,for example,to give a second allen charge where the jury has not asked for one,because doing so conveys a message that the jurors have acted contrary to the earlier instruction as that instruction was properly to be understood and that message serves no purpose other than impermissible coercion.id.quoting seawell,at.it was against these background core principles that we viewed the district court procedure in evanston.id.by ordering supplemental arguments after giving an allen charge,the implication was,as with a second allen charge,that the judge believed the jury had not accorded proper deference to his prior encouragement to reach a verdict.id.at.
moreover,the likelihood of coercion occasioned by the allen charge in evanston was exacerbated by the district court later admonition to the jury after it reported it was deadlocked for a second time.such commentary,coupled with the supplemental closing arguments,risked the same type of coercion and prejudice contemplated by seawall.id.at citing at.it was very likely that,having been admonished once with the allen charge,and then admonished that the district court had to make sure the jury absolutely could not reach a verdict before declaring a mistrial,the jurors in the minority might have been swayed to reach a verdict more readily,and against their honest beliefs,than if the supplemental arguments had not been given.id.
here,none of the above concerns was implicated when the district court ordered suppl
