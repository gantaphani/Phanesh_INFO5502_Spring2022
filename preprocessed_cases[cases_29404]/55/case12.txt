nearly a decade ago,petitioner camreta,a state child protective services worker,and petitioner alford,a county deputy sheriff,interviewed then at her oregon elementary school about allegations that her father had sexually abused her.they did not have a warrant or parental consent to conduct the interview.eventually stated that she had been abused.her father stood trial for that abuse,but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.mother,respondent here hereinafter,subsequently sued camreta and alford on s behalf for damages under,alleging that the interview breached the fourth amendment proscription on unreasonable seizures.the district court granted summary judgment to the officials.the ninth circuit affirmed.the court of appeals first ruled that seizing absent a warrant,court order,parental consent,or exigent circumstances violated the constitution.but the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct.the court explained that it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim so that officials would be on notice that they could not dispense with traditional fourth amendment protections in this context.although the judgment entered was in their favor,camreta and alford petitioned this court to review the ninth circuit ruling that their conduct violated the fourth amendment.declined to for review of the decision that the officials have immunity.

a the relevant statute confers unqualified power on this court to grant certiorari upon the petition of any party.that language covers petitions brought by litigants who have prevailed,as well as those who have lost,in the courts below.
b an appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy article iii requirement.to comply with that requirement,litigants must demonstrate a personal stake in the suit.summers earth island institute.the petitioner has such a stake when he has suffered an injury in fact that is caused by the conduct complained of and that will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife.and the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest in the dispute,so that the case features that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.los angeles lyons.the parties must have the necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation,but throughout its course.arizonans for official english arizona.so long as the litigants possess the requisite personal stake,an appeal presents a case or controversy,no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.see deposit guaranty nat.bank roper,electrical fittings thomas betts.
this article iii standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a determination that their conduct violated the constitution because that ruling may have prospective effect on the parties.so long as it remains good law,an official who regularly engages in the challenged conduct as part of his job as camreta does must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action.the official thus can demonstrate injury,causation,and redressability.and conversely,if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct,she has a stake in preserving the court holding so that she will have ongoing protection from the practice.
c this court prudential practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties does not bar consideration of immunized officials petitions.the court has recognized exceptions to this prudential rule when there has been a policy reaso n of sufficient importance to allow an appeal by the winner below.deposit guaranty,at.just such a reason exists in qualified immunity cases.the constitutional rulings that prevailing parties ask the court to consider in these cases have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials and the policies of the government units to which they belong.the rulings are designed to produce this effect by establishing controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases.moreover,they are so designed with this court permission,to promote clarity and observance of constitutional rules.taken together,these features of qualified immunity cases support bending the usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials petitions.
to begin with the nature of these suits under and bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights.but if those officials are entitled to qualified immunity,a court can dismiss the damages claim without ever deciding its merits and so the qualified immunity situation threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.to prevent that problem,this court has permitted lower courts to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established.see,pearson callahan.here,the ninth circuit followed exactly this process so that it could settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the future conduct of officials.
given its purpose and effect,such a decision is reviewable in this court at an immunized official behest.if the court usual prevailing party rule applied,the official would either have to acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this court,or defy the lower court view,adhere to what has been declared an illegal practice,and invite further law suits and possible punitive damages,at.and applying this court usual bar on review would undermine the purpose of the process,which is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.bunting mellen,scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari.just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue,so too may it support this court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court decision.
this holding is limited in two respects.first,it addresses only this court authority to review cases in this procedural posture.the court need not decide if an appellate court can also entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds.second,the holding concerns only what the court may review,not what the court actually will choose to review.going forward,the court will consider prevailing parties petitions one by one in accord with its usual standards for granting certiorari.
a separate jurisdictional problem requires the court to dismiss this case at the threshold the case is moot.in a dispute of this kind,both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome.that is true of camreta,who remains employed as a child protective services worker,and so has an interest in challenging the ninth circuit ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an interview.but can no longer claim the plaintiff usual stake in preserving the court holding because she no longer needs protection from the challenged practice.she has moved to florida and is only months away from her birthday and,presumably,from her high school graduation.when subsequent events ma ke it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,there is no live controversy to review.united states concentrated phosphate export.
when a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal,this court has authority to direct the entry of such appropriate judgment,decree,or order,or require such further proceedings as may be just under the circumstances.the court established practice is to vacate the judgment below,see,united states munsingwear,to ensure that those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled are not treated as if there had been a review,ibid.the point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision from spawning any legal consequences.at.a constitutional ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision.when happenstance prevents this court review of that ruling,the normal rule should apply vacatur rightly strips the decision below of its binding effect,deakins monaghan,and clears the path for future relitigation,munsingwear,at.because mootness has frustrated camreta ability to challenge the ninth circuit ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse victim at school,that part of the ninth circuit decision must be vacated.

on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
almost a decade ago,a state child protective services worker and a county deputy sheriff interviewed a girl at her elementary school in oregon about allegations that her father had sexually abused her.the girl mother subsequently sued the government officials on the child behalf for damages under stat,claiming that the interview infringed the fourth amendment.the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit agreed,ruling that the officials had violated the constitution by failing to obtain a warrant to conduct the interview.but the court of appeals further held that qualified immunity shielded the officials from monetary liability because the constitutional right at issue was not clearly established under existing law.
the two officials sought this court review of the ninth circuit ruling on the fourth amendment.we granted their petitions to examine two questions.first,may officials who prevail on grounds of qualified obtain our review of a court of appeals decision that their conduct violated the constitution and second,if we may consider cases in this procedural posture,did the ninth circuit correctly determine that this interview breached the fourth amendment 
we conclude that this court generally may review a lower court constitutional ruling at the behest of a government official granted immunity.but we may not do so in this case for reasons peculiar to it.the case has become moot because the child has grown up and moved across the country,and so will never again be subject to the oregon interviewing practices whose constitutionality is at issue.we therefore do not reach the fourth amendment question in this case.in line with our normal practice when mootness frustrates a party right to appeal,see united states munsingwear,we vacate the part of the ninth circuit opinion that decided the fourth amendment issue.
in february,police arrested nimrod greene for suspected sexual abuse of a young boy unrelated to him.during the investigation of that offense,the boy parents told police that they suspected greene of molesting his daughter g.the police reported this information to the oregon department of human services,which assigned petitioner bob camreta,a child protective services caseworker,to assess safety.several days later,camreta,accompanied by petitioner james alford,a deschutes county deputy sheriff,went to elementary school and interviewed her about the allegations.and alford did not have a warrant,nor had they obtained parental consent to conduct the interview.although at first denied that her father had molested her,she eventually stated that she had been abused.greene was indicted and stood trial for sexually abusing,but the jury failed to reach a verdict and the charges were later dismissed.
respondent sarah greene,mother,subsequently sued camreta and alford on behalf for damages under,which authorizes suits against state officials for violations of constitutional rights.alleged that the officials interview had breached the fourth amendment proscription on unreasonable seizures 
the district court granted summary judgment to camreta and alford,and the ninth circuit affirmed.the court of appeals first ruled that the interview violated rights because camreta and alford had seize d and interrogate d in the absence of a warrant,a court order,exigent circumstances,or parental consent.footnote omitted.but the court further held that the officials were entitled to qualified immunity from damages liability because no clearly established law had warned them of the illegality of their conduct,at.
the ninth circuit explained why it had chosen to rule on the merits of the constitutional claim,rather than merely hold that the officials were immune from suit.by addressing the legality of the interview,the court said,it could provide guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the fourth amendment.at.that guidance came in no uncertain terms g overnment officials investigating allegations of child abuse,the court warned,should cease operating on the assumption that a special need automatically justifies dispensing with traditional fourth amendment protections in this context.at.
although the judgment entered was in their favor,camreta and alford petitioned this court to review the ninth circuit ruling that their conduct violated the fourth amendment.declined to for review of the decision that the officials have immunity.we granted certiorari.
we first consider our ability to act on a petition brought by government officials who have won final judgment on grounds of qualified immunity,but who object to an appellate court ruling that they violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.camreta and alford are,without doubt,prevailing parties.the ninth circuit decision shielded them from monetary liability,and chose not to contest that ruling.so whatever else follows,they will not have to pay the damages she sought.the question we confront is whether we may nonetheless review the court of appeals holding that the officials violated the constitution.
the statute governing this court jurisdiction authorizes us to adjudicate a case in this posture,and does not contend otherwise.the relevant provision confers unqualified power on this court to grant certiorari upon the petition of any party.emphasis added.that language covers petitions brought by litigants who have prevailed,as well as those who have lost,in the court below.see gressman,geller,shapiro,bishop,hartnett,supreme court practice ed.hereinafter stern gressman.
however,alleges two impediments to our exercise of statutory authority here,one constitutional and the other prudential.first,she claims that article iii bars review because petitions submitted by immunized officials present no case or controversy.see brief for respondent.second,she argues that our settled practice of declining to hear appeals by prevailing parties should apply with full force when officials have obtained immunity.see,at.we disagree on both counts.
article iii of the constitution grants this court authority to adjudicate legal disputes only in the context of cases or controversies.to enforce this limitation,we demand that litigants demonstrate a personal stake in the suit.summers earth island institute,slip,at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states parole comm geraghty.the party invoking the court authority has such a stake when three conditions are satisfied the petitioner must show that he has suffered an injury in fact that is caused by the conduct complained of and that will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted.and the opposing party also must have an ongoing interest in the dispute,so that the case features that concrete which sharpens the presentation of issues.los angeles lyons,internal quotation marks omitted.to ensure a case remains fit for adjudication,the parties must have the necessary stake not only at the outset of litigation,but throughout its course.arizonans for official english arizona.
we have previously recognized that an appeal brought by a prevailing party may satisfy article iii requirement.see deposit guaranty nat.bank roper.indeed,we have twice before allowed a party for whom judgment was entered to challenge an unfavorable lower court ruling.see electrical fittings thomas betts,in that context as in others,we stated,the critical question under article iii is whether the litigant retains the necessary personal stake in the appeal.deposit guaranty,at.as we will explain,a court will usually invoke rules of federal appellate practice to decline review of a prevailing party challenge even when he has the requisite stake,at see infra,at.but in such a case,article iii is not what poses the bar these rules of practice d o not have their source in the jurisdictional limitations of the constitution.deposit guaranty,at.so long as the litigants possess the personal stake discussed above,an appeal presents a case or controversy,no matter that the appealing party was the prevailing party below.
this article iii standard often will be met when immunized officials seek to challenge a ruling that their conduct violated the constitution.that is not because a court has made a retrospective judgment about the lawfulness of the officials behavior,for that judgment is unaccompanied by any personal liability.rather,it is because the judgment may have prospective effect on the parties.the court in such a case says although this official is immune from damages today,what he did violates the constitution and he or anyone else who does that thing again will be personally liable.if the official regularly engages in that conduct as part of his job as camreta does,he suffers injury caused by the adverse constitutional ruling.so long as it continues in effect,he must either change the way he performs his duties or risk a meritorious damages action,at discussing prevailing party stake in a ruling prospective effects.only by overturning the ruling on appeal can the official gain clearance to engage in the conduct in the future.he thus can demonstrate,as we demand,injury,causation,and redressability and conversely,if the person who initially brought the suit may again be subject to the challenged conduct,she has a stake in preserving the court holding.see erie pap,honig doe,lyons,at examining whether the plaintiff had shown a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way only if the ruling remains good law will she have ongoing protection from the practice.
we therefore reject view that article iii bars us from adjudicating any and all challenges brought by government officials who have received immunity below.that the victor has filed the appeal does not deprive us of jurisdiction.the parties in such cases may yet have a sufficient interest in the outcome of a litigated issue to present a case or controversy.deposit guaranty,at.
article iii aside,an important question of judicial policy remains.as a matter of practice and prudence,we have generally declined to consider cases at the request of a prevailing party,even when the constitution allowed us to do so.see,gunn university comm.to end war in viet nam,new york telephone maltbie,per curiam see also bunting mellen,scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari o ur practice reflects a settled refusal to entertain an appeal by a party on an issue as to which he prevailed quoting stern gressman ed.our resources are not well spent superintending each word a lower court utters en route to a final judgment in the petitioning party favor.see california rooney,per curiam t hat the court of appeal reached its decision through analysis different than this court might have used does not make it appropriate for the prevailing party to request us to review it we therefore have adhered with some rigor to the principle that t his court reviews judgments,not statements in opinions.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted.on the few occasions when we have departed from that principle,we have pointed to a policy reaso n of sufficient importance to allow an appeal by the winner below.deposit guaranty,at.
we think just such a reason places qualified immunity cases in a special category when it comes to this court review of appeals brought by winners.the constitutional determinations that prevailing parties ask us to consider in these cases are not mere dicta or statements in opinions.rooney,at internal quotation marks omitted see bunting,at scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari stating that such a determination is not mere dictum in the ordinary sense they are rulings that have a significant future effect on the conduct of public officials both the prevailing parties and their and the policies of the government units to which they belong.see supra,at.and more they are rulings designed to produce this effect,by establishing controlling law and preventing invocations of immunity in later cases.and still more they are rulings designed this way with this court permission,to promote clarity and observance of constitutional rules.we describe in more detail below these of the qualified immunity world and why they came to be.we hold that taken together,they support bending our usual rule to permit consideration of immunized officials petitions.
to begin,then,with the nature of these suits under invoked in this case and bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,a plaintiff may seek money damages from government officials who have violated her constitutional or statutory rights.but to ensure that fear of liability will not unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties,anderson creighton,the officials may claim qualified immunity so long as they have not violated a clearly established right,they are shielded from personal liability,harlow fitzgerald.that means a court can often avoid ruling on the plaintiff claim that a particular right exists.if prior case law has not clearly settled the right,and so given officials fair notice of it,the court can simply dismiss the claim for money damages.the court need never decide whether the plaintiff claim,even though novel or otherwise unsettled,in fact has merit.
and indeed,our usual adjudicatory rules suggest that a court should forbear resolving this issue.after all,a longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.lyng northwest indian cemetery protective,see also ashwander tva,brandeis,concurring.in this category of qualified immunity cases,a court can enter judgment without ever ruling on the perhaps difficult constitutional claim the plaintiff has raised.small wonder,then,that a court might leave that issue for another day.
but we have long recognized that this day may never come that our regular policy of avoidance sometimes does not fit the qualified immunity situation because it threatens to leave standards of official conduct permanently in limbo.county of sacramento lewis.consider a plausible but unsettled constitutional claim asserted against a government official in a suit for money damages.the court does not resolve the claim because the official has immunity.he thus persists in the challenged practice he knows that he can avoid liability in any future damages action,because the law has still not been clearly established.another plaintiff brings suit,and another court both awards immunity and bypasses the claim.and again,and again,and again.so the moment of decision does not arrive courts fail to clarify uncertain questions,fail to address novel claims,fail to give guidance to officials about how to comply with legal requirements.see,wilson layne.qualified immunity thus may frustrate the development of constitutional precedent and the promotion of behavior.pearson callahan.
for this reason,we have permitted lower courts to avoid avoidance that is,to determine whether a right exists before examining whether it was clearly established.see,lewis,at.indeed,for some time we required courts considering qualified immunity claims to first address the constitutional question,so as to promote the law elaboration from case to case.saucier katz.more recently,we have left this matter to the discretion of lower courts,and indeed detailed a range of circumstances in which courts should address only the immunity question.see pearson,at.in general,courts should think hard,and then think hard again,before turning small cases into large ones.but it remains true that following the sequence defining constitutional rights and only then conferring immunity is sometimes beneficial to clarify the legal standards governing public officials,at see,at discussing factors courts should consider in making this determination.
here,the court of appeals followed exactly this process,for exactly the reasons we have said may in select circumstances make it advantageous.at.the court,as noted earlier,explained that it was address ing both prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry to provide guidance to those charged with the difficult task of protecting child welfare within the confines of the fourth amendment.at.to that end,the court adopted constitutional standards to govern all interviews of suspected child abuse victims.see,at.and the court specifically instructed government officials to follow those standards going forward to cease operating on the assumption that warrantless interviews are permitted.see,at.with the law thus clearly established,officials who conduct this kind of interview will not receive immunity in the ninth circuit.and the state of oregon has done just what we would expect in the wake of the court decision it has provided revised legal advice,consonant with the ninth circuit ruling,to child protective services workers wishing to interview children in schools.see tr.of oral arg.the court thus accomplished what it set out to do settle a question of constitutional law and thereby guide the conduct of officials.
given its purpose and effect,such a decision is reviewable in this court at the behest of an immunized official.no mere dictum,a constitutional ruling preparatory to a grant of immunity creates law that governs the official behavior.if our usual rule pertaining to prevailing parties applied,the official would fac e an unenviable choice he must either acquiesce in a ruling he had no opportunity to contest in this court,or defy the views of the lower court,adhere to practices that have been declared illegal,and thus invite new suits and potential punitive damages.pearson,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.and if our usual bar on review applied,it would undermine the very purpose served by the process,which is to clarify constitutional rights without undue delay.bunting,at scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari.this court,needless to say,also plays a role in clarifying rights.just as that purpose may justify an appellate court in reaching beyond an immunity defense to decide a constitutional issue,so too that purpose may support this court in reviewing the correctness of the lower court decision 
we emphasize,however,two limits of today holding.first,it addresses only our own authority to review cases in this procedural posture.the ninth circuit had no to consider whether it could hear an appeal from an immunized official in that court,after all,appealed the judgment in the officials favor.we therefore need not and do not decide if an appellate court,too,can entertain an appeal from a party who has prevailed on immunity grounds second,our holding concerns only what this court may review what we actually will choose to review is a different matter.that choice will be governed by the ordinary principles informing our decision whether to grant certiorari a power we sparingly exercis e.forsyth hammond,see also,at this court grants review only when the circumstances of the case satisfy us that the importance of the question involved,the necessity of avoiding conflict in the lower courts,or some matter affecting the interests of this nation,demands such exercise this court rule.our decision today does no more than exempt one special category of cases from our usual rule against considering prevailing parties petitions.going forward,we will consider these petitions one by one in accord with our usual standards.
although we reject arguments for dismissing this case at the threshold,we find that a separate jurisdictional problem requires that result this case,we conclude,is moot 
as we explained above,supra,at,in a dispute of this kind,both the plaintiff and the defendant ordinarily retain a stake in the outcome.that is true of one defendant here camreta remains employed as a child protective services worker,so he has an interest in challenging the ninth circuit ruling requiring him to obtain a warrant before conducting an interview but can no longer claim the plaintiff usual stake in preserving the court holding because she is no longer in need of any protection from the challenged practice.after we granted certiorari,we discovered that has moved to florida,and ha s no intention of relocating back to oregon.brief for respondent.what is more,is now only months away from her birthday and,presumably,from her high school graduation.see,at.therefore can not be affected by the court of appeals ruling she faces not the slightest possibility of being seized in a school in the ninth circuit jurisdiction as part of a child abuse investigation.when subsequent events ma ke it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,we have no live controversy to review.united states concentrated phosphate export,see,atherton mills johnston,suit contesting the validity of a child labor statute mooted when was no longer within the ages affected by the act defunis odegaard,per curiam suit challenging law school admissions policy mooted when plaintiff neared graduation.time and distance combined have stymied our ability to consider this petition.
camreta makes only one counterargument he avers that has a continuing interest in the ninth circuit constitutional ruling because it may help her establish a municipal liability claim against deschutes county.see tr.of oral arg,at.initial complaint charged that the county has an official policy of unconstitutionally subjecting schoolchildren to police interrogation.see,supra.finding no evidence of such a policy even assuming that an unlawful seizure had occurred in this case,the district court granted summary judgment to the county,app.to pet.for cert.in,and did not appeal that ruling,at.and although recently sought to reinstate her claim against the county,the district court denied that motion,docket entry d.whatever interest might have were her municipal liability claim still pending an issue we need not and do not decide,we do not think dismissed claim against a different defendant involving a separate legal theory can save this case from mootness.see commodity futures trading comm board of trade of chicago,posner,o ne can never be certain that findings made in a decision concluding one lawsuit will not some day control the outcome of another suit.but if that were enough to avoid mootness,no case would ever be moot 
we thus must decide how to dispose of this case.when a civil suit becomes moot pending appeal,we have the authority to direct the entry of such appropriate judgment,decree,or order,or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.our established though not exceptionless practice in this situation is to vacate the judgment below.see munsingwear,at alvarez smith,slip,at.a party who seeks review of the merits of an adverse ruling,but is frustrated by the vagaries of circumstance,we have emphasized,ought not in fairness be forced to acquiesce in that ruling.bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership.the equitable remedy of vacatur ensures that those who have been prevented from obtaining the review to which they are entitled are not treated as if there had been a review.munsingwear,at 
contends that vacatur is inappropriate in the qualified immunity context because that disposition would undermine the court of appeals choice to decide a constitutional questio n to govern future cases.brief for respondent tr.of oral arg.far from counseling against vacatur,argument reveals the necessity of that procedural course.the point of vacatur is to prevent an unreviewable decision from spawning any legal consequences,so that no party is harmed by what we have called a preliminary adjudication.munsingwear,at.as we have just explained,a ruling in a qualified immunity case is a legally consequential decision that is the very reason we think it appropriate for review even at the behest of a prevailing party.see supra,at.when happenstance prevents that review from occurring,the normal rule should apply vacatur then rightly strips the decision below of its binding effect,deakins monaghan,and clears the path for future relitigation,munsingwear,at.
in this case,the happenstance of moving across country and becoming an adult has deprived camreta of his appeal rights.mootness has frustrated his ability to challenge the court of appeals ruling that he must obtain a warrant before interviewing a suspected child abuse victim at school.we therefore vacate the part of the ninth circuit opinion that addressed that issue,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion see,arave hoffman,per curiam selig pediatric specialty care.

i agree with the court conclusion that this case is moot and that vacatur is the appropriate disposition unlike the majority,however,i would go no further.as the exchange between the majority and justice kennedy demonstrates,the question whether camreta,as a prevailing party,can obtain our review of the ninth circuit constitutional ruling is a difficult one.there is no warrant for reaching this question when there is clearly no longer a genuine case or controversy between the parties before us.see sinochem int l malaysia int l shipping,noting that when a court can readily dispose of a case on one threshold ground,it should not reach another one that is difficult to determine indeed,it is improper for us to do so.bancorp mortgage bonner mall partnership,a federal court may not decide the merits of a legal question not posed in an article iii case or controversy

today decision results from what is emerging as a rather troubling consequence from the reasoning of our recent qualified immunity cases.the court is correct to note the problem presented when,on the one hand,its precedents permit or invite courts to rule on the merits of a constitutional claim even when qualified immunity disposes of the matter and,on the other hand,jurisdictional principles prevent us from reviewing those invited rulings.it does seem that clarification is required.in my view,however,the correct solution is not to override jurisdictional rules that are basic to the functioning of the court and to the necessity of avoiding advisory opinions.dictum,though not precedent,may have its utility but it ought not to be treated as a judgment standing on its own.so,while acknowledging the problem the court confronts,my concern with the rule adopted for this case calls for this respectful dissent.
the court acknowledges our settled refusal to entertain an appeal,including a petition for certiorari,by a party on an issue as to which he prevailed.ante,at internal quotation marks omitted.at the outset,however,it is important to state this rule more fully to show its foundational character.a party that has already obtained the judgment it requested may not seek review to challenge the reasoning of a judicial decision.as we have said on many occasions,this court reviews judgments,not statements in opinions.california rooney,per curiam internal quotation marks omitted see also chevron natural resources defense council,and collecting cases.the rule has been noted and followed since the early years of this court.the question before an appellate court is,was the judgment correct,not the ground on which the judgment professes to proceed.mcclung silliman,wheat.
the rule against hearing appeals or accepting petitions for certiorari by prevailing parties is related to the article iii prohibition against issuing advisory opinions.this principle underlies,for example,the settled rule against hearing cases involving a disputed judgment based on grounds of state law.as justice jackson explained for the court o ur power is to correct wrong judgments,not to revise opinions.we are not permitted to render an advisory opinion,and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws,our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.herb pitcairn.this point has been repeated with force and clarity.see,michigan long.the judicial power is one to render judgments,not advisory opinions.plaut spendthrift farm,internal quotation marks omitted.
the rule against hearing appeals by prevailing parties applies in countless situations,many involving government parties.deficient performance may not yield prejudice under strickland washington.a defective warrant may be entitled to reliance under united states leon.an unreasonable search may be cured through the inevitable discovery doctrine of nix williams.in these and myriad other situations,an error is identified,but that conclusion does not affect the ultimate judgment entered.in all these contexts,it is established that the prevailing party may not appeal.this conclusion holds true even though a statement on the merits can have adverse consequences for the prevailing party.the court of appeal use of analysis that may have been adverse to the state interests does not allow the state to claim status as a losing party for purposes of this court review.rooney,supra,at.
the court nonetheless holds that defendants who prevail in the courts of appeals based on qualified immunity may still obtain review in this court.this point is put in perspective by the fact that the court today,in an altogether unprecedented disposition,says that it vacates not a judgment but rather part of the ninth circuit opinion.ante,at.the court conclusion is unsettling in its implications.even on the court reading of our cases,the almost invariable rule is that prevailing parties are not permitted to obtain a writ of certiorari.kalka hawk,cadc concluding that the supreme court has apparently never granted the certiorari petition of a party who prevailed in the appellate court after today,however,it will be common for prevailing parties to seek certiorari based on the court newfound exception.and that will be so even though the admonition against reviewing mere statements in opinions has special force when the statements raise questions,for it is our settled practice to avoid the unnecessary decision of such issues.fcc pacifica foundation.
the court defends its holding with citations to just two of our cases.ante,at.neither provides support for the court result.
the first case is electrical fittings thomas betts.there,a plaintiff alleged the infringement of two patent claims.the district court found the plaintiff first claim valid but not infringed and the second claim invalid.rather than issuing a judgment dismissing the bill without more,the district court instead entered a decree adjudging claim valid and dismissing the bill for failure to prove infringement.at.the district court thus issued a formal judgment regarding the validity of the first claim.the defendant appealed to dispute that claim validity.this court noted,without qualification,that a party may not appeal from a judgment or decree in his favor,for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to support the decree.at.but,this court went on to explain,here the decree itself purports to adjudge the validity of claim,and though the adjudication was immaterial to the disposition of the cause,it stands as an adjudication of one of the issues litigated.ibid.in other words,the district court had entered an unnecessary legal conclusion into the terms of the judgment itself,making it possible,for example,that the decree would have estoppel effect as to an issue whose resolution was unnecessary to the proper judgment of dismissal.electrical fittings therefore concluded that the petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the decree eliminated.ibid.the sole relief provided was an order for the reformation of the decree.ibid.that result accords with,indeed flows from,the settled rule that this court reviews only judgments,not statements in opinions.
the second case is deposit guaranty nat.bank roper.in that case plaintiffs attempted to bring a class action against a bank.after the district court denied class certification,the defendant tendered to the plaintiffs the maximum value that they could recover as individuals.of course,that offer did not amount to all that ha d been requested in the complaint namely,relief for the class.at rehnquist,concurring.it is therefore no surprise that the plaintiffs responded with a counteroffer of judgment in which they attempted to reserve the right to appeal the adverse class certification ruling.at opinion of the court.but that proposal was denied.based on the bank offer,the district court entered judgment in respondents favor,over their objection.at.the district court thus issued a judgment other than the one the plaintiffs had sought.the class plaintiffs appealed,and this court later granted certiorari.the court held that appeal was not barred by the rule we view the denial of class certification as an example of a procedural ruling,collateral to the merits of a litigation,that is appealable after the entry of final judgment.at.as the court explained,the plaintiffs had obtained only a judgment in their individual capacities.yet the plaintiffs had asserted as their personal stake in the appeal their desire to shift to successful class litigants a portion of those fees and expenses that have been incurred in this litigation.at,see also,at.because the purported prevailing parties were injured by their failure to obtain the judgment they had sought,the court held there was jurisdiction to entertain the appeal only to review the asserted procedural error,not for the purpose of passing on the merits.ibid.the court was clear that the district court denial of class certification had a direct effect on the judgment as in electrical fittings,the purported prevailing parties were entitled to have a portion of the district court judgment reviewed.ibid.
neither electrical fittings nor deposit guaranty provides support for the rule adopted today.those decisions instead held that,in the unusual circumstances presented,particular parties who at first appeared to have prevailed below had in fact failed to obtain the judgments they had sought.this court therefore had jurisdiction,including of course jurisdiction under article iii,to provide relief for the harm caused by the adverse judgments entered below.the parties seeking appeal in electrical fittings and deposit guaranty might be compared with plaintiffs who have requested in relief but obtained only.such parties have prevailed in part,but have not receive d all that they ha d sought.deposit guaranty,supra,at.in contrast the court appears to assume that the petitioners in the present case are true prevailing parties.they have obtained from the court of appeals the only formal judgment they requested denial of respondent claim for damages.
the court points to policy concerns as the basis for its willingness to hear appeals by prevailing parties.ante,at.but those concerns are unwarranted.in only one dissenting opinion has it been suggested that certiorari should be granted to reach a merits determination locked inside a favorable qualified immunity ruling.bunting mellen,scalia,dissenting from denial of certiorari.that dissenting opinion was issued in response to the rule that constitutional issues should be decided in every case involving qualified immunity,at.yet that mandated rule of decision has now been disapproved,so the dissent argument is no longer applicable.see pearson callahan.indeed,the court today suggests that it still would not allow review of the merits even in the case that provoked the dissent.unlike petitioner camreta,the petitioner in bunting had left the government employ before filing a petition for certiorari and so lacked standing to obtain review in this court.compare,at,with,at stevens,respecting denial of certiorari,and ante,at,and.
the instant case thus appears to be the first in which the court new exception to the prevailing party rule might have been applied.and even here that exception is neither necessary nor sufficient for the merits to be adjudicated by this court.the fourth amendment question decided below is bound to arise again in future cases.indeed,the reasoning of the decision below implicates a number of decisions in other courts of appeals,collecting cases.yet today decision does not supply the courts of appeals with guidance as to these merits issues.the court instead vacates part of the reasoning of the decision below,thereby leaving other decisions intact and unreviewed.the court thus resolves difficult constitutional issues and provides an unprecedented answer to an important question of judicial policy,all to no end.ante,at.
the court errs in reading electrical fittings and deposit guaranty to permit review and,indeed,the provision of relief disconnected from any judgment.the result is an erroneous and unbounded exception to an essential principle of judicial restraint.parties who have obtained all requested relief may not seek review here.
as today decision illustrates,our recent qualified cases tend to produce decisions that are in tension with conventional principles of adjudication.this court has given the courts of appeals permission to find constitutional violations when ordering dismissal or summary judgment based on qualified immunity.ante,at see pearson,supra.this invitation,as the court is correct to note,was intended to produce binding constitutional holdings on the merits.ante,at.the goal was to make dictum precedent,in order to hasten the gradual process of constitutional interpretation and alter the behavior of government defendants.ibid.the present case brings the difficulties of that objective into perspective.in express reliance on the permission granted in pearson,the court of appeals went out of its way to announce what may be an erroneous interpretation of the constitution and,under our case law,the ninth circuit must give that dictum legal effect as precedent in future cases.
in this way unnecessary merits decisions in qualified immunity cases could come to resemble declaratory judgments or injunctions.indeed the united states as amicus curiae contends that the merits decision below has an effect similar to an injunction or a declaratory judgment against the government as a whole.brief for united states as amicus curiae.today opinion adopts that view,providing as relief the vacatur of part of the ninth circuit opinion namely,the part of the opinion that rules on the constitutional merits.ante,at.for the first time,obiter dictum is treated not just as precedent for future cases but as a judgment in its own right.
the court of appeals in this case did not in fact issue a declaratory judgment or injunction embodying a determination on the merits,and it does not appear that a judgment of that kind could have issued.plaintiffs must establish standing as to each form of relief they request,yet the plaintiff in this case had no separate interest in obtaining a declaratory judgment.see los angeles lyons,citing ashcroft mattis,per curiam golden zwickler,see also medimmune,genentech.there was no likelihood that,the plaintiff daughter,would again be subjected to interrogation while at school,much less that she would be interrogated by camreta,so would seem to have had no greater stake in obtaining a declaratory judgment than the plaintiff in lyons had in obtaining an injunction.see,at noting the actual controversy that must exist for a declaratory judgment to be entered our qualified immunity cases should not permit plaintiffs in constitutional cases to make an around established principles of justiciability.in treating dictum as though it were a declaratory judgment or an injunction,the court appears to approve the issuance of such judgments outside the bounds of article iii jurisdiction.
the court creates an exception to the prevailing party rule in order to solve the difficulties created by our qualified immunity jurisprudence,but the court solution creates new problems.sometimes defendants in qualified immunity cases have no particular interest in disputing the constitutional merits.acknowledging as much,the court notes that petitioner alford no longer works for the government and so has lost his interest in the fourth amendment ruling.ante,at.in concluding that alford lacks article iii standing,the court suggests that it would lack jurisdiction to review and perhaps even to vacate the merits decision of the court of appeals if respondent had sued only alford.arizonans for official english arizona,discussing standing to obtain review in this court as well as this court jurisdiction to vacate judgments issued without jurisdiction.that suggestion is disconcerting.under today decision,it appears that the court ability to review merits determinations in qualified immunity cases is contingent on the defendant who has been sued.a defendant who has left the government employ or otherwise lacks an interest in disputing the merits will be unable to obtain further review.see ante,at,discussing article iii limits on relief in this court ante,at,discussing limitations on this court equitable vacatur authority.
the court today avoids this difficulty by concluding that petitioner camreta has suffered an article iii injury.ante,at ante,at,w e do not decide any questions that would arise if alford were the only defendant but the court can reach that conclusion only because,as part of his job,camreta regularly engages in conduct made unlawful by the reasoning of the court of appeals.ante,at.as discussed below,this conclusion is doubtful.see infra,at.in any event the court standing analysis will be inapplicable in most qualified immunity cases.ante,at asserting that the article iii standard often will be met when an officer is sued for taking an extraordinary action,such as using excessive force during a car chase,there is little possibility that a constitutional decision on the merits will again influence that officer conduct.the officer,like petitioner alford or the petitioner in bunting,would have no interest in litigating the merits in the court of appeals and,under the court rule,would seem unable to obtain review of a merits ruling by petitioning for certiorari.see ante,at ante,at,ante,at,see also lyons,supra,at.this problem will arise with great frequency in qualified immunity cases.once again,the decision today allows plaintiffs to obtain binding constitutional determinations on the merits that lie beyond this court jurisdiction to review.the court thus fails to solve the problem it identifies.
it is most doubtful that article iii permits appeals by any officer to whom the reasoning of a judicial decision might be applied in a later suit.yet that appears to be the implication of the court holding.the favorable of the court of appeals did not in itself cause petitioner camreta to suffer an article iii injury entitling him to appeal.supra,at discussing electrical fittings and deposit guaranty asarco kadish,finding an article iii controversy where petitioner challenged a final judgment altering tangible legal rights on the contrary,camreta has been injured by the decision below to no greater extent than have hundreds of other government officers who might argue that they too have been affected by the unnecessary statements made by the court of appeals.the court notes as a limit on its authority to entertain appeals from prevailing parties certain statutory directives,directives that can be interpreted or shaped to allow expanded powers of review.ante,at.but even if congress were to give explicit permission for certiorari petitions to be filed by any person instead of by any party,the constitutional definition of a case or controversy would still constrain this court jurisdiction.
the court analysis appears to rest on the premise that the reasoning of the decision below in itself causes camreta injury.until today,however,precedential reasoning of general applicability divorced from a particular adverse judgment was not thought to yield standing to appeal.parr united states,opinion for the court by harlan.that is why o nly one injured by the judgment sought to be reviewed can appeal.at see also supra,at,chathas local ibew,posner,adverse dicta are not appealable rulings.they can cause harm,but not the sort of harm that the courts deem to create a genuine controversy within the meaning of article iii of the constitution.judgments are appealable opinions are not citations omitted,department of,cadc williams,m ere precedential effect within an agency is not,alone,enough to create article iii standing,no matter how foreseeable the future litigation citing radiofone,fcc,cadc opinion of scalia,at explaining that standing must arise from the particular activity which the agency adjudication has approved and not from the mere precedential effect of the agency rationale in later adjudications oxford shipping,new hampshire trading,breyer,since the judgment appealed from was in a party favor,and since the statement made was in no sense necessary to that judgment,the statement was dictum.there is no known basis for an appeal from a dictum it is revealing that the court creates an exception to the prevailing party rule while making clear that the courts of appeals are not to follow suit,in any context.see ant
