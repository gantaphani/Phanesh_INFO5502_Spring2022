factual and procedural background 
in june,jeffrey cowan filed a breach of contract complaint against boris krayzman.according to the complaint,cowan,an attorney,had successfully defended krayzman in an earlier lawsuit.the complaint alleged krayzman failed to pay cowan for his services and owed him over in unpaid legal bills.cowan proof of service of summons indicated that on june,the summons and complaint were personally served on krayzman.on july,cowan,representing himself,filed a request for entry of default.the court clerk entered the default on july.
on july,krayzman filed a motion to quash service of summons motion to quash.krayzman submitted a declaration stating that on or about june,he noticed a copy of the summons and complaint had been left at or near the front of his house when he was not home.krayzman claimed he never received any other copy of the documents.on august,cowan opposed the motion to quash,based on the declaration of the process server who had served the summons and complaint.the process server detailed his efforts to personally serve krayzman and attested that on june,he gained access to krayzman housing complex.a man matching krayzman description,at krayzman address,had opened the door to krayzman residence,acknowledged that he was krayzman,but refused to take the summons and complaint.the process server dropped the documents on the floor of the open doorway and told krayzman he had been served.
in september,cowan also filed a motion to strike krayzman motion to quash.cowan informed the court he had not realized when he filed his opposition that the court had already entered a default against krayzman.cowan argued the court should not consider krayzman motion to quash since it was filed after the default was entered.
the motion was set to be heard on october.no transcript of this hearing is included in the record.according to cowan notice of ruling,the court tentative ruling was to deny the motion to quash,on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because a default had already been entered against krayzman,and that krayzman declaration that he had not been served was not credible krayzman requested that the hearing be continued.the court granted the request and allowed krayzman to file a motion to set aside the default,to be heard along with the motion to quash.the court ordered that no further documents were to be submitted on the motion to quash.
on october,krayzman filed a motion to vacate the entry of default motion to vacate.in declarations attached to the motion,krayzman and his son stated they were unaware of the summons and complaint until june.krayzman further declared that he retained counsel on or about july.krayzman stated he did not know or understand that a default could be taken against him if he did not file a responsive pleading prior to july.
krayzman counsel also submitted a declaration indicating krayzman retained him on july,and on july he filed the motion to quash on krayzman behalf.counsel declared that at the time he filed the motion he had not seen a proof of service and reasonably believed that the facts regarding the attempted service,as stated in krayzman declaration,were accurate and true.counsel additionally asserted he had no reason to question or challenge the facts as set forth in the declaration in the motion to quash.had i known,prior to july,of the potential dispute over the service of the summons and complaint,i would have filed a responsive pleading prior to the entry of the default in this matter.based on the declarations,krayzman argued the court should grant relief under the discretionary and mandatory relief provisions of civil code of procedure section,subdivision b section b,and set aside the default.
in his opposition to the motion,cowan asserted krayzman counsel statements were untrue.cowan declared that counsel previously told him krayzman had not retained him until after the deadline to respond to the complaint had passed.cowan further asserted the statement that counsel was retained was an improper legal conclusion unsupported by any related facts,such as whether krayzman signed a retainer agreement on july,or tendered a retainer.cowan also argued krayzman motion was defective because it was served less than court days before the hearing,and the notice of motion and memorandum of points and authorities served on cowan were unsigned.
prior to the commencement of the november,hearing,the court issued a tentative decision denying the motion to vacate.although krayzman counsel had checked in with the courtroom assistant on the morning of the hearing,when the court called the case he was no longer present the court denied the motion to quash and the motion to vacate.later that day,krayzman counsel appeared and told the court he had previously checked in but left to make an appearance in another courtroom,and was thus absent when the case was called.the court vacated its previous orders and instructed krayzman counsel to contact cowan to find a date for the motions to be argued.
the hearing was continued to december.at the beginning of the hearing,the court,apparently referring to the previous tentative,announced the motion to vacate was denied and the court saw no reason to change that decision.krayzman counsel responded that he had withdrawn the motions,and asserted the courtroom calendar clerk told him it was okay for him to withdraw the motions.the court noted that if krayzman had withdrawn the motions he was in default.cowan argued that krayzman could not,as a matter of law,withdraw the motions since the court had issued a tentative ruling denying them.after listening to cowan argument,the following colloquy ensued 
the court in any event,if you withdrawn the motion to vacate,then you are in default.
krayzman counsel i understand.the only reason i appeared today is because the same person that advised me it was okay to withdraw the motion said we have an initial status conference.
the court we have no initial status conference now because we are in default.i take a look at it.i going to take it under submission.krayzman has no assuming that the motion can not be withdrawn,then the court tentative will stand.if the motion is withdrawn,then there a default,and i just give a date for an osc re default.
the court took the matter under submission and told krayzman counsel he could not file a pocket brief on the issue unless the court requested one.the court also noted that krayzman counsel never gave the court or opposing counsel notice that he was withdrawing the motions.he responded that he had reserved a new date for a new motion,and suggested he wished to cure the first motion inadequate notice.
later that day the court issued the following written ruling 
defendant withdrew his motion for relief from default subsequent to entry of the tentative ruling on the los angeles superior court internet site.some days prior to hearing on the motion that ruling tentatively denied his motion to vacate default.defense counsel does not dispute these facts,and,in fact his counsel,in open court,now indicates that he undertook the withdrawal of the motion while fully intending to file yet another motion to vacate default with additional facts.he did not,however,at any time seek leave to file such additional facts respecting the motion then before the court and did not seek to do so ex parte following entry of the court tentative ruling on the internet.
the court finds that withdrawal of the motion in the face of a negative tentative ruling contravenes principles enunciated in groth brothers oldsmobile th,cited with approval in franklin capital wilson th,at fn.and see also california rules of court,rule that permitting such withdrawal would undercut the basic principles of the tentative ruling system.at defense counsel request,he shall have seven days for the express purpose of providing the court in writing of case or statutory authority contrary to the groth decision.this is not an opportunity to provide the court with further points and authorities on the issues presented in the motion,or with declarations or other evidence supporting the motion to vacate default.it is purely intended to provide defendant with an opportunity to defeat or distinguish the groth decision by way of contrary legal material.
in january,krayzman filed a second motion to vacate the entry of default.the second motion argued solely that the court should grant mandatory relief under section b and set aside the default due to attorney fault.krayzman counsel again declared that krayzman retained him on july,but explained he did not have krayzman sign a retainer agreement at that time because he had already signed a retainer agreement in an underlying,related matter which counsel felt was broad enough to cover the cowan action.counsel stated he would bring a copy of the agreement to the hearing on the motion in order to produce it for an in camera inspection if necessary to preserve the privilege.counsel admitted erring in failing to verify the date and manner of service of the summons and complaint.he further asserted krayzman failure to file a timely response to the complaint was the direct result of counsel determination and decision that a response was not due until july,
the next hearing was held on april.the court announced its tentative ruling was to deny krayzman motion.krayzman counsel,appearing telephonically,first attempted to continue the hearing because he was unable to be physically present at court.counsel represented that he had filed a notice of continuance and reserved a date in june for the hearing the court noted that the briefing was completed and counsel was appearing telephonically,thus there was no reason to postpone the hearing.krayzman counsel argued that he had withdrawn the original motion to vacate because he had served it one day late and he wanted the motion to be decided on the merits rather than on a procedural defect.counsel further argued there was no legal authority for the proposition that krayzman could not withdraw his motion after the court had issued a tentative ruling.as argument continued,krayzman counsel admitted that in the second motion to vacate the default,he attempted to address some concerns the court had raised in the tentative ruling denying the first motion.
the court issued a lengthy written ruling in which it indicated it did not believe several of krayzman counsel representations to the court.for example,the court noted that at the december,hearing 
defense counsel did not deny receipt of the tentative ruling on the morning of the november,hearing,but,instead,argued that he had telephonically withdrawn the motion to set aside the default prior to the hearing and that he intended to file another motion for relief from default,with additional facts.however,he had never filed a formal withdrawal of the motion neither the court clerk or the court attendant recalled being advised that the motion had been withdrawn,nor did defense counsel indicate with whom he had spoken,or when.most notably,plaintiff had never been given any notice of withdrawal of the motion,and it is frankly inexplicable that defense counsel would have withdrawn the motion yet permitted opposing counsel to undergo the time and expense of an appearance.moreover,defense counsel had apparently made no mention of the claimed prior telephonic withdrawal of the motion upon receiving the tentative.indeed,assuming that he had withdrawn his motion,and that both plaintiff and the court staff had been telephonically advised of the withdrawal,it is unclear why he would have appeared at all on november.
the court stated it did not find persuasive krayzman assertion that he had withdrawn the motion to vacate prior to counsel receipt of the tentative,and expressly adopted its november tentative ruling as the court final order on the motion to vacate.
the court continued 
it is further clear to the court that defendant second motion to set aside the default specifically attempts to address the very issues identified by the court in its tentative ruling,the credibility of defense counsel statements regarding the date upon which he was retained by the defendant.yet,still,he provides no evidence in support of these claims.he has not provided the retainer agreement,which admittedly involved other litigation but which he contends without any showing,is expansive enough to include the current representation and,apparently on a specific date at that.to the extent the retainer document is claimed to be privileged,neither the court nor opposing counsel has been provided with any evidence regarding counsel ability to redact the retainer agreement in a manner providing plaintiff with an opportunity for review,yet retaining applicable privileged matter.in addition,he does not explain why this new evidence was not available at the time that the original motion was filed.ccp section.the court is thus left with the conclusion that the facts may well have been tailored to address the issues raised in the tentative ruling,contrary to the rationale and notions of fairness as set forth in groth,supra.
on june,the court entered a default judgment against krayzman for.krayzman timely appealed.
discussion 
krazyman appears to contend the trial court erred by never deciding his motion to vacate the entry of default on its merits.this contention has two parts.first,krayzman asserts the court never made a final ruling on the first version of the motion.second,krayzman argues that even if the court ruled on the first version of the motion,it should not have done so because he withdrew that motion,and the court should have recognized the withdrawal and ruled on the second version of the motion.we disagree.
i.the trial court decided the motion to vacate on its merits 
first,it is clear that the trial court denied krayzman motion to vacate on its merits.on november,the court issued a tentative ruling denying the motion.although no copy of that tentative ruling is included in the record,subsequent discussions between the court and the parties indicate the ruling addressed the substance of the motion.in the april,written ruling,the court expressly indicated it was adopting the november tentative ruling as the court final ruling on the issue.the court considered and denied the motion to vacate.krayzman assertions to the contrary are simply inaccurate.
to the extent krayzman challenges the substance of the court ruling denying the motion to vacate,we find no error.t he court shall,whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment,is in proper form,and is accompanied by an attorney sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect,vacate any resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client,and which will result in entry of a default judgment unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect.b leader health industries of america,th.
the court determination of whether the default was caused by the attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect is in part a credibility determination.johnson pratt whitney canada,th,johnson.credibility is an issue for the fact finder we do not reweigh evidence or reassess the credibility of witnesses.citation.when the evidence gives rise to conflicting reasonable inferences,one of which supports the findings of the trial court,the trial court finding is conclusive on appeal citation.ibid.
here,the trial court determined krayzman counsel declaration of fault was not credible.the court april order referenced this previous finding.substantial evidence support
