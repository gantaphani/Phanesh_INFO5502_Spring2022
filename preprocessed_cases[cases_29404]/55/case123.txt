while a husband and wife were litigating their ongoing marriage dissolution case,a limited liability company run by the wife filed a civil action concerning a disputed debt at issue in the dissolution proceedings.the superior court deemed the two cases related and assigned the civil case to the already assigned judge.the question we decide is whether the limited liability company code of civil procedure section challenge in the related civil action requires transfer of both cases to a new judge.
peymaneh rothstein peymaneh and mark rothstein mark instituted proceedings in january to dissolve their marriage,los angeles superior court case number the family law case.in an income and expense declaration filed in connection with her request for an order concerning child and spousal support plus attorney fees,peymaneh included an amended schedule of assets and debts that listed a loan to mark made in the name of precious time,llc precious time among her separate property assets.after certain other preliminary proceedings,peymaneh filed a code of civil procedure section challenge to the judicial officer and the matter was thereafter assigned to judge christine byrd.
over the following months,judge byrd made findings and orders in the family law case,resolving factual disputes involving child custody and visitation,as well as child and spousal support.then,in january,judge byrd entered a judgment upon stipulation of the parties that terminated peymaneh and mark married status.the judgment provided,however,that the court reserves jurisdiction over all other issues of the marriage,including,but not limited to,the nature,value and extent of the community property and separate property,the division of property,spousal support,child support,attorneys fees and costs,and all other matters which the court determines appropriate and within the scope of its jurisdiction.
additional proceedings ensued,and about a month after judge byrd granted a motion to impose sanctions against peymaneh,real party in interest precious time,a virginia limited liability company,filed a civil suit against mark in case number the civil case.the suit alleged causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the causes of action were based on alleged facts that mark asked for a loan from precious time principal and ceo,that precious time and mark thereafter entered an oral agreement for such a loan,and that mark had repaid only half the amount,leaving a balance due of.
mark filed a notice with the superior court that identified the family law case and the civil case as related.the notice of related case explained the two cases were related because the debt alleged to be the basis of the causes of action in the civil case was a matter previously alleged by peymaneh to be in dispute in the family law case the judge presiding in department of the superior court,which processes related case notices in probate and family law matters,determined the cases were related under the governing local court rule.specifically,the presiding judge acknowledged the parties were not identical in both suits but concluded the cases were related a because a public records search revealed peymaneh was the director of precious time,the unnamed ceo referenced in the civil case complaint,a point she did not dispute,and b because the debt alleged in the civil case was also in dispute in the family law case.both cases were therefore ordered related not consolidated and the civil case was transferred to judge byrd,the judge before whom the family law case was then pending.
on may,with both cases now related and assigned to the same judicial officer,counsel for precious time filed a section peremptory challenge to judge byrd in the civil case.in a minute order captioned with both case numbers,judge byrd found the challenge was timely and ordered as follows pursuant to the direction of department,both actions the civil case and the family law case are reassigned for all purposes to the honorable tamara hall 
mark asked judge byrd to reconsider her order granting the section challenge and transferring both cases to another judge.he argued the challenge had not been filed in the family law case and there was therefore no basis to transfer that case to another judge.mark also argued the terms of section barred transfer of the family law case to a new judge because judge byrd had already made determinations on contested factual issues relating to the merits of the case.and mark further contended,in part based on documentary evidence he submitted indicating peymaneh was the sole member of precious time,that the civil case was merely a continuation of the family law case such that the section peremptory challenge was improper.
judge byrd denied mark request for reconsideration.mark then sought a writ of mandate in this court,and we issued an alternative writ directing judge byrd to enter a new order transferring only the civil case pursuant to precious time section challenge while retaining the family law case or to show cause why a peremptory writ to that effect should not issue.judge byrd issued no new order,and we accordingly proceed to decide whether to issue a peremptory writ.
we hold a section challenge filed in a case that is related to not consolidated with an case in which the assigned judge has resolved a disputed factual issue relating to the merits requires transfer of only the case to another judge.we explain why.
