james edward kimsey kimsey has in the past engaged in the unauthorized practice of law as well as other dishonest activities involving the legal system.alluding to his recent exploits,the government characterized kimsey as a charlatan.whether that is so or not,our legal system does not punish people simply because they have been proven unscrupulous in the past and are continuing to engage in dubious activities.that is why the government may not prove that the defendant is a bad person,simply to show that in all likelihood he acted criminally on the occasion at issue.united states martinez,cir.rather,the legal system punishes people for proven violations of specific laws.
in the case before us,kimsey was convicted of criminal contempt of court in violation of.the contemptuous act for which the district judge convicted kimsey,who is not a lawyer,was the ghostwriting of eight pleadings for a pro se litigant in a civil lawsuit.section provides that any person who willfully disobeys a rule of any district court shall be prosecuted for contempt if the contumacious act also constitutes a criminal offense under the laws of any s tate.the district court premised kimsey conviction on its finding that kimsey violated local rules ia and of the district court of nevada,which govern the admission of attorneys seeking to practice law in the district and nevada revised statute,which prohibits persons from practic ing law if they are not members of the nevada state bar or have not gained admission to practice pro hac vice.
kimsey now appeals his conviction on four grounds,contending that he was denied his statutory right to a jury trial he could not be prosecuted for criminal contempt under on the basis that he did not comply with local rules and is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him and he did not violate.we reverse kimsey conviction based on the first two points and so do not reach the latter two.
backgrounda.ghostwriting 
in,frederick rizzolo rizzolo became embroiled in a contentious,lawsuit,in which eighteen lawyers bombarded each other and the district court with over pleadings.plaintiffs kirk and amy henry the henrys initiated the suit after kirk fateful visit to rizzolo crazy horse too gentleman club in las vegas,where kirk was attacked so ferociously that he became a quadriplegic.the henrys sued rizzolo and others for damages,and sought attachment of assets that rizzolo and his wife had allegedly concealed through a collusive divorce and through various cash transactions with third parties,involving millions of dollars.
on january,rizzolo attorneys withdrew from representing him.from then until october,rizzolo proceeded without an attorney.during that period,rizzolo initially filed documents that bore the stamp of a pro se litigant.for example,he submitted handwritten responses to interrogatories,producing such answers as,i do believe i am an heir to any other persons sic will.but not sure.
in july and august,however,while still purportedly proceeding without a lawyer,rizzolo filed eight documents that seemed to reflect somewhat more familiarity with the legal system than had his initial pro se efforts.those documents,styled as filed by frederick rizzolo,pro se,sought,among other things,stays of discovery,dismissal,summary judgment,and disqualification of the henrys attorney.a number of the filings raised legal arguments and cited precedent.
the henrys lawyers received the first of these documents,a motion to dismiss,by fax on july.defending property transfers arising from rizzolo nevada divorce,the motion advanced a series of contentions ranging from the supposed impact of erie railroad tompkins,to the applicability of the domestic relations exception to federal diversity jurisdiction.the motion asserted,for example 
begay kerr mcgee,cir,citing erie railroad tompkins.the erie doctrine brings forth a central issue in this case.should this court decline to dismiss for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction under the heretofore described theories of lack of complete diversity and the domestic relations exception to diversity,then the erie doctrine requires that the federal court grant or withhold relief as if decided by the state courts.
jack degree degree,the henrys attorney,testified that the bottom of the fax they received had a tag line that appeared to identify the sender of the document as kimsey.subsequently,degree received the official version of this motion through the district court cm ecf filing system.this version included an appendix of exhibits,one of which bore what appeared to be a computer file path containing the name james edward kimsey.
surprised by the motion and the more than pages of exhibits,degree contacted rizzolo on july,to request an extension of time for responding.degree found the ensuing conversation rather odd,given his prior dealings with rizzolo in the past,rizzolo had always been very agreeable in phone conversations this time,rizzolo replied that he wanted to think about degree request and would return his phone call.about an hour later,degree did receive a return call,but not from rizzolo.instead,the caller identified himself as james on behalf of rick rizzolo.james refused to agree to any extension unless the plaintiffs agreed to a stay of discovery.although james provided degree with a return phone number at which he could be reached,he would not reveal his last name when asked,either then or in a later phone call degree instigated to decline the stay.degree also asked james whether he was an attorney,a question that apparently hit a raw nerve.at that point james yelled back,i not answering your questions,degree.
immediately after the second phone call with james,degree contacted dave groover,a private investigator.degree asked groover to trace the phone number james had provided,which turned out to be registered to james kimsey.given this information,as well as the faxed motion bearing the name kimsey and the exhibit with the file path containing james kimsey,degree and groover ascertained that kimsey was likely the ghostwriter of the documents filed by rizzolo.
degree proceeded to file with the district court on the henrys behalf a motion to reveal pro se litigant rick rizzolo ghost writer.he attached a declaration from groover indicating that kimsey was the probable author of rizzolo pleadings.degree also attached records showing that kimsey had been convicted for unauthorized practice of law in nevada in the motion requested that rizzolo be required to reveal the identity of the person who had authored the eight documents he had filed during the previous two months.
at the hearing before a magistrate judge on the henrys motion,rizzolo appeared with his new counsel,kenneth frizzell frizzell.just before the hearing began,groover spotted kimsey outside the courthouse.when groover approached kimsey to serve him with a subpoena,kimsey refused to take the document.
at the hearing,frizzell acknowledged that rizzolo had used kimsey services to prepare and file the eight documents.addressing kimsey actions,the magistrate judge entered a written order finding that rizzolo had used the services of james kimsey to prepare and file pleadings with the court.in doing so,the magistrate judge determined,defendant rick rizzolo allowed a to determine the legal sufficiency of the instruments filed with the court and relied on kimsey judgment in applying legal knowledge to the specific issues pending in this action.concluding,based on these findings,that kimsey had engaged in unauthorized practice of law on behalf of rizzolo,the magistrate ordered rizzolo to cease using kimsey services and struck the eight documents kimsey had prepared.
soon thereafter,the matter escalated into a criminal proceeding.the magistrate judge issued an order to kimsey to show cause as to why he should not be held in criminal contempt.reiterating that kimsey appeared to have engaged in the unlawful practice of law,the magistrate judge requested that the government prosecute kimsey pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure a for the alleged contempt.see.a the court must request that the contempt be prosecuted by an attorney for the government.in response to the request,the attorney instigated a prosecution of kimsey for criminal contempt.the scope of the prosecution was defined by the magistrate judge order to show cause,which constituted the sole charging document.the order charged kimsey with helping rizzolo prepare and file the eight pleadings,stating that it appears that kimsey actions as a in preparing and filing legal instruments constitutes the unauthorized practice of law on behalf of defendant rick rizzolo.based on these specific alleged actions,the order charged kimsey with violating 
the local rules of practice of the united states district court for the district of nevada,which require that in order to be eligible to practice before the district court,an attorney must be admitted to practice before the supreme court of nevada or,if the attorney is appearing pro hac vice,that he or she be a member in good standing and eligible to practice before the bar of any jurisdiction in the united states and nevada revised statute nrs,which makes it unlawful for a person to practice law in nevada if the person is not an active member of the state bar of nevada or otherwise authorized to practice law in nevada.
in his acceptance of service of the magistrate judge order,kimsey expressly reserved his right to a trial by jury.nonetheless,kimsey criminal contempt proceedings took the form of a bench trial before the district court.
the testimony at trial established that kimsey was not an attorney,and that he did not hold himself out as an attorney to rizzolo.there was no evidence that rizzolo had paid kimsey for his services.
at the same time,the evidence also indicated that kimsey had provided rizzolo with legal assistance so substantial as to mimic those an attorney would offer.to test whether this was so,the district judge questioned rizzolo about the substance of the pleadings he had filed under his name during july and august.with respect to the motion for summary judgment,for example,the judge asked,what did you understand rule to encompass rizzolo replied,i do know.i read so many of these,your honor.the judge then pressed,w hat your understanding of the standard that would have to be met for a party to be entitled to s ummary j udgment upon a claim or a case rizzolo response confirmed that he must have had little to do with the motion he had purportedly filed 
i would have to read it and go back to look and see what it was summary j udgment would be that we were asking that you know,we would come in here and based on i do know what this particular one is,but that,you know,we asking for you basically for a s ummary j udgment from you to i believe it was to dismiss the case or whatever that one was about.
similarly,when the district judge questioned rizzolo about his motion to dismiss,which relied on the erie and rooker feldman doctrines,rizzolo conceded that he had never read erie,rooker fidelity trust,or district of columbia court of appeals feldman.
after hearing rizzolo testimony,as well as that of other witnesses,the district court noted the difficulty of defining what constitutes the practice of law we know it when we see it or the courts know it when they see it.nevertheless,the court concluded that this clearly is a case that crosses the line between simply providing assistance or offhand recommendations of looking at a particular case,and summarized its findings of the services that kimsey had provided rizzolo as follows 
rizzolo,whether it through suggestions of others or just his own conjured up views on something,raises with kimsey,asks kimsey if t here a case or to research a particular point.kimsey conducts the research.kimsey writes an argument,gives it to rizzolo to analyze,review,edit,whatever factually correct certainly.and ultimately the eight products that are filed in july and august are documents the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt authored by kimsey.
in support of these findings,the court noted that the eight documents are clearly in the form of pleadings citing case authority that had been researched,that had been structured or formatted in a way to present legal arguments seeking specific relief including dismissal of the claims against rizzolo,and that rizzolo responded affirmatively when asked,was what you did with kimsey what you did with your attorneys 
the court had no difficulty holding that kimsey had violated local rules ia and of the district court,as well as nevada revised statute,based on his role in preparing and filing the eight pleadings.in addition,the court relied on the following facts to find that kimsey had willfully violated these provisions,as required for a conviction under kimsey had been convicted of unauthorized practice of law in the past he had failed to sign the eight pleadings he had not identif ied himself he had refused to acknowledge his status and he had declined to receive service after concluding that the factors set forth in the magistrate judge order to show cause have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt by the evidence,the district court convicted kimsey of criminal contempt under.
discussiona.jury trial 
we first consider kimsey argument that the trial court committed reversible error by disregarding his statutory right to a jury trial and instead convicting him after a bench trial.we review de novo the question whether kimsey was entitled to a jury trial under and,see united states male juvenile,cir,and decide that he was.
section provides that any prosecution under that provision must be carried out in accordance with section,in turn,creates a statutory right to a jury trial for those prosecuted under 
whenever a contempt charged shall consist in willful disobedience of any lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command of any district court of the united states by doing or omitting any act or thing in violation thereof,and the act or thing done or omitted also constitutes a criminal offense the accused,upon demand therefor,shall be entitled to trial by a jury,which shall conform as near as may be to the practice in other criminal cases.
emphasis added.although the right to jury trial under is contingent upon a demand therefor,the statute does not specify that a defendant must demand a jury trial in any particular manner or at any particular stage of the proceedings.in his acceptance of service to the magistrate judge order to show cause for why he should not be held in criminal contempt,kimsey explicitly reserved his right to a trial by jury.this reservation constituted a demand for a jury trial in ordinary english,and nothing in requires that we disregard it.
moreover,federal rule of criminal procedure states that i f the defendant is entitled to a jury trial,the trial must be by jury unless the defendant waives a jury trial in writing the government consents and the court approves.because kimsey never waived his statutory right to a jury trial,the district court erred in conducting a bench trial rather than a jury trial.
the government contends that kimsey was not entitled to a jury trial because it was stipulated at kimsey initial appearance that he could not be imprisoned for more than six months.although this proposition is correct as a matter of constitutional law,see taylor hayes,kimsey argues that he had a statutory right to a jury trial.because carries with it a maximum sentence of six months,its reference to would be entirely meaningless if it did not create a right to a jury trial where defendants are sentenced to six months or less of imprisonment.the government contention therefore fails.
deprivation of the right to a jury trial constitutes structural error requiring reversal.sullivan louisiana.accordingly,we hold that the failure to try kimsey by jury mandates reversal of his criminal contempt conviction 
although the conviction can not stand for failure to provide a trial by jury,we proceed to consider a second ground for reversal whether the district court properly held that kimsey could be convicted of criminal contempt under because he violated local rules and.the answer to this question will govern whether there can be any further proceedings on the criminal contempt allegations,and so has consequences beyond reversal of the conviction for procedural error.under these circumstances,it is appropriate for us to address the issue.see,united states shetler,wl,at cir.
kimsey contends that he can not be convicted under for violation of the local rules.we agree.we hold that does not permit convictions for criminal contempt for violations of standing rules of court.because we so conclude,we need not reach the question whether kimsey violated the particular local rules alleged.
section,the federal criminal contempt statute under which kimsey was convicted,provides,in relevant part,that a person is guilty of criminal contempt if he willfully disobey s any lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command of any district court if the act or thing so done be of such character as to constitute also a criminal offense under the laws of any s tate.emphasis added.kimsey maintains,and the government agrees,as do we,that requires that the same act violate both a criminal statute and a district court rule.in finding kimsey punishable for criminal contempt under,the district court determined that kimsey violated local rules ia and and nevada revised statute.
whether rules and apply to 
kimsey contends that he can not be lawfully convicted under because he did not violate either local rule or,the two predicate district court rule s,on which the district court premised his conviction.see.ia.local rules and regulate the admission of attorneys to practice law before the district court for the district of nevada.see.ia.rule regulates the admission of attorneys who are members of the nevada bar rule regulates the admission of attorneys who are not members of the state bar to practice in particular cases,a limited admission sometimes termed pro hac vice.see black law dictionary ed.kimsey argues that rules and apply only to attorneys and therefore do not apply to him,because he is not a lawyer.see.ia a in order to practice before the district an attorney must be admitted to practice under the following provisions.emphasis added id.a an attorney who is not a member of the bar of this court,who has been retained or appointed to appear in a particular case,may do so only with permission of the court.emphasis added.although kimsey might very well prevail on this ground were it pertinent,on our reading of,it is not.kimsey could not be convicted under that provision even if he violated the local rules.
rule within the meaning of 
neither nor ninth circuit precedent defines what constitutes a district court rule for purposes of a contempt conviction.see.both we and the seventh circuit have assumed,without directly addressing the issue,that local court rules do qualify as such predicate rule s.see united states marthaler,cir affirming the defendant conviction for criminal contempt,under,based on his violation of a local court rule united states kozel,cir same.however,unstated assumptions on issues are not precedential holdings binding future decisions.proctor vishay intertechnology,cir quoting sakamoto duty free shoppers,cir.
in contrast,the circuit has addressed the issue albeit without deciding it,suggesting that the term rule does not include general,standing rule s of court.in re brown.in interpreting,the sister provision of the circuit reasoned 
since every other directive which speaks of writ,process,order.decree,or command is one which is specifically addressed to a particular person or group and one which traditionally has been enforceable through the contempt power,it may be that the rule to which refers is the rule in the process sense the rule to show cause,the rule nisi,and the like rather than a general,standing rule of court,which usually draws its sanctions from other sources.
id.emphases added united states rose,cir affirming the trial court holding that a defendant was in criminal contempt,where the defendant refus ed to testify after repeated warnings by the court united states powers,cir affirming a defendant sentence of imprisonment for criminal contempt,where the defendant was told repeatedly that his refusal to testify could result in a judgment of contempt and a jail sentence.
there are several reasons why we conclude that the circuit suggestion is correct.the first derives from the evolution of language over time,a source of error in interpreting statutes of vintage.see,mitchell helms,concurring t he evolution in the meaning of the term neutrality in our jurisprudence is cause to hesitate before equating the neutrality of recent decisions with the neutrality of old.
the original version of was passed as part of the clayton act of and contained substantially the same language as the current version.compare clayton act,ch,stat,a ny person who shall willfully disobey any lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command of any district court shall be proceeded against for his said contempt as hereinafter provided.emphasis added,with u.any person willfully disobeying any lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command of any district court shall be prosecuted for such contempt as provided in section of this title emphasis added.in addition,the initial version of passed as part of the act of march,and included language similar to that found in the current version of both that provision and.compare act of,ch,stat,federal courts shall have power to punish,by fine or imprisonment,at the discretion of the court,contempts of their authority provided,t hat such power to punish contempts shall not be construed to extend to any cases except the disobedience or resistance to any lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command of the said courts.emphasis added,with a court of the united states shall have power to punish by fine or imprisonment,or both,at its discretion,such contempt of its authority,and none other,as d isobedience or resistance to its lawful writ,process,order,rule,decree,or command.emphasis added.
according to definition of the noun rule in the version of black law dictionary the version published just one year before congress passed the act of march,and four years before it passed the clayton act a rule is a n order made by a court,at the instance of one of the parties to a suit,commanding a ministerial officer,or the opposite party,to do some act,or to show cause why some act should not be done.black law dictionary ed.the same edition of black defines the verb rule in definition as to command or require by a rule of court as,to rule the sheriff to return the writ,to rule the defendant to plead.id.this definition itself uses rule as a noun in a manner consistent with black definition of the noun rule.
similarly,according to definition a of the noun rule in the oxford english dictionary oed,a rule is a n order made by a judge or court with reference to a particular case only a ruling.oxford english dictionary ed.oed.while noting that this usage is now rare,the oed goes on to quote from a news report of a fairly recent british judicial decision that turned on the same language evolution we face here.the article explained the use of the term in the nineteenth century r ules were a term denoting decisions or rulings by the judiciary on a case by case basis.id.second alteration in original quoting law report may house of lords costs automatically follow acceptance of money paid in court,times london,may.the oed also provides an example of the usage from a case any violation of the judge rule in regard to the sequestration is punishable as for contempt.id.quoting thomas state,as this last oed example confirms,the term rule,as used in the first decades of the twentieth century which is when and were originally enacted could well have referred to a judge edict in a specific case rather than general,standing court rules.
second,although standing court rules already existed in the early twentieth century and so,based on etymology alone,it would not be inconceivable that use of the term rule referred to them,this possibility is severely undermined by the application of a basic canon of statutory interpretation the canon,noscitur a sociis,reminds us that a word is known by the company it keeps,and is invoked whe
