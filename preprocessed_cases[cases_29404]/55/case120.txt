plaintiff joseph shalant,having previously been declared a vexatious litigant code civ,subd.b was subject to a prefiling order,issued under section,barring him from filing any new litigation,subd.a in propria persona in a california court without leave of the court presiding judge.he filed the present litigation through counsel,but lost his representation while the action was pending.on defendants motions,the trial court dismissed shalant complaint on the ground he had not complied with section.the court of appeal reversed,holding section applies only to actions filed in propria persona by vexatious litigants.
we agree with the court of appeal.by its unambiguous terms,section,subdivision a authorizes only a prefiling order prohibiting a vexatious litigant from filing new litigation without prior permission,and only when the litigant is unrepresented by counsel.subdivision c of the section provides that the court clerk shall not file any such litigation without an order from the presiding judge permitting the filing,and if the court clerk mistakenly files the litigation without such an order,the litigation is to be dismissed.section dismissal provision did not apply here because shalant was not in propria persona when he filed the litigation.
this interpretation,which is compelled by the statutory language,does not leave a defendant without protection against a vexatious litigant continued pursuit of an action initially filed through counsel.in this situation,a defendant in the pending litigation may move for an order requiring the vexatious litigant plaintiff to furnish security.if security is ordered but not furnished,the action is to be dismissed.
factual and procedural background 
in,in an action unrelated to this one,the superior court entered an order declaring shalant,an attorney,to be a vexatious litigant as defined in section.the court further entered a prefiling order under section,prohibiting him from filing any new litigation in propria persona in the courts of california without approval of the presiding judge of the court in which the action is filed.in may,the state bar court recommended that shalant be disbarred and placed him on inactive status.this court ordered shalant disbarred in december.
on december,shalant,through attorney butler,filed the present action against thomas girardi and national union fire insurance company national union.the action arose from shalant and girardi representation of jose castro and his wife in a personal injury suit in which national union insured the defendant.when the personal injury case settled,girardi paid shalant of the proceeds pursuant to a agreement,but shalant alleges he was owed an additional in fees and costs.
in may,attorney james biesty substituted in for butler as shalant attorney.with the exception of one month when shalant represented himself,biesty represented shalant in this action until march,when butler returned as attorney of record.on june,however,butler applied,over shalant objection,for permission to withdraw as counsel,citing an irremediable breakdown in the relationship.the trial court granted butler application on july.
with shalant now acting in propria persona,girardi and national union moved to dismiss his complaint against them under section.the trial court gave shalant until september,to retain counsel or obtain permission from the presiding judge to proceed in propria persona,and set a hearing on the motions to dismiss for september.on that date,the court granted the motions,finding that shalant had failed to rectify his violation under section.the court entered judgment for national union,and shalant represented by counsel appealed.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment and directed the superior court to deny the motions to dismiss.we granted girardi and national union joint petition for review,which raised only the issue of dismissal under section.
discussion 
the vexatious litigant statutes are designed to curb misuse of the court system by those persistent and obsessive litigants who,repeatedly litigating the same issues through groundless actions,waste the time and resources of the court system and other litigants.bravo ismaj th.sections to were enacted in,while section,the section at issue here,was added in.stats,ch,stats,ch.
vexatious litigant is defined in section,subdivision b as a person who has,while acting in propria persona,initiated or prosecuted numerous meritless litigations,relitigated or attempted to relitigate matters previously determined against him or her,repeatedly pursued unmeritorious or frivolous tactics in litigation,or who has previously been declared a vexatious litigant in a related action.section provides that in any litigation pending in a california court,the defendant may move for an order requiring the plaintiff to furnish security on the ground the plaintiff is a vexatious litigant and has no reasonable probability of prevailing against the moving defendant.the action is stayed pending determination of the motion.if,after a hearing,the court finds for the defendant on these points,it must order the plaintiff to furnish security in such amount and within such time as the court shall fix.the plaintiff failure to furnish that security is grounds for dismissal.
in,the legislature enacted section to provide the courts with an additional means to counter misuse of the system by vexatious litigants.section operates beyond the pending case and authorizes a court to enter a prefiling order that prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in propria persona without first obtaining permission from the presiding judge.mccolm westwood park cal.app th.the presiding judge may also condition the filing of the litigation upon furnishing security as provided in section,subd.b.bravo ismaj,supra,th at.
section did not displace the remedy provided in sections to for defendants in pending actions by its terms it operates i n addition to any other relief provided in this title,subd.a.rather,it added a powerful new tool designed to preclude the initiation of meritless lawsuits and their attendant expenditures of time and costs.bravo ismaj,supra,th at.
once a person has been declared a vexatious litigant,the court,on its own or a party motion,may enter a prefiling order which prohibits the person from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed,subd.a.disobedience of the order is punishable as a contempt.ibid.the presiding judge shall permit the filing of that litigation only if it appears that the litigation has merit and has not been filed for the purposes of harassment or delay.the presiding judge may condition the filing of the litigation upon the furnishing of security for the benefit of the defendants as provided in section,subd.b.court clerks are directed not to file litigation from a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order without the presiding judge order permitting the filing.if the clerk mistakenly does file the action,any party may seek dismissal through a notice that the plaintiff is subject to a prefiling order.the litigation shall be automatically dismissed unless the plaintiff within days of the filing of that notice obtains an order from the presiding judge permitting the filing of the litigation as set forth in subdivision b,subd.c.
as the court in mccolm westwood park,supra,th at page,footnote,explained sections differ from section in some significant ways.under the former sections,the litigant may proceed with the case without showing a reasonable probability of prevailing,but the litigant will have to furnish security to proceed if the court finds success improbable.under the latter section,the litigant is barred from filing the action or proceeding if success is considered improbable section extra burden upon the vexatious litigant arises because a state court has taken a second step in addressing the vexatious litigant problem and has determined that no court or adverse party should be burdened by the particular plaintiff meritless litigation.
to summarize,our vexatious litigant statutes provide courts and nonvexatious litigants with two distinct and complementary sets of remedies.in pending litigation,a defendant may have the plaintiff declared a vexatious litigant and,if the plaintiff has no reasonable probability of prevailing,ordered to furnish security.if the plaintiff fails to furnish the security,the action will be dismissed.in addition,a potential defendant may prevent the vexatious litigant plaintiff from filing any new litigation in propria persona by obtaining a prefiling order and,if any new litigation is inadvertently permitted to be filed in propria persona without the presiding judge permission,may then obtain its dismissal.
in the present case,defendants pursued the wrong statutory remedy for the situation in which they found themselves.although shalant is a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order under section,he did not violate that order by filing the present action through counsel,and the action was therefore not subject to dismissal as violative of the order.as the court of appeal below explained the prefiling order entered against shalant on a form approved by the judicial council prohibits shalant from filing any new litigation in propria persona in the courts of california without approval of the presiding judge of the court in which the action is to be filed.shalant filed only one civil action or proceeding in this case,namely,his action against girardi and national union.he did not file it in propria persona but rather filed it through counsel.nothing in the prefiling order prohibits shalant from continuing to prosecute or maintain an action in propria persona as long as he did not file the action in propria persona and nothing in the statutory language would authorize the issuance of a prefiling order containing such a prohibition.shalant therefore did not violate the prefiling order,and the trial court erred by granting the motions to dismiss.
defendants could have proceeded under section for an order requiring shalant to post adequate security before continuing to prosecute his action against them,making it subject to dismissal under section if he failed to do so.on remand,they may still pursue this remedy.they could not,however,properly seek dismissal under section,as it governs only the filing of new litigation,and the present action,filed as it was through counsel,did not violate the section prefiling order against shalant.
in concluding otherwise,defendants and the trial court relied on forrest department of corporations th forrest,which held that the requirements of a prefiling order,under section,remain in effect throughout the life of a lawsuit and permit dismissal at any point when a vexatious litigant proceeds without counsel or without the permission of the presiding judge.id.at.
despite the breadth of its holding,the forrest court may have reached the right result on the facts before it.forrest,a vexatious litigant subject to a prefiling order,was unrepresented by counsel when she filed the action she later retained counsel,who filed and served an amended complaint but withdrew before trial.forrest,supra,th at.thus,forrest violated the prefiling order when,acting in propria persona,she file d new litigation without permission of the superior court presiding judge,subd.a see forrest,at,and her action was arguably subject to dismissal under section,subdivision c despite counsel later filing of an amended complaint the forrest court erred,however,in holding broadly that a prefiling order under section permit s dismissal at any point when a vexatious litigant proceeds without counsel or without the permission of the presiding judge.forrest,at.by its terms,the statute and orders made pursuant to it apply only to the vexatious litigant filing of new litigation 
the forrest court noted that in an order barring a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in propria persona,subd.a,the word new plainly refers to a civil lawsuit filed after entry of the prefiling order.it does not,as forrest contends,refer to an early procedural stage in the lawsuit.forrest,supra,th at.this observation was correct an action that was improperly filed in propria persona by a plaintiff subject to a prefiling order remains,under section,subdivision c,subject to dismissal at any point in its pendency,not only at the early stages.at the same time,however,the statutory term filing plainly refers to filing the lawsuit,not to prosecuting or maintaining it.if the plaintiff was represented by counsel when he or she filed the action,section does not apply at all.
the forrest court deemed it anomalous for section application to be limited to the filing of a new lawsuit,given that a person can be declared a vexatious litigant for having prosecuted or maintained prior unmeritorious litigation in propria persona,or for having filed unmeritorious motions or employed frivolous or delaying tactics in the course of prior litigation,subd.b,see forrest,supra,th at.we detect no anomaly.as previously explained,defendants in a pending action brought by a vexatious litigant have a remedy under sections to.section,added in to supplement those existing statutes,operates beyond the pending case and affects the litigant future filings.mccolm westwood park,supra,th at.a potential defendant who,because of a prefiling order under section,is never sued,is thus also relieved of the burden of defending against a vexatious litigant unwarranted prosecution of an action or use of frivolous or delaying tactics in its prosecution.if,as here,the plaintiff is able to file the action through counsel,sections to continue to provide a remedy against the plaintiff unjustifiable behavior in the pending case 
defendants observe that litigation is defined,for purposes of the vexatious litigant statutes,as any civil action or proceeding,subd.a,italics added and that the term proceeding can,in some contexts,refer not only to a complete remedy but also to a mere procedural step that is part of a larger action or special proceeding.rooney vermont investment cal d,fn.omitted.from this they argue that a vexatious litigant who is barred by a prefiling order from filing any new litigation in propria persona,subd.a,and who becomes while an action is pending,can not take any further procedural steps in the action without first obtaining permission from the presiding judge 
reading the vexatious litigant statutes as a collective whole,defendants construction is not a plausible one.if litigation as defined in section,subdivision a included every motion or other procedural step taken during an action or special proceeding,and that definition were applied throughout the vexatious litigant statutes,several provisions would take on absurd,unworkable,or clearly unintended meanings.under section,subdivision b,a person could be declared a vexatious litigant for losing five motions all of which might have been filed in the same lawsuit in a period.section,subdivision b reference to motions,pleadings,or other papers filed in the course of a litigation would make little sense if every motion,pleading,or paper filed was itself a new litigation.under section,the defendant could move for an order requiring the plaintiff to post security each time the plaintiff filed a motion or took any other procedural step.the trial court would then have to hold a hearing separate from any hearing on the motion itself and determine whether the plaintiff was reasonably likely to prevail on the motion or other procedural step.on a negative finding,the court would then be required to order the plaintiff to furnish security,presumably cumulative to any ordered at earlier stages of the action.if the plaintiff failed to provide the security,the action would,according to section,be dismissed,though the negative ruling on a motion is ordinarily referred to as a denial rather than a dismissal.
under section itself,defendants construction of litigation would be unworkable.a vexatious litigant in shalant position,having filed the action through counsel but then having lost representation,would be required to seek permission of the presiding judge before fili
