this case involves the termination of plaintiff julie pucci from her administrative position in the nineteenth district court,a court within michigan state judicial system.pucci has brought suit against both the court and mark somers,the court chief judge at the time of pucci termination.pucci claims that she was terminated in retaliation for her complaints to state court officials about somers use of religious language from the bench,in violation of her right to free speech.she also alleges her termination violated her right to due process because she had a property interest in continued court employment.the district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion for summary judgment.the defendants now appeal,claiming they are entitled to sovereign immunity and that pucci has no due process claim because she had no constitutionally cognizable interest in her continued employment.somers also appeals on the ground that he is entitled to qualified immunity.
for reasons set forth below,we find that both defendants are entitled to immunity under the eleventh amendment,and we therefore reverse the district court denial of summary judgment as to the nineteenth district court and somers in his official capacity.we also find somers is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to pucci free speech and due process claims,and we therefore affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity to somers in his personal capacity.
the michigan supreme court oversees administration of michigan courts,and the chief justice of the michigan supreme court serves as the head of the state judiciary.comp.laws.the michigan supreme court issues rules,administrative orders,and a code of judicial conduct that affects all michigan judges.the supreme court administrative office oversees the administration of michigan courts,including the michigan unitary district court,of which the nineteenth district court is one division.
the nineteenth district court is a third class district court consisting of three judges and serving dearborn,michigan.comp.laws.the city of dearborn is the court local funding unit and is responsible for maintaining,financing and operating the district court.comp.laws.although the court constitutes its own administrative unit,the michigan supreme court has supervisory authority over the court.see.comp.laws the state is divided into judicial districts of the district court each of which is an administrative unit subject to the superintending control of the supreme court.the chief district judge,who is appointed for terms by the michigan supreme court,has the authority to perform all administrative duties,including hiring and firing court employees.see.b,c.
julie pucci began working at the nineteenth district court as a court typist in.she was promoted to probation officer in,judicial aide in,clerk of the court in,and assistant court administrator in.the last position was reclassified in as deputy court administrator,and pucci held this position until she was terminated in.while deputy court administrator,pucci became romantically involved with judge william hultgren,a district judge on the nineteenth district court.the relationship began in,and the two eventually began living together.the relationship apparently did not factor into the court operations until the appellant,mark somers,was elected district judge.
after somers election in,the nineteenth district court comprised judges hultgren,somers,and richard wygonik.the michigan supreme court declined to appoint any of these three to the position of chief district judge and instead appointed judge leo foran,a judge from a neighboring district court,to that post.foran served as chief district judge from march until january,when the michigan supreme court appointed somers chief district judge 
initially,pucci worked as deputy court administrator without incident and received good employment evaluations.in,however,she lodged a complaint with her supervisor,the court administrator,regarding somers practice of interjecting his personal religious beliefs into judicial proceedings and the business of the court.pucci dist.court,d.she also complained to the regional court administrator and to the state court administrative officer scao,which oversees the administration of michigan courts.pucci was not alone in complaining.sharon langen,the clerk of the court,also testified that she complained to the scao,and another court employee filed a complaint with the state judicial tenure commission.foran stated that,during his brief tenure as chief district judge,he received upwards of fifteen complaints from local attorneys about judge somers interjecting his religious beliefs from the bench or imposing sentences based on religion.id.the record provides several examples 
judge somers used official court stationary on three separate occasions to send official correspondence affixing a quote from a biblical passage according to foran,a muslim boy got a stiffer sentence because of the fact that whatever offense he had,it happened during ramadan o thers complained that judge somers lectured defendants about marijuana,declaring that it was the devil weed or satan surge,and that he would ask litigants in court if they go to church.
id.in response,the regional court administrator instructed somers to stop using court stationary to send religious messages.hultgren claims he told somers that pucci had complained about the religious statements in february.
meanwhile,foran decided to reorganize the nineteenth district court administrative structure.on march,he announced his intent to replace the retiring court administrator with pucci and not fill the resulting absent position.foran explained,pucci was doing the job as court administrator anyway.she was accepted,highly regarded,and respected by any attorney that ever talked to me about her and highly respected and regarded in the community at large.id.somers objected to pucci planned promotion,arguing that her and hultgren relationship created an inherent conflict.id.at.
somers then began to lobby for pucci termination as a court employee.on march,somers wrote foran about pointed conversations between somers and hultgren regarding pucci potential promotion.somers stated that hultgren believed his relationship with pucci should not prevent his own appointment to chief judge or pucci planned promotion.somers alleged,judge hultgren has gone so far as to tell me that this is personal to him,and that he will never support me for the chief judge position if i oppose pucci appointment to court administrator id.somers also suggested that the michigan supreme court policy should apply to pucci court employment and implore d foran to prevail upon hultgren and explain the impossibility of his position in this matter.id.foran declined,responding that he had informed the control unit that pucci would succeed the outgoing court administrator.id.
somers again objected to pucci appointment on april.writing to his fellow nineteenth district court judges,he argued that without the courtesy of consultation or discussion,pucci appointment is presented as a fait accompli t he integrity of this court is at stake.id.at.somers warned he would test the legality of this appointment under the supreme court policy and the cannons sic.id.nine days later,he lodged a challenge with the regional court administrator,asking her to reverse pucci appointment.he then sent a letter to the state court administrator,carl gromek,seeking to rescind the appointment,remove foran as chief judge,and amend the court policy to include domestic partners.
pucci was appointed interim court administrator on may.soon thereafter,however,gromek sent foran a letter,which stated 
i referred this matter to the court,and the justices have concluded that julie pucci romantic partnership with judge hultgren is a violation of the spirit of its antinepotism rule.while the court is of the view that pucci may remain employed with the district court in the capacity that predated her romantic relationship with judge hultgren,she can not be advanced or otherwise be advantaged after the beginning of her romantic relationship with judge hultgren.accordingly,pucci will not succeed doyne jackson as court administrator.id.in light of the letter,foran appointed langen to court administrator and maintained pucci as deputy court administrator.he did not fill the clerk of court position made vacant by langen elevation.this arrangement continued to foran satisfaction and without complaint from the court staff or community until somers became chief district judge on january.
coinciding with his elevation to chief district judge,somers began to evaluate the performance of the administrative staff.he particularly questioned langen ability to fulfill her duties as court administrator.on june,somers began inquiring with the regional court administer,deborah green,about changing the nineteenth district court personnel structure.green followed up via email on july,
y ou might want to inquire as to when julie pucci is eligible for retirement.you asked about possible legal ramifications,and if my memory serves dearborn has an all or nothing retirement system that i thought julie was very close to vesting in.terminating her on the eve of her vesting might be seen as suspect if she sues.if she vests it might also give you and she a graceful way out.
id.at.somers ignored this advice and announced his reorganization plan on october.langen would return to her former position as clerk of the court as soon as a new person could fill the court administrator position the deputy court administrator position would be eliminated,and,effective january,pucci would be terminated.
pucci lost her position without a hearing or other review process following the announcement of her termination in a memorandum.she had assumed and maintains today,however,that she could only be fired for cause.although no longer a labor union member,pucci never signed the employment agreement that some other court employees signed.she claims that the nineteenth district court,which has no employment manual or policies,has in practice followed those of the city of dearborn.pucci also notes dearborn progressive employment policies and two prior incidents in which court employees were terminated and given generous severance packages in exchange for signing waivers of their respective employment rights 
pucci also testified that somers told her that her termination was due to her relationship with hultgren and not due to budgetary concerns somers denies any illegal motive in his termination of pucci.his stated reasons for pucci firing are dissatisfaction with her job performance and the implementation of the same organizational plan that was already in the works under judges foran and hultgren before the michigan supreme court intervened with regard to pucci promotion.pucci,d at internal quotation marks omitted.foran disagreed and testified that he thought somers terminated pucci for personal reasons and because of her unmarried relationship with hultgren.
on february,pucci filed suit against somers,the nineteenth district court,and the city of dearborn.she alleged a violation of her due process rights claims of religious,and sex discrimination under the civil rights act.comp.laws et seq.and a claim of discrimination in violation of the whistleblowers protection act.comp.laws et.pucci subsequently amended her complaint twice adding a first amendment retaliation claim under and a similar claim under the civil rights act.the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts,and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the discrimination claim and to the dismissal of all claims against the city of dearborn.
the district court rejected the defendants argument that the eleventh amendment provides the nineteenth district court and somers in his official capacity with immunity from pucci federal claims.it concluded that because the city of dearborn,as the nineteenth district court local funding unit,is liable for any money judgment against the defendants,the court is not a state entity entitled to state sovereign immunity.pucci,d at.the district court also found that pucci raised sufficient evidence of retaliation and due process violations to survive summary judgment.id.at.the defendants filed a timely interlocutory appeal challenging the district court denials of sovereign and qualified immunity.

states and the federal government possess certain immunities from suit in state and federal courts.ernst rising,f d,cir en banc.this immunity flows from the nature of sovereignty itself as well as the tenth and eleventh amendments to the united states constitution and applies to claims against a state by citizens of the same state,claims against a state by citizens of another state,and actions against state officials sued in their official capacity for money damages.barachkov dist.court,app x,cir quoting ernst,at internal quotation marks omitted.however,this sovereign immunity does not extend to an entity that is not an arm of the state,including municipal and county entities,or if the lawsuit is filed against a state official for purely injunctive relief enjoining the official from violating federal law.ernst,at citations omitted see also lowe hamilton cnty.dep t of job family,cir.
this court has laid out the factors that courts should consider when determining,for purposes,whether an entity is an arm of the state on the one hand or a political subdivision on the other.see ernst,at.those factors are 
the state potential liability for a judgment against the entity the language by which state statutes and state courts refer to the entity and the degree of state control and veto power over the entity actions whether state or local officials appoint the board members of the entity and whether the entity functions fall within the traditional purview of state or local government.
id.citing hess port auth,see also lowe,at.relying on the potential liability factor as the most important factor,the district court found that because dearborn would be financially liable for any judgment against the nineteenth district court,sovereign immunity was inappropriate.pucci,d at.the district court declined to follow two prior opinions from the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan holding that michigan district courts are an arm of the state and entitled to sovereign immunity because those decisions did not give adequate weight to the factor.see id.at discussing englar dist.court,wl,aff in part and rev in part,sub nom.barachkov dist.court,app x cir,and geller washtenaw county,wl e,since the district court issued its opinion,federal district courts in michigan have found that sovereign immunity attaches to two other michigan district and the other circuit.see dolan city of ann arbor,d,finding the fifteenth district court entitled to qualified immunity borghese autman,wl,at,finding without discussion that the family division of the seventeenth circuit court is entitled to sovereign immunity see also turppa cnty.of montmorency,d,wl,at.july,noting that there is some degree of probability that the probate court is immune from suit as an arm of the state citations omitted.
in concluding that potential financial liability is the only determinative the establishing whether a state court is an arm of the state for purposes of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity,the district court strayed from the appropriate analysis of taking the other factors into account.in the case of michigan district courts,the other three factors far outweigh the fact that local funding units such as dearborn may bear the financial repercussions of a lawsuit filed against a district court,its judges,or its employees 
this court,en banc,has clarified that w hile there can be little doubt that the inquiry will generally be the most important factor,it also seems clear that it is not the sole criterion for determining whether an agency is a state entity for sovereign immunity purposes.ernst,at quoting hamilton county,cir en banc emphasis added.our need to inquire beyond the issue of financial liability relates back to the supreme court emphasis that the eleventh amendment incorporates twin reasons for granting states sovereign immunity the desire not to infringe either a state purse or its dignity.see hess port auth.sovereign immunity,therefore,does not exist solely in order to prevent judgments that must be paid out of a state treasury it also serves to avoid the indignity of subjecting a state to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.seminole tribe florida,citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also hess,at recognizing that the eleventh amendment emphasizes the integrity retained by each state in our federal system.therefore,in certain as the one before us last three factors may demonstrate that an entity is an arm of the state entitled to sovereign immunity despite the fact that political subdivisions and not the state are potentially liable for judgments against the entity.
this case would not be the first instance in which we have declared that a district court analysis focusing only on the factor is deficient.in barachkov,we reversed the district court determination that a michigan district court is not entitled to sovereign immunity based solely on the grounds that the state is not liable for judgments against the court and remanded the case to the district court to undertake an analysis of the other three factors.app x at.in fact,the partial dissent in barachkov undertook that analysis and would have found that district court is entitled to sovereign immunity.see id.at batchelder,concurring in part and dissenting in part.following the lead of barachkov partial dissent,an analysis of ernst three other factors with respect to the nineteenth district court compels a finding that michigan district courts,including the nineteenth district court,are arms of the state for purposes.
the michigan constitution unquestionably establishes a unified state judicial system,of which the nineteenth district court is a subdivision,under the control and administration of the michigan supreme court.thus,the second factor identified in ernst the language by which state statutes and state courts refer to the entity and the degree of state control and veto power over the entity actions favors granting sovereign immunity.ernst,at.
michigan constitution vests the state judicial power exclusively in one court of justice which shall be divided into one supreme court,one court of appeals,one trial court of general jurisdiction known as the circuit court,one probate court,and courts of limited jurisdiction that the legislature may establish.const.art.vi,emphasis added,and vests in the supreme court general superintending control over all courts.const.art.vi,emphasis added.additionally,state statutes establish judicial districts of the district court each of which is an administrative unit subject to the superintending control of the supreme court.comp.laws emphasis added see also.comp.laws l granting full authority and control in district judges subject to the supervision of the supreme court emphasis added.thus it is the state legislature that establishes and defines the authority of the district courts,and it is the state supreme court that exercises supervisory and administrative control over those district courts.the local funding units have no such influence.
the michigan supreme court has repeatedly affirmed the unitary nature of the state judicial power and the michigan supreme court exclusive role as supervisor and administrator of all of the subunits of that one court system.the michigan supreme court held despite the complications of the trial court environment,the case law,taken as a whole,has come to strongly affirm that the fundamental and ultimate responsibility for all aspects of court administration,including operations and personnel matters within the trial courts,resides within the inherent authority of the judicial branch of the state of michigan.judicial attorneys ass state,emphasis added.thus,t he judicial branch is constitutionally accountable for the operation of the courts and for those who provide court services.id.at.additionally,the expenses of justice are incurred for the benefit of the state and only charged against the counties in accordance with old usage,as a proper method of distributing the burden.grand traverse cnty.state,quoting stowell jackson cnty.bd.of supervisors,emphasis added.given these circumstances,there can be no doubt that all of michigan courts,including those courts funded by local funding units,are part of one,unified judicial branch of the state consequently,just as the michigan supreme court is an arm of the state,so is its nineteenth district court.
in addition to state control over the administration of the nineteenth district court,there is also considerable state control over judicial officers appointments to the nineteenth district court.consequently,ernst third factor whether state or local officials appoint the board members of the entity also urges granting sovereign immunity.see ernst,at.the city of dearborn oversees the employment of the nineteenth district court staff but the city has no control over the selection and removal of the three judges that occupy its bench or the appointment of employees of the scao,which is the administrative arm of the michigan supreme court.although michigan district judges are elected,i f a vacancy occurs in the office of district judge,the governor shall appoint a successor to fill the vacancy and the person appointed by the governor shall be considered an incumbent for purposes of this act.comp.laws m.
state local control the removal of district judges.the governor of michigan,on a concurrent resolution of of the members elected to and serving in each house of the state legislature,may remove a judge for reasonable cause,which is not sufficient ground for impeachment.const.art.vi,see also.comp.laws additionally,a majority of michigan house of representatives has the power to impeach any judge or justice for corrupt conduct in office or for crimes or misdemeanors,and any such impeached judicial officer shall be removed from office with a concurring resolution by the senate.const.art.xi.the michigan supreme court also may remove judicial officers for a broad range of reasons 
on recommendation of the judicial tenure commission,the supreme court may censure,suspend with or without salary,retire or remove a judge for conviction of a felony,physical or mental disability which prevents the performance of judicial duties,misconduct in office,persistent failure to perform his duties,habitual intemperance or conduct that is clearly prejudicial to the administration of justice.
const.art.vi.
the state of michigan,therefore,through its governor,legislature,and supreme court,exercise considerable control over the even district court judges.the local funding units,conversely,do not.consequently,the third ernst factor heavily favors granting sovereign immunity.
the state authority to establish a single,unified judicial body has long been recognized in our federal system.see erie tompkins,t he constitution of the united states recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the s tates in their judicial departments.consequently,the fourth ernst factor whether the entity functions fall within the traditional purview of state or local government also strongly suggests that sovereign immunity should attach to michigan district courts because their functions fall exclusively within the traditional purview of a state judicial branch.see ernst,at.the nineteenth district court was established pursuant to michigan constitutional provision vesting the judicial power of the state in one court of justice.const.art.vi.such language could not make clearer that this entity operates as part of an authority historically reserved to the state.
our inquiry into the traditional purview of state government stems from the importance of dignity in the origins of our sovereign immunity doctrine if the agency in question carries out a state function,it is a particular affront to a state to subject this agency to suit.we have previously recognized that c onsiderations of dignity are particularly relevant in a suit against a state court,which is the adjudicative voice of the state itself.barachkov,app x at.this respect for a state dignity in eleventh amendment immunity analysis is particularly true in the context of a court system that is mandated by the state constitution to be uniform and to be supervised by one supreme court,at discussing ohio unified court system see also barachkov,app x at quoting same in connection with michigan district court.as noted above,michigan state constitution explicitly vests the judicial power of the state in one court of justice,headed by one supreme court with general superintending control over all courts.const.art.vi.our concern for the dignity of the state,therefore,also counsels in favor of granting sovereign immunity here.
looking at these factors together,the importance of local funding units potential liability is outweighed by the integrated role of michigan district courts within the state judiciary as provided for by michigan constitution and statutes,the degree of supervision and control that the michigan supreme court and legislature exercise over those courts,the role of state actors in appointing and removing district court judicial officers,and the traditional state function the nineteenth district court carries out.the nineteenth district court as with michigan district courts generally is entitled to the immunity protections of the eleventh amendment,and all federal claims against it must be dismissed.as an officer of the nineteenth district court,somers also is entitled to sovereign immunity from all federal claims against him in his official capacity seeking damages and retrospective relief.
although somers is entitled to sovereign immunity in his official capacity with respect to damages and retrospective relief,the doctrine does not bar pucci suit against somers in his individual capacity,see ecclesiastical order of the ism of,chasin,cir,or against him in his official capacity with respect to declaratory and injunctive relief,see thomson harmony,cir.somers argues that he is nonetheless immune from suit because he is entitled to qualified immunity against both pucci due process and retaliation claims.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.pearson callahan,quoting harlow fitzgerald.a defendant enjoys qualified immunity on summary judgment unless the facts alleged and the evidence produced,when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,would permit a reasonable juror to find that the defendant violated a constitutional right and the right was clearly established at the time of the defendant allegedly unconstitutional conduct.aldini johnson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.somers has claimed qualified immunity as to both pucci due process and retaliation claims.we analyze each in turn.
in silberstein city of dayton,our court considered a procedural due process claim similar to the one raised by pucci here.cir.the court opinion and framework lends itself to pucci due process claim,and we therefore follow its approach 
the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis asks whether a constitutional violation has occurred,that is,whether a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions.saucier katz.in the context of pucci due process claim,this inquiry has two subparts first,whether pucci had a property interest that entitled her to due process protection,and,second,what level of process was due.see logan zimmerman brush,silberstein,at.
governmental employees may have a property interest in continued employment,in which case they must be afforded due process before being discharged.see cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill.these property interests are created by a source independent of federal law,such as state law.women med.prof l baird,cir noting the question of whether a constitutionally protected property interest exists is often a question of state law bailey floyd cnty.bd.of,cir the existence of a property interest depends largely on state law.in this case,therefore,we look to michigan state law to determine whether pucci had a property interest.
michigan law generally presumes that employment relationships are arrangements employees,in turn,have no property interest in their continued employment.lytle malady,noting the strong presumption of employment at will under michigan law.parties may overcome this presumption and show employment was under a just cause arrangement in one of three ways 
proof of a contractual provision for a definite term of employment or a provision forbidding discharge absent just cause an express agreement,either written or oral,regarding job security that is clear and unequivocal or a contractual provision,implied at law,where an employer policies and procedures instill a legitimate expectation of job security in the employee.
id.at quotations omitted.should pucci overcome this presumption and prove she was a just cause employee,under michigan law she would possess constitutionally protected property interest in her employment.loudermill,at see also silberstein,at.in contrast,should she be considered an employee,she would have no constitutionally protected property interest.see bishop wood,noting that because the petitioner held his position at the will and pleasure of the city,his discharge did not deprive him of a constitutionally protected property interest.
the parties disagree as to whether pucci has successfully rebutted the presumption,and somers points to evidence that pucci was in fact an employee.some evidence that pucci in fact may have been an employee does not necessarily defeat pucci claim of a constitutional interest at the summary judgment stage,however.if the defendant disputes the plaintiff version of the story,the defendant must nonetheless be willing to concede the most favorable view of the facts to the plaintiff for purposes of the qualified immunity appeal.morrison bd.of trs.of green,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as the saucier court noted,the inquiry at the qualified immunity stage is whether a violation could be made out when the record is t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,not whether the plaintiff has actually satisfied his burden.at.
as the district court found,pucci has offered evidence indicating the michigan court system voluntarily adopted protocols and procedures that instilled in pucci a valid expectation of continued employment under michigan state law.pucci dist.court,d.taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the record suggests that pucci had a property interest in her continued employment,such that termination without any process would have violated the fourteenth amendment.the district court rejection of somers claim that pucci lacked a property interest was therefore proper.
because a reasonable jury could find that pucci had a constitutionally protected interest in her continued employment,the second prong of a procedural due process inquiry determines what process pucci was due.for a public employee with a property interest in continued employment,due process includes a opportunity to respond,coupled with administrative procedures.silberstein,at quoting lou
