this mandamus petition requires us to decide whether,under erie tompkins,a federal court sitting in diversity applies state or federal law to determine the validity of a jury trial waiver contained in a contract governed by california law.california and federal law treat such waivers differently under california law,jury trial waivers are invalid unless expressly authorized by statute.see grafton partners,superior court,cal federal law,on the other hand,permits such waivers as long as each party waived its rights knowingly and voluntarily.see palmer valdez,cir.the compatibility of these provisions,in an action based on california law but tried in federal court by reason of the parties diverse citizenship implicates the erie doctrine.gasperini ctr.for humanities.under the erie doctrine,federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.id.at.
because no federal rule of civil procedure or federal law governs jury trial waivers,we apply the relatively unguided erie analysis to answer the vertical choice of law question presented here.see hanna plumer.doing so,we find that the law governing jury trial waivers is procedural under erie,and so federal courts should apply federal law to determine the validity of a waiver.but we also conclude that the federal knowing and voluntary standard does not necessarily conflict with california grafton rule because the federal standard is a constitutional minimum courts use to protect litigants seventh amendment rights to trial by jury we hold,therefore,that erie federalism principle requires federal courts sitting in diversity to import,as the federal rule,state law governing jury trial waivers where,as here,state law is even more protective than federal law of the jury trial right.applying california law,we hold that the parties contractual jury trial waiver is unenforceable.see grafton,at.and because the only question presented here is whether the district court erred in denying petitioner request for a jury trial,mondor district court,f d,cir,we grant the county petition for writ of mandamus.
the dispute underlying this mandamus petition is a simple breach of contract action.in,plaintiff petitioner the county of orange the county hired defendant real party in interest tata america international corporation and its international affiliate collectively,tata america to develop a property tax management system.in,the parties entered into a contract for professional services to develop and implement the computerized system.the contract became final when the county board of supervisors approved it on july.the contract contains an unambiguous clause by which each party agrees to waive its right to a jury trial in any dispute arising out of the contract.that clause provides 
waiver of jury trial.each party acknowledges that it is aware of and has had the opportunity to seek advice of counsel of its choice with respect to its rights to trial by jury,and each party,for itself and its successors,creditors,and assigns,does hereby expressly and knowingly waive and release all such rights to trial by jury in any action,proceeding or counterclaim brought by any party hereto against the other against its officers,directors,employees,agents,or subsidiary or affiliated entities on or with regard to any matters whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this contract any other claim of injury or damage.
the contract also contains a california choice of law clause.
tata america did not perform its obligations under the contract to the county satisfaction,and,in,the county filed a breach of contract action in the united states district court for the central district of california,invoking that court diversity jurisdiction.see compl,ecf.the county sued under california contract law,asserting claims for promissory fraud,fraudulent misrepresentation,fraudulent concealment,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of contract.in general,the county alleges that tata america failed to live up to the representations and promises it made to the county and also failed to comply with generally accepted industry standards.the complaint and the first amended complaint both include a jury trial demand.
tata america filed a motion to strike the county jury demand.see tata mot.to strike,ecf.it argued that the county waived its right to a jury trial by proposing and signing the contract containing the jury trial waiver.see id.at.in its motion,tata america invoked the district court power under federal rule of civil procedure,which permits a district court to strike a jury demand if it finds that on some or all of the issues raised there is no federal right to a jury trial.a.
in a thoughtful and well reasoned opinion,the district court granted tata america motion to strike.see cnty.of orange tata consultancy serv,case cv jls jc cal.june,ecf in chambers order granting defendant motion to strike.noting that t he parties dispute whether federal or california law applies to the determination of whether the county has waived its right to a jury trial,the court invoked the erie doctrine.see id.at.it relied on simler conner,and byrd blue ridge rural electric cooperative,to conclude that the right to a jury trial including waiver of that right is a federal procedural issue controlled in federal court by federal law.see cnty.of orange,case cv jls jc,at.it invoked herron southern pacific,as a basis for rejecting the county argument that california prohibition on contractual jury trial waivers controls in federal court.applying this authority,the court conclude d that federal law,not california law,governs the question of whether a party has waived its right to a jury trial in federal court.see cnty.of orange,case cv jls jc,at.applying federal law,the district court determined that the county which drafted the jury waiver at issue here knowingly and voluntarily waived its right to a jury trial.id.at.
the county then filed the petition for writ of mandamus currently before us.in its petition,the county argues that the district court erred under erie when it applied federal law to evaluate the validity of the waiver.the all writs act,gives us jurisdiction to resolve this dispute 
before tackling the erie issue,we consider whether to apply the five factors announced in bauman district court,cir,to a mandamus petition like the county that alleges the erroneous deprivation of a jury trial.
the all writs act provides that federal courts may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary or drastic remedy,used only to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.in re sussex,wl,at cir,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the petitioner carries the high burden of establishing that his or her right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.bauman,f d at quotation marks omitted.
to evaluate whether the petitioner has carried this burden,we ordinarily examine the five factors set forth in bauman 
the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires.the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.this guideline is closely related to the first.the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.
id.at citations omitted see also in re sussex,wl,at.
but bauman does not apply in the extraordinary case where the petitioner claims erroneous deprivation of a jury trial.the right to a jury trial has occupied an exceptional place in the history of the law of federal mandamus wilmington trust dist.court,cir see also the late charles alan wright et,fed.prac.proc.juris.ed.for that reason,we will grant mandamus where necessary to protect the constitutional right to trial by jury.if the plaintiffs are entitled to a jury trial,their right to the writ is clear.tushner dist.court,cir kennedy,citations omitted see also mondor,at while mandamus relief is extraordinary and is available only in very limited circumstances,the wrongful denial of a jury trial is an appropriate basis for such relief.
thus where,as here,the mandamus petition alleges the erroneous deprivation of a jury trial,the bauman factors are inapplicable and the only question presented is whether the district court erred in denying petitioner request for a jury trial.mondor,at.furthermore,we may issue the writ even if the petitioner is unable to show a clear and indisputable right to it.wilmington trust,at.
to decide whether the district court erred in denying petitioner request for a jury trial we must first determine under erie and its progeny whether federal district courts sitting in diversity apply federal or state law to evaluate the validity of a jury trial waiver.state and federal law treat such clauses differently california generally prohibits waivers,grafton,at,but federal law permits them as long as the parties waived their rights knowingly and voluntarily,see equip.rental,hendrix,cir.although courts including ours generally recognize that a party right to a jury trial in federal court is a federal issue controlled by federal law,no circuit court has considered the narrower question presented here what law should federal courts sitting in diversity apply to determine the validity of a jury trial waiver clause when state law is more protective than federal law of the right to a jury trial 
to answer this question,we begin with erie.or rather,with the rules of decision act.the rules of decision act provides that t he laws of the several states,except where the constitution or treaties of the united states or acts of congress otherwise require or provide,shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions in the courts of the united states,in cases where they apply.id.the supreme court interpreted the rules of decision act in erie.it held that e xcept in matters governed by the federal constitution or by acts of congress,the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state including state statutory and common law.erie,at.although this holding seems to preclude entirely application of federal common law in diversity cases,subsequent decisions have not read erie so strictly.see,snead metro.prop.cas.ins,cir applying the mcdonnell douglas model which is federal decisional law in the face of a countervailing state rule because the state rule is procedural semtek int l lockheed martin,f ederal common law governs the effect of a dismissal by a federal court sitting in diversity.rather,erie has come to stand for the general principle that federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.gasperini,at.
when confronted with an erie question,we first ask whether a federal rule of civil procedure or a federal law governs.hanna,at.if so,we will apply that rule even in the face of a countervailing state rule as long as it is constitutional and within the scope of the rules enabling act.olympic sports prods.universal athletic sales,cir describing analysis see also shady grove orthopedic,allstate ins,same.
absent an applicable federal rule or law,we apply the relatively unguided erie analysis,hanna,at,which calls on us to determine whether the rules at issue are substantive or procedural,see gasperini,at.a substantive rule is one that creates rights or obligations,or is bound up with rights and obligations in such a way that its application in the federal court is required.byrd,at.a procedural rule,by contrast,defines a form and mode of enforcing the substantive right or obligation.id.at.although helpful,these definitions have their limits t here is no bright line distinguishing substance from procedure,and the meanings of these terms shade into one another by degrees and vary from context to context.larry kramer,choice of law in complex litigation,see also gasperini,at classification of a law as substantive or procedural for erie purposes is sometimes a challenging endeavor.
thus,even more so than the labels,our unguided analysis is informed by erie core policies.olympic sports,at.these policies require us to consider whether application of the federal rule would be outcome determinative,encourage between state and federal courts,or lead to inequitable administration of the laws.hanna,at describing erie twin aims guar.trust of york,describing the outcome determinative test.if so,the state rule is likely substantive and we will apply it in federal court.on the other hand,if the rule implicates an essential characteristic of the federal system,we typically apply the federal rule.see,gasperini,at byrd,at.
although we face an issue of first impression,we do not write on an entirely blank slate.federal courts including ours have applied erie to hold that the right to a jury trial is a federal procedural issue controlled by federal law.for example,in simler,the court considered whether state or federal law governs when a court must determine if an action is legal or equitable for the purpose of deciding whether the claimant has a right to a jury trial.at.the court held that the right to a jury trial in the federal courts is to be determined as a matter of federal law in diversity as well as other actions.id.at.in byrd,the court held that federal courts sitting in diversity must apply federal law to determine whether a particular factual matter should be decided by a judge or a jury.byrd,at.circuit courts,including the ninth circuit,cite these cases for the general proposition that federal courts sitting in diversity apply federal law to determine the scope of the parties rights to a jury trial.see,granite state ins.smart modular,cir in a diversity action,federal law governs whether a party is entitled to a jury trial and if so,on what issues.
several of our sister circuits have applied this general rule to hold that federal courts sitting in diversity look to federal law to determine the enforceability of a jury trial waiver clause such as the one at issue here.see,hergenreder bickford senior living,llc,cir tracinda daimlerchrysler ag,cir merrill lynch.allegheny energy,cir medical air tech.marwan,cir telum,hutton credit,cir leasing serv.crane,cir.the seventh circuit took a different approach in ifc credit united business industrial federal credit union,cir easterbrook.there,the court held that even if federal law governs whether a litigant waived its right to a jury trial in federal court,federal courts should import the state rule of decision to determine the validity of a waiver because there is no general federal law of contracts after erie.id.
but the way california law deals with the validity of waivers makes these cases distinguishable from ours.unlike state law in the first,second,third,fourth,sixth,seventh,and tenth circuits,california law along with georgia law is more protective than federal law of the right to trial by jury.under california and georgia law,parties to a contract can not waive their right to a jury trial before a dispute commences,and any contract provision seeking to effect such a waiver is unenforceable unless expressly authorized by statute.see grafton,at.
recognizing this difference,california and georgia district courts sitting in diversity have split on whether state or federal law governs the validity of a jury trial waiver.compare pallen martial arts,llc shir martial arts,llc,case cv jst,wl,at.may,t he growing consensus in this district is that jury trial waivers are unenforceable in contract actions brought under california law,and ge commercial fin.bus.prop.heard,d,t he court finds that the contractual jury trial waivers in the georgia contracts are null and void under georgia law and consequently not enforceable in this action,with cnty.of orange,case cv jls jc,at order appealed here applying the federal knowing and voluntary standard to evaluate the validity of a jury trial waiver,and gem acquisitionco,llc sorenson grp.holdings,llc,no.c si,wl,at,same see also brian thomley,comment,nothing is sacred
