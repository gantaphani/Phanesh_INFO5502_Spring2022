after the virgin islands supreme court issued a writ of mandamus in a criminal case presided over by former superior court judge leon kendall,he published an opinion chastising the mandamus decision and recusing himself from the case due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct.the justices cited kendall for criminal contempt and eventually found him guilty because his opinion,in their view,obstructed the administration of justice and because his recusal was pretextual in that he sought to avoid complying with the writ of mandamus.
kendall asks us to reverse his convictions.he argues that his judicial opinion is protected by freedom of speech and can not therefore serve as a basis for criminal contempt.as to that novel question,we hold that the first amendment protects a sitting judge from being criminally punished for his opinion unless that opinion presents a clear and present danger of prejudicing ongoing proceedings.kendall opinion did not pose such a threat.we also agree with kendall that there is insufficient evidence that his recusal was pretextual.consequently,we will reverse the virgin islands supreme court judgment and vacate all of kendall contempt convictions.
a.the underlying criminal case 
kendall convictions arose from actions he took while presiding over people ford,a criminal trial of basheem ford and jermaine paris for killing an police officer.see generally crim.july.the prosecutor,assistant attorney general jesse bethel,initially charged ford and paris with manslaughter among other crimes in january but later added charges of assault and first and murder.
bethel subsequently expressed serious doubt to his supervisor about whether he could successfully convict ford and paris of more than voluntary manslaughter.although he later admitted that his prosecutorial duties required him not to pursue charges about which he had serious doubt s,bethel left the murder charges pending and began plea negotiations with counsel for ford and paris.
on january,bethel left a voicemail with the defendants counsel that offered ford and paris a plea bargain to involuntary manslaughter in exchange for dismissal of the remaining charges an offer they accepted ten days later.bethel then reversed course,claiming that he had offered a plea deal to voluntary manslaughter and denying that any plea deal existed for involuntary manslaughter.people ford.july,depublished.ford and paris each moved to enforce the offer.during argument on the motions before kendall,bethel said that even though he might have misspoken or the defendant counsel may have misunderstood the deal,he also insisted that he made it very clear that the deadline to respond to the offer was january,and that the defendants had not done so.but a voicemail of bethel plea offer told a different story.that recording unambiguously revealed that bethel offer was for involuntary manslaughter not voluntary manslaughter,as bethel had later claimed and that bethel had never imposed any deadline for the defendants to accept the offer.
based on this evidence,kendall concluded that bethel misrepresented his plea offer to the court and held that the defendants acceptance of bethel offer had created a binding plea agreement.accordingly,kendall scheduled a hearing for february,at,cancelling jury selection and the jury trial.unhappy with this course of events,bethel repeatedly interrupted and traded jabs with kendall,who admonished him several times.that culminated with bethel informing kendall that he would not be present for the hearing.kendall responded that he did not need to know that and proceeded to schedule the hearing anyway.
on the morning of the hearing,bethel appealed kendall decision to enforce the oral plea offer to the virgin islands supreme court.and consistent with his earlier promise,he did not show up for the hearing at that afternoon.after waiting fifteen minutes without any sign of bethel,kendall adjourned the hearing,held bethel in contempt,and issued a warrant for his arrest.at about,bethel was arrested and remained under the control of the bureau of corrections until the next morning.at the time,bethel told the media and the virgin islands supreme court that he had been incarcerated overnight a statement that was later revealed to be false when bethel admitted that the warden had allowed him to spend the night at home without judicial authorization and without the bail set by kendall.
at a hearing the next day,bethel apologized to kendall for his tardiness and explained that he was in the process of filing papers and looking for a parking space.although kendall concluded that these explanations were false,he accepted an apology from bethel and defer red from any decision to hold him in contempt.kendall never revisited the issue of bethel contempt.at the end of the hearing,kendall returned to the issue of whether the plea offer for involuntary manslaughter was enforceable.kendall asked bethel and defense counsel to submit supplemental briefing on virgin islands scotland,cir,a third circuit case holding that a prosecutor may withdraw a plea offer at any time before the court accepts it unless the defendant detrimentally relies on the offer by,for example,pleading guilty.kendall stated that if scotland is dispositive,the court will proceed to trial if not,the court will enforce the plea agreement.
beginning that same day,the virgin islands daily news published several articles about bethel arrest,detention for contempt,and eventual release.one of the articles recounted bethel earlier misrepresentations at the hearing about the oral plea offer.
on february,bethel moved for reconsideration of kendall decision to enforce the plea agreement to involuntary manslaughter,but kendall denied that motion.he concluded that the revelation of the plea agreement in numerous press reports including the daily news article had tainted the jury pool and therefore made it impossible for ford and paris to receive a fair trial.consequently,he reasoned that ford and paris had detrimentally relied on the plea agreement,and so he had to enforce it.kendall then rescheduled the hearing for march.
b.the writ of mandamus against judge kendall 
following kendall decision to enforce the plea agreement for involuntary manslaughter,bethel filed an amended notice of appeal with the virgin islands supreme court,indicating that there was no factual basis for acceptance of a guilty plea to involuntary manslaughter.bethel simultaneously petitioned the virgin islands supreme court for a writ of mandamus directing kendall not to enforce the plea agreement.
in the petition,bethel made several mischaracterizations and also took swipes at kendall.he claimed that kendall had publicly commented on people ford in a manner adverse to the people position as reported in the virgin islands daily news.he said that kendall participated in plea negotiations directly by mandating what the plea agreement should be in its entirety.and in reference to his absence from the initial hearing,bethel claimed that he had told kendall he would not be appearing on monday,february,for the change of plea,but he did not say and never intended to convey that he would not be appearing at all.kendall declined the virgin islands supreme court invitation to appear in the mandamus action in response to bethel petition.
the virgin islands supreme court denied bethel direct appeal because kendall rulings were not yet final but granted his petition for mandamus.according to the virgin islands supreme court,settled united states supreme court precedent establishes that the government may unilaterally withdraw a plea offer,even if the defendant promises to accept the offer,because a plea agreement,as a unilateral contract,can not become binding on the parties through the defendant mere promise of performance but by the defendant actual performance a change of plea to guilty.and although a limited exception to this rule exists when the defendant detrimentally relies upon a plea offer,see scotland,at,the virgin islands supreme court concluded that ford and paris had not detrimentally relied on the plea offer to involuntary manslaughter at the time it was withdrawn.in the virgin islands supreme court view,kendall had incorrectly and prematurely concluded that the defendants could not get a fair trial.rather,kendall was required at the very least to conduct an immediate voir dire inquiry to determine if the jurors had read the media reports and,if they had,whether they could nevertheless render a fair and true verdict.id.quoting united states new jersey,cir.in addition,kendall had an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the effects of any prejudicial pretrial publicity.app.quoting united states scarfo,cir.consequently,even if kendall could have properly found that pretrial publicity prejudiced ford and paris,he was still obligated to employ less drastic curative measures,such as a continuance or change of venue,prior to ordering the extreme remedy of specific performance of a withdrawn plea offer.
in issuing its writ of mandamus on may,the virgin islands supreme court reversed kendall orders enforcing the oral plea offer,vacated his order scheduling a hearing for march,and remanded the case for proceedings consistent with its opinion.the writ did not provide any additional instructions to kendall.
kendall subsequent opinion and recusal 
after the writ of mandamus issued,ford and paris accepted bethel offer to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter,and kendall scheduled a hearing.at the hearing,bethel proffered what the evidence would show at trial,and kendall conducted a plea colloquy with ford and paris to determine whether they agreed with bethel account.ford and paris,though,stuck to their story that they were acting in.and that story was consistent with bethel own review of the evidence in a memorandum to his superiors,bethel concluded that the victim initiated a deadly confrontation with ford by threatening and chasing him with an ax handle which unfortunately resulted in the death of the victim by gunshots from the defendants.kendall concluded and bethel agreed that there was an insufficient factual basis to support the defendants guilty plea to voluntary manslaughter.as a result,kendall had no choice but to reject the pleas and plea agreement.
rejecting the plea agreement left kendall in what he considered a difficult situation.notwithstanding the insufficient factual basis for voluntary manslaughter and bethel own serious doubt,bethel unequivocally planned to prosecute ford and paris for not only the voluntary manslaughter,but also assault,first and murder,aiding and abetting assault,and unauthorized possession of a firearm.that decision to pursue the charges,as kendall noted,contradicted bethel own factual proffer on how the victim died assault requires intent to murder and murder requires proof of malice aforethought,yet bethel own factual proffer showed that it was the victim who initiated a deadly confrontation with the defendants.in kendall view,bethel continued pursuit of these unsupported charges would be tantamount to perpetrating a fraud upon the court.
but kendall recognized that he had to follow the virgin islands supreme court directions with respect to the disposition of this matter.and having rejected the plea agreement,kendall only alternative was to have this matter set down for trial according to the supreme court.with those determinations made,kendall promised the parties that he would memorialize his reasons for rejecting the plea agreement in a written opinion.
on july,kendall filed a page opinion for publication.as promised,the ford opinion recounted the background of the criminal case,including the events that gave rise to the writ of mandamus,and memorialized his reasons for rejecting the plea agreement to voluntary manslaughter.but the opinion also took two unexpected turns,both of which later became the basis for kendall convictions first,the opinion offered a denunciation criticism of the virgin islands supreme court decision to issue the writ of mandamus.the opinion characterized the virgin islands supreme court reasoning as erroneous,improper,having no rational basis,lacking merit,and making no sense.in re kendall.misc,wl,at.indeed,the opinion went so far as to say that the writ of mandamus was apparently sought and issued to facilitate bethel blatant misconduct and perpetrate a fraud on the superior court.id.at.its issuance,kendall wrote scathingly,was therefore contrary to law and all notions of justice.id.
second,kendall recused himself from presiding over further proceedings in the ford case.because of bethel misrepresentations concerning the oral plea agreement and his continued pursuit of charges that contradicted his own factual proffer,kendall lost the ability to believe any of bethel further representations in the ford case.moreover,bethel decision to press the unsupported,more serious charges enhanced kendall nagging concern that the extensive pretrial publicity would deny the defendants their sixth amendment rights to a fair and impartial jury.in short,kendall said he could no longer be a party to bethel egregious misconduct.
after kendall issued this opinion,people ford was reassigned to james carroll iii.judge carroll held a pretrial conference on july.the people were not prepared to proceed to trial at that time because certain witnesses were unavailable.so judge carroll scheduled jury selection and trial for november.
meanwhile,ford and paris petitioned the third circuit for a writ of certiorari to review the virgin islands supreme court writ of mandamus and its conclusion that bethel plea offer for involuntary manslaughter was not enforceable.when november arrived,the government indicated that it was not prepared to begin trial because it was awaiting a ruling by the third circuit on the defendants certiorari petition.in fact,the third circuit had denied the petition a few days earlier on november.judge carroll nonetheless continued jury selection until april,at the request of paris counsel because two defense witnesses either could not be located or had to be flown to the virgin islands.although ford died before he could go to trial,a jury ultimately acquitted paris.
d.the criminal contempt charges against kendall 
the virgin islands supreme court did not take kendall recalcitrance lying down.they had no mechanism for disciplining kendall in an earlier challenge by kendall,the statute authorizing the virgin islands commission on judicial discipline to investigate and remove superior court judges was struck down by this court as unconstitutional.see kendall russell,cir.nor had the virgin islands supreme court yet issued new disciplinary rules applicable to judges.
believing that they had no other alternatives,the justices ordered kendall to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt.that order charged kendall with three counts of criminal contempt 
count obstructing the administration of justice by issuing the ford opinion critical of the justices writ of mandamus 
count failing to comply with the writ of mandamus by refusing to schedule people ford for trial,refusing to consider a change of venue or continuance to minimize pretrial publicity,and recusing himself to avoid complying with the writ of mandamus and 
count misbehaving in his official transactions as an officer of the court by issuing his ford opinion and disobeying the writ of mandamus.
the virgin islands supreme court appointed a special prosecutor to pursue the charges and a special master to rule on all nondispositive motions,manage discovery,preside over the trial,and recommend findings of fact and conclusions of law.much like the relationship between a magistrate judge and a district judge,see generally,the justices had the ultimate authority to adopt or reject the special master recommendations.
before trial,kendall moved to disqualify all three justices of the supreme court because they were the target of his opinion criticism.the justices denied this motion,and kendall case proceeded to trial.after the people rested,kendall moved for a judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence.he also moved for a mistrial,arguing that the justices violated his right by not personally attending the trial and observing the witnesses live testimony before making findings of fact in the case.the special master recommended denial of this motion,and the supreme court adopted that recommendation.
at the conclusion of the trial,the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the special master.the special master recommended that kendall be acquitted on all charges.after considering supplemental briefs from both sides and reviewing a video recording of a majority of the proceedings before the special master,the virgin islands supreme court rejected the special master ultimate recommendation of acquittal and found kendall guilty on all counts.
in sentencing kendall,the justices ordered him to pay a fine on count but stayed sentencing for the remaining charges because all three charges arose from the same conduct.the supreme court also depublished kendall ford opinion.
e.this appeal 
kendall sought review of his convictions by petitioning this court for a writ of certiorari we granted his petition on the following questions 
whether the first amendment limits the imposition of criminal contempt for statements made in a judge written opinion and if so,the scope of the limitation and its application in this case 
whether the virgin islands supreme court erred in imposing criminal contempt on the charges of failure to comply with its mandamus order of may,in in re people of the virgin islands.civ.
whether the virgin islands supreme court justices erred in not recusing themselves from this matter and 
whether kendall impliedly consented,or waived any challenge,to conducting the show cause hearing before a special master and,if not,the propriety of that procedure.
on count,kendall was convicted of indirect criminal contempt for obstructing the administration of justice by publishing inflammatory remarks about the virgin islands supreme court in his ford opinion.kendall argues that the remarks in his ford opinion are protected by freedom of speech and therefore can not serve as a basis for his conviction we agree.
a.the scope of constitutional protection for judicial speech 
the supreme court has yet to address the scope of a judge freedom of speech as a sitting judge.see republican party of white,d kennedy,concurring this case does not present the question whether a state may restrict the speech of judges because they are judges for example,as part of a code of judicial conduct the law here regulates judges only when and because they are candidates.yet other federal and state courts have repeatedly held that a judge does not check his first amendment rights at the courthouse door,to be reclaimed at the expiration of his judicial tenure.in re judicial misconduct,kozinksi,sitting alone.
we agree.what a judge says in an opinion is sufficiently expressive to trigger first amendment review.the judge inten ds to convey a particularized message by explaining his legal analysis and conclusions,and there is a great likelihood that the opinion message would be understood by its audience no less than if the judge had published the same analysis and commentary in a law review article texas johnson,d quotation marks and citations omitted.indeed,as pure speech on public issues,a judicial opinion occupies the highest rung of the hierarchy of first amendment values and is thus entitled to special protection.snyder phelps,d quotation marks and citations omitted.to be sure,the rationale and holdings in an opinion often carry the force of law,but the mere fact that an opinion has legal effect does not somehow deprive an opinion of its expressive component.doe reed,d see also.comm on ethics carrigan,d it is one thing to say that an inherently expressive act remains so despite its having governmental effect,but it is altogether another thing to say that a governmental act becomes expressive simply because the governmental actor wishes it to be so.we have never said the latter is true.no one contends that kendall opinion was not speech.
having concluded that a judicial opinion qualifies as speech,we must determine the scope of its protection.kendall argues that a judicial opinion is criminally punishable only under the government limited authority as sovereign to regulate speech that poses a clear and present danger to the administration of justice.by contrast,the virgin islands supreme court relied on the government broader authority to discipline attorneys for speech that is substantially likely to prejudice ongoing proceedings and held that this broader authority allows the government to criminally punish judicial speech that poses the same threat we agree with kendall.
as a general matter,the first amendment protects freedom of expression regardless of its content or viewpoint and regardless of whether it is disruptive,offensive,vulgar or insulting.blue mountain sch,cir en banc smith,concurring.yet that rule is not absolute.when acting as sovereign,the government is empowered to impose time,place,and manner restrictions on speech,see ward rock against racism,d,make reasonable,decisions about what speech is allowed on government property that is not fully open to the public,see.educ.television comm forbes,d,decide what viewpoints to espouse in its own speech or speech that might be attributed to it,see johanns livestock mktg.ass n,d,and categorically restrict unprotected speech sometimes,however,the government acts in a capacity that goes beyond merely being sovereign,and it gains additional authority to regulate speech in those capacities.see,garcetti ceballos,d government as public employer morse frederick,d government as k educator gentile state bar of,d government as regulator of attorneys thornburgh abbott,d government as prison administrator fcc pacifica,d government as regulator of broadcast radio and television parker levy,d government as military commander.
in the realm of speech about ongoing judicial proceedings,the government authority as sovereign provides only limited power to criminally punish speech by those outside the judicial system.as the supreme court made clear in a trio of cases involving members of the press held in criminal contempt for their news stories,speech about ongoing judicial proceedings is criminally punishable only if it poses a clear and present danger of obstructing or prejudicing the ongoing proceedings.craig,at pennekamp florida.bridges california.see also standing comm.on discipline of dist.court for cent.dist.of cal.yagman,cir.the government has greater authority to discipline speech about an ongoing judicial proceeding,though,when the speaker is an attorney involved in that proceeding.see gentile,at.because the attorney is likely to be viewed as especially authoritative and his statements are more likely to influence the actual outcome of the trial,the government has an overriding interest in limiting the attorney prejudicial comments to preserve the litigants constitutional rights to an impartial jury.id.at.consequently,the attorney speech is subject to discipline at a lower threshold when it is substantially likely to prejudice the proceedings.id.at.
that brings us to the question in this case does the government broader authority to discipline attorney speech about ongoing proceedings also permit the government to hold a judge in criminal contempt for his speech about ongoing proceedings we answer that question with a resounding no.criminal contempt is no mere disciplinary tool.it derives,like all crimes,from a government power as sovereign.see eash riggins trucking,cir a court broad power to discipline attorneys as officers of the court for misconduct not properly categorized as contempt is substantially different from the contempt power.cammer united states.the power to disbar an attorney proceeds upon very different grounds from those which support a court power to punish for contempt.quoting ex parte robinson,wall.see also bagwell,at describing criminal contempt as a crime in the ordinary sense quoting bloom illinois,d.because the government use of the power is the sine qua non of a sovereign act,the government has no greater authority to hold someone in criminal contempt for their speech about ongoing proceedings than it would to criminally punish any speech.the government additional authority to discipline attorney speech is therefore inapposite.and that means the speech must present a clear and present danger not just a substantial likelihood of obstructing the administration of justice.consequently,the first amendment protects a judge opinion from criminal punishment unless his speech poses a clear and present danger to the administration of justice 
the people,however,argue that kendall opinion should receive no constitutional protection from criminal punishment.see people br.at.the people analogize the virgin islands supreme court authority to punish judges speech to the government broad authority as public employer to discipline an employee for speech made pursuant to his official duties,see garcetti,at,and to the government broad authority as military commander to punish an officer insubordinate speech towards his superiors,see united states howe,wl.
these analogies fall flat.as we have already explained,contempt is not discipline the virgin islands supreme court acted as sovereign,not as public employer,by criminally punishing kendall speech.and the virgin islands supreme court supervisory capacity over judges is hardly similar to the government capacity as military commander.the supreme court has long differentiated restrictions from those in the civilian community based on considerations unique to the military.see,goldman weinberger,d our review of military regulations challenged on first amendment grounds is far more deferential than constitutional review of similar laws or regulations designed for civilian society.the military need not encourage debate or tolerate protest to the extent that such tolerance is required of the civilian state by the first amendment.parker levy,d the armed forces depend on a command structure that at times must commit men to combat,not only hazarding their lives but ultimately involving the security of the nation itself.speech that is protected in the civil population may nonetheless undermine the effectiveness of response to command.if it does,it is constitutionally unprotected.citations omitted.those same considerations have no force in a civilian court system superior courts do not depend on an instinctive obedience to command structure that is critical to executing battlefield orders.nor do court systems have a similar need to restrict the role of dissent unlike the military,the judicial mission depends on courts being deliberative bodies.united states grimley.an army is not a deliberative body.it is the executive arm.its law is that of obedience.no question can be left open as to the right to command in the officer,or the duty of obedience in the soldier.
in summary,the first amendment prevents the government from criminally punishing a sitting judge speech about one of his pending cases unless it poses a clear and present danger to the administration of justice citizens united fec,d if the first amendment has any force,it prohibits congress from fining or jailing citizens,or associations of citizens,for simply engaging in political speech.
whether kendall opinion crossed the constitutional line 
we must vacate kendall conviction because his opinion did not pose a clear and present danger of prejudicing the ongoing ford proceedings.in the usual course of reviewing the sufficiency of evidence,we review the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the available evidence.united states wolfe,cir citing jackson virginia,d.but in cases raising first amendment issues,we have an obligation to make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.gentile,at quoting bose consumers union of,d.consequently,we are compelled to examine for ourselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see whether or not they do carry the requisite threat to the administration of justice.id.quoting pennekamp,at see also united states cutler,cir suffice it to say that in first amendment cases,we must scrutinize carefully the lower court application of the relevant standards to the facts at hand.
as we have explained,obstruction of the administration of justice contemplates interference with the pendency of some sort of judicial proceeding.united states walasek,cir.but obstruction of the administration of justice should not be confused with obstruction of justice.justice may be obstructed by mere inaction,but obstruction of the administration of justice requires something more some act that will interrupt the orderly process of the administration of justice,or thwart the judicial process.united states warlick,cir citing ex parte hudgings.compare in re michael.p erjury alone does not constitute an obstruction of the administration of justice and there must be added to the essential elements of perjury under the general law the further element of obstruction to the court in the performance of its duty.quoting ex parte hudgings,at,with clark united states.concluding that a prospective juror who committed perjury had also obstructed the administration of justice because she had falsely testified to qualify for the jury even though she was biased and would acquit the defendant no matter what the evidence showed.and to transgress the threshold of clear and present danger,the speech must constitute an imminent,not merely a likely,threat to the administration of justice.the danger must not be remote or even probable it must immediately imperil.craig,at.
the virgin islands supreme court relied on two theories in concluding that kendall opinion was a clear and present danger to the fairness of the ford case.neither passes muster.
according to the virgin islands supreme court,kendall opinion was punishable because it called the very integrity of its mandamus decision into question by blatantly accus ing,without proof,the justices of gross dereliction of their sworn duties and of committing illegal acts.yet kendall criticism of the decision to issue mandamus even if it unfairly impugned the justices motives is simply not enough.his critique could not affect the justices ability to fairly decide how to rule on the petition for a writ of mandamus.pennekamp,at holding that criticism of judicial action already taken,even though the cases were still pending on other points or might be revived by rehearings,was not enough to satisfy the standard.and the virgin islands supreme court interests in protecting the reputation of its judges and maintaining its institutional integrity are insufficient to justify the subsequent criminal punishment of speech.landmark commc ns,virginia,d.
nor,as the virgin islands supreme court intimated,did kendall opinion delay or otherwise prejudice the criminal case against ford and paris.according to the virgin islands supreme court,kendall opinion delayed the ford trial by prompting the defendants to petition this court for a writ of certiorari to review the mandamus decision.
the evidence unequivocally contradicts that account.the defendants mere filing of a petition for certiorari in this court did not and could not have stayed their trial.see brewer quarterman,cir en banc dennis,dissenting from the majority exercise of jurisdiction explaining that while the granting of a petition for certiorari stays a case in the lower court,the filing of a petition for certiorari does not do so.although the government moved to continue the ford trial on november,to await a ruling on the defendants petition,this court had already denied the defendants petition several days earlier on november.judge carroll who ultimately presided over the ford trial nevertheless continued the trial at the defendants request because some key defense witnesses either could not be located or were.furthermore,even if there were some evidence that the defendants petition delayed the trial,the virgin islands supreme court did not identify any evidence that kendall opinion caused the defendants to seek review of the mandamus decision by petitioning for certiorari.the record simply contains no support for the conclusion that kendall opinion delayed the ford trial.accord scarfo,at reversing a gag order on an attorney speech about an ongoing case because there was no evidence that his statements to the press jeopardized the fairness of the trial or in any way materially impaired or prejudiced the judicial power of the court.
the people offer an additional argument about how kendall opinion prejudiced the ford case.according to the people,kendall deliberately contaminated the jury pool by publicly argu ing that the people lacked sufficient evidence to convict the ford defendants,directly resulting in paris acquittal.people br.at.this is pure conjecture,and as conjecture it is belied by the fact that judge carroll was ultimately able to select an impartial jury for ford trial.more importantly,the virgin islands supreme court did not rely on this theory in convicting kendall.nor can we.turner louisiana,d holding that the sixth amendment guarantee of a trial by jury requires the jury to base its verdict only on the evidence presented at trial txo prod.alliance res,d kennedy,concurring unlike a legislature,whose judgments may be predicated on educated guesses and need not necessarily be grounded in facts adduced in a hearing,a jury is bound to consider only the evidence presented to it in arriving at a judgment.internal citations omitted.
on the whole,kendall opinion contained strong language,intemperate language,and,we assume,an unfair criticism.but a judge may not hold in contempt one who ventures to publish anything that tends to make him unpopular or belittle him.craig,at quoting craig hecht.holmes,dissenting see also in re little,d overturning lawyers contempt convictions where t heir convictions rest ed on nothing whatever except allegations they made in motions for change of venue and disqualification of the judge because of his alleged bias,and noting that the lawyers had not disobeyed any valid court order,talked loudly,acted boisterously,or attempted to prevent the judge or any other officer of the court from carrying on his court duties internal quotation marks and citations omitted.consequently,kendall controversial remarks in the ford opinion were protected by the first amendment and can not sustain his conviction on count.
on count,kendall was charged and convicted of indirect criminal contempt for failing to comply with the writ of mandamus.this conviction fails,however,because it is not supported by sufficient evidence.
like any crime,a conviction for criminal contempt requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.young united states,d.and like any criminal prosecution,we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo.united states flores,cir citing united states brodie,cir.in doing so,we examine the totality of the evidence,both direct and circumstantial,and interpret the evidence in the light most favorable to the government as the verdict winner.united states starnes,cir quoting united states miller,cir.if all the pieces of evidence,taken together,make a strong enough case to let a jury find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,then we must uphold the jury verdict.brodie,at quoting united states coleman,cir.
criminal contempt generally requires the existence of a valid court order that the defendant knew of and willfully disobeyed.doral produce paul steinberg,cir see also ftc lane labs usa,cir discussing civil contempt.this willfulness requirement distinguishes civil contempt from criminal contempt and requires a specific intent to consciously disregard an order of the court or where the defendant knows or should reasonably be aware that he is disregarding the order.doral produce,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted waste conversion,at.because of this willfulness requirement,compliance is a defense to criminal contempt but not civil contempt if the defendant alleged disobedience is consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the court order and there is no other evidence of willfulness,we would be unable to affirm the conviction.doral produce,at.
the virgin islands supreme court charged kendall with disobeying the writ of mandamus in two ways by refusing to consider a change of venue or a continuance to minimize pretrial publicity by refusing to schedule the ford case for trial and recusing himself instead of proceeding to trial in the absence of a valid plea agreement.these two grounds,however,suffer from a similar defect the writ of mandamus did not require kendall to take any action with respect to these issues.consequently,there is insufficient evidence that kendall disobeyed any unambiguous term of the writ of mandamus.
refusal to consider alternatives to minimize pretrial publicity 
as the virgin islands supreme court acknowledged,the writ of mandamus did not itself direct kendall to consider a postponement or change of venue.the virgin islands supreme court nonetheless determined that the writ precluded kendall from concluding that the ford defendants could not obtain a fair trial without first considering a change of venue or a postponement.id.
kendall did not,however,ignore the writ requirement that he consider ways to minimize pretrial publicity as part of any ruling on pretrial publicity because he never ruled on this issue.rather,kendall left this question open for his successor to decide.to be sure,his opinion describes his continued belief that widespread publicity disclosing the defendants earlier willingness to plead guilty virtually foreclosed the selection of a fair and impartial jury in the territory very small population.but his opinion does so only to explain some of the concerns motivating his recusal not as part of any ruling on whether the pretrial publicity had violated the defendants right to a fair trial.consequently,kendall discussion of pretrial publicity did not violate the writ.
recusal instead of proceeding to trial 
likewise,the virgin islands supreme court conceded that the writ of mandamus did not state that kendall was forbidden from recusing himself and was required to immediately proceed to trial.kendall therefore can not be held in contempt for recusing himself rather than proceeding to trial.
the virgin islands supreme court convicted him on count anyway.it concluded that kendall was guilty because his recusal was a pretext to avoid complying with the writ,even though pretextual recusal would not violate the writ the special master concluded that the evidence was at least equally consistent with the premise that kendall recused himself because he believed bethel had engaged in prosecutorial misconduct and that he could not,and ethically should not,render decisions in the case.op.at.the virgin islands supreme court rejected the special master assessment for one reason the timing of kendall recusal.according to the virgin islands supreme court,all of kendall reasons for recusal arose by march,yet kendall continued to issue rulings in people ford after that date,and waited until after the writ issued months later to recuse himself.id.at.so the virgin islands supreme court concluded that the timing of kendall decision revealed the real reason for his recusal his disagreement with the writ of mandamus.id.
that theory fails on its own terms.its premis
