background 
during world war ii,the united states entered into contracts with several oil companies for the production of aviation fuel avgas.production of avgas resulted in an increased production of hazardous waste which was dumped at a waste site in california referred to as the mccoll site.several decades later,after years of litigation in federal district court in california,the oil companies were held liable under cercla for the costs of cleaning up the waste dumped at the mccoll site.
on february,the oil companies filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking reimbursement of the cercla cleanup costs from the government based on certain language in the avgas contracts.because there was extensive discovery and the parties entered into comprehensive stipulations of fact in the underlying cercla action,the parties agreed that no further factual development was necessary,and the case was litigated on successive summary judgment motions one as to liability and the other relating to damages.the trial court decisions on these summary judgment motions are the subject of this appeal.
first,on february,the court granted the oil companies motion for partial summary judgment on liability,finding that the avgas contracts contained open ended indemnification agreements and that the reimbursement clause of the contracts encompasses costs for the cerlca cleanup as those costs were charges and by reason of production of the avgas.shell oil united states.the oil companies subsequently moved for summary judgment with respect to the amount of recoverable damages.on march,the court granted,in part,plaintiffs motion for summary judgment as to damages and awarded collectively to plaintiffs.shell oil united states.
on april,the government filed a motion for reconsideration asking the court to revisit its decision with respect to the remediation of property damage.the court denied the motion on september.
on october,the trial court entered final judgment awarding the sum of to the oil companies as follows 
on november,the trial judge conducted a telephone conference and informed the parties that,when he was entering final judgment in this case,he reahzed that his wife had inherited shares of stock in chevron corporation,which is the parent corporation for texaco and union oil.he explained that his wife inherited the shares in,prior to the initiation of this lawsuit.transcript,shell oil united states,ecf at.the judge then indicated that he initially did not discover the conflict because he was particularly focused on shell and was looking for conflict between chevron and ownership in shell or texaco rather being a part of shell.id.at.
during the telephone conference,the judge did not identify the specific date on which he became aware of the conflict or whether he had sought a formal advisory opinion on the issue.instead,he indicated that he consulted with the various technical powers that be in the judiciary and looked at some of the material and determined the appropriate resolution was to break texaco out of this case,vacate all the orders as they relate to texaco and have the clerk office reassign texaco to a different judge id.at.the trial judge noted,however,that if the parties had a mutually agreeable alternative he would consider it.both parties asked for more time to analyze the issue.
on december,the government filed a motion for relief from judgment and for recusal pursuant to rule b of the rules of the court of federal claims.in that motion,the government argued that recusal was mandatory and unwaivable under b,and that the presiding judge was required to recuse himself from the entire proceeding,not just with respect to individual parties.the government further argued that the court orders as to shell oil and arco would still have an unfair preclusive effect with respect to the claims by texaco and union oil given the identity of issues between the oil companies.
during the course of briefing on the rule b motion,the government obtained a copy of the judge financial disclosure statement for the calendar year.that disclosure report,which the judge signed and certified on may,disclosed an interest in chevron texaco stock.see exhibit financial disclosure form,shell oil,ecf.
on december,before briefing on the government rule b motion was complete,the government appealed the court october,final judgment to this court.the government has explained that it filed the appeal at that time to avoid expiration of the time to appeal the court judgment.
on february,the judge issued an order indicating that,in light of the government appeal,he no longer had jurisdiction to rule on the government pending motion for relief from judgment and recusal.in the order,the trial judge stated that 
the government could restore jurisdiction by withdrawing its appeal,in which case the court would vacate its earlier decisions with respect to texaco and union oil.the government could then appeal the shell oil and atlantic richfield portions of the decision.the case almost solely focuses on the facts in shell case.it could also then the texaco and union oil cases before another judge.

on august,the judge entered final judgment against the united states in the amount of,allocated as follows 
the government timely appealed the final judgment to this court on september.as a general rule,a judge refusal to recuse under can be reviewed on an appeal from a final judgment.see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,fed.prac.proc,at ed noting that,where a judge refuses to disqualify it is safe to say generally,at least that such an order can be reviewed on appeal from a final judgment in the case.this is particularly true where,as here,the party asking for recusal timely raised the issue to the court below.we have jurisdiction under a.
standard of review 
given our exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments of the court of federal claims,we apply the law of this circuit when reviewing the denial of the government request for recusal.see a the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of the united states court of federal claims.consistent with the vast majority of courts to consider this issue,we review a judge failure to recuse for an abuse of discretion.see phonometerics,westin hotel,under the law of the eleventh circuit,the pertinent law on this recusal issue,a district court refusal to recuse may be raised in an appeal from the final judgment and is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.citations omitted.
discussion 
the government argues that the judgment of the court of federal claims is tainted because the judge wife owns shares in the parent company of two parties to the proceeding texaco and union oil.specifically,the government argues that the trial judge was required to disqualify himself under b from the entire proceeding,and,because he failed to do so,this court should vacate the lower court judgment and remand the matter with instructions that the case be assigned to a different judge.the government further argues that the judge decision to sever texaco and union oil while reissuing the decisions with respect to shell oil and arco could have preclusive or prejudicial effect upon the remaining matters,such that the government would be prejudiced by any order other than one which vacates the judgment at issue in this appeal.appellant br.
in response,the oil companies argue that the trial judge complied with b when he severed texaco and union oil from this lawsuit and had them transferred to a different judge and any error in the judge decision not to disqualify himself would be harmless because this court reviews the trial court grant of summary judgment de novo.
for the reasons discussed below,we find that the trial judge was required to recuse himself under b.given the circumstances,we conclude that vacatur is the appropriate remedy 
usc b mandates recusal 
section governs the disqualification or recusal of federal judges.section a provides that a ny justice,judge,or magistrate judge of the united states shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.while a operates as a catchall recusal provision,b lists a number of specific circumstances where recusal is required.the subsection at issue here,b,provides that a judge shall disqualify himself when he knows that he or his spouse has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding.a financial interest is defined as ownership of a legal or equitable interest,however small.d.it is that the ownership of stock constitutes a financial interest.the statute defines a proceeding to include pretrial,trial,appellate review,or other stages of litigation.d.
section b expressly provides that the judge must know of his or her interest before he is required to recuse.liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d a careful reading of the respective subsections makes clear that congress intended to require knowledge under subsection b and not to require knowledge under subsection a.this language embodies an actual knowledge test regarding disqualifying circumstances and provides a bright line as to disqualification based on a known financial interest in a party,an equity financial interest of any size is disqualifying.chase manhattan bank affiliated fm ins,cir see also union carbide cutting,cir since the statute forbids only the knowing possession of a financial interest,since judge relinquished control of the case as soon as she found out about the financial interest,and since she did not resume control until the financial interest was eliminated,at no time was she in literal violation of the statute.pursuant to c,a judge should inform himself about his personal and fiduciary financial interests,and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.c.
recusal under b can not be waived.indeed,the statute specifically provides that n o justice,judge,or magistrate judge shall accept from the parties to the proceeding a waiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in subsection b.e.although recusal under b is mandatory,there is a statutory exception where the judge discloses and divests himself of the financial interest.specifically,f provides that,if a judge or spouse has a financial interest in a party other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome,and this interest appears or is discovered after substantial judicial time has been devoted to the matter,then disqualification is not required if the judge or spouse divests himself or herself of the interest that provides the grounds for the disqualification.f see also kidder,peabody maxus energy,cir finding that f applied where the judge immediately disclosed and divested his stock and the parties had devoted nearly three years to the litigation.
the legislative history reveals that f was created 
to permit a judge or his or her spouse to resolve the conflict by divesting themselves of the property creating the conflict.disqualification would continue to be automatic if the interest in the controversy was one that could be substantially affected by the outcome.for example,a significant stockholder in a closely held corporation with close acquaintances would be expected to recuse himself or herself rather than divest.
in re certain underwriter defendants,cir citing,reprinted in.where a judge discovers a financial interest and divests in accordance with f,disqualification under b is no longer required.see united states pappert,cir finding that the judge prompt divestment prevented her from having to recuse and that once the judge divested herself of the stock that created the conflict b no longer applied.
here,there is no evidence that the judge wife divested the chevron stock and therefore f is inapplicable because the stock was not divested,recusal is mandatory under b,and can not be waived.given the lack of divestiture,as soon as he discovered the conflict,the trial judge was required to disqualify himself from the entire proceeding and ask the clerk of court to transfer the case to another judge.
although the judge explained that he did not discover the interest until he was entering final judgment,the record reflects knowledge of his wife financial interest in chevron at least as early as may,when he completed his certified financial disclosure report disclo
