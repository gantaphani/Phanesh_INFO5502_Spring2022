appellant united states the government appeals the opinion and order of the court of federal claims awarding attorney fees and costs to appellee dellew corporation dellew pursuant to the equal access to justice act the eaja,a,d a.the central question here is whether comments that the court of federal claims made during a hearing and prior to the government taking corrective action materially altered the relationship between the parties such that dellew qualified as a prevailing party under the eaja.the court of federal claims found its comments sufficient to confer prevailing party status on dellew.see dellew united states dellew ii,fed.cl.we reverse because a strong comment by a trial court is not tantamount to a ruling on the merits or a court order.
background 
the parties do not dispute the facts material to the instant appeal.the department of the army the army awarded a contract to tech systems,tsi for logistics support services at the schofield barracks in.id.at citation omitted.dellew filed a bid protest against the government in the court of federal claims,alleging that the army improperly awarded tsi a contract because tsi did not accept a material term of the request for proposals when it refused to cap its proposed general and administrative rate,and the contract awarded varied materially from tsi proposal.dellew also argued that the army failed to perform an adequate cost realism analysis before awarding the contract to tsi.
after the government filed the administrative record and the parties briefed the merits,the court of federal claims held oral argument.dellew ii,fed.cl.at.during oral argument,the court of federal claims provided hint s about its views favorable to dellew on the merits,see discussing cost realism,discussing the general and administrative rate,discussing change in material terms,and stated that it had drafted an opinion.the court of federal claims also repeatedly expressed its belief that corrective action would be appropriate i also would strongly suggest to the army that they think about taking corrective action,a corrective action should be taken in this case,similar,similar,similar.indeed,the court of federal claims encouraged the army to tak e corrective action now so that it could avoid issuing a needless ruling.the court of federal claims set a schedule for the parties to provide a joint status report approximately ten days after the hearing,and explicitly agreed not to issue a decision until it received the report.the court of federal claims also left open the possibility of additional briefing.
in the joint status report,the government that the army had determined that certain changes in conditions had occurred,resulting in a in the contract value and requiring an amendment to the solicitation.as a result of these changed conditions,as well as the discussions held at oral argument,the army determined to take corrective action.the army subsequently terminated the contract with tsi,and the government filed a motion to dismiss dellew protest as moot in light of the corrective action.
the court of federal claims granted the motion and dismissed dellew action.dellew united states dellew i,fed.cl.in dismissing the action,the court of federal claims declined dellew invitation to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law that dellew is a prevailing party because doing so would require the court of federal claims to issue an advisory opinion.id.at.notwithstanding mootness,the court of federal claims determined that it retained jurisdiction over the action.id.at.
dellew subsequently sought attorney fees and costs from the government under the eaja,and the court of federal claims awarded dellew a total of in fees and costs.see dellew ii,fed.cl.at.relevant here,the court of federal claims held that it made numerous substantive comments during oral argument regarding the merits,id.at,that carried a sufficient judicial imprimatur to materially alter the relationship between dellew and the government such that dellew qualifies as a prevailing party under the eaja,id.at.after surveying the relevant authorities,id.at,the court of federal claims articulated four grounds for its decision,id.at.first,it explained that,at oral argument,it clearly stated its view that the government would lose on the merits and that it intended to rule in dellew favor with respect to th e issue s.id.at.second,it stated that it made clear its view that the army should take corrective action.id.at.third,it determined that the army corrective action was not voluntary.id.at.finally,it explained that its comments were made after the parties briefed the case and after it had drafted though not issued a written decision.id.taken together,the court of federal claims held that the government knew how it intended to rule and,thus,found it appropriate to confer prevailing party status on dellew.id.at.

discussion 
standard of review 
we generally review the award of attorney fees and costs under the eaja for an abuse of discretion.see int l custom,united states,fed.cir.however,t he question of whether a party qualifies as a prevailing party under the eaja is a question of law that we review de novo.rice,united states,fed.cir.citation omitted.
ii.the court of federal claims improperly awarded attorney fees and costs to dellew under the eaja 
legal framework 
in the united states,parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney fees the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser.buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human.described as the american rule,that practice proscribes an award of attorney fees unless otherwise provided by statute.id.absent a waiver of sovereign immunity,a party may not recover attorney fees in suits against the government.see chiu united states,fed.cir.
the eaja waives the sovereign immunity of the united states to enable certain parties to seek attorney fees and costs against the government under certain circumstances.see fidelity constr.united states,fed.cir.the eaja provides that 
a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other incurred by that party in any civil action brought by or against the united states unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
d a emphasis added.the appeal hinges on whether dellew meets the definition of prevailing party under the eaja.
neither a statute nor a regulation defines prevailing party for eaja purposes.however,the supreme court has held that prevailing party,as used in other statutes,means a party that obtains a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the supreme court also explained that the change in the parties legal relationship must have a certain judicial imprimatur,id.at,such as an enforceable judgment on the merits or a consent decree,id.at citation omitted.it further held that a prevailing party does not include a party who obtained relief through a defendant voluntary change in conduct.id.at.we extended these principles to the eaja,see brickwood contractors,united states,fed.cir,and later explained that the buckhannon threshold can also be met by other court action equivalent to a judgment on the merits or a consent decree,as long as it carries sufficient judicial imprimatur to materially change the legal relationship of the parties,rice,at.
dellew is not a prevailing party under the eaja 
the government contends that the court of federal claims committed three errors in determining that dellew qualifies as a prevailing party under the eaja.see appellant br.we agree with each of the government arguments and address them in turn.
the government voluntarily took corrective action 
the first argument concerns the nature of the government corrective action.the court of federal claims held that the army did not voluntarily decide to take corrective action because i t only did so following the g overnment realization that the court was not swayed by its
