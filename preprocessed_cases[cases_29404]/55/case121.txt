the california constitution provides that parties litigating a cause may stipulate that the matter may be heard and decided by a temporary judge.cal,art.vi.our supreme court has interpreted this to mean that a stipulation is required to qualify a commissioner to act and that without such a stipulation,any ruling by or judgment of the commissioner is void.see in re horton cal d,horton.to be valid,the stipulation need not be in writing or be the result of an express oral statement id.at,but it may be implied as a result of the conduct of a party counsel under the tantamount stipulation doctrine ibid.however,in order for there to be an implied stipulation,there must be evidence in the record to show a party counsel were aware that the judicial officer sitting on the bench was a commissioner rather than a judge id.at and nonetheless participated in the cause.
the instant case is a prime example of the harsh consequences that result when a commissioner neglects,at the outset of the cause,to obtain the parties consent for the commissioner to hear and decide the cause before making any substantive rulings.this case is even more troubling because the superior court had available a form,titled stipulation for court commissioner to act as temporary judge for all purposes form,that,if signed by the parties their attorneys,gave the commissioner the power to hear and decide the cause.thus,the tantamount stipulation doctrine should never have been an issue in this case.
appellant marc djulus marc,appearing in propria persona as is respondent kelli mcclintock kelli,appeals the judgment of dissolution entered in december.among other contentions,marc asserts the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to hear and decide the cause because the record contains insufficient evidence to support the commissioner finding in june that marc consented to the commissioner hearing the cause as a result of his participation as a pro se litigant in the initial hearing of the parties in march when the commissioner made several rulings ostensibly not in marc favor.
the commissioner made this finding at the outset of the june hearing after realizing the parties had not yet been provided with and signed the form.although kelli and her counsel then signed the form,marc refused.rather than taking the simple step of stopping the proceedings and sending the cause back for reassignment,the commissioner instead ruled the tantamount stipulation doctrine applied,despite the absence of any evidence that marc knew,or should have known,at the outset of the march hearing that the judicial officer was a commissioner,and despite the evidence in the record,summarized ante,that this judicial officer was initially referred to as the court and as a judge but,unfortunately,not as a commissioner.
because on this record there is insufficient evidence to support the application of the tantamount stipulation doctrine,we agree with marc contention.as such,we are constrained to reverse not only the judgment of dissolution,but all orders made by the commissioner leading up to the judgment including any restraining order s.see horton,supra,cal d at.
factual and procedural background 
marc and kelli were married in october.they had one child together,born in november minor,and they separated in january.in january,kelli filed a petition seeking an order regarding child and spousal support,custody and visitation,and attorney fees petition.the record shows the hearing on the petition took place on march.although counsel represented kelli at the march hearing,marc appeared in propria persona.significant to the issue on appeal,there is no evidence in the record showing marc was informed before,or at any time during,the march hearing that commissioner darlene white,who was presiding over the hearing,was a commissioner and not a judge.
rather,the record shows at the march hearing,commissioner white stated that she had read the parties papers,including marc response to the petition that she had considered the income and expense statements filed by both parties and that she had read the mediator report.after the lengthy argument by kelli counsel,commissioner white asked marc to respond to each of the subject matters raised in the petition.marc instead asked to give an opening statement.
commissioner white reminded marc of the purpose of the hearing,noting as follows 
so i just go through the issues and make my rulings.eventually you may get to a trial.but for today,it really just a moving calendar where i go through the issues,understanding and i think both parties understand everything i do today is temporary because this is a pending dissolution.so the orders i make on support and custody and all that may or may not change as time goes on depending on either because you agree to do something different in a marital settlement agreement or if the matter goes to trial.so what i do today is temporary.so i not necessarily precluding you from making an opening statement,as much as i hear what you have to tell me,but i just need to go through the issues one at a time.
over marc objection,at the conclusion of the hearing commissioner white made a series of rulings involving physical custody of minor,visitation,child and spousal support,and an award of attorney fees in favor of kelli.the record includes two minute orders from the march hearing.in both minute orders,the box entitled judge says darlene white.at the bottom of both minute orders,it says minutes of the family court.neither minute order identifies white as a commissioner.
at the hearing on june,concerning kelli motion to compel discovery and for sanctions,commissioner white stated that as a preliminary matter she needed marc to sign a stip.the record shows that kelli and her legal counsel signed the form that same day june,but that marc refused to sign the form.
the form provided 
commissioner darlene white is a judicial officer selected by the judges of the san diego superior court assigned to hear and determine family cases because of her experience,skill and knowledge in handling these matters.
in order to have a commissioner act as a judge in a case,all parties to the case must agree that the commissioner can act as a temporary judge.if any party does not agree,the case will be reassigned to another judicial officer for today hearing and all future hearings.a commissioner authority to act as a judge upon the agreement of the parties comes from article vi,sections and of the california constitution,and code of civil procedure,section,subdivision d.
to stipulate means you agree to the appointment of commissioner darlene white as a judge for this hearing and all future hearings and trials in this case,including any contempt proceedings and all matters.
it is stipulated by the attorneys parties signing below that commissioner darlene white will hear and decide all present and future matters in this case as a temporary judge,including any contempt proceedings and all matters.
the record shows commissioner white was unsure whether the parties previously had signed such a stip but noted that,in any event,she has made rulings on the merits on the case on march.commissioner white further noted so at this point there a tantamount stip looking to see if i have a stip in the file or not.in other words,since i already ruled on the merits of the case,it is too late to now stip me.
marc in response objected your honor,this ruling was made against my will.i was not presented with the stip to start with and as it stands right now,those rulings are in conflict with the current situation.italics added.
when asked by commissioner white what he meant by conflict,marc responded meaning that i have not authorized i was not presented with that form on march,your honor.i myself.i was i did not consent to you being with all due respect,your honor you being the judge of this particular case and therefore,the request for the of the current ruling that has been put in place.since it was made against my will,i was not presented with this document and i had not signed it as of now.italics added.
when commissioner white inquired of marc whether he had done anything with respect to the ma
