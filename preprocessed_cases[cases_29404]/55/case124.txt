by the court 
petitioner johnny father is a respondent in a juvenile dependency proceeding.welf.inst.code.he seeks writ review of an order of the trial court denying a motion to disqualify the assigned judge under code of civil procedure section section the court denied the motion as untimely,reasoning that the motion was filed after the court made substantive rulings at an initial detention hearing.as we explain,those rulings did not preclude father from making his section challenge because they did not involv e a determination of contested fact issues related to the merits,subd.a.we therefore grant father petition and issue a peremptory writ in the first instance,as we previously informed the parties was possible.see palma industrial fasteners,cal d,palma.
factual and procedural background 
on february,the san francisco county human services agency the agency filed a welfare and institutions code section petition on behalf of father son,minor.the following day,the trial court held an initial detention hearing.father appeared,and the court appointed counsel for him.father counsel asked to set the matter for a contested detention hearing but explained she could not proceed immediately because her witnesses and evidence were not available and because she was in trial in another department.
the court proposed hearing the matter on friday,february,but father counsel informed the court she would be unavailable.after the court told counsel february was the only day on which it could conveniently hear the matter,counsel invoked her client statutory right to a continuance.welf.inst.code,upon motion of the minor or a parent or guardian of such minor,the court shall continue any hearing or rehearing held under the provisions of this article for one day,excluding sundays and nonjudicial days.cal.rules of court,rule a.the court then told counsel she would have to return the next day,february,for the continuance.counsel agreed to return but told the court,i will not be able,by that time,to hire a social worker,or go out and take photographs to represent my case.the court observed that always the situation when you want a contested hearing.it suggested it might be wiser to set it on a no time waiver basis,and if counsel needed time to investigate,to then set the matter for a contested hearing.
the court then proceeded to make its record.it stated that it had read and considered the february detention report,and it found notice had been given as required by law.it then found there had been a prima facie showing minor came within section of the welfare and institutions code,there was a substantial danger to minor physical and emotional,and there were no reasonable means by which minor physical and emotional safety could be safeguarded without removing minor from father custody.the court ordered minor temporarily detained under the care and custody of the agency.it approved minor placement with his mother.
on february,father counsel filed a declaration and disqualification motion under section.when court convened that morning,the court noted it had received father motion.the court found it to be untimely because the court had made substantive rulings on the detention yesterday.in response to father counsel disagreement,the court stated it had made temporary detention findings which are substantive findings.father counsel again objected,but the court denied the motion as untimely.it renewed its detention findings and ordered the parties to return on february for a contested jurisdiction hearing.
on february,father filed a timely petition for writ of mandate seeking review of the denial of his disqualification motion.code civ,subd.d see in re sheila th,petition for writ of mandate is exclusive means of appellate review of juvenile court denial of challenge.the following day,we requested informal opposition to the petition and notified the parties that we might proceed by issuing a peremptory writ in the first instance.that same day,minor filed a letter in support of the relief requested in the petition,and the next day,the agency counsel informed us it had no position on the petition and did not intend to file informal opposition.on february,we temporarily stayed proceedings in the juvenile court pending further consideration of the petition 
discussion 
father contends the juvenile court erred in ruling that his disqualification motion was untimely filed.he argues that he filed the motion within the time limits set by the statute,and he disputes the juvenile court conclusion that the court findings and orders at the initial detention hearing rendered the motion untimely.we agree with father.
father motion was filed within the statutory deadline.
section,subdivision a provides that any party or the attorney for any party may challenge the assigned bench officer if the party or attorney can not,or believes that he or she can not,have a fair and impartial trial or hearing before the judge,court commissioner,or referee to whom the case has been assigned.this section applies to juvenile court cases.daniel superior court th,daniel juvenile delinquency proceeding pamela superior court d,section is equally applicable and constitutional in juvenile court proceedings.if a party or attorney motion is timely and in proper form,immediate disqualification is mandatory.in re jose d,jose.here,counsel declaration in support of the motion closely tracked the language set forth in the statute.see,subd.a providing language of supporting affidavit.it was therefore in proper form.
that leaves the question of the motion timeliness.in general,a challenge of a judge is permitted under section any time before the commencement of a trial or hearing.lavi,supra,cal th at.but section establishes three exceptions to the general rule,namely,the rule,the master calendar rule,and the all purpose assignment rule.lavi,at.normally,to determine whether a disqualification motion is timely,the court must decide whether the general rule or one of the three exceptions applies.grant superior court th.
father contends this case falls within the all purpose assignment rule,and thus his motion had to be filed within days after notice of the assignment.see,subd.a if directed to the trial of a civil cause that has been assigned to a judge for all purposes,the motion shall be made to the assigned judge or to the presiding judge by a party within days after notice of the all purpose assignment,or if the party has not yet appeared in the action,then within days after the appearance.we need not decide whether father is correct,however,because father motion would be timely under any of the statute deadlines.the initial petition in this case was filed on february.the first hearing of any kind was held on february.father filed his disqualification motion the very next day,on february.a section challenge brought a mere two days after the filing of the initial dependency petition is clearly within the statutory deadlines.
ii.at the initial detention hearing the trial court did not resolve any contested fact issue relating to the merits.
as father recognizes,our conclusion that his motion was filed within the time fixed by the statute does not end the timeliness inquiry.a n otherwise timely peremptory challenge must be denied if the judge has presided at an earlier hearing which involved a determination of contested factual issues relating to the merits.grant superior court,supra,th at.but t he fact that a judge has presided at,or acted in connection with,a pretrial conference or other hearing,proceeding,or motion prior to trial,and not involving a determination of contested fact issues relating to the merits,shall not preclude the later making of the motion provided for in this paragraph at the time and in the manner herein provided,subd.a.we must therefore determine whether the initial detention hearing involved the determination of such contested fact issues.
a section challenge will not be untimely merely because the judge has previously determined some issue of fact.it is not enough that a judge make a determination which relates to contested fact issues.the judge must have actually resolved or determined
