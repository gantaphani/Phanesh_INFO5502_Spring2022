here,we confront the boundaries of the use of judicially noticed records in ruling on a demurrer.utilizing judicially noticed documents in ruling on a demurrer is only proper when the documents are not used to determine disputed factual issues,such as the timing of acquisition of knowledge of the misappropriation of customer information or power supply technology 
appellants are richtek technology corporation richtek technology,a taiwan corporation and richtek usa,richtek usa,its california subsidiary.respondents are james chang,huang and chen,taiwan residents and former employees of richtek technology,and upi semiconductor corporation upi,a california company they formed.
we will distinguish the employees cases that are governed by an employment agreement,and the action against upi,which remains here,and is subject to california law,particularly as to continuing use of multiple trade secrets.
appellants sued respondents for trade secret misappropriation.the trial court sustained respondents upi,chang and huang demurrer on the ground that appellants claims were barred by the taiwanese statute of limitations for trade secret misappropriation actions.the court also granted chen motion to dismiss based on a forum selection clause in his employment agreement mandating a taiwanese forum.
appellants bring this appeal asserting that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer because it resolved disputed issues of fact based on information from judicially noticed documents.in addition,appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting chen motion to dismiss based on the forum selection clause in his employment agreement with richtek technology.
