overview of jrs ii.
jrs ii governs the retirement system for judicial officers at all levels of california state court who were elected or appointed to judicial office on or after november,subd.a.it provides for three types of retirement benefits normal,early,and disability.all retirement allowances are paid from a trust fund,known as the judges retirement system ii fund jrs ii fund,held in the state treasury,which receives all contributions to the jrs ii system from judges and the state.
a judge who has either served years and reached age,or served five years and reached age,is eligible for normal retirement,subd.a.upon retirement,a judge must elect to receive either a monthly retirement allowance essentially,an annuity paying an amount determined by multiplying the judge final salary,years of service,and a statutory benefit factor which is capped at percent of the judge final compensation,or a lump sum equal to the judge accumulated monetary credits an amount equal to percent of the judge monthly salary for every month of the judge service,plus the jrs ii fund net earnings on that amount payable either in a single payment or in installments over time,at the judge election,subds.d,e.the percent lump sum represents a portion of amounts contributed to the jrs ii fund during the judge period of service by the judge and the state judges contribute eight percent of their monthly salary,while the state contributes an amount that is adjusted yearly from an initial contribution rate of percent,subd.f.
if a judge leaves service but does not qualify for normal retirement,he or she is eligible for an early retirement benefit.a judge who leaves service before accruing five years of service may receive a refund of his or her eight percent monthly contributions into the jrs ii fund plus interest,subd.a,subd.f.if five or more years of service have been accrued,the judge may receive a distribution of his or her monetary credits as noted above,an amount equal to percent of the judge monthly salary for every month of service,subds.a,b.importantly,given the issues in this case,section provides that the judge leaving service and receiving an early retirement benefit is to receive the specified payment and no other amount,subds.a,b.
a judge who becomes disabled as a result of an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of judicial service,or a judge who becomes disabled for any reason who has accrued five or more years of judicial service,may,with his or her consent,apply for a disability retirement benefit,subd.a.the disability retirement benefit is a monthly allowance like the normal retirement benefit,essentially an annuity tied to a percentage of the judge final salary and capped at percent.unlike the early retirement benefit,the disability retirement benefit comes with certain restrictions on the judge postretirement employment that remain in effect until the judge reaches the age he or she would have been eligible for normal retirement.
under jrs ii,a judge who receives a disability retirement benefit is not entitled to also receive an early retirement benefit.
judge warner contends that a judge who becomes disabled may first apply for and obtain a disability retirement benefit,and then still proceed to receive the retirement benefit appropriate to his or her years of service in his case,the early retirement benefit of a lump sum payment of monetary credits pursuant to section,subdivision b.this contention is based in part on the circumstance that provisions regarding disability benefits are codified in article of the jrs ii law,while service retirement provisions,including both normal and early retirement,are codified in article.
we can not say judge warner interpretation is explicitly foreclosed by the relevant statutory language,which ideally would have been drafted with greater precision.nevertheless,we conclude the interpretation that fits most comfortably with the statutory scheme as whole,as well as its purpose,legislative history,and public policy,is that a judge who becomes disabled is not entitled to receive both disability and service retirement benefits under jsp ii,but only one or the other.
first,the statute that provides the early retirement benefit expressly states that the retiring judge is to receive the specified lump sum and no other amount,subds.a,b.judge warner position,whereby a retired judge might receive both an early retirement benefit and a disability retirement allowance,is at least in some tension with this language 
second,the structure of jrs ii benefits generally suggests that retiring judges are to receive either a monthly retirement allowance or a lump sum payment,but not both.see state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,statutes are interpreted with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is a part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.judges qualified for normal retirement must elect between retirement allowance and lump sum payment of monetary credits,subd.c.judges who leave service before becoming eligible for normal retirement may receive an early retirement benefit of a lump sum payment,and no other amount,subds.a,b.judges who qualify for disability retirement may receive a monthly allowance,despite having not reached normal retirement eligibility,but there is no explicit provision allowing such judges also to receive a lump sum payment of contributions or monetary credits.the absence of any contrary example any situation where a judge is explicitly entitled to collect two retirement benefits under
