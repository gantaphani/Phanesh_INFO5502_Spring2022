lloyd myers was indicted on ten charges stemming from his involvement in a ponzi scheme he operated with his.after nearly three years of pretrial proceedings,myers requested a criminal settlement conference in accordance with the northern district of california criminal local rule.the prosecutor,initially opposed to the procedure due to the rapidly approaching trial date,ultimately acquiesced to myers request.the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge to conduct a settlement conference.during the proceeding,myers and the government reached a plea deal that was subsequently memorialized in a written plea agreement between the parties.myers later pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of and was sentenced to a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment.
myers does not dispute that he voluntarily participated in the settlement conference.rather,he argues the procedure violated federal rule of criminal procedure,which prohibits t he court from participat ing in plea discussions.c.specifically,myers argues that the supreme court decision in united states davila,sets forth a categorical rule prohibiting any judicial involvement in plea negotiation,even,as is at issue here,when the judicial participation is both requested by the defendant and sanctioned by the district court local rules.
we agree that davila makes clear that rule c imposes a categorical bar on judicial participation in plea negotiations.because myers failed to object at the time to judicial participation,however,we review his unpreserved rule claim for plain error,and we affirm.myers has failed to establish the alleged error affected his substantial rights because the record is bereft of evidence indicating that he suffered any prejudice due to the magistrate judge participation in the settlement conference.rather,the settlement conference helped myers reach a plea deal with the government something myers vigorously pursued during the nearly three years of pretrial proceedings which resulted in myers receiving a sentence.
in,myers and his,rodney hatfield,created landmark trading company,llc,to solicit investments and conduct financial transactions in the foreign currency exchange markets forex transactions.myers and hatfield had very little,if any,training or experience with forex trading.between and,hatfield recruited approximately forty investors,many of whom were fellow congregation members from myers and hatfield place of worship.once funded,hatfield transferred the money to a forex trading account,which myers controlled and operated.myers and hatfield received over from investors,but because myers forex trades were wildly unsuccessful,landmark never turned a profit.however,this was not the information myers and hatfield represented to investors.rather,investors were told the company was flush with cash and its investments consistently achieved monthly profits of up to three percent.to disguise the company losses,myers and hatfield used new investors funds to pay off other investors.by early,the scheme had reached a breaking point myers and hatfield reported to investors the value of landmark investment account was approximately,when the account actually contained a meager.
in december,myers and hatfield were indicted in the northern district of california for one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,in violation of,and nine counts of wire fraud,in violation of.following numerous delays,trial was set for march.leading up to the trial date,myers and hatfield actively sought to reach a plea deal with the government.for example,in august,the parties stipulated to a hearing continuance to allow time for defendants counsel to continue to work toward a resolution of the case with the government.the district court granted the motion and set a status conference hearing for november.
during the november status conference after a brief discussion about the progress of pretrial discovery,the district court asked whether the parties wished to advance the trial date.myers counsel responded 
well,you know,i think the court intentions are to keep the ball rolling,and our idea is to have our feet to the fire rather than having them in the fire.i think what we have been discussing,your honor,is possibly setting a criminal local rule settlement conference prior to the thanksgiving holiday.
under the northern district of california criminal local rule,titled voluntary settlement conference,the government and a criminal defendant acting jointly may request that the district court refer the case to another judge or magistrate judge to conduct a settlement conference.a.the role of the settlement judge is to assist the parties in exploring a voluntary settlement in a criminal case.c.the rule expressly provides a ny party may unilaterally withdraw its request for a settlement conference at any time.d.
the government initially resisted myers request for a settlement conference.the prosecutor acknowledged that myers had made good efforts in trying to resolve the matter up until today,but stated the government ability to resolve the case without trial would be rapidly diminishing given the approaching trial date.however,the government ultimately agreed to myers request and the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge to oversee the settlement conference.
on december,the parties took part in a settlement conference with the magistrate judge,where myers agreed,among other things,to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.a few weeks later,myers and the government entered into a written plea agreement in which myers agreed,among other things,to give up his right to appeal his conviction,the judgment,and orders of the court.
the district court held a change of plea hearing in february.there,myers acknowledged that he had waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence,and he affirmed that his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.myers expressed satisfaction with the quality of his representation and confirmed that he was pleading guilty because he was,in fact,guilty.the district court accepted myers guilty plea.
the district court sentenced myers on october.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,below the month sentence recommended by probation.
federal rule of criminal procedure prohibits t he court from participating in plea discussions.c.the federal rules broadly define c ourt to mean a federal judge performing functions authorized by law.b,a definition which expressly includes a magistrate judge executing his or her legal duty.b b.while rule c appears to prohibit any form of judicial participation in the plea bargaining process,our court previously approved the participation by a settlement judge in plea negotiations.united states scolari,cir see united states torres,cir per curiam holding that no rule violation occurred when t he parties hammered out their agreement with the assistance of a settlement judge in accordance with the criminal case settlement procedures for the southern district of california.torres and scolari did not address,much less resolve,the conflict between the plain language of rule c which categorically prohibits t he court from participating in plea negotiations and the local rule allowance of criminal settlement conferences.rather,these decisions appear to distinguish criminal settlement conferences from the scope of rule c on the basis that the sentencing judge did not participate in any plea bargaining.scolari,at emphasis added see torres,f d at.the supreme court recent decision in davila.at,is irreconcilable with this reasoning.
in davila,the defendant,dissatisfied with his attorney,sent a letter to the district court requesting that a new attorney be appointed to represent him.according to davila,his lawyer advised him to plead guilty and therefore offered no defensive strategy.at.the request for new counsel was referred to a magistrate judge who,during an in camera hearing,made a number of inappropriate comments urging davila to plead guilty and cooperate with the government id.at.davila pled guilty about three months later.he then appealed,arguing that the magistrate judge comments violated rule.id.at.the eleventh circuit agreed and vacated davila guilty plea consistent with the circuit rule requiring automatic vacatur for rule c violations.id.at.
the government conceded that the magistrate judge comments violated rule c.the supreme court acknowledged the concession,stating there is no room for doubt on that score.the magistrate judge repeated exhortations to davila to tell it all in order to obtain a more favorable sentence were indeed beyond the pale.id.at.having resolved the question of error,the court next addressed the issue presented in davila whether the violation of rule c by the magistrate judge warranted automatic vacatur of davila guilty plea,as the eleventh circuit had ruled.id.at.
the court determined that automatic vacatur was not an appropriate remedy for a violation of rule c.id.at.rather,like all trial errors,rule c violations should be reviewed under either rule a standard or rule b standard,depending on when the error was raised.id.at.the court explained the standard applies to preserved errors,while the rule is applicable when a defendant fails to object to the error in the trial court.id.at.the supreme court remanded the case so that the court of appeals could reach the arguments raised by the parties in the first instance,including davila argument that the extraordinary circumstances of his case warranted a departure from the general rule that the standard governs the review of unpreserved errors.id.at.
myers argues that davila sets forth a rule that magistrate judges can not participate in plea negotiations under rule c,even where,as here,the defendant facilitated judicial involvement by specifically requesting a settlement conference.the government conceded error during oral argument.although we are not bound by the government legal concession,see united states daas,cir,we agree that davila undercuts the analysis upon which our court relied in torres and scolari.the factual circumstances in davila are quite distinct from those present in myers case,but davila interpretation of rule is clear rule c prohibition of judicial involvement in plea discussions extends to magistrate judges who are neither the sentencing judge nor the judge presiding over the defendant criminal case.at emphasis added.given this directive,we can not ignore that the plain language of rule c compels the application of the rule to the circumstances here.see united states petri,cir because the federal rules of criminal procedure,once effective,have the force and effect of law,we apply traditional tools of statutory construction to interpret them.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
we observe that each decision of this court that has expressly addressed the scope of rule c has similarly concluded the rule categorically bars judges from participating in plea negotiations.see,united states kyle,cir we take this opportunity to emphasize that rule c is intended to eliminate all judicial pressure from plea discussions.united states gonzalez melchor,cir we have explained previously that judicial participation in plea negotiations is prohibited.united states bruce,cir noting rule c creates a rule bar ring a judge from participating in plea bargaining see also united states baker,c ourts have interpreted rule categorically to mean the judge role is limited to acceptance or rejection of the plea agreement after a thorough review of the relevant factors the judge should not participate in the plea bargaining process.internal quotation marks omitted see also in re benvin,cir.consistent with these decisions,we conclude that rule c extends to the magistrate judge participation in the settlement conference at issue here.
we note that this means northern district of california local criminal rule a was and is in conflict with rule c.the local rule allowed judicial participation only after myers himself requested it,see.a,and also permitted myers to withdraw from the settlement conference at any time,see.d.while these facts bear on whether myers voluntarily waived rule c which we address later in this opinion these procedural protections do not ameliorate the conflict between the local rule and rule c categorical bar on judges participating in plea negotiations.see.a local rule must be consistent with federal statutes and rules united states lopez cavasos,cir.
the parties dispute whether myers appeal waiver precludes our consideration of the merits of his rule claim.generally,a defendant waiver of his appellate rights is enforceable if the language of the waiver encompasses his right to appeal on the grounds raised,and the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made.united states jeronimo,cir,overruled on other grounds by united states castillo,cir en banc.myers acknowledges that he waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence in his plea agreement,but he contends the waiver does not preclude our consideration of his rule claim.see united states brizan,cir we decline to enforce an appeal waiver if the district court failed to comply with federal rule of criminal procedure.the government concedes that an appeal waiver is generally not enforceable when the district court violates rule.however,the government argues that myers appeal waiver should be enforced because myers,by requesting the settlement conference,invited the error and therefore waived his right to raise the issue on appeal under the invited error doctrine.
the doctrine of invited error prevents a defendant from complaining of an error that was his own fault.united states.reyes alvarado,cir.under the doctrine,an error is waived and therefore unreviewable when the defendant has both invited the error,and relinquished a known right.united states perez,cir en banc citing united states olano.
here,with respect to perez first inquiry,there is little question myers invited rule error.during the status hearing on november,defense counsel requested the settlement conference as a effort to resolve the case before trial.in counsel words,myers wanted to have his feet to the fire in a settlement conference rather than having them in the fire at trial.while the government was initially inclined to proceed to trial,it ultimately agreed to participate in the settlement conference.the government notified myers that its ability to resolve the case without trial would be rapidly diminishing,and with this in mind,myers participated in the settlement conference the following month.myers could have withdrawn from the settlement conference at any time,yet he participated in the process knowing full well the government would take the case to trial if he preferred that route.under these circumstances,we have no trouble concluding that myers invited the rule error.
because of the limited record before us,the second showing required under perez whether myers intentionally relinquished or abandoned a known right is less clear.perez,at citing olano,at.as our en banc decision in perez clarified,the supreme court decision in olano limits our application of the invited error doctrine to those rights deemed waived,as opposed to merely forfeited,that is,known right s that have been intentional ly relinquish ed or abandon ed.at alterations in original quoting olano,at.whether a particular right is waivable whether the defendant must participate personally in the waiver whether certain procedures are required for waiver and whether the defendant choice must be particularly informed or voluntary,all depend on the right at stake.olano,at.thus,to find that myers waived rule c,we must find both that a criminal defendant can,in fact,waive rule c,and myers knowingly did so here.
as to the first inquiry,we hold that rule c is waivable.in united states mezzanatto,the supreme court explained the provisions of the federal rules of criminal procedure are presumptively waivable.rule is no exception.see,united states orm hieng,cir defendant can waive right not to have the statements he made during proffer discussions used against him rule f united states reyes,cir defendant can waive right to withdraw a plea under rule c if the waiver is knowing and voluntary.we see no reaso
