this is an appeal from a judgment after a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.plaintiff douglas mcclintock sued michelle west and the law offices of michelle west collectively the west defendants for damages resulting from west purported misconduct while acting as his guardian ad litem during a divorce proceeding.at all times in the underlying case,west was acting under the supervision of an experienced family law judge.
the court sustained the west defendants demurrer to mcclintock second amended complaint,concluding that the doctrine of immunity and the litigation privilege,among other things,precluded mcclintock claims.we agree and affirm.
factsa.the divorce action 
in,mcclintock wife,sara filed for divorce.sara,like mcclintock,an attorney,sought legal and physical custody of the couple two children and intended to relocate to the midwest.when the case was called for trial in february,mcclintock did not appear.his attorney,stephen kaufman,advised the court that he had checked himself into a hospital in massachusetts for severe depression.the court refused to grant a continuance without evidence of mcclintock condition.the next day,kaufman presented a letter that had been faxed by a physician.the trial judge stated the letter convinced him that mcclintock could not act on his own behalf,and he appointed michelle west as guardian ad litem.in re marriage of mcclintock,wl nonpub.opn.on the same day,the court entered an order awarding sara temporary sole custody of the children.
mcclintock claims judge naughton unilaterally appointed west without holding a hearing on appellant competence and without any evidence in the record that appellant was anything more than depressed it later became apparent that judge naughton unilaterally appointed west in order to give her a huge financial windfall after appellant was finally able to get her removed two years later.
after she was appointed,west spoke to mcclintock by phone.mcclintock later alleged he told west his priorities were to regain custody and visitation rights with his children and to divide the marital property through a settlement.
in march,west and sara signed a stipulation that the custody order was to remain in effect and that west would continue as guardian ad litem for mcclintock for all purposes.mcclintock later alleged that in june,west agreed to a request from sara attorney to release mcclintock medical records.
west and kaufman,on mcclintock behalf,then negotiated a stipulated judgment on reserved issues with sara and her attorney.the court approved the stipulated judgment on july.among other provisions,the parties equally divided approximately million in retirement accounts.mcclintock was to provide account statements and execute releases to grant sara access to the accounts,and mcclintock was to be responsible for any attorney fees resulting from the failure to do so.mcclintock was to maintain the children medical coverage.the stipulated judgment also provided for equal division of proceeds from the marital home after an equalization payment to sara.
mcclintock alleges that prior to the hearing on july,he tried to speak to west when he saw her in the parking lot,but she refused to speak to him.he alleges that west accused him of stalking her after the hearing.
the remaining issues were settled in september,via another stipulated judgment and order on reserved issues.one part of that order stated that from the sale of the residence was payable to michelle west as an entire flat fee for all past and future services through the division of the marital estate and the house sale as guardian ad litem.
at some point during this period,mcclintock apparently filed a motion to relieve west of her duties as guardian ad litem.according to a later declaration filed by sara,mcclintock claimed he had no mental disabilities,yet at the same time,he applied for and was granted full disability based on his mental status.
the stipulated judgment and order entered in september became a final judgment on october.the judgment gave sole physical and legal custody to sara,and stated that mcclintock shall have no contact with the minor children,and that a ny future contact of any kind shall only occur at the request of the minor children through a qualified therapist,and the parties stipulate that this order is not modifiable,except at the request of the minor children.while mcclintock blames west for his failure to reunite with his children and the alienation of the children by sara,there is evidence in the record that a reunification therapist testified at trial that there was no alienation by sara,and mcclintock was largely responsible for the rift between him and his children.
around the same time,sara gave notice of an ex parte motion seeking to shorten time on a motion to give west the authority to carry out the july agreement with respect to the retirement accounts.in her supporting declaration,sara stated that mcclintock had not turned over any retirement account statements by the stipulated deadline.mcclintock had also failed to make the equalization payment,independently contacting the escrow agent responsible for the sale of the home and informing the agent that he had a dispute with the july agreement.he had also failed to maintain the children medical coverage.
most urgently,given the declining state of the stock market in september,sara sought to have the retirement accounts divided immediately.she stated the guardian ad litem has little control over the respondent,and the court must make the orders requested in order to allow the assets to be divided pursuant to the terms of the judgment.the respondent has chosen to ignore this court orders she argued that mcclintock recalcitrance had caused sara to incur over in attorney fees and costs.
the proposed order went further than the july agreement,however,and sought to require mcclintock transfer percent of the value of the various accounts as of july,kaufman did not oppose or notify mcclintock of the hearing,but filed a declaration asking that each party bear its own costs.the court granted the order as requested and awarded in attorney fees and costs to sara.the court also broadened west discretion as guardian ad litem,and she was ordered to take all steps necessary to facilitate the transfer of the retirement accounts,as well as to do what was needed to effectuate the judgment.
in,mcclintock fired kaufman and filed for fee arbitration in an advisory proceeding.mcclintock claimed that kaufman was not entitled to any attorney fees.he asserted that kaufman had entered into a stipulation to grant sara legal and physical custody without his authority,failed to object to the appointment of west or seek to overturn the order,failed to respond to him or act according to his direction,failed to give notice of an ex parte motion,and entered into the stipulation for judgment which resulted in an order for unequal division of property and unreasonable attorney fees and fees for west.west testified on kaufman behalf.
the arbitrators concluded that kaufman was entitled to approximately in fees.with respect to west appointment,the arbitrators stated it is also very clear from review of the transcript of the february,proceeding,that the court,in making that appointment of west as guardian ad litem was bending over backward to protect the interests of mcclintock,who would otherwise have been required to proceed to trial in absentia.the result of such a default trial proceeding would certainly have been less favorable to mcclintock than the result reached through the participation of the gal,acting on mcclintock behalf.
west services were terminated in march,and she thereafter sought payment of her fees.she petitioned the court for payment of hours spent between october,and march,at a rate of per hour for a total of.she submitted a declaration to the court in support of the request.the court granted it,stating that the services of the guardian ad litem were necessary to the conclusion of the case.without her services,the court stated,there would have been no resolution of the matter in any reasonable time frame and both parties had benefitted from her services.mcclintock was ordered to pay and sara was ordered to pay.the parties were given days to object to the order,but there is no evidence in the record that anyone did.
the court also ruled on the issue of attorney fees in the divorce case,and ordered mcclintock to pay in fees.the court felt the fees amassed were monumental and with respect to the decision to order mcclintock to pay the bulk of them,the court stated sara lays the blame for the high attorney fees entirely on mcclintock with some justification particularly if one believes that that the trip to the hospital in massachusetts was merely an effort to game the legal system.were that the case,the ploy failed because the appointment of a guardian ad litem ensured the rapid conclusion of the case to judgment.the court also noted it had warned mcclintock since he did seem to be paying any attention to the guardian ad litem who could have and should have resolved the whole thing.
b.the instant case 
mcclintock filed his initial complaint against the west defendants on march.he alleged five causes of action,including negligence,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the gravamen of the complaint was that west actions resulted in financial losses and the loss of custody of his children.the claims for fraud and breach of contract were based in part on the theory that west had promised to cap her fees at pursuant to the september stipulation.
the west defendants demurred,arguing,among other things,that as guardian ad litem she had immunity.the court tentative decision sustained the demurrer,but mcclintock then filed an amended complaint,thereby taking the hearing off calendar.
the first amended complaint added causes of action for intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,but was otherwise substantially similar to the initial complaint.again the west defendants demurred,again raising immunity,among other arguments.mcclintock opposed,arguing west was not entitled to such immunity.mcclintock counsel failed to appear at the hearing on the demurrer,although mcclintock appeared to argue on his own behalf.the court ordered the demurrer sustained,with days leave to amend.
in due course,mcclintock,now representing himself,filed a second amended complaint,which is the one at issue here.in addition to the claims included in his first amended complaint fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,intentional infliction of emotional distress,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,he added claims for legal malpractice and substituted a claim for professional negligence for his original negligence cause of action.he also claimed that west was his de facto attorney who breached her professional obligations by failing to provide him with a copy of his files.
the west defendants again demurred.with regard to the new contentions regarding legal malpractice,west asserted that she appeared as mcclintock guardian ad litem,not his attorney.even assuming she had acted as an attorney on isolated occasions,the primary duty to furnish documents would have fallen to kaufman,the attorney of record.the west defendants also filed a lengthy request for judicial notice,which was unopposed.
in opposition to the demurrer,mcclintock contended that west owed him a duty of care and that she was not entitled to immunity.he pointed to the stalking incident as evidence that west had acted outside her role as guardian ad litem.mcclintock argued that he had adequately set forth sufficient claim as to each cause of action,mostly in an entirely conclusory manner he did not offer any argument that if the demurrer was sustained,further leave to amend should be granted.
the court granted the request for judicial notice,with the exception of one document,and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court concluded that west was entitled to immunity on the claims alleging breach of a duty of care.with respect to the fraud and breach of contract claims,the litigation privilege barred any claims based on statements west had made in the divorce proceedings or in her application for fees.with regard to the stalking incident,even if outside of west role as guardian ad litem,mcclintock had not set forth any viable theory of causation and damages.the judgment and order of dismissal was subsequently entered.

quasi judicial immunity 
the role of the guardian ad litem 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,states in relevant part when an incompetent person is a party,that person shall appear either by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or proceeding is pending,or by a judge thereof,in each case the guardian ad litem so appearing for any incompetent person shall have power,with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending,to compromise the same,to agree to the order or judgment to be entered therein for or against the ward and to satisfy any judgment or order in favor of the ward or release or discharge any claim of the ward pursuant to that compromise.
a guardian ad litem is not a party to an action,but merely the representative of record of a party.estate of cochems d.he or she represents the interests of a person in legal proceedings who lacks capacity to represent himself or herself superior court th,d.but while a guardian ad litems role is as a representative of the ward,he or she does not act as an advocate,and does not simply represent the wards wishes.the court is,in effect,the guardian of the minor and the guardian ad litem is but an officer and representative of the court.citation.serway galentine d.
while the guardian ad litem has the power to assent to procedural steps that will facilitate a determination of the wards case torres friedman d,the guardian ad litems authority is that of an agent with limited powers.citation.berry chaplin d.for example,when a guardian ad litem believes that settling a case is in the wards best interests,that decision requires court approval.code civ.the court has a duty to ensure that the wards rights are protected by the guardian ad litem.berry chaplin,supra,d at.the guardian ad litem,therefore,when representing an adult deemed incapable of representing themselves,is in a similar role to a conservator,who derives his or her authority from the power of the state to protect incompetent persons.see,young cbs broadcasting,th,d.
guardians ad litem enjoy quasi judicial immunity when acting within the scope of their authority 
the seminal california case on immunity is howard drapkin d.howard.the defendant in that case was a psychologist who had been appointed to evaluate the plaintiff child custody dispute.id.at.the plaintiff claimed the psychologist had acted improperly in carrying out that evaluation.ibid.the defendant filed a demurrer to the plaintiff complaint,arguing she had immunity as an expert witness,and the trial court agreed,sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.id.at.the court of appeal ultimately agreed.id.at.
the court of appeal provided an overview of common law immunity,beginning with the concept of judicial immunity.the concept of judicial immunity is and absolute,with its roots in english common law.it bars civil actions against judges for acts performed in the exercise of their judicial functions and it applies to all judicial determinations,including those rendered in excess of the judges jurisdiction,no matter how erroneous or even malicious or corrupt they may be.citations.howard,supra,d at,fn.omitted.the rationale behind the doctrine is twofold.first,it protect s the finality of judgments and discourag es inappropriate collateral attacks.citation.second,it protect s judicial independence by insulating judges from vexatious actions prosecuted by disgruntled litigants.citation.citation.id.at.
the court then discussed the concept of immunity,which extended absolute judicial immunity to persons other than judges if those persons act in a judicial or capacity.howard,supra,d at.immunity has been extended to court commissioners,grand jurors,administrative hearing officers,arbitrators and the organizations sponsoring them,the state bar and committee of bar examiners,and prosecutors.id.at.as with the reason for granting judicial immunity,immunity is given to promote uninhibited and independent decisionmaking.citation.ibid.the court noted that federal decisions had extended immunity to trust officers,conservators,receivers,guardians ad litem,psychologists and attorneys for children in child abuse cases.id.at.see also kurzawa mueller cir,guardian ad litem must act in the best interests of the person he represents and s uch a position clearly places him squarely within the judicial process.
the howard court noted that the overburdened judicial system was dependent on attracting independent and impartial services and expertise to function.thus,we believe it appropriate that these nonjudicial persons who fulfill functions intimately related to the judicial process citation should be given absolute immunity for damage claims arising from their performance of duties in connection with the judicial process.without such immunity,such persons will be reluctant to accept court appointments or provide work product for the courts use.additionally,the threat of civil liability may affect the manner in which they perform their jobs.citation.howard,supra,d at.
mcclintock argues that under howard,immunity should only apply to neutral third parties,and not a guardian ad litem,whose role involves making decisions for her ward.but that is not what howard states,and we believe the test it sets forth is applicable here.the question,under howard,is whether a guardian ad litem fulfills a function that is intimately related to the judicial process howard,supra,d at,and the answer to that question is yes.as we discussed ante,the guardian ad litems role is that of a officer,who,under the appointment of and under the supervision of the trial court,must act in her wards best interests.that is indeed a function intimately related,and indeed,one which the trial court found in this case was indispensible to bringing the case to a conclusion.
further,the policy considerations raised in howard apply here indeed,this case could be a poster child for such considerations.if west had known she might be subject to liability for causes of action ranging from negligence to intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,resulting in the potential for years of litigation and financial liability greater than her entire fee for handling the case,would she have ever agreed to the appointment why would any qualified person ever accept appointment as a guardian ad litem when his or her decisions could be subject to such post hoc second guessing 
moreover,in addition to the difficulty of finding anyone to accept such an assignment,the risk of liability could impact how the guardian ad litem carried out her role.as we discussed ante,the guardian ad litem does not advocate for her ward in the way an attorney does her job is acting in the wards best interests,and the ward might not always agree with the guardian ad litems decisions.her ability to act would be compromised if the threat of future liability encouraged a guardian ad litem to put a wards wishes above his interests.howard,supra,d at.
the countervailing policy present here is the accountability of guardians ad litem,but there are sufficient mechanisms in place to address such concerns.first,immunity is limited to acts within the scope of the guardians authority.second,in addition to a guardian ad litem,wards generally have legal counsel as well,as was the case here.third,as we have noted,guardians ad litem are appointed by and subject to the supervision of the trial court.the trial court can remove a guardian if he or she is not performing responsibly,either on its own motion or at a party request.fourth,the trial courts decisions are ultimately subject to review by an appropriate writ or appeal.ultimately,both the parties and the judicial system are best served by addressing any issues with the guardian ad litems performance during the initial case,rather than by a subsequent lawsuit collaterally attacking the original judgment.
in opposition to the argument that guardians ad litem are entitled to such immunity,mcclintock cites a number of federal cases that do not offer him much help.he points to miller gammie cir,a case that involved immunity for a social worker and a social therapist in a civil rights action under united states code section.id.at.the ninth circuit took the view that immunity was dependent on the specific function performed and could not be determined at the pleading stage.id.at.but that case is not dispositive here.as a federal case interpreting a federal statute,it is not binding on this court interpretation of state law.
that case is also less than instructive here because it does not involve a guardian ad litem.other federal cases,as the howardcourt noted howard,supra,d at,have found that guardians ad litem are entitled to immunity.in addition to the cases cited in howard,in gardner by gardner parson cir,the court held that a guardian should be absolutely immune when acting as an integral part of the judicial process.citation.id.at.while most of the federal cases on this issue arise out of guardians ad litem acting in an investigative capacity in child custody proceedings,they do not stand for the proposition that immunity should or must be limited to that context.see,cok cosentino cir,myers morris cir,ward san diego county dep t of social services.
other unhelpful federal cases cited by mcclintock are robinson freeze cir,a case filed by an inmate against a bailiff under united states code section,and richman sheahan cir,another civil rights action filed against bailiffs in an illinois courtroom.while these cases may be,as mcclintock argues,the law of the land with respect to federal civil rights claims filed in federal court,they do not apply to a common law action against a guardian ad litem filed in california state court.
in sum,both precedent with respect to other personnel and policy considerations persuade us that immunity was appropriately accorded to west in this case.accordingly,the trial court properly sustained the west defendants demurrer to the causes of action for professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional infliction of emotional distress,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage 
c.the litigation privilege 
mcclintock argues immunity can not apply to his claims for breach of contract or fraud.the basis for those claims is west fee application after her services as guardian ad litem were completed.mcclintock alleges that west,in the september stipulation,agreed to cap her fees,but later sought additional fees,which he claims constituted both breach of contract and fraud.west request for fees,however,is subject to the litigation privilege.
