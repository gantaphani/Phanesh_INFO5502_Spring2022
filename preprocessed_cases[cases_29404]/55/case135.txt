this unusual case involves charles kinney,a lawyer who was declared a vexatious litigant in in los angeles superior court.code civ,et despite his status as a vexatious litigant,kinney has pursued a persistent and obsessive campaign of litigation terror against his neighbors and the city of los angeles.kinney has evaded the effect of the prefiling order by enlisting a cohort,kimberly jean kempton,to stand in his stead as plaintiff and appellant,because kinney can no longer represent himself in litigation without prior court approval.
with kinney at the helm,kempton has pursued six lawsuits in los angeles superior court over the last five years.all of the lawsuits relate to real property owned by kinney and kempton the k,located on fernwood avenue in the silver lake neighborhood of los angeles the fernwood property.the k have continually and resoundingly lost their cases in the trial courts.as one trial judge aptly wrote in a statement of decision,kinney is a relentless bully who displays terrifying arrogance by filing baseless litigation against the city and its citizens.
after losing in the trial courts,the k have repeatedly appealed.since,they have lost appeals,had two appeals involuntarily dismissed and had a writ petition summarily denied.we conclude that attorney kinney is using kempton as his proxy or puppet in order to continue his career as a vexatious litigant.this opinion and order will serve to curb that behavior.
background 
kinney is declared a vexatious litigant in 
before becoming a los angeles courtroom menace,kinney was an orange county courtroom menace,engaging in incessant,litigious conduct stemming from his ownership of a house in laguna beach.much of that conduct is detailed in the los angeles superior court order declaring kinney to be a vexatious litigant in kinney overton,kinney sued a laguna beach neighbor claiming that she wrongly denied him use of a purported easement by erecting a fence,and he sued the state of california to compel it to take title to a lot by way of escheat.kinney lost his appeal against the state,and lost an appeal against his neighbor because kinney has no interest in the property that would support any of his causes of action.he also lost an appeal regarding sanctions and a motion to tax costs kinney failed to prosecute a against seven laguna beach neighbors for nuisance and trespass,and the resulting dismissal of his case was affirmed on appeal 
kinney was declared a vexatious litigant in in part because he has been repeatedly sanctioned for filing frivolous or unmeritorious papers,motions or other papers.kinney was sanctioned in after appealing from a order expunging a lis pendens kinney was also sanctioned while representing a plaintiff in federal court.the ninth circuit wrote,attorney kinney has continued in his efforts to relitigate nonmeritorious claims through vexatious and multiple filings within the current suit.even in this appeal,despite a circuit decision to the contrary,he seems intent upon arguing that his claims are meritorious.the first district court of appeal has upheld sanctions against kinney in several cases.he was sanctioned twice for in and in while representing a defendant who was alleged to have fraudulently transferred his assets in an auto accident case,and the sanctions were upheld on appeal the court wrote,there was ample reason for concluding that kinney filed the motions for an improper purpose,such as to cause needless delays or to harass or punish plaintiff for bringing suit.in another case,the appellate court affirmed sanctions of imposed on kinney for patently inadequate discovery responses and,more particularly,the frivolous objections which he interposed.
on november,the los angeles superior court declared kinney to be a vexatious litigant because he a commenced,prosecuted or maintained at least five litigations that were finally determined against him while he was acting in propria persona,and b repeatedly filed unmeritorious motions,pleadings,or other papers and was sanctioned for it.kinney was required to post security of and became subject to a prefiling order

the k lost their fence suit against clark,the prior owner of the fernwood property.they pursued an appeal of the judgment in division one,which found that the fence was an open and notorious physical burden on the land,and the k accepted that burden when they purchased the land the k lost their challenge to the trial court award of contractual attorney fees to clark finally,the k lost their fence case against the harrises in the trial court and on appeal division three found that the k have no easement over the harris property to enter and exit their garage,so there was no public or private nuisance created by the harris fence
