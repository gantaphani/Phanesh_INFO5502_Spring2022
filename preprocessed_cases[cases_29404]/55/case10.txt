on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the authority of a federal court to raise,on its own motion,a statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus petition.after state prisoner patrick wood filed a federal habeas corpus petition,the state twice informed the district court that it would not challenge,but is not conceding,the timeliness of wood habeas petition.app.see,at.thereafter,the district court rejected wood claims on the merits.on appeal,the tenth circuit directed the parties to brief the question whether wood federal petition was timely,the court of appeals affirmed the denial of wood petition,but solely on the ground that it was untimely.
our precedent establishes that a court may consider a statute of limitations or other threshold bar the state failed to raise in answering a habeas petition.granberry greer,exhaustion defense day mcdonough,statute of limitations defense.does court discretion to take up timeliness hold when a state is aware of a limitations defense,and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the court of first instance the answer day instructs is no a court is not at liberty,we have cautioned,to bypass,override,or excuse a state deliberate waiver of a limitations defense,at.the tenth circuit,we accordingly hold,abused its discretion by resurrecting the limitations issue instead of reviewing the district court disposition on the merits of wood claims.
in the course of a robbery at a pizza shop in a colorado town,the shop assistant manager was shot and killed.petitioner patrick wood was identified as the.at a bench trial in january,wood was convicted of murder,robbery,and menacing,and sentenced to life imprisonment.the colorado court of appeals affirmed wood convictions and sentence on direct appeal in may,and the colorado supreme court denied wood petition for certiorari five months later.wood did not ask this court to review his conviction in the days he had to do so.
wood then pursued postconviction relief,asserting infirmities in his trial,conviction,and sentence.prior to the federal petition at issue here,which was filed in,wood,proceeding pro se,twice sought relief in state court.first,in,he filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to colorado rule of criminal procedure c he also asked the colorado trial court to appoint counsel to aid him in pursuit of the motion.when some months passed with no responsive action,wood filed a request for a ruling on his motion and accompanying request for counsel.the state court then granted wood plea for the appointment of counsel,but the record is completely blank on any further action regarding the motion.second,wood filed a new pro se motion for postconviction relief in colorado court in.on the first page of his second motion,he indicated that n o other postconviction proceedings had been filed.record in d,doc.exh.e.the state court denied wood motion four days after receiving it.
wood filed a federal habeas petition in,which the district court initially dismissed as untimely.app.on reconsideration,the district court vacated the dismissal and instructed the state to file a preanswer response limited to addressing the affirmative defenses of timeliness exhaustion of state court remedies.at.on timeliness,the state represented in its preanswer response respondents will not challenge,but are not conceding,the timeliness of wood federal habeas petition.at.consistently,in its full to wood federal petition,the state repeated respondents are not challenging,but do not concede,the timeliness of the petition.at.
disposing of wood petition,the district court dismissed certain claims for failure to exhaust state remedies,and denied on the merits wood two remaining claims one alleging a double jeopardy violation and one challenging the validity of wood waiver of his sixth amendment right to a jury trial,at.on appeal,the tenth circuit ordered the parties to brief,along with the merits of wood double jeopardy and sixth amendment claims,the timeliness of wood application for federal habeas relief.at.after briefing,the court of appeals affirmed the denial of wood petition without addressing the merits instead,the tenth circuit held the petition time barred.fed.appx.in so ruling,the court of appeals concluded it had authority to raise timeliness on its own motion,at.it further ruled that the state had not taken that issue off the table by declining to interpose a statute of limitations defense in the district court.ibid.
we granted review,to resolve two issues first,whether a court of appeals has the authority to address the timeliness of a habeas petition on the court own initiative second,assuming a court of appeals has such authority,whether the state representations to the district court in this case nonetheless precluded the tenth circuit from considering the timeliness of wood petition.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,a state prisoner has one year to file a federal petition for habeas corpus relief,starting from the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.for a prisoner whose judgment became final before aedpa was enacted,the limitations period runs from the aedpa effective date april.see serrano williams.the clock is stopped,however,during the time the petitioner properly filed application for state postconviction relief is pending.day,at quoting d 
the state judgment against wood became final on direct review in early.see supra,at.wood time for filing a federal petition therefore began to run on the date of aedpa enactment,april,and expired on april,unless wood had a properly filed application for state postconviction relief pending in colorado state court during that period.wood maintains he had such an application pending on april,the rule c motion he filed in.that motion,wood asserts,remained pending thus continuing to suspend the clock until at least august,when he filed his second motion for postconviction relief in state court.the motion,the state does not contest,was properly filed.wood argues that this second motion further tolled the limitations period until february,exactly one year before he filed the federal petition at issue here.if wood is correct that his motion remained pending in state court from april until august,his federal petition would be timely.
in its preanswer response to wood petition,the state set forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations issue.it noted that wood time for filing a habeas petition began to run on april,when the aedpa became effective and that wood had until april,plus any tolling periods,to timely file his habeas petition.app.the state next identified the crucial question did wood state petition arrest the statute of limitations period from until,at.i t is certainly arguable,the state then asserted,that the postconviction motion was abandoned before and thus did not toll the aedpa statute of limitations at all.ibid.but rather than inviting a decision on the statute of limitations question,the state informed the district court it would not challenge wood petition on timeliness grounds instead,the state simply defended against wood double jeopardy and sixth amendment claims on the merits.
ordinarily in civil litigation,a statutory time limitation is forfeited if not raised in a defendant answer or in an amendment thereto.day,at citing fed.rules civ.proc.c,b,and a.see also habeas corpus rule b requiring the state to plead a statute of limitations defense in its answer an affirmative defense,once forfeited,is exclu ded from the case,wright miller,federal practice and procedure,ed,and,as a rule,can not be asserted on appeal.see day,at scalia,dissenting weinberger salfi,mccoy massachusetts inst.of technology,it is hornbook law that theories not raised squarely in the district court can not be surfaced for the first time on appeal.
in granberry greer,we recognized a modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited affirmative defense,at.the district court in granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the merits,at.on appeal,the state argued for the first time that the petition should be dismissed because the petitioner had failed to exhaust relief available in state court.ibid.see habeas corpus rule b listing failure to exhaust state remedies as a threshold bar to federal habeas relief.despite the state failure to raise the nonexhaustion argument in the district court,the seventh circuit accepted the argument and ruled for the state on that ground.we granted certiorari to decide whether a court of appeals has discretion to address a defense that the state failed to raise in the district court,at.
although express ing our reluctance to adopt rules that allow a party to withhold raising a defense until after the main event is over,at,we nonetheless concluded that the bar to court of appeals consideration of a forfeited habeas defense is not absolute,at.the exhaustion doctrine,we noted,is founded on concerns broader than those of the parties in particular,the doctrine fosters respectful,harmonious relations between the state and federal judiciaries,at.with that comity interest in mind,we held that federal appellate courts have discretion,in exceptional cases,to consider a nonexhaustion argument inadverten tly overlooked by the state in the district court,at,
in day,we affirmed a federal district court authority to consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances so warrant,at.there,the state miscalculated a time span,specifically,the number of days running between the finality of day conviction and the filing of his federal habeas petition,at.as a result,the state erroneously informed the district court that day petition was timely.ibid.a magistrate judge caught the state computation error and recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely,notwithstanding the state timeliness concession,at.the district court adopted the recommendation,and the court of appeals upheld the trial court sua sponte dismissal of the petition as untimely.ibid.
concluding that it would make scant sense to treat aedpa statute of limitations differently from other threshold constraints on federal habeas petitioners,we held that district courts are permitted,but not obliged,to consider,sua sponte,the timeliness of a state prisoner habeas petition.at ibid.noting that habeas corpus rule b places a statute of limitations defense on a par with failure to exhaust state remedies,a procedural bar,and.affording federal courts leeway to consider a forfeited timeliness defense was appropriate,we again reasoned,because aedpa statute of limitations,like the exhaustion doctrine,implicat es values beyond the concerns of the parties.day,at quoting acosta artuz,at the aedpa statute of limitation promotes judicial efficiency and conservation of judicial resources,safeguards the accuracy of state court judgments by requiring resolution of constitutional questions while the record is fresh,and lends to state court judgments within a reasonable time.internal quotation marks omitted.
we clarified,however,that a federal court does not have carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation basic to our adversary system.see greenlaw united states.only where the state does not strategically withh o ld the limitations defense or cho o se to relinquish it,and where the petitioner is accorded a fair opportunity to present his position,may a district court consider the defense on its own initiative and determine whether the interests of j
