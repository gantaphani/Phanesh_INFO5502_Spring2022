in this appeal from a month sentence based on appellant allen smith guilty plea,we explore the interrelationship of the fifth amendment due process requirement that a guilty plea be voluntary and the sixth amendment guarantee that an accused enjoy the assistance of counsel.
during the proceedings below,smith advised the district court that his relationship with counsel was irretrievably fractured and requested on several occasions that the district court appoint substitute counsel.the district court refused smith requests,peremptorily advising him,before fully exploring the reasons for the disharmony between smith and his counsel,that he had been appointed one lawyer,and one lawyer is your free limit.
eventually,smith entered into a plea agreement with the government and pled guilty the guilty plea hearing complied unerringly with the formalities dictated by federal rule of criminal procedure.nevertheless,by the time of the ensuing sentencing hearing,disputes between smith and his appointed counsel had reemerged,and smith again asked the district court to appoint substitute counsel.the district court refused.
before us on appeal now represented by substitute appointed counsel smith argues that his guilty plea was rendered involuntary by the court refusal of his request for substitute trial counsel and that,at sentencing,the court likewise erred when it denied his renewed request for substitution.we have carefully considered smith contentions and we conclude that,viewing all that transpired below,he has not made a substantial showing that his guilty plea was involuntary.this conclusion is based on our determination that the district court refusal to appoint substitute counsel did not,under the circumstances,deprive smith of the meaningful assistance of counsel.
similarly,we conclude that the district court subsequent refusal to grant smith request for substitution of counsel for purposes of the sentencing hearing did not violate smith rights,in light of all that had gone before its refusal and the circumstances of the sentencing hearing itself.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
smith was charged on february,in a indictment naming defendants with conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise,in violation of d,and conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances,in violation of.he was alleged to be a member of tree top pirus,a subset of the bloods gang.
the district court appointed a distinguished member of the federal trial bar to represent smith on march.the court ordered smith detained pending trial and,in light of the number of defendants joined in the indictment,it scheduled separate groupings of defendants for separate trials.smith was in the group assigned a trial date of july.
in february and march,smith wrote three letters to the district court complaining about his trial counsel representation.counsel had accepted the terms of the government discovery agreement a customary practice among the defense bar in the district,which precluded him from making copies of the discovery materials for smith to retain however,counsel and smith could review the materials at the detention facility where smith was being held.smith objected to this arrangement and expressed concerns in his first letters to the district court about potential collusion between his trial counsel and the prosecution.in his final letter,dated march,smith informed the court that his counsel was not very happy about smith prior correspondence with the court and had told smith to contact the court and ask that another lawyer be appointed.smith asked that the court possibly consider appointment of alternate counsel,worried that counsel was so mad my defense will be sabotaged.id.
despite smith evident dissatisfaction with his counsel,the latter was actively engaged in plea negotiations with the government on smith behalf before and after march.at some point during this period,the district court scheduled smith rearraignment for april.the government believed,based on its negotiations with smith counsel,that smith would enter a guilty plea pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure,pleading guilty to conspiracy to participate in a racketeering enterprise count one of the indictment in conformity with a written plea offer dated april.
instead,when court convened on april,smith immediately asked to address the court.he told the court that he could not go about signing this plea agreement with trial counsel not really representing me.he reported that counsel had called him an asshole for me asking him a question when they met just before the hearing,and he reiterated what he had expressed in his earlier letters to the court that he was not happy with my representation.id.the district court told smith one lawyer is your free limit and specifically instructed him that his choices in this matter were three learn to work with appointed trial counsel,hire a lawyer,or represent yourself.
the district judge then entered into a detailed discussion with smith about his complaints.when smith asserted that he had been ask ing counsel to do certain things to help me in this case,and he not doing it,the court inquired further.smith pointed to a petition for a writ of coram nobis that he wished counsel to file for him in order to challenge certain prior state court convictions,and counsel explained that he was investigating the factual predicates for such a petition the court decided to postpone the guilty plea proceedings to allow counsel to pursue coram nobis relief and to permit smith to consider hiring alternate counsel.
the rule hearing resumed thirteen days later on may.at that point,according to counsel statements at the hearing summarizing his course of dealing with smith over the period of his representation,he had met with smith at the allegany county detention center located approximately miles from baltimore four or five times and had conferred with the defendant in baltimore.earlier that day,smith and counsel had signed the plea agreement the government had offered on april.smith signed both the plea agreement and the separate factual stipulation under the following statement i am completely satisfied with the representation of my attorney.
during the plea colloquy which complied entirely with the dictates of rule,after smith had been placed under oath,the court asked smith about counsel representation,telling him,if you got a problem,you got to let me know about it now.smith replied that counsel was all right and that he,smith,was all good with it.id.yet smith was less than enthusiastic in his endorsement of counsel when the court asked if smith was currently satisfied with his services,smith replied,i have no choice but to be,your honor.i keeping it honest,your honor.emphasis supplied.as smith had explained moments before,i mean we had our ups and downs,but i here to go through with it today.when asked by the district court if they had worked out those ups and downs,smith replied,yes.id.
the court also asked smith why he was pleading guilty.smith initially said he was pleading so i wo have to get life and maintained that he was n o t guilty,but he immediately recanted and stated he was pleading guilty because i guilty.the court asked,well,which is it and smith repeated,i guilty.before the conclusion of the proceeding,the district court accepted smith guilty plea.
just before the hearing concluded,counsel volunteered to the court that,despite some disagreement and dissatisfaction on both sides earlier,he thought that he and smith were now back on track and that smith was satisfied that i doing everything that i can for him.
smith sentencing hearing was held on august.the hearing opened with a reference by defense counsel to an document he had forwarded to the district judge chambers,a memorandum in aid of sentencing,which smith had prepared with the assistance of a friend,not counsel.smith then spoke about his continuing problems with counsel 
l ast time i was here,if you notice,me and counsel,we ai getting along,and it still continuing i feel as though counsel ai got my best interests in representing me,and he just told me downstairs that he would let you know yourself sic that he withdrawing from being my counsel.
the court asked about the status of the coram nobis petition,and counsel explained that his research indicated that smith had waived his right to seek coram nobis relief by failing to timely apply for leave to appeal the prior convictions each based on smith guilty pleas as required under state law.counsel then detailed his last meeting with smith.
the two met on june,to discuss the presentence investigation report psr,but the conversation quickly turned to the coram nobis petition.counsel stated that smith then became belligerent and correctional officers interceded,ending the meeting.counsel sent the probation office a letter regarding the exceptions smith had raised about the portions of the psr that were discussed before the meeting ended he had copied smith on the letter and told smith to review the remainder of the report and to inform the probation office directly of any further exceptions.counsel told the court that he had not conducted any further review of the psr with smith and that smith was planning to again ask for the appointment of substitute counsel.in that context,counsel wished to say to the court that i do believe that our relationship,such as it has ever been,has obviously broken down to the point where we are not able to sit down and have a rational,reasonable discussion about this case and about the issues in this case.
after counsel apprised the court of the situation,smith did,in fact,again request substitute counsel,and the court again told smith his only choices were to hire an attorney,to proceed with the same appointed counsel,or to represent himself.smith explained that he was unable to retain private counsel and incapable of representing himself,and no more was said about smith representation.
the court asked smith about the psr smith told the court that he had read the report and that the only objection that i ever had to it was that it failed to consolidate certain prior convictions.he also corrected a sentence that mistakenly reported that he had requested placement in a mental health program,when he had instead asked for a drug treatment program.just before the sentencing hearing,smith had given counsel a letter confirming smith participation in the creating lasting family connections program at the allegany county detention center and a certificate of completion from a men issues group,also at the detention center,both of which counsel presented to the court.
smith said a few words about asking for another chance,being a father to my kids,and explained that he really ha d d one anything,he had just been around the wrong crowd.the court then sentenced smith to months of incarceration,the bottom of the applicable advisory sentencing guidelines offense range,noting that twelve and a half years was appropriate given that,among other things,smith had suffered multiple gunshots on two distinct occasions and still had not been dissuaded from a life of drug crime.
smith brought a timely appeal challenging both his guilty plea and his sentence.though the plea agreement stated that smith would waive the right to appeal any sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range,the government has elected not to enforce that provision.united states attar,cir noting general appeal waiver did not waive defendant right to appeal his sentence on the ground that the proceedings following the entry of his guilty plea were conducted in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel.after filing a notice of appeal on behalf of smith as specifically instructed by the district court,counsel moved to withdraw as appellate counsel.we granted counsel motion and appointed substitute counsel.
on appeal smith alleges that his guilty plea was involuntary because the district court erroneously denied his requests for substitute counsel,an error that left him bereft of the assistance of counsel at the time of plea negotiations and of his actual guilty plea.separately,he argues that,as a result of the district court erroneous denial of his renewed request at the sentencing hearing,he was likewise effectively denied the assistance of counsel at sentencing.we conclude for the reasons set forth within that smith contentions do not entitle him to relief.
before reaching the merits of smith involuntariness claim,we first address the issue of wavier,which is urged on us by the government.the government argues that,because smith never objected to the rule colloquy or moved to strike his guilty plea,we may review the voluntariness of his plea only for plain error.br.of appellee,at.but here smith claims that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was denied his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel not owing to some defect in the actual rule proceeding.smith raised this substitution issue multiple times with the district court,first in letters prior to his rearraignment and then twice orally in the course of the subsequent hearings.though of course he did not challenge the guilty plea itself on this ground his claim is precisely that he lacked the sort of lawyerly advice that would have advised him to do so he did inform the court,at the first opportunity in open court,at the original rule hearing on april,that he felt it would be inappropriate to sign the plea agreement without meaningful representation.see h ow can i go about signing this plea with counsel not really representing me.
the federal rules of criminal procedure provide that a party preserves a claim when it inform s the court when the court ruling or order is made or sought of the act the party wishes the court to take,and the rules specifically provide that i f a party does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order,the absence of an objection does not later prejudice that party.b.see also united states hanno,cir reading rule to require a meaningful opportunity to make a contemporaneous objection united states vonner,cir requiring a meaningful opportunity.
the government suggests that smith could only have preserved the issue by moving in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea,but requiring such a later motion in the circumstances of this case would exceed the requirements of rule b,which has been characterized as a rule.united states burrell,cir quoting puckett united states,d.as the eighth circuit noted,t he opportunity to object language would be meaningless if the mere ability to file a motion for reconsideration qualified as an opportunity to object.id.where smith raised the underlying issue repeatedly with the court,specifically attempting to protect his rights and place the issue on the record for future use if necessary,he has not waived the issue of the voluntariness of his guilty plea by failing to renew the objection as he entered that plea.mcmann richardson,d recognizing that the guilty plea is properly open to challenge where defendant was uncounseled 
of course,sixth amendment claims are most often brought in petitions for relief.our precedents make it clear,however,that we will consider even ineffectiveness claims the most of the bunch when they are not waived and when we need not look beyond the trial court record brought before us in a direct appeal.united states baldovinos,cir united states russell,cir united states cronic,d.in this case,the factual basis for smith particularized sixth amendment claim lies completely within the record before us and the claim has been preserved as the district court seemingly acknowledged,in that it instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal on smith behalf,notwithstanding the appeal waiver in the plea agreement it had accepted.accordingly,smith claim is appropriately before us on direct appeal and plain error review of his involuntariness claim does not apply.
because smith contends that the district court erroneous denial of his substitution request rendered his plea involuntary,there remains some uncertainty as to the proper standard of review.although we have said that we review a lower court ruling on a motion to substitute counsel for abuse of discretion,see united states reevey,cir,t ypically,we review the voluntariness of a guilty plea de novo,united states general,cir,considering all of the relevant circumstances surrounding it.brady united states,d.the government argues in this case that we should proceed under an abuse of discretion standard while smith simply cites both standards of review and chooses not to wade any further into the murky water.to select the proper standard of review,we must first untangle the relationship between the alleged involuntariness of smith guilty plea and the underlying denial of his request for the appointment of substitute counsel.this task requires that we first identify the source of the right to substitute counsel.
we have sometimes suggested that a defendant sixth amendment right to be appointed substitute counsel is to be derived from the right to be afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure counsel of his own choosing.united states gallop,cir.but later cases have indicated that the right to counsel of choice does not extend to defendants who require counsel to be appointed for them.united states gonzalez lopez,d.rather,as the limitations we have placed on the right to substitution indicate,the right to appointment of substitute counsel must spring directly from the indigent defendant right to counsel recognized in gideon wainwright,d.
our review of claims has focused on three inquiries the timeliness of the motion the adequacy of the court subsequent inquiry and whether the conflict was so great that it had resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.gallop,at accord reevey,at quoting gallop.as to that last inquiry,a total lack of communication is not required rather an examination of whether the extent of the breakdown prevents the ability to conduct an adequate defense is the necessary inquiry.united states johnson,cir.thus,we have been concerned not with the indigent defendant freedom of choice or with whether the attorney and his client have a meaningful relationship,morris slappy,d,but with a breakdown of communication so great that the principal purpose of the appointment the mounting of an adequate defense incident to a fair trial has been frustrated.in short,the defendant sixth amendment right to successor appointed counsel arises because the initial appointment has ceased to constitute sixth amendment assistance of counsel 
as justice sutherland famously explained in powell alabama,
the right to be heard would be,in many cases,of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel even the intelligent and educated layman lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense,even though he have a perfect one.he requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.
these poignant words make plain that only when a defendant is heard by counsel can a defendant be heard through counsel.the mere physical presence of competent counsel is not enough it is the marriage of the attorney legal knowledge and mature judgment with the defendant factual knowledge that makes for an adequate defense.indeed,the text of the amendment makes this clear.the sixth amendment guarantees the provision not simply of counsel,but of the assistance of counsel for the accused defence.const.amend.vi emphasis added.united states cronic,d if no actual assistance for the accused defence is provided,then the constitutional guarantee has been violated.emphasis added gonzalez lopez,at alito,dissenting the assistance of counsel clause focuses on what a defendant is entitled to receive assistance,rather than on the identity of the provider.where a defendant communication with an appointed attorney has so frayed that a court determines the mounting of an adequate defense to be impossible,the defendant is neither be ing heard by counsel nor receiving the assistance of counsel for his defence.
though substitution and ineffectiveness claims are of course distinct,a line of ineffectiveness cases informs our understanding of the right to substitution.the court recognized in cronic that a per se sixth amendment violation may arise where,although counsel is available to assist the accused during trial,the likelihood that any lawyer,even a fully competent one,could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.id.at.by the same token,when a breakdown in communication is so severe that it prevents even the ability to conduct an adequate defense,johnson,at emphasis added that is,when the likelihood of defense counsel providing effective assistance is so small the court finds it to be virtually nil the assistance provided by defense counsel is fatally compromised.more than a warm body is required to satisfy the sixth amendment.united states ex rel thomas,cir the sixth amendment right to counsel,of course,guarantees more than just a warm body to stand next to the accused during critical stages of the proceedings.and,this is true whether counsel is retained or appointed.
though the supreme court has not had occasion to decide such a case,one of our sister circuits has.the sixth circuit has found per se sixth amendment violations in three cases,and it has emphasized in each case that counsel ability to discuss the matter with the defendant was sharply limited.see united states morris,cir holding appointment of counsel just before the preliminary examination,allowing only an extremely short time period during which to meet with a defendant in the bull pen cell which lacked privacy and thereby prohibit ed counsel from having a confidential,privileged conversation with the client before the hearing amounted to a per se sixth amendment violation under cronic mitchell mason,cir reversing district court denial of habeas where no effort to consult with the defendant was made by counsel,who met with the defendant for only six minutes across three meetings in the bull pen,and where counsel was suspended from practicing law during the month preceding trial hunt mitchell,cir reversing denial of habeas where counsel was required to proceed to voir dire without ever discussing the case with his client and without conducting any discovery or independent investigation of the facts.though morris and hunt centered on late appointments,mason hinged almost entirely on counsel failure to communicate with the defendant the defense counsel in mason was appointed seven months before trial,and the court simply cited the attorney suspension from law during the month prior to trial as another fact contribut ing to the weight of the evidence that demonstrates that there was no consultation between defendant and his attorney prior to trial.mason,at.the sixth circuit found this to constitute constructive denial of counsel under cronic and consequently presumed prejudice.id.at.
to be sure,we have cautioned against broaden ing the prejudice exception to strickland,warning that it would add an extra layer of litigiousness to ineffective assistance law.glover miro,cir.in that case,we were concerned that courts would not regard trials through a particularized lens but rather through some presumption of prejudice.id.at.indeed,we emphasized that our concern applied especially to state trials on federal collateral review,where the court is far removed from the realities of the representation.id.this concern is mitigated in the substitution context,as we are concerned only with cases in which a court has already made a specific factual determination or,in a proper case,clearly erred in failing so to find that communication between a given defendant and attorney had so broken down that an adequate defense could not be maintained 
the ninth circuit has already found that the erroneous denial of a substitution motion amounts to the constructive denial of counsel.as the court held in daniels woodford,cir 
where a criminal defendant has,with legitimate reason,completely lost trust in his attorney,and the trial court refuses to remove the attorney,the defendant is constructively denied counsel.this is true even where the breakdown is a result of the defendant refusal to speak to counsel,unless the defendant refusal to cooperate demonstrates unreasonable contumacy.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in the very case that formulated the three factors we use in substitution analysis,brown craven,our sister circuit noted that to compel one charged with grievous crime to undergo trial with the assistance of an attorney with whom he has become embroiled in irreconcilable conflict is to deprive him of the effective assistance of any counsel whatsoever,cir.for the foregoing reasons,we agree.
as the above discussion makes plain,the standard of review we began to develop in gallop requires further elaboration.the district court is far better situated than we are to observe and inquire into the state of the relationship between a defendant and his appointed counsel,and thus,where the district court has met its obligation to inquire thoroughly into the factual basis of defendant dissatisfaction,united states mullen,cir,we apply the ordinary standard of review to its factual findings clear error.see,united states foster,cir we review de novo the legal conclusion of the district court,but review for clear error the district court underlying factual findings.
once a district court has determined that defendant and his counsel communication has so deteriorated as to prevent the mounting of an adequate defense,however,an appointment of substitute counsel is part and parcel of a defendant sixth amendment right the decision is not committed to the district court discretion 
of course,as we noted in gallop,a district court must consider the timeliness of defendant request when determining whether the conflict complained of is genuine or merely a transparent plot to bring about delay.at see,united states kemache webster,d,wl.april.district court,having appointed substitute counsel after defendant first request,and then having appointed after defendant second request,denied defendant third substitution request upon finding that defendant may be motivated in his repeated attempts to obtain new counsel by a desire to delay his trial.
likewise,a district court may consider whether a purported breakdown in communication is,in fact,another such dilatory tactic.even if a breakdown is genuine,after granting one or more substitution motions a court may well decline to grant further motions if it finds that yet another substitution would not remedy the problem.in such a case,it can not be said that a defendant did not have the assistance of counsel for his defence,const.art.vi emphasis added,though defendant obstinacy may have frustrated it.see,united states detemple,cir finding no error in district court refusal to permit fourth appointed counsel to withdraw,and noting that a court can properly refuse a request for substitution of counsel when the defendant own behavior creates the problem.united states morsley,cir finding no error in district court refusal to permit withdrawal of second appointed attorney after first appointed attorney was allowed to withdraw.
here the district court refused smith first substitution request,and there is no indication in the record before us,nor has the government ever suggested,that smith conflict with his appointed trial counsel was a deliberate tactical maneuver.thus,in determining whether smith sixth amendment right to substitution was violated,we simply ask whether communication had so broken down as to prevent the mounting of an adequate defense.
before we can do so,we must determine the effect of smith interceding guilty plea.we said in united states moussaoui,that w hen a defendant pleads guilty,he waives all nonjurisdictional defects in the proceedings conducted prior to entry of the plea,and thus has no ground upon which to attack that judgment except the inadequacy of the plea,cir internal quotation marks omitted.and so,having unraveled smith embedded substitution claim,we turn now to its relationship to his contention that,as a result of the allegedly wrongful denial of his request for substitute counsel,his guilty plea was rendered involuntary.
to be valid,a guilty plea must be a knowing,intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.brady,at.the supreme court expressly noted in brady that an intelligent assessment of the relative advantages of pleading guilty is frequently impossible without the assistance of an attorney,which is why it is clear that a guilty plea to a felony charge entered without counsel and without a waiver of counsel is invalid.id.at.this is so because a guilty plea can not be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.mccarthy united states,d.in brady,the supreme court held the defendant guilty plea voluntary even though the law promised him a lesser maximum penalty if he did not go to trial.at.the brady court reasoned that the possibly coercive impact of a promise of leniency could be dissipated by the presence and advice of counsel.at.indeed,the court compared the case to miranda,where t he presence of counsel was held the adequate protective device necessary to counteract the coerciveness of police interrogation.id.at quoting miranda arizona,d.where there has been a breakdown in communication between defendant and defense counsel such that the mounting of an adequate defense would be impossible,this protective device is absent.
we held in moussaoui that violations of a defendant fifth and sixth amendment rights to obtain counsel of choice,to proceed pro se,and to be present during critical stages of the proceedings,among others,did not give rise to structural error and did not render his guilty plea involuntary,since,after defendant had submit ted to an unconstitutional trial,he could seek an appellate remedy for the constitutional violations if convicted.at.
but moussaoui does not extend so far as to shield from challenge the total absence of the assistance of counsel.it is well settled that the denial of assistance of counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings is constitutional error not subject to a prejudice inquiry.cronic,at.moussaoui itself recognized this,noting that 
i n unusual circumstances,a defendant may obtain reversal of his conviction based on the inadequacy of counsel even in the absence of a showing that would satisfy hill or strickland.such a constructive denial of counsel results from circumstances where the performance of counsel is so inadequate that,in effect,no assistance of counsel is provided at all.cronic,at.
at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the actual or constructive denial of counsel constitutes the type of structural defect that def ies analysis by standards because it affects the framework within which the trial proceeds or a guilty plea is negotiated,and is not simply an error in the trial process itself.gonzalez lopez,at internal quotation marks omitted.structural errors deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial can not reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.neder united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.to contend that the lack of assistance of counsel is made unassailable by an uncounseled plea would be unfathomable.
furthermore,smith does not simply argue,like the appellant in moussaoui,that his plea was coerced because he would otherwise have been forced to continue to a trial that violated his sixth amendment rights.rather,smith argues that his plea was invalid because,as an effectively uncounseled plea,it was not a knowing,intelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences.brady,at.if the advice of counsel falls below the minimum required by the sixth amendment,the guilty plea can not be deemed knowing and voluntary,and i t is clear that a constructive denial of counsel falls short of the minimum requirements of the sixth amendment.childress johnson,cir cited with approval in moussaoui,at,for applying cronic to the guilty plea context.neither moussaoui reasoning nor its result does anything to disturb this fundamental constitutional requirement of a valid guilty plea.
thus,if smith could show that he was denied his sixth amendment right to the appointment of a substitute and thus constructively denied counsel,then that protective device was functionally absent and he would establish that his guilty plea was involuntary.as a constitutionally compelled finding of involuntariness would immediately follow from the underlying sixth amendment violation,the fact that we t ypically review the voluntariness of a guilty plea de novo,united states general,cir,cert.denied,d,is of no moment,as a distinct voluntariness inquiry is not necessary in the context of a constructive denial of counsel.inversely,if the denial of smith request for substitution is found not to violate his sixth amendment right to the assistance of counsel,it is difficult to imagine that his conflict with counsel would so taint the guilty plea as to make it involuntary.but in the rare case in which such a claim might be cognizable on direct review,we would separately consider the voluntariness of the plea and review any preserved objection de novo,considering all of the relevant circumstances surrounding it,brady,at,as guided by the prescriptions of federal rule of criminal procedure.
mindful of the above principles,and reviewing the whole record in the case at bar,we find that smith establishes neither a sixth amendment violation nor the involuntariness of his guilty plea.though there was undoubtedly considerable conflict between smith and counsel,and although the district court erred in telling smith he had been appointed one lawyer,and one lawyer is your free limit,the evidence here does not establish that smith was constructively without counsel when considering the government plea offer and then entering his guilty plea.because we find counsel continued to provide meaningful assistance to smith prior to and during the plea hearing,neither do we find that this conflict independently tainted the plea.as smith raises no other ground on which we might find involuntariness,we affirm his conviction.
smith and counsel appear to have argued before the initial rule hearing over counsel discovery agreement with the government and the likely success of a petition for a writ of coram nobis,and counsel seems to have informed smith that he could and perhaps should request the appointment of substitute counsel if he wished.smith expressed concern in his letters to the court that counsel was angry with him and might sabotage his defense,but such fears alone do not establish a breakdown in communication.
the district court inquired into the source of the conflict at both the initial rule hearing and again two weeks later,when the hearing was resumed.though best practice would include an express finding on the record about the state of communication between defendant and counsel best developed in an colloquy in the absence of government counsel,it is clear from the colloquies here that communication had not yet fractured to the point where mounting an adequate defense would have been frustrated.according to counsel uncontested statements at the later rearraignment hearing,counsel had visited smith in detention either four or five times,in addition to meetings in the courthouse,and at the time of the plea,smith and counsel were on speaking terms.
before smith plea,the district court told smith,if you got a problem,you got to let me know about it now,and smith replied that counsel was all right and that he,smith,was all good with it.smith explained,i mean we had our ups and downs,but i here to go through with the plea today.id.the court specifically asked if the two had worked out those ups and downs,and smith replied,yes.id.as counsel told the court at that hearing,the pair had weathered some disagreement and dissatisfaction earlier and were now back on track.he told the court that smith was satisfied that i doing everything that i can for him.
smith can point to no evidence of a conclusive break with counsel before his plea,and evidence of disagreements that were resolved before the plea does not establish a breakdown of communication.thus,smith contention that his guilty plea was involuntary fails.
we look next to smith claim that the district court erred in denying his renewed request for substitute counsel at sentencing.as explained above,we consider the adequacy of the court inquiry into the defendant complaint,gallop,at,and,most crucially,determine whether the extent of the breakdown in communication prevent ed the ability to conduct an adequate defense,johnson,at.we review the district court factual findings concerning the state of that communication for clear error.
we first consider the extent of the court inquiry into the conflict.as we explained in mullen,w hen a defendant raises a seemingly substantial complaint about counsel,the judge has an obligation to inquire thoroughly into the factual basis of defendant dissatisfaction.at.though we are reviewing only the court refusal to appoint substitute counsel at the sentencing hearing,we consider the adequacy of the court investigation throughout since smith request had been a continuing one from the beginning of the proceedings.
at the rule hearings,the district court repeatedly asked both smith and counsel about their problems.at the initial hearing,after smith complained that he had ask ed counsel to do certain things to help me in this case,and he not doing it,the judge asked,what do you want him to do.smith explained that he wanted counsel to file a petition for a writ of coram nobis,and the court,after an extended aside suggesting that smith was angry about the poor legal position he was in rather than with counsel representation,then questioned counsel about the petition at some length.
at the resumed hearing two weeks later,during the plea colloquy,the court asked smith if counsel had answered all of your questions,done anything you told him not to do,or refused to do something that you told him to do.the judge warned smith to s peak now or forever hold your peace,and told him i f you got a problem,you got to let me know about it now.smith replied,i mean sometimes,i mean,i mean he all right.i all good with it,and then told the court,i mean we had our ups and downs,but i here to go through with it today.the court followed up by asking if smith and counsel had worked out those ups and downs,and smith said they had.when the judge then asked if smith was currently satisfied with counsel services,smith told him,i have no choice but to be,your honor.i keeping it honest,your honor.the court asked a final question,if counsel had done something you did want him to do,and when smith answered that he had,it moved on.
less inquiry was needed at the sentencing hearing,as the state of smith relationship with counsel was to the court.at the beginning of the sentencing hearing,held on august,counsel explained that he had last met with smith on june a affair that was shortly broken up by correctional officers after smith became belligerent and last contacted him via letter on june.counsel told the court that i do believe that our relationship,such as it has ever been,has obviously broken down to the point where we are not able to sit down and have a rational,reasonable discussion about this case and about the issues in this case.
the court did inquire about the state of smith coram nobis petition counsel explained that smith had waived his right to seek such relief by failing to seek leave to appeal his prior convictions,and that this news was the cause of the last altercation between them on june.the court also asked smith whether he had reviewed his psr,and smith confirmed that he had.and when smith addressed the court to again ask for appointment of substitute counsel,complaining that counsel gave smith family attitude,d id call them back,and d id do anything smith asked him to do,the court interrupted to ask,what did you ask him to do.smith reply did not raise any significant new issues,and the court ended its questioning there.
as the source of contention the coram nobis petition had been thoroughly discussed at
