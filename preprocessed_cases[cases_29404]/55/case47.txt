the united states appeals the decision of the district court to vacate and merge several of douglas kennedy counts of conviction.a jury convicted kennedy in july of crimes related to his possession with intent to distribute narcotics and his possession of two handguns.at the initial sentencing,the district court granted kennedy motion for a new trial with respect to four counts of conviction.we reversed on appeal.on our limited remand for only,the district court sua sponte found certain counts of conviction multiplicitous and vacated another count on the basis that its own jury charge was plainly erroneous.we will vacate the district court judgment,once again reinstate all counts of conviction,and remand for resentencing.regrettably,we find it necessary to direct the chief judge of the united states district court for the district of new jersey to reassign this case,and all related matters,to a different district court judge on remand.
in october and november,drug enforcement administration agents discovered a heroin distribution network operating out of a house in clifton,new jersey.the agents obtained information from wiretapped cell phone conversations that members of the network intended to make a sale at a burger king restaurant in newark,new jersey on november.at the appointed hour,agents monitoring the burger king observed two individuals from the clifton house arrive in a livery cab.a black cadillac automobile with tinted windows soon pulled into the parking lot.carrying a red shopping bag with bricks of heroin a woman exited the livery cab,got into the back seat of the cadillac,then returned to the cab with a brown bag containing in cash.as the vehicles left,agents tracked the cadillac to a house in irvington,new jersey,and watched kennedy exit from the driver seat and enter the house.parked in the driveway at the irvington house was a green lincoln navigator automobile.
based in part on these observations,agents obtained a search warrant for the house in clifton.the search uncovered in cash,large quantities of heroin stored in bags that resembled the red shopping bag seen in the burger king transaction,and equipment used to process and package heroin.agents also seized a ledger that recorded heroin transactions,and in particular listed the november transaction.esther grullon,who was present in the clifton house at the time of the search,quickly agreed to cooperate with the government.she admitted that she took part in the burger king transaction with kennedy,who,she reported,was the driver of the cadillac.one week earlier,she revealed,kennedy and another man met her at the same burger king to purchase a separate order of bricks of heroin.
armed with evidence of kennedy involvement in the drug ring,agents went to the irvington residence to conduct surveillance the next morning,november.when they arrived,the black cadillac was parked in the driveway,but the lincoln navigator was gone.kennedy drove up to the house in the lincoln some time later.agents approached him,confirmed that he lived in the irvington house,and placed him under arrest.they then obtained his consent to search the house,the cadillac,and the lincoln.inside the home they found in cash,ammunition,and a bag containing grams of crack cocaine.over the course of the search,kennedy admitted that the bag of cocaine was his and that he was paid to transport the red shopping bag in the november burger king transaction.
agents seized both vehicles and moved them to a secure location for a search by other agents and a dog.hidden under the center console of the lincoln,they discovered,was a secret compartment containing a loaded handgun and four glassine envelopes with grams of heroin.the brand stamped on the envelopes did not match the brands of heroin sold from the house in clifton.the search did not uncover weapons or drugs inside the cadillac.a year later,however,in november,an employee performing routine maintenance on the cadillac noticed abnormally loose wiring and a suspicious construction of the side panels on the center console.he dislodged one of the panels,exposing a secret compartment that had been overlooked in the first search of the cadillac.inside,agents found a second loaded handgun and bricks of heroin.this heroin weighed grams and bore a brand stamp that matched a stamp used by grullon and the other clifton distributors.
on january,a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging kennedy with two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute,in violation of a,b b,b c,and,as well as one count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon,in violation of g.the matter was assigned to an able,hardworking,and respected district judge of the united states district court for the district of new jersey.
at the arraignment,the assistant united states attorney ausa detailed kennedy sentencing exposure,but emphasized that the recently uncovered evidence of the second gun and drugs in the cadillac portended significantly greater exposure.the ausa stated that if the parties did not reach a plea agreement,the government planned to seek a superseding indictment charging kennedy with two violations of c.if proven,those charges alone would subject kennedy to a mandatory years in prison,to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.see c a i setting a mandatory minimum for a violation of the statute,c c i setting a year mandatory minimum for a second or subsequent conviction under the statute.
when plea negotiations faltered,the government sought and obtained a superseding indictment on march,and a second superseding indictment on may.the latter indictment contained eight counts.count charged that from october,to november,kennedy conspired with others to distribute and possess with intent to distribute grams or more of a substance containing heroin,in violation of.count,which referred to the heroin found in the lincoln,charged possession with intent to distribute a quantity of heroin in violation of a and b c,and.count charged possession of a firearm in furtherance of the intended distribution of the heroin discovered in the lincoln,in violation of c and.count,which referred to the heroin found in the cadillac,charged possession with intent to distribute grams or more of heroin in violation of a and b b,and.count charged possession of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy count and in furtherance of the intended distribution of the heroin discovered in the cadillac count,in violation of c and.count,which referred to the cocaine found in the irvington home,charged possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base in violation of a and b b,and.count,which referred to the gun found in the lincoln,charged possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of g.count,which referred to the gun found in the cadillac,charged possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in violation of g.
the district court held a jury trial.after the close of evidence but before summations,and without the jury present,the court addressed kennedy and his family present in the courtroom.explaining that he has never had this conversation with a defendant before,the judge warned kennedy that,if he were to be convicted on all charges,the court will have absolutely no discretion and no choice but to impose a year sentence.app.the judge walked through the extremely different options facing kennedy either plead guilty and serve an appropriate punishment or risk a verdict that would result in spending the rest of his life in jail and maybe never coming out because he be an old man.id.at.kennedy elected to proceed with the trial.the next day,on july,the jury found him guilty on all counts.
kennedy attorney did not seek relief or file a notice of appeal within the time allotted by the federal rules.on october,kennedy filed a pro se motion requesting appointment of new counsel.the district court granted the motion on november.on november,kennedy counsel moved for a new trial,arguing that the failure to move for a new trial within the period prescribed by the rules was excusable neglect.see.b,b b.through the motion,kennedy contended that he had been denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney did not seek suppression of the gun and drugs found in the cadillac.moreover,he argued,his conviction was unlawful because the second superseding indictment improperly joined counts and both of which involved contraband found in the lincoln to the remaining counts,which concerned the cadillac and the conspiracy.see.a.alternatively,he theorized,the evidence adduced at trial proved the existence of two unrelated conspiracies and thus impermissibly varied from the indictment,which charged a single conspiracy.
on june,before ruling on the motion or proceeding to sentencing,the district court held a status conference.the judge told kennedy that o ne of the only ways that you can release the court from imposing th e mandatory minimum is if you were to be able to provide cooperation to the government in some form.app.when discussions between kennedy and the government bore no fruit,the district court scheduled sentencing for august,more than two years after the date of conviction.
the court began the august hearing by focusing on the pending motion for a new trial.over the government objection,it found excusable neglect because trial counsel effectively abandoned kennedy after the conviction.turning to the merits,the court rejected kennedy misjoinder and variance arguments but found the ineffective assistance of counsel claim convincing.trial counsel failure to question the validity of kennedy consent to the searches and his decision not to seek suppression of the cadillac gun and drugs on grounds,the district court ruled,amounted to constitutionally deficient representation finding that counsel deficiency resulted in prejudicial convictions,the district court granted kennedy motion for a new trial with respect to counts,and all counts that were premised on the gun and drugs seized from the cadillac.on the remaining counts of conviction counts,and the district court imposed a year term of incarceration,the minimum sentence authorized by congress.see c a a,b b iii.
kennedy appealed and the government.we affirmed the district court rejection of kennedy misjoinder argument and his effort to attain a new trial on all eight counts.united states kennedy kennedy i.cir.we held,however,that the district court made two mistakes of law in its analysis of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim first,it erred in finding kennedy trial counsel constitutionally deficient by incorrectly placing upon the government the burden to show that counsel was effective and by ignoring the possibility that counsel decision not to mount a attack was strategic.second,it neglected to address in its discussion of prejudice whether kennedy would have prevailed in a motion to suppress the cadillac evidence.based on the trial record,we concluded,kennedy failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.we therefore reversed the grant of a new trial on counts,and and remanded for only.id.at.
the district court did not immediately set the matter for resentencing after we issued our mandate.instead,in anticipation of resentencing,it invited the parties to brief three issues whether counts and were multiplicitous whether it was plain error to use language in the jury charge on count and whether the jury charge was inconsistent with richardson united states,d.app.the government submitted a sentencing memorandum that argued that only the multiplicity issue could be considered at sentencing all other issues,it said,fell outside the mandate and were otherwise beyond the court power to raise on its own initiative.it also disputed the issues on the merits.kennedy did not submit briefing in anticipation of resentencing and did not file a second motion for a new trial.
the parties convened for resentencing on december.after a lengthy colloquy with the ausa,the district court announced that,even though it had not requested briefing on the matter,it would merge counts and the counts into a single count and likewise merge counts and the counts into a single count.the court explained that these sets of counts,which distinguished between contraband found in the lincoln and contraband found in the cadillac,charged kennedy twice for single,undifferentiated offenses.the court also vacated the jury verdict on count,the second charge under c.having amended the counts of conviction in this way,the district court resentenced kennedy to years in prison on the remaining counts.see c a a,b b iii.
three days later,the district court issued a memorandum opinion that set forth its reasoning.united states kennedy kennedy ii,wl.endeavoring to apply a plain error standard of review,it began with its multiplicity rulings on counts and,the g convictions.the court identified as controlling authority united states tann,which held that the allowable unit of prosecution under g is the incident of possession and that possession of two firearms seized at the same time in the same location supports only one conviction and sentence under g,cir.because kennedy gun in the cadillac and his gun in the lincoln were within eyeshot of one another,the district court found that kennedy had simultaneously possessed both firearms.kennedy ii,wl,at.to remedy the multiplicity,it merged counts and into count.
the district court next found that count,which charged possession with intent to distribute under a for the heroin in the lincoln,and count,which charged possession with intent to distribute under a for the heroin in the cadillac,also were impermissibly multiplicitous.punctuating its analysis for emphasis,it reasoned that both stashes of heroin were seized by the police in a common operation working from a single surveillance post and were seized at the same time and at the same street address.id.at emphases in original.from this,the district court concluded that counts and also imposed cumulative punishment.accordingly,it merged both counts into count 
having merged counts and and counts and,the district court next concluded that it must also merge counts and,the counts brought under c.as charged and tried,those counts relied on distinct predicate crimes.count,which charged possession of the lincoln handgun,furthered the intended distribution of the heroin found in the lincoln count.and count,which charged possession of the cadillac handgun,furthered the intended distribution or conspiracy to distribute the heroin found in the cadillac counts.now that counts and had been merged into a coterminous predicate offense,the district court reasoned,controlling precedent permitted punishment for only one c count.id.at citing united states diaz,cir.
recognizing that its rationale with regard to count made sense only insofar as it assumed that the jury believed that kennedy used the cadillac handgun in furtherance of count,but not count,the district court pivoted to consider the propriety of the jury charge on count.it focused on the portion of the instruction that permitted the jury to convict if it found that kennedy used the cadillac handgun in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in count the distribution charged in count.this language,reasoned the district court,might have led some jurors to conclude that kennedy used the cadillac gun in furtherance of the intended heroin distribution charged in count,while others might have concluded that kennedy used the cadillac gun in furtherance of the heroin conspiracy charged in count.even though the jurors unanimously found kennedy guilty on counts and and received a general unanimity instruction,the district court reasoned,they might not have agreed unanimously on which predicate crime supported kennedy conviction in count because the court did not give a unanimity instruction specific to the count.analogizing to richardson united states,d,a case that did not interpret c it held that the predicate crimes in a c charge are elements of the crime,and that the language of the charge prevented anyone from knowing whether the jury unanimously agreed on the predicate crime.this,the district court concluded,was not harmless error,and in fact was plain error.to remedy the mistake,the court vacated kennedy conviction on count and declined to impose the year mandatory sentence prescribed by c c i.
the government filed this timely appeal 
this is our second encounter with this case.the mandate in our first opinion instructed the district court,on remand,to conduct only.kennedy i.at.the government argues that the district court ignored that directive when it vacated kennedy conviction in count.we must agree.
from the earliest days of the republic,and continuing through today,the supreme court has consistently held that an inferior court has no power or authority to deviate from the mandate issued by an appellate court.briggs.citing ex parte sibbald united states,pet.boyce ex rs grundy,pet.the santa maria,wheat.himely rose,cranch.see also in re sanford fork tool.as the court explained in ex parte sibbald united states,
whatever was before the court,and is disposed of,is considered as finally settled.the inferior court is bound by the decree as the law of the case and must carry it into execution,according to the mandate.they can not vary it,or examine it for any other purpose than execution or give any other or further relief or review it upon any matter decided on appeal for error apparent or intermeddle with it,further than to settle so much as has been remanded.
at.the principle,as firmly ingrained as it is fundamental to our hierarchical system of justice,has remained essentially unchanged in nearly one hundred fifty years.casey planned parenthood of se,cir.by now,i t is axiomatic that on remand for further proceedings after a decision by an appellate court,the trial court must proceed in accordance with the mandate and the law of the case as established on appeal.bankers trust bethlehem steel,cir.a trial court must implement both the letter and spirit of the mandate,taking into account the appellate court opinion and the circumstances it embraces.id.
this mandate rule serves important purposes.it preserves the proper allocation of authority within the tiered federal court structure set up by congress and the constitution.casey,at litman.mut.life ins,cir.it promotes predictability and finality by notifying parties of the matters that remain open on remand and committing the rest to final resolution.and it safeguards stability in the administration of justice,for the orderly functioning of the judiciary would no doubt crumble if trial judges were free to disregard appellate rulings.see litman,at post mandate maneuvering in the district courts would undermine the authority of appellate courts and create a great deal of uncertainty in the judicial process.hutto davis,d u nless we wish anarchy to prevail within the federal judicial system,a precedent of this court must be followed by the lower federal courts no matter how misguided the judges of those courts may think it to be.
we must examine whether the district court adhered to the mandate in our first opinion or whether it ventured beyond its authority after we remanded for resentencing,the district court did not consult the mandate or attempt to discern its scope.before merging counts of conviction and finding error in the jury charge for count,it made a generalized claim of latitude and discretion to modify the jury verdict in the course of resentencing kennedy.app.but it gave no explanation as to how those issues were germane to resentencing and declined to grapple with the government argument that the mandate curtailed its power to reconsider jury instructions.had it done so,it could not have avoided the limited scope of the mandate,which directed the district court to undertake only.kennedy i.at.our use of the word only was not typical,nor was it accidental.most often,when we find error that necessitates resentencing,we remand for resentencing,expecting that the district court will attend to resentencing and nothing more.by qualifying our mandate with the term only,we forewarned the district court to be especially careful not to consider issues extraneous to resentencing.
the district court correctly concluded,and the government conceded,that concerns over multiplicity may be addressed at sentencing.see united states pollen,cir.the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment prevent s the sentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.missouri hunter,d.it is within the power of a sentencing court to construe the unit of prosecution that congress intended in drafting a criminal statute to ensur e that the total punishment does not exceed that authorized by the legislature.pollen,at quoting jones thomas,d.in considering whether counts and,and,and and were multiplicitous,then,the district court addressed a matter pertinent to resentencing and within the scope of the mandate.
reconsideration of the jury charge on count,however,was not a matter germane to resentencing.jury instructions go to the validity of a conviction,not to the content of the punishment.confined on remand to conduct only,the district court should have turned its attention to fashioning a sentence,consistent with the law,that was tailored to kennedy and his crimes.the procedure for sentencing is set forth in federal rule of criminal procedure.that rule does not mention reconsideration of jury instructions.we gave district courts additional guidance on the proper sentencing procedure in united states gunter,cir.that procedure does not permit revisiting the jury instructions sua sponte.the conclusion is inescapable that the district court,finding error in its jury charge on its own initiative,ventured beyond the scope of our mandate.
the failure of the district court to abide by our mandate is reason enough to vacate its order with respect to count.equally troubling,however,is the district court failure to consider whether it had legal power to identify and raise the matter sua sponte.by finding its own jury instruction on count plainly erroneous and vacating kennedy conviction,the district court implicitly ordered a new trial on the count.see,neder united states,d reversal of a conviction without any consideration of the effect of an error of omission in a jury instruction upon the verdict would send the case back for retrial.that is,although kennedy did not move for a new trial on count or choose to brief the matter upon the court invitation,the district court nevertheless persisted in granting him a new trial.this decision was contrary to federal rule of criminal procedure,which permits a district court to vacate a judgment and grant a new trial only u pon the defendant motion.see also,advisory comm.notes,amends.a judge has no power to order a new trial on his or her own motion,but can act only in response to a motion timely made by a defendant.united states wright,cir united states newman,cir.because kennedy made no such motion,the district court was powerless under the federal rules to assert it on his behalf.
acting on its own initiative and contrary to our mandate,the district court maneuvered beyond its authority in vacating the conviction on count and implicitly granting kennedy a new trial.accordingly,we will reinstate the conviction on count.
the government argues that although the question of multiplicity fell within our mandate,the district court erred in finding counts and,and,and and multiplicitous.in each instance,the government maintains that the district court misapplied controlling precedent in holding that kennedy was indicted and convicted twice for conduct that constituted a single offense.kennedy defends the district court authority to address multiplicity,but offers no defense of the court decisions on the merits.
multiplicity is the charging of a single offense in separate counts of an indictment.united states carter,cir charles alan wright andrew leipold,federal practice procedure criminal ed.a multiplicitous indictment risks subjecting a defendant to multiple sentences for the same offense,an obvious violation of the double jeopardy clause protection against cumulative punishment.see hunter,at.pollen,at.the purpose of the constitutional protection against duplicative punishment is to ensure that the sentencing discretion of courts is confined to the limits established by the legislature.ohio johnson,d.it is not surprising,then,that the test for multiplicity examines whether the legislature intended to make separately punishable the different types of conduct referred to in the various counts.united states stanfa,cir quoting carter,at.in this endeavor,we look to each statute unit of prosecution.tann,at united states frankenberry,cir 
the district court first concluded that counts and,the convictions under g,were multiplicitous.section g makes it unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition.g.the district court reasoned that counts and must be merged because the cadillac handgun and the lincoln handgun were within eyeshot of one another and were seized by the same group of police in the same operation at the same time at the same street address.kennedy ii,wl,at emphases in original.
in united states tann,we held that congress made the allowable unit of prosecution under g the defendant incident of possession.at.the defendant in tann was charged with two g counts after officers in pursuit apprehended him and placed him under arrest in his bathroom.id.at.the officers recovered ammunition for a handgun on the defendant person and found the handgun in the bathroom.id.at.we held that the seizure of the firearm and ammunition at the same time in the same location supported only one g conviction.id.at.in arriving at this conclusion,we relied heavily on united states marino,which held that under a similar statute,simultaneous possession of several firearms by a convicted felon constitutes a single offense,cir.
the district court identified tann and marino as controlling but misapplied their reasoning.both decisions were concerned with the character of the defendant incident of possession the conduct of the police at the time of the seizure was inconsequential.the district court emphasis on the fact that the same group of police seized both guns in a single operation therefore was mistaken,for neither factor bears on the multiplicity inquiry.what matters is the defendant course of treatment of the firearms,which may not be viewed in a frozen,momentary state immediately prior to the seizure.united states mullins,cir.
the district court correctly found that both guns were seized at approximately the same time,but it was mistaken in concluding that the guns were possessed in the same location.like simultaneous possession,same location is an imprecise concept,one whose contours acquire definition by reference to case law.the district court understood same location to mean same street address,inferring that because the guns were discovered in vehicles parked at the same address,kennedy possessed them simultaneously.this represents a marked expansion of tann and collides with myriad decisions of courts of appeals outside this circuit that understand the concept of simultaneous possession in the same location more narrowly.see,united states verrecchia,cir holding that it was appropriate to bring two charges under g,one for guns seized from defendant barn and a second for guns seized from defendant truck that had previously been stored with the guns in the barn united states keen,cir holding that simultaneous seizure of a shotgun and ammunition from the same room supports one g conviction,but observing that g uns that are acquired at different times or stored in separate places permit separate punishment to be imposed for each violation of g united states hutching,cir explaining that simultaneous possession of multiple firearms generally constitutes only one offense unless there is evidence that the weapons were stored in different places,and finding that firearms stored in the defendant bedroom,a car in his garage,and his truck could be charged as separate offenses quotation marks omitted united states bonavia,cir explaining that separate possessions can be established by showing that the weapons were stored in different places and finding counts multiplicitous when the government presented no such evidence quotation marks omitted united states gann,cir holding that multiple charges were permissible when firearms were found in defendant bedroom closet and car because they were stored separately.
the evidence adduced at trial showed that kennedy stored two different firearms in separate vehicles one in the cadillac,and a second in the lincoln.the firearms were kept in secret compartments that contained heroin branded with different stamps,suggesting different distributors.the lincoln gun was in the car with kennedy upon his arrival at the irvington residence before his arrest,indicating that the firearms were some distance apart while he was out driving.these facts were enough to show that kennedy did not simultaneously possess the guns,but rather stored them in separate locations,albeit at times on the premises of the same street address.on these facts,it was proper for the government to charge separate g counts.kennedy convictions will not twice punish him for the same offense.the district court erred in finding otherwise and in merging counts and.
the district court next held that counts and,the convictions under a,also were multiplicitous.section a makes it unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance.a.the district court reasoned that counts and must be merged because the heroin seized from the cadillac and the heroin seized from the lincoln were seized by the police in a common operation working from a single surveillance post and were seized at the same time and at the same street address.kennedy ii,wl,at emphases in original.
we confronted a similar allegation of multiplicitous charges in united states carter.the defendant in carter was convicted under a both of distributing grams of heroin and of possessing with intent to distribute grams of diluted heroin.at.he argued that these separate counts constituted a single,undifferentiated offense.we disagreed,explaining that congress intend ed that two distinct offenses,punishable by separate sentences,should be seen to arise when the evidence shows as it did here that the acts of possession and distribution involved discrete quantities of narcotics.id.at.
as with the g counts,the district court mistakenly focused on the conduct of the police when it merged the a counts.it should have discussed the trial testimony that the stash of heroin in the lincoln and the stash of heroin in the cadillac had different compositions and purities and bore different brand stamps.the quantities and means of packaging,too,were distinct the cadillac heroin totaled grams and was bundled in bricks,while the lincoln heroin totaled grams and was packaged only in glassine envelopes.and,as discussed,the heroin was stored in separate vehicles.our reasoning in carter compels the conclusion that counts and charged separate offenses and that the district court erred in merging the convictions.
finally,the district court suggested that it could merge counts and,the c counts,because it had previously merged counts and,the predicate drug offenses.section c imposes additional years of imprisonment on any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm.c.the unit of prosecution for a c count,we have held,is the underlying drug trafficking offense.diaz,at.because kennedy was convicted of two distinct counts,and because the jury properly found that he possessed separate firearms in furtherance of those crimes,his concomitant c convictions were not multiplicitous.
we conclude that counts and,and,and and were not multiplicitous and that kennedy punishment on those counts comports with the double jeopardy clause.the district court erred in concluding otherwise and in merging the counts of conviction.
the government asks us to direct the chief judge of the united states district c
