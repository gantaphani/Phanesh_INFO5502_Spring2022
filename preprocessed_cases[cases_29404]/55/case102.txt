robert hunter and howard eley,the plaintiffs in this action,sought to prove at trial that they were subjected to excessive force while in custody at the sacramento county main jail pursuant to the county allegedly unconstitutional custom or practice of using excessive force at the main jail.the jury found in favor of the county,and the district court denied plaintiffs motion for a new trial.in this appeal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by refusing to use certain jury instructions they requested.because we agree that the district court erred,and that its error was prejudicial,we reverse the district court order and remand for a new trial.
plaintiffs initiated this action on march,and filed their second amended complaint complaint on august.the complaint alleges that,on september,plaintiff hunter was arrested for driving while under the influence.he was taken to the sacramento county main jail main jail,where he was placed in a detox cell with a clogged and overflowing toilet.the complaint further alleges that when hunter alerted several deputies of the sacramento county sheriff department about the toilet condition,the deputies responded by throwing him to the floor and applying force that resulted in a fractured elbow,stretched tendons,and nerve damage.the complaint also alleges that plaintiff eley was an inmate at the main jail,and that on march,eley had a verbal disagreement with a deputy sheriff,after which the sheriff shoved,slapped,and choked eley without provocation.
plaintiffs complaint named a number of defendants and asserted several causes of action.in its september,ruling on the defendants summary judgment motion,the district court dismissed all of plaintiffs claims except for their claim against the county of sacramento defendant or county.plaintiffs monell claim alleged that they were subjected to excessive force,in violation of their rights under,pursuant to defendant longstanding practice or custom of subjecting inmates at the main jail to excessive force.
in its ruling denying summary judgment on this claim,the district court opinion placed primary emphasis upon a declaration submitted by plaintiffs expert,lieutenant twomey,a former employee of the sacramento county sheriff department sheriff department.twomey declared that there were to major incidents of excessive force at the main jail from to.twomey also declared that officials in the jail repeatedly failed to investigate the incidents,discipline the guards,or take other action to address the problem.for example,no internal affairs investigation was opened after a detainee named jafar afshar filed a complaint alleging that he had been subject to excessive force in the main jail when a deputy grabbed him from behind and threw him backward,smashing his head onto the floor.a sheriff department official later admitted that an investigation should have been opened but was not.similarly,twomey declared that,in his experience,an internal investigation should have been opened when inmate mihaita constantin suffered a fractured nose and hand after being thrown to the ground and having his wrists restrained by five deputies,none of whom were injured in the altercation.the court found that all of this evidence created a material issue of fact as to whether the county had a practice or custom of using excessive force,despite the fact that the county had formal written policies prohibiting the use of excessive force.
on september,about a month and a half before trial,the district court instructed the parties to submit proposed jury instructions.on october,plaintiffs and defendant both submitted proposed jury instructions.plaintiffs offered proposed instructions,of which elucidated various ways in which a plaintiff may establish municipal liability under monell.on october,the district court issued its own set of proposed jury instructions,instructing the parties to submit any suggested modifications as soon as possible.
the instruction of central relevance to this appeal laid out the elements of a monell claim for the use of excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment monell instruction.the district court proposed monell instruction read,in its entirety,as follows 
each plaintiff alleges that the defendant county of sacramento violated his fourth amendment constitutional right against use of excessive force.to prevail on this claim each plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence each of the following elements 
first,that one or more of defendant employees used excessive force against plaintiff in violation of the fourth amendment of the united states constitution.
second,that in so doing,defendant employee or employees acted pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom of defendant.
third,that plaintiff was injured and,
fourth,that defendant longstanding practice or custom was so closely related to plaintiff injury that it was the moving force causing plaintiff injury.
excerpts of record er at.both parties filed objections and proposed modifications to the district court instructions.the document filed by plaintiffs began as follows please take notice that plaintiffs object to the proposed jury instructions proffered by the court,and request the following modifications.in the body of the document,plaintiffs explained that they did not object to the monell instruction as written,but they specifically request ed the following proposed instructions be provided as well,as they state the law in the ninth circuit accurately,and in this district.plaintiffs then listed the following ten additional instructions,all of which were taken from their earlier list of proposed instructions and addressed standards for liability under monell.
the routine failure to follow a general policy can itself constitute an actionable custom.
plaintiff can establish municipal liability against defendant by proving that the excessive force was committed pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom which constitutes the standard operating procedure of the local governmental entity.
regardless of whether the county has formal policies regarding the use of force,routine failure to follow a general policy can itself constitute an actionable custom.
failure to properly investigate,like failure to discipline employees involved in incidents of excessive force,is evidence of and supports a finding that not only was it accepted,but was customary.
plaintiff may also attempt to prove the existence of a custom or informal policy with evidence of repeated constitutional violations for which the errant municipal officials were not discharged or reprimanded.
policy or custom may be inferred if,after the use of excessive force,the county of sacramento took no steps to reprimand or discharge the deputy sheriffs,or if they otherwise failed to admit the deputy sheriffs conduct was in error.
the county is liable for depriving plaintiff of a federal right if it is determined it did an affirmative act,participated in another affirmative acts,or omitted to perform an act which it was legally required to do that causes the deprivation.
liability for an established custom can be imposed irrespective of whether official policy makers had actual knowledge of the practice at issue.
failure to properly investigate,like failure to discipline employees involved in incidents of excessive force,is evidence of and supports a finding excessive force was not only accepted but was customary.
the extent and openness of excessive force supports an inference that managerial level employees should have known.

the final instructions did reflect the county suggestion that the definition of the term practice or custom used in ninth circuit model civil jury instruction be added to the proposed monell instruction.that definition specifies that p ractice or custom means any permanent,widespread,practice or custom that constitutes a standard operating procedure of the defendant.ninth circuit model civil jury instruction model instruction.the court incorporated this definition in a separate instruction in its final set of jury instructions.
trial began on august,and the district court instructed the jury on august.the jury was given general verdict forms which asked whether each plaintiff had prevail ed on his fourth amendment claim against the county of sacramento and,if so,what amount of damages was caused by the county.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the county and against both of the plaintiffs.
plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial on november,which argued,in relevant part,that the district court had failed to instruct the jury on the law as proffered in plaintiffs proposed additional jury instructions.the district court rejected plaintiffs retrial request on january,finding that it was based on a one sentence conclusory argument which assumes plaintiffs proposed instructions were not considered before the jury instructions were finalized.er.the court also concluded that plaintiffs did not show that the instructions given failed to fairly and adequately cover the issues tried.er quoting duran city of maywood,cir.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on february.
plaintiffs object to the jury instructions used by the district court on several grounds.defendant argues that the instructions given were appropriate and that plaintiffs have waived their arguments concerning the instructions.we conclude that plaintiffs properly objected to the district court refusal to use plaintiffs supplemental monell instructions,and that the district court erred by declining to use those instructions 
we begin by addressing whether plaintiffs properly objected to the district court monell instruction.under federal rule of civil procedure,a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.c.an objection to a jury instruction need not be formal,and a party may properly object by submitting a proposed instruction that is supported by relevant authority,so long as the proffered language is sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.norwood vance,cir quoting inv.serv.allied equities,cir.if a party does not properly object to jury instructions before the district court,we may only consider a plain error in the instructions that affects substantial rights.d 
plaintiffs have indeed made certain arguments for the first time in this that we find unpersuasive 
however,the plaintiffs did properly object to the district court proposed monell instruction,to the extent that it did not go farther and failed to include a separate definition of practice or custom.in their objections to the district court instructions,plaintiffs stated that they did not object to the court proposed monell instruction as written,but they asked that the court also use the ten instructions quoted in part i of this opinion,which elaborate various ways in which a monell plaintiff may prove a practice or custom.we find that the ground for plaintiffs objection was made clear in their proposed instructions,which plaintiffs correctly,if inartfully,argued state the law in the ninth circuit accurately,and in this district.id.under rule,objections to jury instructions must stat e distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection.c.as the supreme court has noted,objections to a charge must be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.palmer hoffman.in applying rule c in voorhies larson,we noted that a party objecting to a jury instruction may put the court on notice by offering alternative instructions that were denied.at citing gulliford pierce,cir.likewise,in our decision last year in norwood,we held that a party sufficiently objected by proposing alternative instructions that made the grounds for their position clear,citing relevant authority.at.in this case,the plaintiffs proposed their own jury instructions that defined and explained the practice or custom prong and referred to several of our leading cases.by submitting instructions that specifically focused on the practice or custom prong of the monell test,the plaintiffs put the district court on notice of the grounds for their objection.
it should be noted that the county submission of the definition of practice or custom contained in model instruction did not cure plaintiffs objection.as will be discussed in the following section,the county definition failed to make clear to the jury that the plaintiffs could prove that an unofficial practice or custom of excessive force existed at the main jail by pointing to inaction in the face of repeated instances of the use of excessive force by main jail employees.by contrast,the plaintiffs submitted instructions which explicitly stated that an unconstitutional practice or custom could be proven through evidence that incidents of excessive force were not investigated and their perpetrators were not disciplined.see,er instruction failure to properly investigate,like failure to discipline employees involved in incidents of excessive force,is evidence of and supports a finding excessive force was not only accepted but was customary.citations omitted.these very specific proposed instructions were sufficient to put the district court on notice that the plaintiffs considered the county proposed definition of custom or practice,taken from model instruction,to be incomplete and misleading.thus,plaintiffs objection to the district court proposed monell instruction was sufficient under rule.
we now turn to the merits of plaintiffs objection to the district court custom or practice instruction.our jury instruction decisions have traditionally distinguished between errors in the formulation of a jury instruction,which we review for abuse of discretion,and a jury instruction misstate ment of the law,which we review de novo.dream games of,pc onsite,cir internal quotation omitted see also dang cross,cir.as our decision in norwood recognized,we engage in de novo review when a party challenges a jury instruction as an incomplete,and therefore incorrect,statement of the law.at citing clem lomeli,cir dang,at.
