code of civil procedure section authorizes an award of attorney fees to a private attorney general,that is,a party who secures a significant benefit for many people by enforcing an important right affecting the public interest in adoption of joshua cal th,d,joshua,we decided that a section fee award may not be imposed on a litigant who did nothing to adversely affect the public interest,but simply lost an important appellate case in the course of pursuing his or her private rights.joshua,at,d.
in this case,plaintiffs objected to paying an extra fee for an expedited transcript of a deposition noticed by defendant.they won an appeal establishing that trial courts have the authority to determine the reasonableness of fees charged by deposition reporters to nonnoticing parties.on remand,the trial court found that the fee charged to plaintiffs was unreasonable,but denied their motion for an award of attorney fees under section.relying on joshua,the court concluded that plaintiffs had acted in their own interest and only incidentally conferred a benefit on other litigants.the court of appeal,in a split decision,affirmed.we granted plaintiffs petition for review,in order to clarify the scope of our holding in joshua 
we conclude that joshua has no application here.deposition reporters are officers of the court,regulated by statute,who perform a public service of considerable importance to litigants and members of the public.the reporting service here did not merely seek to vindicate its private rights.it defended its institutional interest in controlling the fees it charges,and sought to shield itself from judicial review of its conduct as a ministerial officer of the court.moreover,it was found to have charged plaintiffs an unreasonable fee.the courts below erred by concluding that the service did nothing adverse to the public interest,and that plaintiffs appeal did not involve an important right affecting the public interest.
background 
in the underlying personal injury action,which eventually settled,defendant took the deposition of a plaintiffs expert and requested an expedited transcript.the reporting service,coast court reporters coast,asked plaintiffs counsel whether he too wanted an expedited transcript.he did,and coast sent counsel a bill including a fee for expediting the copy counsel objected to the additional charge.coast refused to expedite the transcript without payment of the fee.counsel asked the trial court to require coast to provide the transcript without the extra cost.coast and plaintiffs counsel agreed that the court ruling would determine the validity and reasonableness of its fee,and would govern the fees for other expedited transcripts in the action.coast delivered the transcript to plaintiffs,deferring payment until the court ruled.
the trial court found that coast practice of charging the nonnoticing party a fee for expedited transcripts was unconscionable.however,the court believed it had no authority to determine how much a deposition reporter may charge for transcripts.it ordered plaintiffs to pay the full amount charged by coast,but invited them to seek appellate review.plaintiffs did so,and prevailed.serrano stefan merli plastering,th,d stefan i.
in stefan i,the court of appeal observed that depositions must be conducted under the supervision of an officer qualified to administer an oath.while the officer and the stenographer who records the testimony need not be the same person,they usually are,and that practice was followed here stefan i,supra,th at,d.the court further observed that deposition officers are ministerial officers of the court burns superior court cal,who are subject to the court statutory and inherent authority over judicial proceedings,subd.a walker superior court cal d,stefan i,supra,th at,d.
section,subdivision c allows a nonnoticing party to obtain a copy of a deposition transcript at its own expense.stefan i reasoned that the trial court obviously should be able to enforce this statutory right by ordering the deposition reporter to provide a copy of the transcript on condition of the party payment of the expense of the copy.stefan i,supra,th at,d,citing,subd.a.coast argued that while the court could order a reporter to provide a copy of a transcript,it could not regulate the amount of the fee charged by the reporter.the court of appeal disagreed,pointing out that the nonnoticing party has no contractual relationship with the reporter,who is selected by the noticing party.thus,the nonnoticing party is in no position to bargain for lower rates.indeed the reporter may have an incentive to offer lower rates to the noticing party while shifting some of its costs of service to the nonnoticing party.stefan i,supra,th at,d.
in light of the importance of deposition testimony in a pending action and the nonnoticing party lack of bargaining power,a trial court must be cautious not to lend assistance to overreaching by the deposition reporter.for a deposition reporter to refuse to provide a copy of a transcript to a nonnoticing party in a pending action unless the party agrees to pay an unreasonable fee would be grossly unfair.stefan i,supra,th at,d.thus,the only monetary condition that the court may properly place upon the nonnoticing party right to receive a copy of the deposition transcript would be payment of a reasonable fee.ibid.the court found support for this conclusion in section,subdivision a,which applies to nonparties,and specifies that the fee charged to any person requesting a copy of a deposition transcript must be reasonable.it would be anomalous indeed,said the court,for the legislature to require a deposition officer to provide a copy of a deposition transcript to a nonparty for a reasonable fee while denying the same protection for a litigating party.stefan i,at,d.
stefan i distinguished and disagreed with urban pacific equities superior court th,d urban pacific,which had led the trial court to believe it had no authority to set coast fee.the urban pacific court rejected a nonnoticing party argument that it was entitled to obtain a copy of a deposition transcript by serving a business records subpoena.urban pacific,supra,th at,d.by way of introduction,however,the court observed that there is no statute regulating the fees charged by private reporting firms,and deposition reporters are free to charge all the market will bear.id.at,d.the stefan i court was not persuaded by this dictum.it noted that a nonnoticing party has no market interaction with the deposition reporter,and absent timely judicial intervention,could be placed at the mercy of the reporter arbitrary pricing policy.stefan i,supra,th at,fn,d.
the urban pacific court had also commented that former section,the predecessor of section,offered no solution to the problem of excessive deposition charges.the court evidently read the statutory reference to a reasonable charge set by the deposition officer as granting the reporter free rein,even though it viewed the charges in the case before it as obviously excessive.urban pacific,supra,th at,d see fn,ante.it stated,unless the reporter concedes that its charges are not reasonable,we do not see how this new statute would affect the problem faced by the appellant,particularly since the new statute appears to be for the benefit of nonparties,not parties.urban pacific,at,fn,d.the stefan i court took exception to this view.a trial court failure to intervene to prevent such abuse of a nonnoticing party would amount to official toleration of such conduct.to the extent that urban pacific suggests that such a result is required by judicial impotency in such circumstances,we decline to follow it.stefan i,supra,th at,fn,d.
stefan i concluded that the trial court in the pending action is in the best position to resolve deposition fee disputes,in a manner consistent with the procedures routinely followed to determine the costs recoverable by a prevailing party.stefan i,supra,th at,d.because the trial court had failed to exercise its discretion as to whether coast charges were reasonable in this case,the court of appeal remanded with directions to make that determination and order a refund of any amounts found to be excessive.id.at,d.on remand,the trial court ruled that under the circumstances presented,the entire charge for expediting the transcript was unreasonable.it ordered that amount refunded to plaintiffs,with interest.
plaintiffs then filed a motion for attorney fees under section.they asked for an award of up to,though counsel asserted that this would leave him with many hours of uncompensated time.plaintiffs claimed they met all the statutory conditions for a fee award they had successfully enforced an important right affecting the public interest,conferring a significant benefit on a large class of persons,and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement made an award appropriate coast opposed the motion,contending that plaintiffs had sought not to enforce a public right but merely to avoid paying a fee for deposition transcripts.coast disputed plaintiffs claim that they had vindicated an important public right,and relied on joshua,supra,cal th,d,for the proposition that a party who has done nothing to adversely affect the public interest other than being on the losing side of an appeal should not be subjected to a fee award under section.
the trial court denied the fee motion,explaining s ection does not authorize an award of attorney fees against an individual who has done nothing to adversely affect the rights of the public or a substantial class of people other than raise an issue in the course of private litigation that could establish legal precedent adverse to a portion of the public joshua,supra,cal th,d.here that is exactly what occurred.moving party was not trying to vindicate the public interest.rather,he was trying to protect his own interest and in so doing,by virtue of a published opinion,he conferred a benefit to litigants.
the court of appeal affirmed over the dissent of justice croskey,the author of the stefan i opinion.the majority held that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the first element of section,because their action did not result in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.the majority deemed joshua on point and controlling.in joshua,former domestic partners had litigated the validity of a second parent adoption and in so doing established the lawfulness of this form of adoption joshua,supra,cal th at,d.here,the court of appeal majority decided that coast occupied a position similar to that of the birth mother in joshua,who sought to invalidate the adoption.it viewed the litigation in stefan i as a private business disagreement between plaintiffs and coast,which happened to involve an issue that was resolved in a published opinion.
the majority concluded that plaintiffs action did not qualify as public interest litigation.coast was not purporting to represent the public and its conduct addressed in our opinion had not been impairing the statutory or constitutional rights of the public or even a large or significant class of people.it emphasized that coast had waived its fees and delivered all of the deposition transcripts to plaintiffs pending the trial court determination of the reasonableness of the fee.the majority viewed the stefan i opinion as a reiteration of existing statutory law governing deposition fees,and a correction of a error by a trial court that had mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to limit court reporter fees.
the dissenting opinion would have reversed and remanded for the trial court to consider all the elements required for an award of fees under section.in the dissent view,coast could not be compared to the losing parent in joshua s.it had engaged in conduct against the public interest and violated its statutory duty as a deposition officer by refusing to deliver a transcript without payment of an unreasonable fee.
discussion 
on appeal from an award of attorney fees under section,the normal standard of review is abuse of discretion.however,de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,d,accord,conservatorship of whitley cal th,d.resolution of this case turns primarily on interpretations of section and the joshua and stefan i opinions,which present questions of law.
section authorizes an award of fees when the action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.see woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.in joshua,we carved out a limited exception to these qualifications e ven when an important right has been vindicated and a substantial public benefit conferred,and when a plaintiff litigation has transcended her personal interest,section was not intended to impose fees on an individual seeking a judgment that determines only his or her private rights,but who has done nothing to adversely affect the public interest other than being on the losing side of an important appellate case.joshua,supra,cal th at,d.
we reasoned that the terms of the statute reflect an implicit understanding by the legislature that fee awards are to be imposed only on parties whose conduct adversely affected the public interest.section authorizes fees for any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest italics added.the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest implies that those on whom attorney fees are imposed have acted,or failed to act,in such a way as to violate or compromise that right,thereby requiring its enforcement through litigation.it does not appear to encompass the award of attorney fees against an individual who has done nothing to curtail a public right other than raise an issue in the context of private litigation that results in important legal precedent.joshua,supra,cal th at,d.
here,the court of appeal majority misapprehended the nature of the joshua holding.the majority proceeded on the assumption that joshua established the applicable criteria here for determining under section whether the litigation has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest italics omitted,the first of the statutory factors.however,in joshua we did not explicate or apply the usual section criteria.the first two factors were unquestionably met.the prior litigation establishing the validity of second parent adoptions involved an important legal issue and yield ed a substantial and widespread public benefit.joshua,supra,cal th at,d.while the third factor was in dispute,particularly as to whether the plaintiff personal interest in vindicating her parental rights disqualified her from recovering her attorney fees,we did not resolve that issue in joshua instead,as described above,we recognized an exception to be applied in cases where all three factors are satisfied,but the party from whom fees are sought is not the type of party on whom private attorney general fees were intended to be imposed.joshua,at,d.
thus,joshua has no bearing on whether an action qualifies as one that has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,except insofar as it exemplifies a conceded point.nor does the analysis of the court of appeal majority below suffice to bring this case within the joshua exception.the majority agreed with the trial court view that the dispute between plaintiffs and coast was a private business disagreement,which did not arise from an attempt to curtail any conduct on the part of coast that was infringing a statutory or public right.these characterizations are insupportable,in view of the facts and law set out in the stefan i opinion.
there was no business relationship between plaintiffs and coast,which was retained as the deposition reporter by defendant.plaintiffs had no choice but to get their transcripts from coast.coast was a ministerial officer of the court,and its obligations to plaintiffs were determined by statute,not by contract.while the proceedings in the trial court regarding transcript charges might be deemed a minor dispute limited to the circumstances of this litigation,on appeal coast strenuously defended its institutional interest in controlling the fees charged to a nonnoticing party without judicial oversight.and the trial court determined,on remand after stefan i,that coast had indeed violated plaintiffs right to receive a transcript for a reasonable charge.accordingly,this is not a case in which a private litigant with no institutional interest in the litigation pursued only its private rights.joshua,supra,cal th at,d.rather,we are presented with the usual circumstance where private attorney general fees are sought from a party at least partly responsible for the policy or practice that gave rise to the litigation.connerly state personnel,supra,cal th at,d,see joshua,supra,cal th at,d.
the court of appeal majority also went astray when it determined that stefan i was not public interest litigation for purposes of section as explicated by joshua italics omitted,reasoning that stefan i did not create new law or extend existing law but merely reiterated the state of statutory authority which empowers trial courts to regulate deposition fees.nor did our opinion pronounce a new principle.trial courts have long had the inherent power generally to control the conduct of ministerial officers and others connected with judicial proceedings the trial court in stefan i misunderstood its power and believed itself constrained by urban pacific,supra,th,d.stefan i gave guidance by disagreeing with urban pacific and explicating the court power.therefore,we merely corrected a error by a trial court that had mistakenly believed it lacked the authority to limit court reporter fees,with the result that stefan i did not enforce a fundamental public right or constitutional principle that was being infringed by coast.
joshua did not speak to these concerns.there,as noted above,the public importance of the underlying litigation was undisputed.furthermore,the majority interpretation of the stefan i opinion is unduly cramped.the statutes governing depositions were unclear on the expenses chargeable to a nonnoticing party,and silent on the courts authority to intervene.section,subdivision c offered no guidance on the amount of the expense a nonnoticing party may be charged,and section,subdivision a,governing transcript requests by nonparties,referred to a reasonable charge set by the deposition officer.the urban pacific court,albeit in dicta,had viewed the statutory scheme as permitting deposition officers to charge whatever the market would bear.urban pacific,supra,th at,d.the trial court reluctance to review the reasonableness of coast deposition fees under this state of the law was understandable.
the stefan i opinion makes it plain that the court was addressing statutory and constitutional rights of considerable public importance.depositions play an important role in litigation and trial preparation,and deposition testimony may be offered as evidence in pretrial proceedings and,in some circumstances,at trial.stefan i,supra,th at,d.c onditioning the party right to receive a copy of a transcript on payment of an unreasonable fee would undermine rather than promote the administration of justice and could very well result in a denial of due process to the nonnoticing party victimized by the reporter conduct.ibid.these considerations substantially contributed to the court conclusion that section,subdivision c must be construed to include a reasonableness requirement.similarly,when the court decided that disputes over the reasonableness of a fee should be resolved by the trial court in the pending action,it observed that t o defer the determination to a later,separate proceeding would be impractical and inefficient and would undermine the trial court necessary authority under section,subdivision a,as well as imperil the due process rights of the nonnoticing party.stefan i,supra,th at,d.
thus,it is clear that issues of public interest were directly involved in the stefan i appeal.the court resolved unsettled issues of statutory interpretation relating to the administration of justice,the trial courts inherent and statutory authority to supervise their ministerial officers,and the statutory and constitutional rights of nonnoticing parties to obtain deposition transcripts at a reasonable cost.stefan i established the right of all such parties to bring transcript fee disputes to the trial courts for resolution.coast argues,correctly,that merely because an appellate opinion is certified for publication does not mean it involves an important right affecting the public interest.the fact that litigation results in significant appellate precedent is only one factor to be considered in that regard.joshua,supra,cal th at,d,los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d.here,however,the stefan i opinion by its terms addressed matters of public importance.
coast also asserts that to qualify as public interest litigation,a case must meet the criteria of section in the trial court as well as on appeal.on this point,coast is wrong.it is well established that an appellate decision may provide the basis for a fee award even when the trial court ruling does not laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d,county of san diego lamb th,d mounger gates d,fn.here,the court of appeal majority erred by concluding that stefan i did not resolve an important issue affecting the public interest.
disposition 
because neither the court of appeal nor the trial court considered whether plaintiffs satisfied the other elements required for a fee award under section,we reverse and remand with directions to the court of appeal to instruct the trial court to determine anew whether plaintiffs are entitled to recover private attorney general fees.
california follows the american rule,under which each party to litigation must generally pay its own attorney fees.code civ.california private attorney general law,however,sets forth an exception,stating that,if certain specified conditions are met,a court may award attorneys fees in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest.
here,defendant scheduled the deposition of plaintiffs expert witness and hired a local deposition reporter to record the deposition and prepare a certified transcript on an expedited basis.after the deposition was completed,plaintiffs requested a certified copy of the transcript,also on an expedited basis.the reporter invoice,sent to plaintiffs counsel,included a surcharge for expediting its service.plaintiffs challenged the surcharge in the trial court.the reporter provided the transcript,agreeing to defer payment of the surcharge until after the trial court ruling.
relying on a published court of appeal decision,the trial court ruled that it had no authority to regulate the fees charged by deposition reporters.plaintiffs appealed,and the court of appeal held in a published decision that trial courts do have authority to regulate reporter fees.plaintiffs then sought in attorney fees under the private attorney general law,arguing that the litigation against the deposition reporter enforced an important right affecting the public interest and conferred a significant benefit on the general public.in this court,the majority upholds the appropriateness of an attorney fees award.i disagree.
an adequate understanding of the issue requires a detailed statement of the relevant facts,as summarized below.
the underlying dispute was a personal injury lawsuit that eventually settled.in the course of litigating that dispute,defendant hired coast court reporters,to stenographically record the deposition of plaintiffs expert witness and to prepare a certified transcript of the deposition on an expedited basis.the deposition was held on monday,june.two days later,plaintiffs counsel requested a certified copy of the transcript,also on an expedit
