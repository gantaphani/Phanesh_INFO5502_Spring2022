kenneth martin kyle pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child,in violation of c,for which he received a month sentence.on appeal,kyle argues his guilty plea and sentence must be set aside because the district court impermissibly and prejudicially participated in his plea negotiations.
after hearing oral argument,we vacated submission and ordered supplemental following the supreme court decision in united states davila,d.the question presented in davila was whether the violation of.rule c by the magistrate judge warranted automatic vacatur of davila guilty plea.id.at.the supreme court held that automatic vacatur is inappropriate,explaining that vacatur of the plea is not in order if the record shows no prejudice to the defendant decision to plead guilty.id.at.davila abrogated the prior rule in this circuit that rule ban on judicial participation in plea negotiations is an absolute command which admits of no exceptions.id.at quoting united states anderson,cir alteration in original.rather,the reviewing court must consider all that transpired in the trial court to assess the impact of the judge error on the decision to plead guilty.id.at.we now follow davila and review the district court alleged violation of rule c in light of the prejudice inquiry required.after careful consideration of the full record of this appeal,we find that the district court participated in the parties plea discussions by prematurely committing itself to a sentence of a specific severity.the district court participation prejudiced kyle.we hold that kyle plea must be vacated and this appeal remanded for further proceedings.
kenneth martin kyle was an assistant professor of public affairs and administration at california state university,east bay in hayward,california.kyle first came to the attention of the federal bureau of investigation fbi in december when an fbi agent using file sharing software in an undercover capacity noticed a user with the moniker cruelsob sharing image and video files with titles indicative of child pornography.the agent downloaded child pornography images and one video file containing child pornography from cruelsob.later investigation revealed that cruelsob was associated with kyle.the fbi referred the case to the san francisco police department sfpd for further investigation.
the sfpd obtained a warrant and searched kyle apartment.following the search,the sfpd arrested kyle.an examination of text messages from kyle cell phone and images from his computer linked kyle with a woman named tessa van vlerah.some of the images from kyle computer depicted van vlerah and her infant child engaged in sexual acts with an adult male whose face was not shown.van vlerah later identified kyle as the adult male in the images and admitted that she and kyle had molested the child.
kyle was indicted on april,for one count of aggravated sexual abuse of a child,in violation of c,and one count each for production,distribution,possession,and transportation of child pornography,in violation of and.kyle and the government finalized the first plea agreement on may.pursuant to the first plea agreement,kyle agreed to plead guilty to count one,violation of c.in exchange,the parties agreed that the mandatory minimum penalty provided in c of months would be an appropriate custodial sentence.the district court accepted kyle guilty plea on may,but reserved ruling on the plea agreement pending the district court review of the pre sentence report.
on october,the district court notified the parties of its intention to reject the first plea agreement.on october,the date originally set for judgment and sentencing,the district court explained that the plea agreement was too lenient,and expressed his view that,this case warrants an sentence,substantially sentence,and not necessarily the statutory maximum of life imprisonment.the district court also stated 
y ou may be acquitted but if you are convicted,the seriousness of what you did to this little girl has to be reflected in the sentence,and the seriousness of some of the comments that you made that were fantasies has to be part of the sentence,and the seriousness of the uncharged conduct,all the child pornography that you possess,which is not part of the guideline calculation has to be taken into account.
the district court allowed kyle to withdraw his guilty plea 
on february,the district court warned the parties that they should either prepare for trial or reach a plea agreement.counsel for kyle responded that we still would like to resolve the case without trial,and offered to provide the district court with more information on the potential sentencing range by obtaining an actuarial calculation on an effective life sentence for kyle.the district court and counsel then engaged in the following colloquy 
the court well,the actuary is and it is helpful,because i said that the court view is that this man is never going to get out of jail,period.so telling me that you going to submit an evaluation of an actuary does really help me because,quite frankly,given what i know about this case,i prepared to impose a life sentence.
so if you want to go from that,you know,that as much guidance as i allowed to give you without getting involved in the plea bargain process.so in light of that,if the defendant wishes to go to trial and exercise all of his rights,then he should do so.
so having an actuary tell me that he or she expects the defendant is going to live any particular length of time is not going to be much help to the court unless you all come up with something creative that meets the court concern.
the court views the conduct as being among the most serious conduct that the court has seen in a case,almost any case.and,so,given that,that my current view and i have a lot of information that the court,counsel,and the probation department have provided,but i would certainly be willing to entertain you have the right to come in with any agreement you wish to and the court will evaluate it on an individualized basis 
counsel for kyle your honor,please forgive me,i do mean to quarrel with the court,but i want to clarify something.
when we were here last,my recollection was the court said a substantial departure above the guideline but less than life.and if i mistaken,please forgive me for speaking in that way,but that was the point of view that we had when we came in this afternoon.
the court all right.well,i given a lot more thought to this case.i did say that and my view has changed.and since the defendant has changed his position in reliance on what i said,the record remains the same but the court view has changed.that my current view.
and having said that,of course,if the parties you know,the government agreed to a year sentence.if the parties can change the court mind with additional data and you come in with a plea,for example,with evidence to support the wisdom of the agreement,then i would certainly consider it but i think it fair,in light of where we are,to give you the court current thinking based upon the information that it now has.and it got more information than a typical case because we been through this process of motions and input from the probation department.
so it may well be that you can convince the court of something different,but that my current view and i think you have a right to know that.so i not prohibiting you from coming to the court with another agreement.if that what you chose,the defendant chooses and the government agrees,then please do so and have your data 
counsel for kyle your honor,we accept the court ruling on this.
i do want to comment that if this case is resolved without trial,it a kindness to the child because it avoids having a record made of all of the things that have occurred in this case and i think that that would be something that would be if the record was made,i think that would be harmful to the child in the future,and that one of the considerations 
the court right.that a fair point.the other side of that is the thought of kyle being on the street while this child is alive,i think is a real is something that the court has great concern about.if this man is
