recognizing the significance of religious freedom in all aspects of life,congress passed the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa or the act to protect institutionalized persons who are unable freely to attend to their religious needs and are therefore dependent on the government permission and accommodation for exercise of their religion.cutter wilkinson.rluipa prohibits state and local governments from imposing a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution unless the government demonstrates that imposing that burden is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.a.the term institution includes a jail,prison,or other correctional facility and a pretrial detention facility.b.we consider whether the orange county santa ana courthouse holding facility,where every day hundreds of individuals are detained in connection with court proceedings,is an institution as defined by rluipa.we conclude that this facility is such an institution under rluipa,and thus the act covers persons detained at the facility.
our interpretation of the statute is guided by three principles.to begin,the focus of our inquiry is narrow and preliminary.the only question before us is whether orange county facility is an institution under rluipa other courthouse or detention facilities have unique characteristics that warrant individualized review.next,we are mindful that the issue of the substantial burden on religious exercise is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest is distinct from the threshold issue of whether the facility is a covered institution in the first place.a.the accommodation question involves serious practical considerations regarding institutional safety,security,and the feasibility of accommodation that are not before us now.finally,congress has explicitly directed us to resolve any ambiguities in rluipa in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise,to the maximum extent permitted.g emphasis added.with this framework in mind,we turn to the background of the case.
background 
souhair khatib is a practicing muslim.in accordance with her religious beliefs,khatib wears a hijab,or headscarf,covering her hair and neck when in public.khatib and her husband pled guilty in orange county superior court to a misdemeanor violation of california welfare law.the khatibs were sentenced to three years probation and ordered to complete thirty days of community service.
two days before the deadline for completing their community service,khatib and her husband appeared in orange county superior court to seek an extension.the court revoked khatib probation and ordered her taken into custody.khatib was handcuffed and taken to the santa ana courthouse holding facility.
at the booking counter,a male officer ordered khatib to hand over her belongings and remove her headscarf.having her head uncovered in public,especially in front of men outside of her immediate family,is a serious breach of khatib faith and a deeply humiliating and defiling experience.weeping,khatib explained that her religious beliefs forbade her from taking off her headscarf and pleaded with the officers to allow her to keep it on.khatib was warned that the male officers would remove the headscarf for her if she did not voluntarily do so.wanting to avoid being touched by the male violation of her religious reluctantly complied.
khatib spent the majority of the day in a holding cell in view of male officers and inmates.experiencing severe discomfort,distress,and humiliat ion,khatib attempted to cover herself by pulling her knees into her chest and covering her head with a vest she was wearing.at a hearing that afternoon,the court reinstated khatib probation and provided an extension of time to complete community service.
khatib filed a complaint against the county of orange,the sheriff,and courthouse officers the county,alleging,among other things,violations of rluipa.the district court dismissed khatib rluipa claims on the ground that the courthouse holding facility was not a covered institution under the act.the district court wrote at length about the conditions in facilities and on the difference between courthouse holding facilities and facilities such as correctional centers and prisons.the court concluded that because 
an inmate stay in a courthouse holding facility is generally temporary and transitory,constant movement within holding facilities makes unlimited exercise of religious and expressive freedoms impractical.staff at such facilities do not have the luxuries that make such freedoms feasible in longerterm institutions,to which rluipa plainly applies.as a result,the court can not conclude that congress intended rluipa to apply to courthouse holding facilities.
as we explain below,this exegesis about the practicality of religious accommodation improperly merges two distinct inquiries whether the facility is an institution,and the government burden as to accommodation.only the former question is at issue in this appeal.
rluipa overview 
we apply legal principles of statutory interpretation.we begin,as always,with the text of the statute.duncan walker.we presume that congress says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,u.thus,the plain meaning of a statute controls where that meaning is unambiguous.see harris trust sav.bank salomon smith barney.
section of rluipa provides that 
n o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution,as defined in,even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability,unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.
a.thus,an individual must have been residing in or confined to a covered institution to invoke the protections of the act.the key interpretive question is whether khatib meets this criterion.
rluipa incorporates by reference the definition of institution from the civil rights of institutionalized persons act of cripa,et,which defines the term to include any facility or institution that is a jail,prison,or other correctional facility or a pretrial detention facility.under the ordinary,common meaning of these terms,the santa ana courthouse holding facility falls within the definitions of pretrial detention facility and of jail.see perrin united states,instructing that unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.in reaching this conclusion,we begin with the county own description of the facility.
b.the santa ana courthouse holding facility 
the best description of the santa ana courthouse holding facility comes from the orange county grand jury report,an annual publication mandated by state law the report lists the courthouse facility as one of orange county adult jail facilities and describes it as follows 
court holding facility is a secure detention facility located within a court building used for the confinement of persons solely for the purpose of a court appearance for a period not exceeding hours.
orange county grand jury,the state of orange county jails and programs june,grand jury report.the facility is further described by the county as a labyrinth of,tunnel s,secured elevators,and holding cells through which approximately inmates travel each day.id.at.the facility holds individuals taken into custody at the courthouse as well as inmates who are transferred from other facilities to appear at court hearings or trial.inmates brought into the facility are segregated by race,gang affiliation,criminal level of intensity,and other characteristics to prevent trouble.id.
whether the facility is a pretrial detention facility 
the santa ana facility easily fits within the definition of a pretrial detention facility.because neither rluipa nor cripa defines pretrial detention facility,we look to the ordinary meaning of the words to define the ter
