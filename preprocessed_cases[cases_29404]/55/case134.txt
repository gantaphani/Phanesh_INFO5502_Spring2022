petitioner gary swarthout,warden of california state prison,solano,challenges,by petition for writ of mandate,the order of the los angeles superior court requiring him to temporarily transfer inmate to the los angeles county men central jail for investigative purposes.as the trial court lacked authority to issue the transfer order,we grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
was convicted of murder and burglary in,and sentenced to prison for a term of years to life.he is currently housed at california state prison,solano,where swarthout is the warden.
on april,the culver city police department sought an order for the temporary transfer of to the los angeles county men central jail for investigative purposes.the request for the order was made by means of an affidavit filed under seal the affidavit sought the temporary transfer of in connection with the culver city police department investigation of another crime,an investigation which purportedly could not take place without the transfer of.the los angeles superior court,which had no proceeding pending against or involving,issued the order 
the order was faxed to warden swarthout,who immediately contacted counsel in the attorney general office.warden swarthout and the attorney general took the position that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue the transfer order.unable to resolve the matter informally with the deputy district attorney who was working on the current investigation,warden swarthout filed a request to reconsider and vacate the transfer order.
a hearing was held on may.at the hearing,the trial court asked the deputy attorney general the basis for the warden opposition to the transfer order the deputy attorney general responded that the order was without legal basis.when pressed,the deputy attorney general also argued that,during the temporary transfer,would remain in the constructive custody of the warden,leaving the warden potentially subject to liability if were to attack the guards during the transfer.the court reviewed the sealed affidavit,and again ordered the temporary transfer of 
on may,warden swarthout filed a petition for writ of mandate.by order of may,we requested opposition to be filed by the los angeles county district attorney office da.by letter of may,the da indicated that it did not believe it could represent the culver city police department in the writ petition before this court.the da forwarded the writ petition and our request for opposition to the city attorney of culver city city,indicating that the city attorney would be the proper party to respond.by letter of may,the city attorney disagreed,stating that the da should,in fact,respond to the writ petition and that the city not be designated the responding party.on may,we issued an order to show cause,and directed both the da and the city to file briefs.
contentions of the parties 
warden swarthout contends that there was no authority for the trial court order.specifically,warden swarthout argues that there are statutes which provide for an order transferring a prison inmate to a county jail for specific purposes,and the trial court order in this case does not fall within the scope of those statutes.the da takes the position that the trial court order was valid,but unenforceable.that is to say,the da argues that warden swarthout possesses the authority to temporarily transfer if he chooses to do so,and that the court transfer order could be interpreted as a request that warden swarthout transfer.the da concedes,however,that without warden swarthout consent,the trial court could not compel the transfer of.the city agrees that there is no statutory basis for the trial court transfer order,but contends that it can be upheld as an exercise of the trial court inherent authority to enable it to carry out its duties and ensure the orderly administration of justice.we conclude that there is no statutory basis for the transfer order,nor can it be upheld as a proper exercise of the trial court inherent authority.we therefore grant the petition for writ of mandate.
discussion 
penal code section provides that a court may issue an inmate transfer order w hen it is necessary to have a person imprisoned in the state prison brought before any court to be tried for a felony,or for an examination before a grand jury or magistrate preliminary to such trial,or for the purpose of hearing a motion or other proceedings,to vacate a judgment.similarly,penal code section provides for a transfer order when a prison inmate is a material witness whose testimony is required in a criminal action as transfer was not sought for a criminal appearance,or as a material witness in a criminal action neither of these statutes apply.
the issue then becomes whether the statutes set forth the only situations in which a trial court may order a state prisoner transfer.the city argues that they do not,and that,instead,the trial courts have a common law power to order the temporary transfer of inmates on good cause.we disagree,for the following three reasons first,language in supreme court authority strongly implies that trial courts lack the power to order inmate transfers second,a statute confirming the courts inherent powers code civ,has been held not to apply to transfer orders when there is no existing judicial proceeding and third,any inherent powers of the courts exist only to enable courts to carry out their judicial functions,while this transfer was sought for the purposes of an investigation,an executive branch function.we discuss each reason below.
supreme court language strongly suggests courts lack the non statutory power to transfer inmates 
first,we consider language in payne superior court cal d.in payne,our supreme court considered whether an indigent prison inmate who is the defendant in a civil action suffers a deprivation of his due process right of access to the courts when he is denied the right to personally appear and can not afford a lawyer to represent him.the court concluded that an indigent inmate civil defendant in these circumstances would suffer a constitutional deprivation,and then turned to the issue of remedy.id.at.the supreme court noted that in some cases,counsel should be appointed for the indigent inmate civil defendant.id.at.the court continued,while this remedy will probably suffice in most cases,in other instances it may also be desirable for the prisoner to testify on his own behalf.accordingly,when the trial court determines on motion that the testimony of a prisoner defendant whether indigent or not is needed to protect the due process rights of the parties,it may attempt,through the department of corrections,to arrange the presence of the prisoner.except in a few specified circumstances,a court has no statutory authority to command the department of corrections to transport a prisoner to a civil courtroom.but judges do have a constitutional duty to uphold the due process clause.accordingly,if a court determines that a prisoner personal testimony is needed to preserve due process rights,but the department of corrections refuses accommodation,the court may order a continuance or employ other alternatives to transporting the prisoner,such as recording his testimony or if feasible holding a portion of the trial at the prison.id.at,italics added.the language we have emphasized indicates that our supreme court is of the opinion that trial courts lack the power to transfer inmates outside of the situations specifically provided for by statute.surely,if our supreme court believed that trial courts possessed a common law power to order inmate transfers outside the scope of their statutory powers to do so,it would be a proper exercise of that power to order an inmate transfer to preserve the inmate due process rights in a civil matter.instead,the court concluded that the inmate can not be transferred if the department of corrections refuses,and left trial courts to fashion other remedies to preserve the inmate defendant due process rights.thus,it appears that the california supreme court believes there is no power for courts to order inmate transfers
