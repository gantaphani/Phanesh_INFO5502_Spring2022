factual and procedural summary 
the wechsler marriage dissolution action was initially filed in september.more than three years later,in january,the matter was assigned to commissioner ratekin to preside over postjudgment custody and support matters.during the next several years,the parties had numerous disputes.in,kimberly filed a motion to increase support payments and both parties raised numerous other related issues.kenneth was represented by cary cotten,and kimberly was represented by alexandra.after many continuances and the appointment of an accounting expert,the commissioner scheduled a hearing for november,to resolve pending motions.
one week before the november scheduled hearing,both counsel appeared in court for an ex parte hearing regarding kenneth request to continue the hearing.as they were waiting to be called,told cotten that commissioner ratekin would be officiating at her wedding later in the year in december.when the wechsler matter was called,commissioner ratekin did not mention her upcoming participation in the wedding,and neither party raised the issue.the court denied kenneth continuance request.
two days later,on october,kimberly filed a declaration and motion seeking additional attorney fees and costs.three days later,kenneth counsel filed a verified statement of disqualification,asserting that commissioner ratekin should be disqualified for cause because the commissioner agreement to officiate in counsel wedding might lead a person aware of the facts to entertain a doubt about the commissioner ability to be impartial in handling the case.a a iii.specifically,cotten claimed any average person would entertain doubts when learning that the commissioner was personally close enough to one of the attorneys to agree to officiate her wedding while at the same time presiding over a case involving that attorney.
commissioner ratekin filed a verified answer denying there were grounds for disqualification.commissioner ratekin said she did not have a personal relationship with,and she could and would remain impartial in the action i have been acquainted with kimberly counsel,for the past few years through her appearances in my court and through our respective appearances at professional legal functions.i am not otherwise acquainted or personally close with.approximately one month ago while i was conducting a settlement conference in another case in which and another attorney appeared as counsel of record,asked if i would perform her wedding ceremony later this year and i agreed.my intention is solely to perform the wedding ceremony and not to stay for any reception.when counsel thereafter appeared ex parte in this case on october,the subject of my performance of the wedding for did not come to my mind.as a result,i did not disclose that i am scheduled to officiate at the ceremony.my officiating at wedding will have no impact on my handling of this case.i take no offense to this challenge.i believe that i have been and can continue to be impartial to all parties and counsel.
the matter was assigned to judge barton for the limited purpose of ruling on the disqualification motion.see code civ,subd.c.after reviewing the statement of disqualification and commissioner ratekin verified answer,the court denied the motion.the court found kenneth did not meet his burden to show a close personal relationship between and commissioner ratekin that would raise doubts regarding commissioner ratekin ability to remain impartial.the court also noted that the performance of a marriage ceremony is a ministerial act,and not a judicial act requiring the exercise of judicial discretion,citing people ex rel.mcdonald bush cal.
one week later,kenneth petitioned for a writ of mandate in this court,contending disqualification was required because of the appearance of partiality under section a a iii.although kenneth challenge in the trial court focused on the purported personal relationship between the commissioner and kimberly counsel,in his writ petition he argued primarily that the mere act of officiating at a wedding compels disqualification.
in her response,on behalf of her client argued disqualification was not required because there is no close personal relationship existing between the commissioner and me.she asserted because commissioner ratekin is only appearing at the ceremony,and leaving immediately thereafter,i will not have a chance to speak with her at the ceremony and the expectation is only that she will be supervising the recitation of the vows,exchange of wedding rings and signing the marriage license.also submitted a lengthy supporting declaration.however,did not present this declaration in the proceedings below,and judge barton did not consider the asserted facts when ruling on the motion.thus,we can not consider the declaration in ruling on this writ petition,and we can not consider facts discussed in kimberly opposition that are asserted for the first time in this court.
in reply,kenneth expanded on his argument that a judge participation at a wedding created a concern that the judge could not rule fairly and impartially,and noted that many wedding officiants have meaningful personal involvement,such as meeting with the couple to determine their wishes and desires about the ceremony,attending a rehearsal and a rehearsal dinner,and receiving a gift or stipend.kenneth argued that an objective observer could reasonably conclude that a commissioner who agreed to officiate at a litigant attorney wedding could be reluctant to rule against that litigant and attorney,especially in light of the various motions for attorney fees and sanctions that are at issue.
viewing the issue as raising close ethical questions that are likely to recur,we issued an order to show cause.pursuant to the parties agreement,we treated the parties prior written submissions as the formal briefing on the order to show cause

governing legal standards 
a determination on a challenge for cause under section a a iii touches upon the core of the judicial process requiring the appearance of objectivity of the decision maker united farm workers of america superior court d,united farm workers.a party moving for disqualification need not show actual bias because the legislature sought to guarantee not only fairness to individual litigants,but also to ensure public confidence in the judiciary people freeman cal th,which may be irreparably harmed if a case is allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted.in re kensington international,cir,italics added interpreting the analogous federal statute.a party has the right to an objective decision maker and to a decision maker who appears to be fair and impartial.
section a a iii states that a judge is disqualified if a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.impartiality entails the absence of bias or prejudice in favor of,or against,particular parties or classes of parties,as well as maintenance of an open mind.haworth superior court cal th,haworth.the applicable disqualification standard is an objective one if a fully informed,reasonable member of the public would fairly entertain doubts that the judge is impartial,the judge should be disqualified.flier superior court th.

ii.analysis 
we agree with kimberly there is no indication that commissioner ratekin agreement to officiate at kimberly counsel wedding shows bias or that she could not be impartial in all her future rulings.however,as kenneth correctly argues,the existence of bias is not the standard here.the standard is whether a reasonable person aware of the facts would entertain doubts as to whether the commissioner could be impartial in this case.would an objective layperson aware of all relevant facts reasonably conclude that commissioner ratekin could not be impartial and would tend to favor a litigant because the commissioner officiated at the litigant counsel wedding 
in answering this question,we do not write on a clean slate.in people carter,supra,cal th carter,the california supreme court rejected the defendant claims that a trial judge act of officiating at the prosecutor daughter wedding several months before the commencement of a death penalty trial created an appearance of partiality under section a a iii.
in carter,the defendant moved to disqualify the trial judge superior court judge melinda lasater based on the defendant assertions of close personal ties between the prosecutor and judge lasater.carter,supra,cal th at.these connections included that judge lasater and the prosecutor had previously worked together in the district attorney office the judge family had gone camping with the prosecutor family in addition to other families the judge husband had purchased the prosecutor son dirt bike approximately years earlier the prosecutor daughter had house sat for the judge one year earlier and been paid a minimal amount and the judge and the prosecutor had sporadic social contacts at parties.id.at.additionally,several months before the death penalty trial was scheduled to begin,judge lasater officiated at the wedding of the prosecutor daughter at his daughter request.ibid.as part of this activity,the judge had gone to lunch with the prosecutor daughter and wife,and the daughter gave the judge a necklace similar to necklaces given to the bridesmaids.id.at fn.see carter chappell,wl,district court denial of carter habeas relief petition.regarding the wedding,judge lasater stated in a declaration it is common practice for judges of this court to perform wedding ceremonies for members of the legal community and their families.my agreement to perform the wedding ceremony for the prosecutor daughter was such an arrangement and was done at his daughter request,rather than the prosecutor.i was not paid to perform the ceremony and specifically indicated that no fee should be paid.carter,at,fn.judge lasater denied that she had any biases,and stated her relationship with the prosecutor was primarily a professional relationship and not a close personal friendship.ibid.
another superior court judge conducted a hearing on the defendant disqualification motion,and denied the motion.carter,supra,cal th at.the court found a reasonable person aware of the facts regarding the prior relationship between the prosecutor and judge lasater would not reasonably entertain a doubt that judge lasater will be able to be impartial in the case.ibid.
after carter was convicted and sentenced to death,he challenged the court ruling for the first time.carter,supra,cal th at.the california supreme court held the defendant waived the disqualification issue by failing to file a timely writ petition code civ,subd.d,but alternatively addressed the issue on its merits and found no grounds for disqualification.carter,supra,at.the court stated even if we were to overlook the procedural deficiency inherent in defendant challenge to the denial of his disqualification motion,we would find no merit in the assertion that judge lasater had a responsibility to recuse herself in view of her prior professional and casual social relationship with the prosecutor.defendant provides no statutory or case law authority in support of that position,and we are aware of none.because virtually all judges are drawn from the ranks of the legal profession,such prior relationships are neither unusual nor dispositive.see united farm workers of america superior court,supra,d,t he proper performance of judicial duties does not require a judge to withdraw from society and live an ascetic,antiseptic and socially sterile life.in our view,the court correctly determined a reasonable person would not entertain a doubt as to judge lasater impartiality.citations.ibid.
the carter court found the judge act of officiating at the wedding of the prosecutor daughter,along with intermittent social and professional contacts,was insufficient to show an appearance of bias.the circumstances here show an even more attenuated connection between the judicial officer and the attorney.the undisputed evidence shows,and judge barton found,that and commissioner ratekin had no preexisting social or personal relationship and that commissioner ratekin participation in the wedding was purely an official function.unlike in carter,there was no evidence commissioner ratekin would recei
