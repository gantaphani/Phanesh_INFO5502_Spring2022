this maritime insurance case from puerto rico arises on interlocutory appeal from the denial of the plaintiff insurers motion for summary judgment that payment under its policy was excused by the insured breach of warranty.the prevailing view,both in federal law and state maritime insurance law,is that a breach of a warranty will excuse the maritime insurer from payment regardless of any causal connection to the loss.the district court erroneously applied a different view.we reverse the district court and direct entry of judgment for plaintiff insurers.
as this comes to us on appeal from a motion for summary judgment,we review the district court ruling de novo,taking the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovants,the defendants.toledo,cir littlefield acadia ins,cir.
the plaintiffs,a group of insurance companies and underwriters including lloyd of london,gothaer versicherungen ag,great lakes reinsurance uk plc,and ing insurance sa,issued an insurance policy to william which provided hull,machinery,and liability coverage for his recently purchased pleasure boat,the gabriella.the effective dates of the policy were from january,to january.the policy was embodied in a insuring agreement which includes a section entitled general conditions warranties.
on july,as the gabriella was traveling to culebra,an island off of puerto rico,an exhaust hose came loose and the gabriella began taking on water through the boat exhaust system.attempts to pump out the water were unsuccessful,and the gabriella flooded and sank.the insured later submitted a claim to the plaintiffs for for the loss of the boat and for the costs incurred during salvage operations.
the insurers began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident.the investigation found,inter alia,that the loss of the gabriella was caused by wear and tear,gradual deterioration,and lack of maintenance and that the vessel fire extinguishing equipment had not been inspected or certified within the preceding year,and that the automatic engine room fire extinguisher system had been disconnected prior to the loss.there was no finding,and it has never been asserted by the insurers,that the condition of the fire extinguishing equipment had any relation whatsoever to the sinking of the boat.however,the insurers do assert that the lack of maintenance of the fire extinguishing equipment violated an express warranty of the insurance contract providing that such fire extinguishing equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order.
the plaintiff insurers then sought a declaratory judgment in federal district court in puerto rico that the breach by the insured of the fire extinguisher warranty in the insurance contract precluded payment of the insured claim.the defendants denied all the allegations and counterclaimed under the insurance contract for the amount of their original insurance claim.
plaintiff insurers moved for summary judgment.the motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended that summary judgment be denied and that triable issues of material fact existed.in an unpublished order,the district court adopted in part the magistrate judge recommendations and denied the motion for summary judgment.plaintiffs then filed a motion for reconsideration which was also denied in another unpublished order.we describe below the portions of the district court reasoning that are pertinent to our analysis.
appellate jurisdiction exists under a,which provides this court with jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals in admiralty cases of orders determining the rights and liabilities of the parties.
our review of the district court summary judgment ruling is de novo.littlefield,at.as framed by the parties and the district court,two key issues must be addressed for summary judgment purposes.the first issue is whether the contested maritime insurance warranty clause is ambiguous.the second is whether,if the clause is not ambiguous and has been breached by the insured,the breach excuses the insurer from payment.
ambiguity of the fire extinguisher warranty clause 
the district court erroneously held the fire extinguisher warranty clause was ambiguous subsection of the policy is entitled general conditions and warranties.subsection l of the policy provides 
if the scheduled vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment,then it is warranted that such equipment is properly installed and is maintained in good working order.this includes the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.
this clause follows after subsection k,which provides 
it is warranted that covered persons must at all times comply with relevant statutes,laws,and coast guard and other regulations,governing the use of the scheduled vessel.
it is clear that subsection l is a warranty provision.the clause plainly states that it is a warranty and it is located in the section of the policy where warranties are set forth.
the contract interpretation question of whether there is an ambiguity in the warranty clause is one for the court.see littlefield,at whether there is any ambiguity in provisions of a maritime insurance contract is a question of law for the court to determine.see also tropeano dorman,cir the question of whether a contract is ambiguous is one for the courts.russ segalla,couch on insurance ed.whether or not a contract of insurance is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.it is a question we review de novo.littlefield,at crowe bolduc,cir.there is no ambiguity in the warranty clause at issue here.
the first sentence of subsection l is a warranty from the insured that if the vessel is fitted with fire extinguishing equipment,as the vessel here was,such equipment is properly installed and maintained in good working order.the second sentence provides the further definition that such proper installation and maintenance includes the weighing of tanks once a year and recharging as necessary.this is a promissory warranty on the part of the insured.see couch on insurance,supra,promissory warranty is one by which the insured stipulates that something shall be done or omitted after the policy takes effect and during its continuance see also commercial union ins.flagship marine,cir defining warranty as a promise by which the assured undertakes that some particular thing shall or shall not be done,or that some condition shall be fulfilled quoting buglass,marine insurance general average in the united states ed.
the date that the parties entered into the insurance contract does not matter.the insured warrants upon entering into the policy that the tanks have been weighed once a year and,if necessary,recharged,as part of the insured warranty of proper maintenance of fire extinguishing equipment.that this is a clear obligation is reinforced by the introductory clause in the contract that states we will provide the insurance coverage described in this insuring agreement,in return for payment to us of the premium due and compliance by covered persons with the provisions,conditions and warranties of this insuring agreement.emphasis added.
since the warranty is clear and unambiguous,it must be enforced as written under usual insurance law.see couch on insurance,supra,i t is a well settled rule that clear and unambiguous clauses must be accepted as the expression of the intent of the parties,and enforced by the courts as written.
it is also undisputed that the insured failed to produce any evidence of compliance with the promissory warranty relating to the fire extinguishers.thus,the insured was in breach of the promissory warranty.
consequences of the breach of warranty 
in light of the insured breach,the question,then,is the effect of this breach.
the district court reasoned that puerto rico law would apply.it acknowledged that chapter of puerto rico insurance code,which covers contract interpretation and construction,expressly excludes maritime insurance contracts from its coverage see laws ann.tit,the applicable provisions of this chapter shall apply to insurances other than ocean marine insurances.the court reasoned it should turn by default to the puerto rico civil code.in the absenc
