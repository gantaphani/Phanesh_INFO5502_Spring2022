factual and procedural background 
in november,union labor life insurance company union labor and its subsidiary,union standard of america life insurance company usa life collectively,agreed to sell their medicare supplement and medicare select insurance policies the medicare block to united teacher associates insurance company united teacher.
prior to putting the medicare block up for sale,had entered into two consent orders with the florida department of insurance fdi that restricted future premium rate increases on the medicare block.first,on may,entered into a consent order restricting premium rate increases to trend on the florida medicare select policies for a period,followed by a reevaluation of the anticipated lifetime loss ratio at the end of this period second,on june,entered into a consent order with the fdi that allowed for a premium rate increase on the medicare supplement policies in force prior to the effective date of the consent order,but restricted future increases to trend unless union labor had credible experience on new issues according to united teacher,the and consent orders significantly affected the profitability of the medicare select and medicare supplement policies.
after union labor put the medicare block up for sale it assembled a due diligence team,led by union labor associate actuary jennifer lazio,to respond to requests for information from prospective purchasers.when larry doze,the president of united teacher,learned that the medicare block was up for bid through a broker,he requested information about it.lazio responded by sending him the information for the medicare supplement policies and an actuarial memorandum about the medicare select policies.lazio did not,however,mention the consent orders.doze subsequently requested,as part of his due diligence investigation,other documents and information to assess the profitability of the medicare block.he did not specifically request information about consent orders or impediments to future rate increases,and he received no such information.united teacher also conducted an visit to the offices of union labor administrator,the american insurance administration group aiag,but did not learn of the consent orders from this visit.at one point in the negotiations,lazio told doze that the fdi had recently approved a increase in the medicare supplement premiums and an increase in the medicare select premiums,but she did not tell him that these increases were pursuant to the consent orders.united teacher now claims that was fraudulently hiding the consent orders from it.
in november,united teacher decided to purchase the medicare block,and it entered into a letter agreement to that effect with,with a formal written agreement to follow.in august,united teacher decided not to follow through with the purchase.accordingly,on december,sued united teacher in the district court for the district of columbia for relief arising out of united teacher failure to consummate the transaction.on october,the parties settled the litigation,and agreed to pay united teacher million for united teacher to acquire the medicare block from it.at the time of settlement,united teacher still did not know about the consent orders.
during the settlement negotiations,united teacher concluded that it would need to seek rate increases aggressively on the medicare block to make it profitable.accordingly,it asked to permit it to do the rate increase filings for the various states that required them.agreed,but it suggested that it union labor handle the rate filings for the state of florida.united teacher agreed to this arrangement.when the fdi only approved increases of and rather than the increases requested,doze asked for the florida rate filing information,including all communications with the fdi.
agreements related to the sale of the medicare block the agreements were signed on october,with closing to occur on october.in a conference call on october,lazio mentioned for the first time that the consent order existed.in response,united teacher once again requested the rate filing information,and on november,union labor produced it to united teacher.on december,united teacher,which by then understood the full impact of the consent order,notified of its intent to rescind the medicare block transaction.by this time,the deadline for reopening the lawsuit had passed.that same day,united teacher filed suit against in texas state court alleging fraud and seeking rescission of the agreements,and it ceased its efforts at completing the transaction with.according to united teacher,failed to disclose material facts about the sale of the medicare block during the due diligence phase.at the time of the lawsuit,was still administering the medicare block and was incurring losses from claims submitted by the insureds.removed the lawsuit to federal court,united teacher amended its complaint to request damages,and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the agreements were valid and an order of specific performance against united teacher.on october,nearly a year after it learned about the consent order,united teacher,which was investigating a discrepancy in the medicare select line lifetime loss ratios,learned for the first time of the consent order.
in september,a bench trial was held on united teacher fraud claim and on declaratory judgment counterclaim.the district court subsequently issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law the findings and a final judgment on march,in which it found that united teacher had not proven fraud.in its decision,the district court stated,inter alia,that in texas,for a duty of disclosure to arise there must be a confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties and no confidential or fiduciary relationship existed between united teacher and.the district court did not address counterclaim in its findings.accordingly,filed a motion to alter or amend,in which it requested that the district court amend its judgment to address its counterclaim.on april,the district court amended its final judgment to state that the agreements are valid and binding,and that united teacher must perform its obligations thereunder.additionally,the district court awarded costs to.on may,united teacher appealed the district court amended final judgment case.
on may,demanded that united teacher immediately pay all amounts due and owing to under the agreements and take steps to consummate the transfer of the medicare block according to,the amount due and owing at that time was for insurance losses and expenses associated with the policies that united teacher had agreed to assume.united teacher allegedly failed to pay the amount that it owed and failed to perform the tasks necessary to effectuate the district court order.accordingly,filed a motion to reopen and for further relief the motion for further relief under,in which it asked the district court to order payment of the money that was owed and to again order united teacher to perform its obligations under the agreements.without issuing a written opinion or conducting a hearing,the district court summarily denied the motion for further relief.subsequently filed an appeal of this denial case.this appeal was consolidated with united teacher appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the existence of a duty to disclose 
united teacher first claims that the district court erred when it found that had not committed fraud because it did not have a duty to disclose the consent orders to united teacher absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship between united teacher and.according to united teacher,a duty to disclose can exist in texas even when there is no confidential or fiduciary relationship between the parties.
united teacher begins its argument by noting that in texas,a plaintiff wishing to prove fraud must establish a material representation,which was false,and which was either known to be false when made or was asserted without knowledge of its truth formosa plastics presidio eng rs.contractors,internal quotation marks omitted.united teacher also notes that the texas supreme court has stated that w hen the particular circumstances impose on a person a duty to speak and he deliberately remains silent,his silence is equivalent to a false representation.spoljaric percival tours.united teacher then cites union pacific resources group,cir,for the claim that a duty to disclose can exist in texas absent a fiduciary or confidential relationship.in,this court stated 
a duty to speak arises by operation of law when a confidential or fiduciary duty relationship exists between the parties or one party learns later that his previous statement was false and misleading or one party knows that the other party is relying on a concealed fact and does not have an equal opportunity to discover the truth or one party voluntarily discloses some but less than all material facts,so that he must disclose the whole truth,all material facts,lest his partial disclosure convey a false impression.
at.according to united teacher,the district court should have invoked the doctrine of stare decisis and held that,in accordance with,had a duty to disclose the consent orders.united teacher also notes that this court,as well as texas intermediate appellate courts,have reached similar conclusions in a number of other cases,both before and after the texas supreme court decided bradford vento,the case on which the district court and rely.see,rimade hubbard,cir lewis bank of am.na,cir per curiam citizens bank allen rae,worth pellegrini moon joint venture,no pet.lesikar rappeport,pet.denied hoggett brown,dist,pet.denied ralston purina mckendrick,antonio,writ denied.accordingly,united teacher contends that the district court,in making its erie guess,incorrectly stated that the holding in was no longer in accord with texas state law.
responds by arguing that in bradford,which was decided three weeks after,the supreme court of texas conclusively established that a duty to disclose does not exist in texas absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship.in support of this claim,cites the following language from bradford 
several courts of appeals have held that a general duty to disclose information may arise in an arm length business transaction when a party makes a partial disclosure that,although true,conveys a false impression.see,hoggett brown,dist,no writ ralston purina,at.the restatement second of torts section also recognizes a general duty to disclose facts in a commercial setting.in such cases,a party does not make an affirmative misrepresentation,but what is said is misleading because other facts are not disclosed.we have never adopted section.
bradford,at emphasis added some internal citations omitted additionally,notes that the texas supreme court in bradford cited its decision in smithkline beecham doe,in which it similarly stated that section of the restatement second of torts recognizes a general duty to disclose facts in a commercial setting,which could encompass the duty doe seeks in this case this court has cited section only once,but has never embraced it as a rule of law in texas.id.citing smithkline beecham,at internal citations omitted.finally,states that this court,as well as texas intermediate appellate courts,have before and after bradford stated that no duty to disclose exists in texas absent a fiduciary or confidential relationship.see coburn supply,kohler,cir imperial premium,khoury,cir bay colony trendmaker,cir engstrom first bank of eagle lake,dist,writ denied travel music of san antonio,douglas,wl,at antonio,may,not designated for publication.accordingly,argues that the district court correctly concluded that because the texas supreme court explicitly declined in bradford to adopt the disclosure duties described in and in cases like hoggett,and because the texas supreme court has only explicitly recognized a duty to disclose in the context of a confidential or fiduciary relationship,a duty to disclose does not exist in texas absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship.

a reasonable jurist might well conclude,certainly after bradford,that a duty to disclose exists in texas only in the context of a confidential or fiduciary relationship.this court has so held in coburn,the only fifth circuit case that discusses the relevant portion of bradford.however,apart from coburn,it would be fair to say that courts after bradford including this court have not gotten the message,but have instead continued to find that a duty to disclose can exist in texas absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship.see,rimade,at lewis,at citizens bank,at pellegrini,at but see travel music,wl,at.
fortunately,we need not decide whether a duty to disclose exists in texas absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship because,even if such a duty did exist,united teacher fraud claim would fail.in texas,fraud occurs when the defendant misrepresented a material fact the defendant knew the material representation was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of its truth the defendant made the false material representation with the intent that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff and the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation and thereby suffered injury.ernst young,at.the first requirement of this test can be met if the defendant concealed or failed to disclose a material fact when a duty to disclose existed.see new process steel,steel of texas,dist,writ ref moore moore drilling white,writ ref.assuming,arguendo,that united teacher has established the first prong of this test because had a duty to disclose the consent orders,united teacher fraud claim nevertheless fails because it can not prove fraudulent intent.in its findings of fact and conclusions of law,the district court noted that clause of the agreement for reinsurance states 
to the best of union labor knowledge,information and belief,no warranty or representation made by the company in this agreement nor in any writing furnished or to be furnished by union labor to united teacher pursuant hereto or in connection herewith contains or will contain any untrue statement of material fact or omits or will fail to state,any material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading.
the district court interpreted this clause as an affirmative representation that union labor disclosed all material information necessary to make other representations related to the sale not misleading.the district court then analyzed whether committed fraud by intentionally concealing or failing to disclose the consent orders during the parties negotiations,thereby misleading united teacher.the district court wrote 
omitted material information.united teacher asserts that the omitted material information was the existence of the consent orders and that disclosing the existence of the consent orders was necessary to make other information provided by union labor during negotiations not misleading.there can be no doubt,and the court finds,that the existence of the consent orders and their content was information material to united teacher in analyzing the proposed purchase.united teacher offers several examples of how information furnished by union labor was rendered misleading by the failure to disclose the consent order.lazio disclosed to doze that union labor received a rate increase on the florida medicare supplement policies on june,and an increase for the florida medicare select policies on december,without disclosing that these increases were related to the and consent orders.later,in connection with the florida rate filings,lazio advised doze that union labor had received an rate increase on the medicare select business and that the request on the supplement business was pending.when florida offered a rate increase rather than the requested,lazio did not inform doze that the low increase was the result of the consent order.
union labor knowledge and intent.united teacher alleges that union labor knew the consent orders were material and intentionally concealed them from united teacher during negotiations.as evidence of union labor fraudulent intent,united teacher points to union labor insistence on performing the florida rate filing,which,if performed by united teacher,would have led to its discovery of the consent orders.united teacher argues that union labor failure to send the filing information to doze promptly after he requested it is further evidence of union labor intent to conceal the consent orders.however,union labor explained that it performed the florida rate filing because it had access to the necessary information and that when doze later requested the filing information,it was not readily available because an outside consultant had actually prepared the filing.further,lazio,a young actuary with almost no experience in conducting due diligence for the purchase or sale of a business,credibly testified that she did not know that the consent orders,signed by union labor and the florida department of insurance,would also bind united teacher and that,since doze did not specifically request information in the category of the consent orders,she did not think to produce them.
united teacher has presented evidence that union labor may have intended to conceal the consent orders,but union labor explanations for its allegedly suspicious behavior are plausible.united teacher has failed in its burden of proof and persuasion.
united teacher assocs.ins.union labor life ins,d,emphasis added.united teacher does not challenge this finding by the district court on appeal.nevertheless,it contends that this finding is not dispositive of its claim of fraud by nondisclosure because the district court analysis regarding intent only applied to fraud by affirmative misrepresentation.in support of this claim,united teacher states that the intent requirement for fraud by affirmative misrepresentation does not exist with respect to fraud by nondisclosure.specifically,united teacher argues that it need not prove intent in order to establish fraud by nondisclosure,since intent is irrelevant when an affirmative duty to disclose exists and was violated.this is wrong.courts in texas have consistently held that fraud by nondisclosure or concealment requires proof of all of the elements of fraud by affirmative misrepresentation,including fraudulent intent,with the exception that the misrepresentation element can be proven by the nondisclosure or concealment of a material fact in light of a duty to disclose.see,schlumberger tech.swanson,holding that fraud by is simply a subcategory of fraud requiring,proof of reliance healthcare cottey,no pet.stating intent as an element of fraud by nondisclosure and finding sufficient evidence of intent to support the jury verdict peltier,hilton,holding that fraudulent concealment requires proof of the same elements as fraud by affirmative misrepresentation.because the intent prong is the same in texas for fraud by affirmative misrepresentation as it is for fraud by nondisclosure or concealment,the district court finding of a lack of fraudulent intent would apply equally if the district court had found that a common law duty to disclose the consent orders existed.accordingly,the district court unchallenged finding of no fraudulent intent in the nondisclosure of the consent orders is fatal to united teacher fraud by nondisclosure claim,regardless of whether or not a duty to disclose the consent orders existed.we therefore need not reach the question of whether a duty to disclose can exist in texas absent a confidential or fiduciary relationship 
b.the denial of motion for further relief under 
in its appeal,argues that the district court erred by denying its motion for further relief under.according to,pursuant to the agreements and retroactive to october,united teacher became reinsurer with respect to the medicare block until the policies were transferred to united teacher in its motion to reopen and for further relief,sought to recover in the form of a monetary award the money owed to it under the agreements,and it also requested that the district court further order united teacher to perform its obligations under the agreements.claims that it was entitled to monetary relief because the district court had previously awarded a declaration that the agreements are valid and binding and that united teacher must perform its obligations thereunder and an order of specific performance as to the agreements.nevertheless,the district court,without a hearing or written opinion,denied motion.
in support of its claim that the district court erred by denying its motion for further relief,argues that money damages should be awarded where such relief is necessary or proper to effectuate a declaratory judgment.in support of this claim,cites several cases from other circuits that,in estimation,have held that a party can effectuate a prior declaratory judgment by obtaining money damages pursuant to a motion for further relief under.further argues that parties often obtain declaratory judgments construing their rights under agreements and then,at a later date,seek further relief under in the form of a monetary award or equitable relief in order to realize the full benefit of the declaratory judgment in their favor.according to,if this ability to seek further relief under were removed,favorable declarations of a party rights would be a meaningless exercise.in this vein,claims that the monetary award and injunctive relief requested in its motion for further relief was necessary to effectuate properly the declaration of the validity of the agreements and the order of specific performance,and it argues that the district court therefore erred by denying the motion.
as previously stated,after a bench trial,findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and issues of law are reviewed de novo.kona tech,at.if the denial of a motion for further relief under is based on a question of law,it is reviewed de novo.see united ins.sst fitness,cir,bd.of comm rs of jay county,cir ins.servs.of beaufort,aetna cas.and surety,cir.that said,we have held that the district court decision to grant or deny declaratory relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion because says that a district court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested parties.see am.states ins.bailey,cir citing wilton seven falls,d.likewise,because says that a district court may award further relief,the district court refusal to award damages under is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.see besler united states dep t of,cir applying an abuse of discretion standard to the denial of further relief under.finally,this court reviews a district court ruling on the application of res judicata de novo.sid richardson carbon gasoline interenergy,cir.
because the district court denied the motion for further relief without a hearing or written opinion,we do not know why the district court denied the motion.accordingly,we first consider whether motion was the proper type of motion to effectuate the declaratory judgment in favor.we then consider the possible reasons advanced by united teacher for denying the requested relief to see if any of them could have served as the basis for the district court decision.
we begin by addressing whether the relief requested by was the sort of relief that the district court could provide in response to a motion for further relief under.section states further necessary or proper relief based on a declaratory judgment or decree may be granted,after reasonable notice and hearing,against any adverse party whose rights have been determined by such judgment.this court has held that under,the prevailing party in a declaratory judgment action may seek further relief in the form of damages or an injunction.kaspar wire works,leco eng g,cir see also fire ins.of hartford bd.of pub.instruction of madison county,cir citing for the proposition that t he federal declaratory judgment act contemplates that all necessary or proper relief based on the declaratory judgment should be granted.other circuits that have addressed the type of relief available under have reached similar conclusions.for instance,in besler,at,the government prevailed on its counterclaim against a group of ranchers for a declaratory judgment that it was not estopped from recovering monies improperly paid to the ranches under a federal program.subsequently,the government sought the monies due and,when the ranchers refused to pay,sought recovery through a motion for further relief.as in the present case,the district court summarily denied the motion without a hearing or opinion.the eighth circuit held that the district court abused its discretion by summarily denying the motion,and it reversed and remanded to the district court for a determination of the amounts owed,stating that monetary relief under was appropriate because the declaratory judgment previously entered by the district court conclusively established the government right to recoup the benefits received by the appellees.besler,at.likewise,in horn hardart national rail passenger,the circuit affirmed the district court award of further relief under after one party failed to meet its obligations as set forth in the court prior declaratory judgment.similarly,in gant grand lodge of texas,cir,the plaintiff sought both coercive and declaratory relief in the original proceeding.subsequently,the plaintiff sought further relief pursuant to to increase the payments the plaintiff was to receive under the declaratory judgment.the tenth circuit affirmed the district court decision granting the request for further relief,stating that permits the original judgment to be supplemented either by damages or by equitable relief even though coercive relief might have been available at the time of the declaratory action.id.at citing charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.finally,in security mutual casualty century casualty,cir,a reinsurer filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to limit its exposure in connection with a judgment against a party insured by the primary insurer.the primary insurer filed a counterclaim,in which it requested a declaratory judgment that the reinsurer was liable to it under the terms of the reinsurance agreement.the district court found in favor of the primary insurer,issued a declaratory judgment stating that the reinsurer was liable under the terms of the reinsurance agreement,and dismissed the case.sec,at.subsequently,the primary insurer moved for an amended judgment under,requesting that the court calculate,and then award to it,monetary damages.the district court treated the motion as being made pursuant to the.e and denied it as untimely.the tenth circuit affirmed the district court decision,but held that the primary insurer was clearly entitled to obtain money damages for the amounts owed to it under the reinsurance agreement pursuant to.see sec,at.according to the tenth circuit,because the district court declaratory judgment established the primary insurer rights under the reinsurance agreement,monetary damages could be obtained through a motion for further relief pursuant to.see id.thus,as is clear from these cases and from the language of,a party can file a motion for further relief requesting monetary damages under to effectuate a prior declaratory judgment.accordingly,filed the right type of motion when it requested further relief under to effectuate the declaratory judgment in its favor previously entered by the district court.
having established that could seek money damages through its motion for further relief to effectuate the district court prior declaratory judgment,we turn to united teacher arguments for why such relief was not justified in this case.united teacher primary argument is that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel preclude the further relief requested by.this argument fails.united teacher preclusion argument is based on the premise that requested money damages below and was denied such relief.this contention is false.never requested money damages in its counterclaim,nor did it request money damages at trial.similarly,while motion to alter or amend referred to the fact that united teacher owed money to it,did not request monetary relief against united teacher in this motion in support of its claim that requested money damages at trial,united teacher cites the following exchange between counsel,christakos,and united teacher counsel,ruiz 
christakos how much does united teacher currently owe to union labor and usa life on this transaction 
ruiz objection,your honor.i going to object to the relevance,because that not in their counterclaim.
christakos it in the counterclaim for declaration that the agreements are valid,and an order that they perform them.i would like the most current amount owed to be in the record it part of that counterclaim.
while this exchange indicated to the district court that united teacher indebtedness to was accruing at a rapid pace,this exchange alone does not demonstrate that requested money damages as part of its counterclaim.in fact,no discovery has ever been conducted on damages,and the record indicates that prior to motion for further relief,no specific request for monetary relief had ever been made to the court.united teacher citation to passing remarks about money damages at trial and in their motion to alter or amend does not change this fact.moreover,it would have been illogical for the district court explicitly to have ordered specific performance and held that the agreements which provided for monetary damages were binding,while at the same time implicitly holding that united teacher did not have to pay the monetary damages provided for by the agreements.accordingly,because never requested money damages before filing its motion for further relief,the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are inapplicable 
united teacher additionally claims that the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant further relief because united teacher filed its appeal of the district court judgment before filed its motion for further relief.this argument also fails.courts that have addressed when a motion for further relief may be brought under have consistently held that neither the filing of an appeal nor a lengthy delay after the trial court initial ruling terminates the court authority to grant further relief pursuant to.see,horn hardart,at mcnally am.states ins,cir per curiam edward marks music charles harris music publ g,cir.the supreme court decision in griggs provident consumer discount,d,does not undermine this conclusion.in griggs,the supreme court held that t he filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.griggs,at.emphasis added.if we were to hold that the act of lodging an appeal of a declaratory judgment nullifies the prevailing party right to seek further relief under,we would countermand griggs statement that the filing of an appeal divests the district court of its control only over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.see griggs,at.horn hardart,at to rule otherwise would allow the party against whom a declaratory judgment is rendered to nullify her adversary right to relief merely by lodging an appeal.indeed,such a forfeiture rule would conflict not only with common sense,but also with the principle that when a party files a notice of appeal the district court only surrenders its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.quoting griggs,at.see also burford equip.centennial ins,holding that the reservation of jurisdiction for motions for further relief under is a statutory exception to the rule set forth in griggs.here,united teacher appeal concerns only the district court judgment and award of costs pertaining to fraud claim.accordingly,united teacher separate argument that the district court was divested of jurisdiction over motion for further relief under fails.
finally,united teacher argues that motion for further relief was improper because its request for monetary damages was a compulsory counterclaim under.a this argument fails because,as correctly states,request for further relief pursuant to was not an entirely new and different claim,but instead was a request for additional relief flowing from the successful assertion of its earlier claim that the agreements were valid and binding and should be performed.united teacher tries to avoid this result by citing polymer industrial products,which it says stands for the proposition that is no exception to rule a.united teacher reliance on polymer is unavailing.in polymer,the plaintiff sued the defendant for patent infringement.the defendant subsequently began to manufacture a new,yet similar product,and it counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that this new product did not infringe the plaintiff patent rights.the plaintiff never asserted a counterclaim that the second product infringed its patent rights.the court found that both products violated the plaintiff patent rights,and it awarded damages with respect to the first product.the plaintiff then filed a new case seeking damages for the infringement by the second product,arguing that permitted it to obtain such relief.the federal circuit disagreed,holding that the plaintiff claim that the second product infringed its patent rights was a compulsory counterclaim that should have been brought in the first action.polymer,at.polymer is easily distinguishable from the present case.the plaintiff in polymer never instituted a declaratory judgment claim to enforce its patent rights with respect to the second product.accordingly,its claim that it was entitled to damages because of the infringement caused by the second product was an entirely new claim.conversely,in the present case,did institute,and prevail on,a declaratory judgment claim establishing the validity of the agreements and the fact that they should be performed.thus,request for further relief was not a new claim,but instead flowed from,and was consistent with,the declaratory judgment entered in its favor.therefore,united teacher argument that request for money damages should have been brought as a compulsory counterclaim fails.
accordingly,motion for further relief was properly brought under,and none of the reasons advanced by united teacher for why it should be denied is persuasive.the declaratory judgment previously entered by the district court conclusively established the validity of the agreements and the fact that they should be specifically performed.the district court denial of the motion for further relief would effectively render this declaratory judgment meaningless.because of this,because none of united teacher reasons for denial is valid,and because the district court did not state its reasons for denying the requested relief,the district court denial of motion for further relief is unsupportable.see besler,at holding that the district court abused its discretion when,without issuing a written opinion,it summarily denied a motion for further relief pursuant to.accordingly,we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for further relief,vacate the district court denial of the motion for further relief,and remand to the district court to conduct further proceedings to determine the relief to which is entitled.
c.the award of costs to 
finally,united teacher claims that the district court abused its discretion when it awarded certain costs to.a district court has broad discretion in awarding costs,and its decision to award costs will only be reversed upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.migis pearle vision,cir humble oil ref,cir.
first,united teacher contends that was not entitled to any fees or costs associated with william decinque attendance at trial because he did not testify and was corporate representative.this argument fails because both parties had designated decinque as a witness,and he was not called to testify solely to save time at the end of the trial,occidental crude sales,cir united states lynd,cir per curiam.second,united teacher claims that travel expenses for decinque and james mcdermott should not have been awarded because they did not use the most economical rates for travel and because did not provide receipts for mcdermott expenses.united teacher,however,has offered no evidence that decinque and mcdermott did not use the most economical rate available other than noting that jennifer lazio,who flew from a different city than decinque and on different days from mcdermott,obtained a cheaper fare.additionally,the record indicates that mcdermott did in fact submit an invoice for his costs that was attached to the bill of costs filed by in the district court,and the district court accepted this as adequate documentation.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding travel expenses for these witnesses.see c.third,united teacher contends that the district court improperly awarded costs for photocopies because did not submit an itemized invoice and failed to prove that the copies were necessarily obtained for use in the litigation.however,the record indicates that counsel made the appropriate declaration under penalty of perjury that the costs were correct and necessarily incurred in this action,and the district court,in awarding costs,overruled united teacher objection on this point.the fact that did not precisely itemize its photocopying costs does not undermine the district court award.see copeland wasserstein,perella,cir.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding photocopying costs.
finally,united teacher claims that the district court abused its discretion when it awarded subsistence allowances for four of witnesses lake,mcdermott,decinque,and lazio that were greater than the maximum per diem allowance set forth in d.according to united teacher,the maximum allowable per diem rate for austin,texas is per day.it contends,therefore,that,at most,was entitled to in subsistence costs for the eighteen days that these four witnesses attended the trial,not the that was awarded to it 
we find that the district court did abuse its discretion when it awarded subsistence costs to in excess of the per diem amount authorized by statute.section d of title of the united states code states 
a subsistence allowance for a witness shall be paid in an amount not to exceed the maximum per diem allowance prescribed by the administrator of general services,pursuant to section a of title,for official travel in the area of attendance by employees of the federal
