after federal and state authorities brought several actions against real party in interest montrose chemical corporation of california montrose chemical,seeking recovery for environmental damage allegedly caused by its operations at several sites,montrose chemical filed a lawsuit seeking declaratory relief against its primary insurance carriers to establish their duties to defend or indemnify pursuant to the operative commercial general liability policies.one of the defendant primary insurance carriers invoked code of civil procedure section,permitting the exercise of one challenge against the assigned trial judge by each side in the litigation,and the case was reassigned to a new trial judge eventually,the parties entered into settlement agreements,and the primary insurance carrier defendants were dismissed from the action.
montrose chemical amended its complaint to name as a defendant its excess insurance carrier,the home insurance company home insurance,which also invoked section in attempting to exercise a challenge against the trial judge.after objection by montrose chemical to this attempted challenge,the trial judge ordered it stricken on the ground that the interests of home insurance were aligned with those of the primary insurers,and that therefore home insurance must be regarded as on the same side in the litigation as the party that previously had exercised the sole challenge available to that side under the statute.in subsequently granting a petition of home insurance for a writ of mandate,however,the court of appeal determined that more often than not primary and excess insurance carriers have substantially adverse interests requiring that they be regarded as on different sides,and that therefore home insurance was entitled to exercise a separate challenge.
we granted review to decide whether,in a single action brought by the insured against both its primary and excess insurers,the interests of the two types of insurers must be deemed substantially adverse,relegating them to different sides in the litigation and entitling an excess insurance carrier to the exercise of a separate challenge pursuant to section,despite the previous exercise of such a challenge by a primary insurance carrier as we shall explain,we conclude that primary and excess insurance carriers do not necessarily have substantially adverse interests,and that the trial judge,having determined that home insurance had not established that defendants interests were substantially adverse,did not err in striking the challenge of home insurance.accordingly,we reverse the judgment rendered by the court of appeal.
commencing in,the federal government and the state of california brought a series of actions against montrose chemical seeking recovery for environmental damage allegedly caused by its operations at various sites.in,following the filing of the second action against it,montrose chemical brought an action naming as defendants its primary insurers and seeking declaratory relief with regard to defense or indemnification under the operative commercial general liability policies.montrose chemical company of california canadian universal insurance company,et now certain underwriters at lloyd,et.county,no.bc see also montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.in that year,a defendant primary insurer exercised a challenge pursuant to section against the trial judge judge keith wisot then presiding.following assignment of a succession of judges,in judge joseph kalin was assigned to the case for all purposes.over the greater part of the next decade,montrose chemical reached settlements with defendant primary insurers,who subsequently were dismissed from the action.
in,montrose chemical filed a second amended complaint naming as a defendant home insurance,an insurer providing coverage of liability in excess of the maximum coverage for liability provided by the policies of the primary insurers.in,after filing its answer to montrose chemical third amended complaint,home insurance attempted to exercise,pursuant to section,a challenge against judge kalin.montrose chemical filed an objection to the challenge on the ground that the defense side previously had exercised the sole challenge authorized by that statute.
judge kalin held a hearing and found that both the primary and the excess insurers had taken the position that montrose chemical is not entitled to defense or indemnification under the terms of the policies,that the particular,that of the obligation to indemnify montrose been before the court for a number of years,that the pleadings of home insurance somewhat mirror ed the pleadings of other insurance companies in the case,and that,as between home insurance and the primary insurers that previously had settled with montrose chemical,no claims existed relating to exhaustion of policy limits or other issues.based upon those findings,judge kalin determined that the interests of home insurance,as an excess insurer,were not substantially adverse to those of the primary insurers.having found the insurers to be on the same side,the judge ordered stricken the section challenge filed by home insurance.
home insurance filed a petition for writ of mandate in the court of appeal,seeking to have the appellate court direct the trial judge to grant the carrier motion to exercise a separate section challenge.the appellate court concluded that as an excess insurer,home insurance was entitled to exercise a separate challenge because,as a general matter,the interests of defendant primary and excess insurers are substantially adverse,and that to require a trial court to make a factual determination on the issue of conflict of interest would unduly burden that court with the responsibility of deciding the merits of the case.the court of appeal granted the petition and issued the requested writ of mandate.we granted review on petition of real party in interest montrose chemical.
the right to exercise a peremptory challenge against a judge is a creation of did not exist in the common law predating enactment of section.pappa superior court cal d,pappa see mcclenny superior court cal d,fn.mcclenny johnson superior court cal d,johnson.the statute applies equally in civil and criminal matters.jimenez,supra,cal th,d,pappa,supra,cal d at,see people superior court lavi,supra,cal th at,d.
as relevant to our discussion,section provides that no superior court judge shall try any civil or criminal action involving a contested issue of law or fact when it is established that the judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney appearing in the action.subd.a.prejudice may be established by the party or attorney by an oral or written motion without notice supported by affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury or an oral statement under oath that the judge is prejudiced against the party or attorney so that the party or attorney can not or believes that he or she can not have a fair and impartial trial before the judge.subd.a.the most significant provision related to the issue before us states except as provided in this section,no party or attorney shall be permitted to make more than one such motion in any one action or special proceeding pursuant to this section and in actions or special proceedings where there may be more than one plaintiff or similar party or more than one defendant or similar party appearing in the action or special proceeding,only one motion for each side may be made in any one action or special proceeding.subd.a,italics added.
section permits a party to obtain the disqualification of a judge for prejudice,based solely upon a sworn statement,without being required to establish prejudice as a matter of fact to the satisfaction of the court.pappa,supra,cal d at,johnson,supra,cal d at,grant superior court th,d barrett superior court th,d.when a party timely files,in proper form,a motion to disqualify a judge based upon this provision,the trial court is bound to accept the disqualification without further inquiry.jimenez,supra,cal th at,d,solberg superior court cal d,solberg barrett superior court,supra,th at,d avital superior court d.avital.
at the same time,section is designed to prevent abuse by parties that merely seek to delay a trial or obtain a more favorable judicial forum.peracchi superior court cal th,d,peracchi jimenez,supra,cal th at,d,solberg,supra,cal d at,people escobedo d,fn.an important element of that design is the limitation,in any one action,of each party to a single motion,or each side to a single motion,should there be more than one plaintiff or defendant,subd.a.the phrase only one motion for each side contemplates that one side may consist of several parties,and a peremptory challenge by any party disqualifies the judge on behalf of all parties on that side.pappa,supra,cal d at.this limitation also reflects the general aim of the legislation to strike a balance between the needs of litigants and the operating efficiency of the courts.people escobedo,supra,d at.
to effectuate the legislatures intent,our courts have been vigilant to enforce the statutory restrictions on the number and timing of motions permitted.solberg,supra,cal d at,jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.we have not permitted a device intended for spare and protective use to be converted into a weapon of offense and thereby to become an obstruction to efficient judicial administration.peracchi,supra,cal th at,d,philo lumber d.see jimenez,supra,cal th at,d.
consistent with this legislative aim,when a party among several on the same side has disqualified a trial judge pursuant to section and subsequently is dismissed from the action,the disqualification is not thereby remaining parties on the same side are not entitled to a new peremptory challenge.philo lumber,supra,d at.wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence,supra.similarly,when a party on the same side has exercised its right to disqualify a judge,a party has no right to challenge the judge,because that side has used its one challenge.school dist.of okaloosa county superior court th,d.conversely,when parties on the same side have waived or have not exercised their right to a peremptory challenge of the judge,a party on that side may exercise such a challenge.id.at,d wegner et,supra.
this court long has recognized that,in certain circumstances,section authorizes the exercise of a peremptory challenge by more than a single plaintiff or defendant.following enactment in of section,which at that time applied solely in civil actions,we considered its constitutionality in johnson,supra,cal d,involving a malpractice action.we held that,by imposing a limit of one disqualification per side in an action,section does not deny equal protection of the laws by discriminating against multiple parties.johnson,at.we reasoned that a party,although joined with other parties,may be considered to be on a different side within the meaning of the statute when the joined parties have interests that are substantially adverse.ibid.we provided,as such an example,a situation in which two drivers whose vehicles collide and injure the plaintiff are jointly named as defendants.id.at,wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence,supra.
following amendment in of section to include criminal actions,in pappa we considered the standard announced in johnson in a criminal case in which the codefendants finch and pappa were charged with murder.finch disqualified the judge pursuant to section.following a mistrial,pappa was denied her peremptory challenge of the judge assigned to retry the case,and sought a writ of prohibition to preclude the challenged judge from presiding.pappa,supra,cal d at.
the majority held that,in order to carry out the legislative intent to minimize abuses of the privilege,the party seeking to exercise a subsequent peremptory challenge has the burden of establishing that his or her interests are substantially adverse to those of the codefendant.pappa,supra,cal d at.the majority added if for some reason a party does not desire to assume the burden of establishing that he comes within these conditions,he may pursue the alternative procedure under section of alleging and proving the facts upon which he relies to establish prejudice.ibid.
the majority determined that pappa attempt to establish a conflict of on the prosecutions theory,revealed at the original trial,that finch was the principal and pappa was an aider and abettor,as well as the trial courts denial of pappas motion for a separate trial and pappas opposition to finchs motion for a change of very meager.pappa,supra,cal d at.the majority observed that pappa was not claiming that each of the defendants was attempting to avoid conviction by shifting responsibility for the homicide to the other rather,finchs defense against the charge that he acted as the principal likely would support pappas defense against the charge of aiding and abetting.id.at.although differences of opinion between codefendants as to procedural matters such as the desirability of a change of venue or a separate trial might,under some circumstances,show the existence of substantially adverse interests,it should not be assumed that this is true in the absence of a showing of what the circumstances are and how they affect each of the parties and the relationship between them.id.at.the majority went on to reject the dissents view that the record was sufficient to establish a possibility that the interests of the parties were substantially adverse and justified a subsequent peremptory challenge.id.at,see,at,dis.opn.of peters.
subsequent civil and criminal decisions have adhered to the evidentiary standard enunciated in pappa.these cases uniformly have recognized that the party seeking a subsequent disqualification of the trial judge has the burden of demonstrating that its interests are substantially adverse to those of a coparty that previously exercised a peremptory adverse interests are not presumed.
for example,in avital,supra,d,the codefendants zakaria and avital jointly were charged with multiple homicides.after zakaria peremptorily challenged the trial judge originally assigned,avital filed a peremptory challenge against the judge who replaced him,supported by the declaration of avitals attorney that avital maintained his own innocence as opposed to that of his codefendant joseph zakaria,had entered into an agreement with the district attorney to testify against zakaria,and could furnish particulars in an in camera hearing.id.at.in reversing the trial courts denial of the second peremptory challenge,the court of appeal concluded that avital had satisfied his evidentiary burden,observing that his strategy of avoiding conviction by shifting responsibility to zakaria was a classic example of the substantially adverse interest described in pappa.avital,supra,d at.see,people eaker d.the defendant was not entitled to a second peremptory challenge against the judge after a codefendants attorney challenged the previously assigned judge and the defendant failed to demonstrate his interests were substantially adverse to those of the codefendant welch superior court d.the defendants attorneys declaration speculating how the coparties adverse interests might arise,rather than how they had arisen,was insufficient to support subsequent disqualification of the trial judge people escobedo,supra,d.a defendant was not entitled to peremptorily challenge the hearing judge after the codefendant exercised such a challenge,where the codefendants did not have a conflict of interest in seeking to suppress evidence obtained in the search of the codefendants premises see also sunkyong trading superior court th,d,fn.party not entitled to severance of in order to enable it to avoid burden of establishing interests substantially adverse to another party that had exercised an earlier peremptory challenge in the proceeding.
in the present case,the court of appeal held that home insurance was entitled to exercise a subsequent peremptory challenge because more often than not,the interests of primary insurers and excess insurers are substantially adverse to one another.the appellate court reasoned that,because liability under the policy of an excess insurer is not triggered until the claimed losses exceed the limits of the primary insurance policy,the primary and excess insurer
