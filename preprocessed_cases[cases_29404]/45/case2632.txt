in this action for professional negligence,the appellant,zenith insurance company zenith,had entered into a contract of reinsurance with royal insurance company royal pursuant to which it had reinsured of royal exposure under certain liability policies.after claims were asserted against royal insured,royal retained the respondent law firm of cozen cozen to provide legal services with respect to the defense of such claims.ultimately,zenith filed this action for professional negligence against cozen,alleging that,under the circumstances,an relationship existed between cozen and zenith based on an implied in fact contract and the theory that zenith was an intended beneficiary of the legal services to be performed by cozen pursuant to its retention agreement with royal.cozen successfully demurred to zenith claim and the cause of action against it was dismissed with prejudice.
as we concur with the trial court that cozen,who was hired by royal,owed no duty of care to zenith,we will affirm.the fact that zenith had reinsured of royal potential policy liability,would thereby benefit or suffer from the performance of cozen legal services,and had multiple communications with cozen who was obligated as royal counsel to keep the reinsurer informed of the status of claim adjustment and defense does not provide a basis for the establishment of an relationship moreover,zenith makes no claim that there was any express agreement with cozen regarding such a relationship.
factual and procedural background 
on may,royal entered into a reinsurance agreement with pacific basin insurance company pacific basin pursuant to which it reinsured four general liability policies issued by royal to the dillingham corporation and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years and.subsequently,on july,the reinsurance obligations of pacific basin were assumed by zenith and,on august,royal and zenith entered into a novation agreement whereby royal released pacific basin and accepted zenith as the reinsurer of the four dillingham policies.zenith,at least for purposes of this appeal,does not dispute its obligations as the reinsurer under the original reinsurance agreement 
the reinsurance agreement provided,among other things 
zenith reinsured of the limits of royal underlying policies issued to dillingham 
zenith liability shall fully follow that of royal 
royal had the right and duty to investigate,settle or defend suits against its insureds 
royal had the right and duty,in its sole discretion,to make such settlements as it deemed expedient in accordance with the provisions of the underlying policies and 
zenith did not have the right to associate in the defense or settlement of claims made under the reinsured royal policies.
in october of,one of dillingham wholly owned subsidiaries,foss maritime foss,notified royal of a claim by the united states environmental protection agency which alleged that foss was liable for the environmental cleanup of the middle waterway of commencement bay in tacoma,washington the middle waterway claim.after zenith had assumed the obligations as royal reinsurer,royal advised zenith that there were some other insurers on the risk represented by the middle waterway claim.
in,royal engaged cozen to provide legal advice and services with regard to the middle waterway claim as well as other foss pollution claims in the state of washington.in,zenith contacted cozen regarding royal failure to seek contribution from other insurers who,as zenith understood it,were also on the risk.cozen advised zenith that because of certain conflicts of interest,cozen was not able to pursue any of the potential contribution claims.zenith then demanded that royal retain other counsel to pursue those claims and royal did so.
royal ultimately agreed to pay foss approximately million in settlement of the middle waterway claim,plus another million in defense costs and in settlement of claims arising from two other foss sites.royal thereafter demanded reimbursement from zenith pursuant to the terms of the reimbursement agreement.as of the date that zenith filed its initial complaint in this matter,it had paid only about on royal demand.
on july,zenith filed this action against royal for breach of contract and declaratory relief.in essence,zenith alleged that royal had mishandled the adjustment of the several foss claims and,specifically,had failed to timely pursue contribution and indemnification claims against other insurers.as a result of royal failure,recovery on such contribution and indemnification claims had been lost and zenith,as the reinsurer of of royal policy obligations has been thereby damaged.cozen was not named as a defendant in this pleading.
zenith thereafter amended its complaint to add a third cause of action against cozen for professional negligence.cozen demurred,arguing that there were insufficient allegations to demonstrate any relationship between the law firm and zenith.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and directed zenith to attach a copy of the reinsurance agreement to any future pleadings.two other pleading efforts by zenith had similar results.zenith was repeatedly unable to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate that cozen had any duty of care owed to zenith or that any relationship existed between them.finally,on march,zenith filed its fourth amended complaint,the operative pleading herein.
zenith concedes that there was never any express agreement with cozen that legal services were to be provided to zenith.the basis for zenith conclusion that an relationship existed is apparently founded on the following summarized allegations 
in,zenith demanded that cozen pursue contribution claims against other insurers and that cozen refused on the ground that it was ethically unable to do so as conflicts of interest existed.when zenith demanded that royal engage other counsel to pursue such claims,however,royal did so 
from time to time,cozen had discussions with zenith concerning the pending litigation and settlement strategy respecting the several foss claims.on one occasion,cozen stated to zenith that a particular settlement that royal proposed to make with respect to two of the foss claims was in zenith best interests.on another occasion,one of royal representatives assured zenith that cozen is protecting all of our interests.cozen was not a party to this latter statement 
cozen was aware at all times that zenith had reinsured of royal policy liability under the dillingham policies 
as a result of these circumstances,zenith alleged that it had reasonably relied on cozen to evaluate,investigate and prosecute claims for contribution or indemnification or other claims to reduce royal,and thus zenith,financial liability 
zenith also alleged that a t no time did cozen ever say to zenith that it was not representing zenith.nor did cozen ever say to zenith that zenith should seek separate counsel respecting any matters discussed between cozen and zenith as to the foss claims and 
cozen knew that zenith was not only liable on the foss claim,but also that zenith was potentially responsible for cozen legal fees.as of the date of the fourth amended complaint,zenith had paid a substantial portion of cozen fees respecting their representation.
based on these general allegations,zenith asserted,in its third cause of action that an implied contract existed between cozen and zenith establishing an relationship and the agreement between royal and cozen whereby cozen was to provide legal advice and services with respect to the claims against foss was specifically intended to affect benefit zenith in that cozen was aware of zenith financial interest in the foss claims and was also aware of royal obligations to zenith under the reinsurance agreement.
thus,zenith concludes,in its allegations against cozen,separate and apart from the implied contract between zenith and cozen that zenith was a third party beneficiary of the written agreement between royal and cozen.zenith then goes on to allege that cozen had failed to act within the standard of care and breached that duty of care by the manner in which it permitted the existence of or maintained relationships that created conflicts of interest,failed to act in zenith best interests,failed to handle the foss claims in a proper manner,failed to properly,and in timely manner,pursue claims against other insurers and indemnitors and failed to timely and adequately disclose its conflicts of interest to royal and zenith.
cozen again filed a demurrer and the trial court sustained it without leave to amend.after examining zenith allegations as summarized above,the trial court concluded that there were not sufficient facts alleged to demonstrate the creation or existence of an relationship and that cozen did not owe a duty of care to zenith.the trial court held that the client was royal and the fact that cozen may have been aware that zenith had reinsurance liability and was providing the funds out which cozen fees were paid or that there were multiple communications between zenith and cozen or that zenith had a subjective belief that cozen was also its attorney was not sufficient,as a matter of law,to demonstrate the existence of an relationship.whatever benefits zenith might receive from cozen performance for services for royal were purely incidental to royal engagement of cozen and did not establish that zenith was an intended beneficiary of the legal services performed by cozen.
the trial court entered a judgment of dismissal as to cozen on may,dismissing zenith third cause of action with prejudice zenith has filed this timely appeal.
issue presented 
the critical issue presented by this case arises from the relationship that exists between a reinsurer and the ceding insurer.the question is raised as to the nature and extent of the duty if any,owed to the reinsurer by counsel retained by the ceding insurer to protect the interests of the insured under the underlying policy.as we explain,we conclude that,in the absence of an express agreement between the reinsurer and retained counsel,the general circumstances relied upon here by zenith are not sufficient to establish an relationship or any duty of care running to the reinsurer.

the nature of reinsurance relationship 
insurance code section defines reinsurance as a contract by which an insurer procures a third person to insure him against loss or liability by reason of such original insurance.a reinsurance contract is presumed to be a contract of indemnity for the benefit of the ceding insurance company,not the party insured under that insurer policy.ascherman general reinsurance d.reinsurance is a special form of insurance obtained by insurance companies to help spread the burden of indemnification.a reinsurance company typically contracts with an insurance company to cover a specified portion of the insurance company obligation to indemnify a policyholder in the event of a valid claim.this excess insurance,as it is called,enables the insurance companies to write more policies than their reserves would otherwise sustain since it guarantees the ability to pay a part of all claims.the reinsurance contract is not with the.when a valid claim is made,the insurance company pays the first level insured,and the reinsurance company pays the insurance company.the reinsurance company obligation is to the insurance company,and the insurance company the reinsurer is thus the insured,or more appropriately the reinsured.excess cas.reinsurance ass insurance com r,cir,italics added.
reinsurance does not alter the ceding insurer relationship with its policyholder.it still remains responsible for defending,settling and paying covered claims against the insured.the ceding insurer pays the full amount of the claim,including the costs of defense,and then seeks reimbursement from the reinsurer for the reinsured portion of the claim.the reinsurer liability is limited to the terms of its agreement with the ceding insurer.ascherman general reinsurance,supra,d at.in this case,royal expressly retained the exclusive power to investigate,defend and settle any claim on such terms as it,in its discretion,deemed expedient.under such provision,zenith had no right or authority to participate therein.it obligation to royal was one of reimbursement.
it is well settled that where,as here,a reinsurance contract fails to provide otherwise,a reinsurer has no control over claims settlement.consequently,if the ceding insurer decides to settle and pay a claim,the reinsurer can not raise coverage defenses to avoid paying its share of the loss.absent fraud or collusion with the insured,the reinsurer must follow the fortunes of the ceding insurer on any claims under the policy and most reinsurance contracts,including the one before us,expressly so provide.pacific mutual life ins.of pacific surety,nat.american ins.of cal.underwriters cir.
zenith can not claim third party beneficiary status 
in its brief,zenith argues that regardless of the existence of an relationship between the parties,california law provides that an attorney owes a duty of care to an intended beneficiary of the attorney services.in this argument,zenith does not rely on any claim of a direct express or implied contractual relationship.
an essential predicate for establishing an attorney duty of care under an intended beneficiary theory is that both the attorney,cozen,and the client,royal,must have intended zenith to be the beneficiary of legal services cozen was to render.sabo deitsch th,d.even if the lawyer representation could incidentally benefit the claimant,that does not sufficiently satisfy this predicate.goldberg frye d.mason levy van bourg d.this rule governs the analysis,even if the attorney knows that third parties will be affected by his representation of his client.without more,such knowledge is not sufficient to create a duty of care.burger pond d.
zenith factual allegations never materially changed through four prior versions of the complaint.royal,not zenith,hired cozen.cozen was retained to advise royal regarding its coverage obligations and to avoid potential bad faith liability of royal to its insured.obviously,any advice given royal by cozen to settle or resolve a claim would be given in that context and such advice might not necessarily be in zenith best interests.in resolving the claims against foss,the interests of royal and zenith were not identical.indeed,given royal obligations under the policy,including duties to defend and indemnify dillingham and its subsidiaries,and its exclusive and discretionary control over how those duties would be discharged,those interests were potentially adverse.royal,but not zenith,would be exposed to potential bad faith liability for the unjustified failure to fully discharge all of the obligations owed under the policy.thus,cozen could not ethically represent both royal and zenith in these matters.in such circumstance,it would be impossible to conclude that either royal or cozen ever intended to confer upon zenith beneficiary status of cozen legal services performed for royal.
the clear absence of this mutual intent requirement is critical,indeed dispositive,in the context presented.an attorney undertaking should be the result of a conscious decision,so that the consequences of a duty to a third person can be considered and the undertaking declined if the risk of conflicts or financial exposure is too great.here,there is no allegation that cozen agreed or intended to benefit zenith.
cozen thus can not be held to be under a duty to protect the interests of zenith,a nonclient,where,as here,the nonclient interests were,at the very least,potentially adverse to those of the client.this rule stems from salutary public policy considerations holding that an adverse party can not be the intended beneficiary of the attor
