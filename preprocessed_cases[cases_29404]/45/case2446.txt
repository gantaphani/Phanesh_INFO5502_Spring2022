introduction 
sohail fahmian was sued for injuries suffered by a worker on a residence fahmian and his company were building.fahmian tendered the matter to his homeowners insurance company,american modern home insurance company american modern,which accepted the defense of the personal injury lawsuit,subject to a reservation of rights.american modern later determined a policy limits settlement demand of by the injured worker was reasonable,and notified fahmian in writing,pursuant to blue ridge ins.jacobsen cal th blue ridge,that it intended to accept the settlement demand unless fahmian would either take over his own defense,or waive any later bad faith claim based on the failure to settle the action.
fahmian did not respond to american modern offer.american modern then settled the underlying action with the worker and sued fahmian for reimbursement.a jury found there was no coverage for the personal injury action under the american modern insurance policy.the jury also found that fahmian did not have sufficient time to make a reasoned reply to american modern.based on this finding,the trial court denied american modern claim for reimbursement,and entered judgment in favor of fahmian.
we reverse.under binding california supreme court authority,an insurance company may obtain reimbursement from its insured for a policy limits settlement,when it is determined the underlying claim was not covered by the policy,if the insurance company made a timely and express reservation of rights,provided express notification to the insured of the insurer intent to accept the proposed settlement offer,and made an express offer that the insured could assume its own defense.in this case,american modern did all of the foregoing.we decline to add any additional requirements.this conclusion is mandated by the blue ridge opinion itself because of its analysis and because the timing of the insurer offer to the insureds and the deadlines given by the insurer in blue ridge were essentially the same as in this case.as blue ridge makes clear,it is a timely and express reservation of rights letter that is determinative.for the reasons we discuss,we hold the trial court erred by imposing an additional requirement,not authorized by the supreme court opinion or rationale,that the insured have sufficient time to respond to the insurer offer.
statement of facts and procedural history 
fahmian is the owner of provident housing,provident.american modern provided a homeowners insurance policy to fahmian the policy.the policy specifically excluded coverage for any liability arising out of fahmian business.
on april,rudy montoya sued fahmian and provident for injuries suffered as the result of being shot in the eye with a nail gun the montoya action.the accident occurred on the premises where fahmian and provident were building a house for the purpose of selling it.fahmian tendered the lawsuit to american modern,which accepted fahmian defense under a reservation of rights.fahmian did not read the reservation of rights letter.
montoya attorney presented a settlement demand to american modern for the policy limits.on july,american modern informed fahmian in writing that it intended to accept the policy limits settlement demand unless fahmian either agreed to undertake his own defense in the montoya action,or waive any potential claims based on the failure to settle the montoya action within the policy limits the settlement advisement letter.the settlement advisement letter informed fahmian that montoya settlement demand would expire by its terms on july,and american modern therefore required fahmian response to the settlement advisement letter by on july.the settlement advisement letter was delivered via federal express at on july,and was signed for by fahmian.fahmian,however,testified he never read it.
on july,fahmian telephoned american modern coverage counsel,david evans,and requested that the settlement advisement letter and its attachments be transmitted to him via electronic mail,so he could forward the documents to his counsel.the requested documents were transmitted electronically the same day.during that telephone conversation,evans told fahmian he could call evans until the morning of july with his decision.
american modern did not receive any communication from fahmian or any attorney purporting to represent him after july.because american modern did not hear from fahmian by july,it accepted the policy limits settlement demand in the montoya action.
on november,american modern sued fahmian for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration that the montoya action was excluded under the policy,and for reimbursement of the monies it had paid to settle that action.the case proceeded to a jury trial,after which the jury completed a special verdict form.after posttrial hearings,the trial court concluded,based on the jury findings,that although the montoya action was not covered under the policy,and american modern had made a timely and express reservation of rights,american modern was not entitled to reimbursement because it had not provided fahmian sufficient time to make a reasoned reply to the offer to assume his own defense if he disagreed with the decision to settle.
it is especially noteworthy that the trial court did not make any declaration of rights as requested in the complaint and as it should have adjudicated.in our disposition,we direct the trial court how to declare those rights.
judgment was entered on august,american modern timely appealed.

under all circumstances,did american modern provide sufficient time for sohail fahmian to make a reasoned reply 
did sohail fahmian build the avenida de las flores address for a business purpose 
did sohail fahmian build the avenida de las flores address for his personal residence 
b.what was the jury role as described on the record 
given that the only claims asserted in the complaint were equitable in nature,why was a jury empanelled before trial,the parties and the trial court discussed the possibility that fahmian might raise as a defense that american modern had been negligent,and agreed that the factual issues presented by such a defense required a jury.
during posttrial hearings,american modern counsel stated,the jury is to decide questions of fact which were extremely limited in the case.the court then takes those facts and applies them to the law.that was the purpose of the paperwork.and we believe that the facts that the court needed were there and are there.and the finding of the jury on that question,i believe question number,is irrelevant to the law and was requested by the court,not defense counsel,and was requested after the close of evidence,after the resting of the case in chief by all parties and the close of evidence.
the trial court expressed its opinion as to the procedural status of the jury special verdict,as follows i think this is a slightly different animal,theoretically,since the action is for declaratory relief,something or other that typically does not allow for a jury determination.they made it clear that when effectively the declaratory relief action is something akin to or it involves an issue which is basically a legal action,in other words,a contractual type of case,that then you entitled to have a jury decide the issues of fact,and then the court makes the determination.the thing that i have not been able to determine to my satisfaction is how much that particular scenario differs from the scenario where you try a case to a jury and you go with a special verdict so essentially you asking the jury to make certain discrete factual findings.and then the court,assuming everything has happened the way that it supposed to in terms of the instructions and special verdict,all that left for the court is to enter judgment.t he declaratory relief situation is the same as it would be in the case of a jury trial using a special verdict,essentially you got to ask the jury to decide all the factual things you want decided,leaving for the court no factual determinations to make but only legal conclusions to draw.
trial court reasoning 
after the jury rendered its special verdict,the trial court conducted posttrial hearings and reviewed posttrial briefs by the parties before reaching its conclusions of law and entering judgment.at the final hearing on the issue,the court presented its reasoning,as follows i n the current state of affairs,everything that the jury determined would allow the court to enter judgment for american modern home insurance,the plaintiff i think i laid out essentially the factual story that would entitle them to a judgment,but for the court view and i be happy to hear you one more time,but i think we talked about this quite a bit,and i think we continue to differ on our viewpoint.i think the one thing we can agree on,there is no affirmative case law in the area and the closest we could get on anything as precedent for my view on blue ridge is the coe state farm,d,that talks about reasonable notice in a different context,albeit,being an underpinning of the concept of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.and that is a gloss on blue ridge that the blue ridge notice has to give the insured a reasonable amount of time to make a reasoned decision on the blue ridge options,or it is tantamount to not supplying the options that the blue ridge court said had to be given to the insured.so under that analysis,the additional question that the court had answered by the jury was did he have sufficient time to make the determination based on the notice,and they said no.
the trial court minute order reads,in relevant part,as follows b ased on factual issues submitted to the jury and its findings,fahmian purchased homeowners insurance from american modern home,a worker was severely injured on a home he was constructing for commercial purposes and sued with a reservation of rights,the worker offered to settle the case for policy limits,american modern home notified fahmian of the offer in a letter that complied with the information requirements under blue ridge but did not provide fahmian a reasonable amount of time to select an option,fahmian did not respond within the time american modern home gave him to do so,and american modern home paid policy limits and sued to recover that amount from fahmian when giving blue ridge notice the insurer must give the insured a reasonable amount of time to select an option,coe state farm mut.auto.ins.d,because american modern home did not give fahmian a reasonable amount of time to decide,fahmian is not liable to american modern home.
forfeiture 
fahmian argues the inclusion of question on the special verdict form was not objected to by american modern,and the issue has therefore been forfeited.the appellate record,however,shows that american modern did object to question,although that objection was apparently part of an unreported discussion between the court and counsel.during the posttrial hearings,american modern counsel stated,that was a specific question that the court asked to be included over my objection,to which the court replied,the jury got to decide that one question,albeit at the court over your objection.italics added.later,during that same hearing,the court noted,i think this is a well preserved issue.i think you certainly have you objected to any instruction.you given me your theory.you done everything possible to convince me.we disagree on this particular part of it.italics added.
during oral argument on appeal,fahmian counsel asserted his recollection of the proceedings was that american modern never made an objection to the inclusion of question,and this court should consider only the lack of an objection on the record,because the recollections of the trial court and counsel that an objection was made,as reflected ante,are inaccurate.counsel did not,however,claim in the trial court that the acknowledgements by the court and counsel of objections raised were in any way inaccurate.
we emphasize that this debate over whether an objection was made could and should have been avoided if the trial court and counsel had put the objection and ruling on the record immediately after the chambers conference.
additionally,american modern preserved the issue by raising it in its posttrial briefs.see amerigraphics,mercury casualty th,the defendant preserved issue based on improper special verdict findings by raising it in a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict all west design,boozer d,challenge to form of special verdict preserved by raising it in motion for a new trial.
blue ridge 
in blue ridge,the california supreme court considered whether an insurer defending a personal injury suit under a timely presented reservation of rights may recover from the insureds the settlement payments made to the plaintiffs in the underlying action,when the insureds objected to the settlement,if the claims are later determined not to be covered under the policy.blue ridge,supra,cal th at.the court held that the insurer could obtain reimbursement for a reasonable settlement payment,made over the insureds objection,if it first offered the insureds the chance to assume their own defense.id.at.
as noted,the issue here is whether blue ridge insurance company may seek reimbursement for the settlement paid on the jacobsens behalf even in the absence of the jacobsens express agreement.we conclude it may.here,the jacobsens were on notice both by the policy language and by blue ridge express reservation of rights when it assumed the defense that blue ridge might seek reimbursement from them for what were ultimately determined to be noncovered claims.moreover,blue ridge notified the jacobsens of its intention to accept what was ultimately determined to be a reasonable settlement offer,and offered the jacobsens the opportunity to assume their own defense.under such circumstances,blue ridge satisfied the prerequisites for seeking reimbursement for noncovered claims included in a reasonable settlement payment a timely and express reservation of rights an express notification to the insureds of the insurer intent to accept a proposed settlement offer and an express offer to the insureds that they may assume their own defense when the insurer and insureds disagree whether to accept the proposed settlement.blue ridge,supra,cal th at.
here,too,fahmian was on notice by the policy language and american modern timely reservation of rights letter that american modern might seek reimbursement from fahmian for any uncovered claims.american modern advised fahmian it intended to accept montoya settlement offer,and offered fahmian the opportunity to t
