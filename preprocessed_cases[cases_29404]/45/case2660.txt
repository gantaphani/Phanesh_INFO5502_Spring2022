factual and procedural background 
factual background 
indemnity is a subsidiary of insurance group,which is a subsidiary of fremont general.mlb represented fremont general and its subsidiaries for many years.mlb represented indemnity in a legal malpractice action fremont indemnity company seyfarth shaw,no.known as the seyfarth action.in that action,indemnity alleged that seyfarth shaw had failed to timely file a complaint for legal malpractice against another law firm arising from the latter law firm representation of indemnity in connection with a workers compensation claim.mlb filed a complaint on behalf of indemnity in december.fremont general was not a party to the seyfarth action.
mlb also represented fremont general in gularte fremont life insurance company super.county,no,known as the gularte action,beginning in late.the subject matter of that action does not appear in the appellate record.indemnity was not a party to the gularte action.
the commissioner filed an application to be appointed conservator of indemnity on june.the court appointed the commissioner as conservator on june,and appointed the commissioner as liquidator on july.harry levine,as counsel for the commissioner,first spoke with michael lieb of mlb concerning the seyfarth action in june,and the two later discussed the possibility of mlb continuing to represent indemnity in that action.paul richler of mlb provided a proposed retainer agreement to levine on november,including language stating that mlb could continue to represent existing clients and could represent new clients in any matter that was not substantially related to the seyfarth action,even if the interests of such clients in those matters are directly adverse to those of the california department of insurance.levine objected to that provision,and the parties were unable to reach a compromise.levine advised richler in december that he had selected other counsel to represent indemnity in the seyfarth action.mlb executed a substitution of counsel form on january.
meanwhile,the commissioner counsel met with counsel for fremont general,including its general counsel and iain nasatir of pachulski,stang,ziehl,young,jones weintraub pachulski firm,on november.at the meeting,the commissioner requested compensation for fremont general use of certain net operating losses and threatened litigation.we will refer to the dispute concerning fremont general use of net operating losses incurred by indemnity as the nol dispute.
trial court proceedings in the nol action 
indemnity filed a complaint against fremont general and insurance group on june,no.nol action.mlb appeared on behalf of the defendants.indemnity first amended complaint filed on july,alleged that fremont general had appropriated indemnity net operating losses without adequate compensation.indemnity alleged counts against the defendants,including counts for declaratory and injunctive relief,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraudulent concealment,avoidance of voidable preferences,avoidance of fraudulent transfers,and violation of the insurance holding company system regulatory act,et.
indemnity moved to disqualify mlb as counsel for fremont general and insurance group on august.indemnity argued that,through mlb prior representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action,mlb had learned the strengths,weaknesses,and other confidences of indemnity.indemnity also argued that fremont general almost certainly had consulted mlb before rejecting the possibility of a settlement with respect to the nol dispute in november.indemnity argued that mlb had refused to disclose when it first agreed to represent fremont general in connection with the nol dispute and that mlb refusal to disclose that information compelled the conclusion that the representation began at a time when mlb continued to represent indemnity in the seyfarth action.based on those purported facts,indemnity argued that mlb had concurrently represented parties with conflicting interests without informed written consent,in violation of rule c of the state bar rules of professional conduct 
indemnity also argued that mlb representation of fremont indemnity in the present action was substantially related to its representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action.indemnity argued that despite the dissimilar facts and legal issues in the two actions,mlb had gained insight into the tolerance of risk,and attitudes toward costs of pursuing litigation in light of the relative strength of the case for fremont indemnity through its representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action and became privy to the commissioner litigation philosophy and practices.indemnity argued that mlb had accepted employment adverse to indemnity as a former client in violation of rule e.
fremont general and insurance group argued in opposition that indemnity claim that mlb had concurrently represented parties with conflicting interests was based on mere speculation that mlb had represented fremont general and insurance group in connection with the nol dispute before mlb was substituted out as counsel for indemnity in january.fremont general and insurance group filed several declarations to show that such speculation was baseless.a declaration by richler stated that he was the mlb attorney responsible for fremont general matters,that fremont general did not seek advice from mlb concerning the nol dispute before rejecting the possibility of settlement in or about november,and that no mlb attorney had advised fremont general or insurance group concerning any aspect of the subject matter of the nol action before june.
a declaration by alan faigin,general counsel of fremont general and insurance group,stated that he had made the decision on behalf of fremont general and insurance group to hire the pachulski firm to represent those two entities in connection with the conservatorship proceeding,that mlb was not consulted on any matter pertaining to the november,meeting with the insurance commissioner,or the issues raised in that meeting,that the pachulski firm and barger wolen were the only outside counsel who had advised fremont general or insurance group with respect to that meeting,and that he first consulted with mlb on behalf of fremont general and insurance group with respect to the nol dispute on june.a declaration by david brody,assistant general counsel of fremont general and insurance group,also stated that mlb was not consulted on any matter pertaining to the meeting of november,and had provided no advice to fremont general or insurance group with respect to the nol dispute until after the nol action was filed in june.
fremont general and insurance group also argued that a substantial relationship exists between a former representation and a current representation only if there is some similarity between the factual and legal issues involved in the two matters,and that an attorney mere familiarity with a client from a prior representation is not a sufficient basis to disqualify the attorney from representation of an adverse party in a later unrelated matter.
indemnity argued in reply that mlb had withheld documents that would disclose the extent of mlb conflicts and had failed to answer indemnity prior request for information as to the dates and circumstances under which you were first contacted to provide representation to fremont general adverse to fremont indemnity the commissioner.indemnity noted that mlb representation of fremont general in the gularte action,which was referenced in a declaration filed in opposition to the disqualification motion,had occurred concurrently with mlb representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action,at a time when the two parties had conflicting interests with respect to the nol dispute.indemnity argued that mlb therefore had concurrently represented parties with conflicting interests,in violation of rule c.
the court granted the motion to disqualify in a minute order dated january,stating mlb simultaneous representation of fremont indemnity and fremont general when they became adverse mandates this result.the insurance commissioner never consented in writing to waive the conflict.mlb have not shown when they were initially consulted regarding representation of fremont general in matters adverse to the insurance commissioner.fremont general and insurance group challenged the order by petitioning this court for a writ of mandate and also appealed the order.we denied the writ petition in april no.
trial court proceedings in the comstock action 
indemnity commenced a second action against fremont general and insurance group on august,no.comstock action.indemnity alleged that it was the successor in interest to comstock insurance company comstock and that fremont general had misappropriated assets of indemnity and comstock,including net operating losses and other assets.indemnity alleged counts against the defendants,including counts for declaratory and injunctive relief,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,constructive trust,conversion,avoidance of fraudulent transfers,avoidance of voidable preferences,and violation of the insurance holding company system regulatory act.mlb appeared on behalf of the defendants.indemnity moved to disqualify mlb as counsel for fremont general and insurance group on march,arguing that disqualification was required for the same reasons that disqualification was required in the nol action.fremont general and insurance group opposed the motion.
the court granted the disqualification motion in a minute order dated april,stating consistent with this court previous ruling in related case,the motion to disqualify is granted.morgan,lewis bockius simultaneous representation of fremont indemnity and fremont general when they became adverse mandates this result.the insurance commissioner never consented in writing to waive the conflict.mlb still have refused to reveal how and when they were initially consulted regarding representation of fremont general in matters adverse to the insurance commissioner.further,there is also prohibited successive representation.mlb had a substantial relationship with the client see levin first and second declarations and this creates a presumption that confidential information was obtained and this is a conflict.see jesson jessen hartford cas.ins.th,d.fremont general and insurance group appealed the order.we have consolidated the two appeals.
contentions 
fremont general and insurance group contend mlb concurrent representation of clients in two unrelated matters in which the clients interests did not conflict indemnity in the seyfarth action and fremont general in the gularte action at a time when a conflict of interest existed between those clients with respect to a third matter in which mlb did not represent either party the nol dispute is not a proper basis for disqualification and mlb prior representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action is not substantially related to its representation of the defendants in these actions,and there is no reason to believe that in that prior representation mlb obtained confidential information material to the present dispute.
indemnity contends disqualification is required because mlb concurrently represented both indemnity in the seyfarth action and fremont general in the gularte action at a time when the interests of indemnity in liquidation conflicted with those of fremont general with respect to the nol dispute and the alleged misappropriation of assets,without the informed written consent of both parties mlb representation of the defendants in the present actions is substantially related to its representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action,despite the dissimilarity of issues,because mlb attorneys in the seyfarth action had a direct and personal relationship with levine as counsel for the commissioner and became privy to the commissioner litigation philosophy and practices and mlb gained confidential information by interviewing indemnity officers and employees in the course of its prior representation of indemnity in numerous matters.
discussion 
general principles governing the disqualification of counsel 
a trial court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.code civ,subd.a people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d,comden superior court cal d,fn,in re complex asbestos litigation d.ultimately,disqualification motions involve a conflict between the clients right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.comden superior court,supra,cal d at.the paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.the important right to counsel of one choice must yield to ethical considerations that affect the fundamental principles of our judicial process.in re complex asbestos litigation,supra,d at.river west,nickel d.see hazard hodes,the law of lawyering ed,discussing the assumed function of automatic disqualification rules in maintaining public confidence in the legal system.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee.
other factors to consider in deciding a motion to disqualify counsel include the attorney interest in representing the client,the financial burden on the client to replace disqualified counsel,and the possibility that the disqualification motion is being used as a litigation tactic.speedee,supra,cal th at,d,gregori bank of america d.

disqualification is not justified based on the concurrent representation of parties with conflicting interests 
an attorney concurrent representation of parties with conflicting interests implicates the duty of loyalty.attorneys have a duty to maintain undivided loyalty to their clients to avoid undermining public confidence in the legal profession and the judicial process.see santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,fn.d,and accompanying text.the effective functioning of the fiduciary relationship between attorney and client depends on the client trust and confidence in counsel.flatt superior court cal th,d.the courts will protect clients legitimate expectations of loyalty to preserve this essential basis for trust and security in the relationship.ibid.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.
rule c prohibits the concurrent representation of clients in certain circumstances without the informed written consent of each client.the rule states a member shall not,without the informed written consent of each client accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients potentially conflict or accept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict or represent a client in a matter and at the same time in a separate matter accept as a client a person or entity whose interest in the first matter is adverse to the client in the first matter.
the most egregious conflict of interest occurs when an attorney represents more than one client in a matter in which their interests are directly adverse.speedee,supra,cal th at,d,flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.such patently improper dual representation suggests to the to the public at the attorney is completely indifferent to the duty of loyalty and the duty to preserve confidences.however,the attorney actual intention and motives are immaterial,and the rule of automatic disqualification applies.the rule is designed not alone to prevent the dishonest practitioner from fraudulent conduct,but also to keep honest attorneys from having to choose between conflicting duties,or being tempted to reconcile conflicting interests,rather than fully pursuing their clients rights.anderson eaton cal.the loyalty the attorney owes one client can not be allowed to compromise the duty owed another.ishmael millington d.speedee,supra,at,d.
a conflict of interest also arises when an attorney represents a client in a matter in which the client interests are adverse to those of another party and concurrently represents the other party in another matter.this is the situation described in rule c.an attorney dual representation of parties in those circumstances presents a conflict of interest even if the two matters are completely unrelated and there is no risk that confidences obtained in one matter could be used in the other.speedee,supra,cal th at,d,flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d.flatt explained why the rule of automatic disqualification applies in those circumstances 
a client who learns that his or her lawyer is also representing a litigation adversary,even with respect to a matter wholly unrelated to the one for which counsel was retained,can not long be expected to sustain the level of confidence and trust in counsel that is one of the foundations of the professional relationship.all legal technicalities aside,few if any clients would be willing to suffer the prospect of their attorney continuing to represent them under such circumstances.as one commentator on modern legal ethics has put it something seems radically out of place if a lawyer sues one of the lawyer own present clients in behalf of another client.even if the representations have nothing to do with each other,so that no confidential information is apparently jeopardized,the client who is sued can obviously claim that the lawyer sense of loyalty is askew.wolfram,modern legal ethics ed,italics added.it is for that reason,and not out of concerns rooted in the obligation of client confidentiality,that courts and ethical codes alike prohibit an attorney from simultaneously representing two client adversaries,even where the substance of the representations are unrelated.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
these concerns about maintaining the trust and confidence of clients,and of the public in general,and preventing a situation where an attorney may be forced to choose between conflicting duties or be tempted to reconcile the clients conflicting interests are limited to circumstances where an attorney represents one or both of the clients in a matter in which the clients interests are adverse.this is reflected in rule c,and,which prohibits the representation of clients with conflicting interests without informed written consent only in circumstances where an attorney concurrently represents one or both clients in a matter in which the clients interests are adverse.rule c and,which is not directly at issue here,expressly are limited to situations where an attorney concurrently represents more than one client in a matter in which the clients interests potentially or actually conflict.rule c,which is directly at issue here,states that an attorney may not r epresent a client in a matter and at the same time in a separate matter accept as a client a person or entity whose interest in the first matter is adverse to the client in the first matter.the client in the first matter is the client who is represented by the attorney in that matter,as referenced at the beginning of the quoted language.thus,rule c expressly is limited to situations where an attorney represents a client in a matter while concurrently representing in another matter a second client whose interests in the first matter are adverse to those of the first client.rule c prohibits the concurrent representation of clients without informed written consent only if the attorney represents one of the clients in a matter in which the clients interests are adverse it does not prohibit the concurrent representation of clients whose interests are adverse only in a matter in which the attorney does not represent either client 
mlb concurrent representation of indemnity in the seyfarth action and fremont general in the gularte action is not a proper basis for disqualification under rule c because the clients interests in those matters were not adverse.the fact that the clients interests were adverse in a third matter,the nol dispute,in which mlb did not represent either client does not implicate the duty of loyalty or justify disqualification.moreover,despite the statements in the challenged orders that mlb have not shown when they were initially consulted regarding the representation of fremont general in matters adverse to the insurance commissioner and mlb still have refused to reveal how and when they were initially consulted regarding representation of fremont general in matters adverse to the insurance commissioner,there is no evidence that fremont general or insurance group consulted with mlb in connection with the nol dispute before june,and the uncontroverted declarations discussed ante show that the defendants first consulted with mlb in connection with the nol dispute in june.we therefore conclude that disqualification of counsel based on the concurrent representation of parties with conflicting interests is not warranted.
disqualification is not justified based on the prior representation of a party in a substantially unrelated matter 
an attorney representation of a client in a matter against a former client implicates the duty of confidentiality.protecting the confidentiality of communications between attorney and client is fundamental to our legal system.the privilege is a hallmark of our jurisprudence that furthers the public policy of ensuring the right of every person to freely and fully confer and confide in one having knowledge of the law,and skilled in its practice,in order that the former may have adequate advice and a proper defense.citation.citation.to this end,a basic obligation of every attorney is t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.bus,subd.e.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.
rule e prohibits the successive representation of clients in certain circumstances without the informed written consent of the client and former client.the rule states a member shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representatio
