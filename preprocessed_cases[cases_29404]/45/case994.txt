in order to protect itself against a catastrophic loss,builders purchased from appellant a excess coverage,or umbrella,policy.thus,appellant in its policy agreed to pay all losses between and.appellant policy contained the following language relevant to defense costs

ii.defense,settlement and supplementary payments 
should applicable underlying insurance s become exhausted by payment of covered claims,this insurance will continue in force as underlying insurance and shall defend any suit arising out of a covered occurrence 
except for exhaustion of underlying limits by payment of covered claims,and occurrences not covered by the underlying policies,but covered by this policy,the company shall not be called upon to investigate or defend any suit brought against the insured,but the company shall have the option to associate in the investigation defense of suits covered under this policy 
on november,when the policies of planet and appellant were in force,a truck driver employed by builders was involved in a collision.two people died and several others suffered catastrophic permanent injuries as a result of the collision.suit for personal injuries was brought in the district court of jefferson county,texas,captioned clancy,et and chandler builders transport,cause no.trial was set for the first part of june and the case was settled shortly before trial.the first portion of the settlement,occurring on june,was in the sum of.of this sum,builders paid,planet paid and appellant paid.

builders claim that approximately was incurred in costs and fees by it in defending the claims.the great portion of this amount was incurred before the first settlement on june.about was incurred between the first settlement on june,and the final settlement on june.
builders assert that appellant and planet should participate in the payment of the defense costs the planet policy provided for a pro rata sharing of defense costs by all contributors to the settlement of a claim.appellant policy provided that once underlying coverages are exhausted,its insurance will continue in force as underlying insurance and appellant shall defend any suit arising out of a covered occurrence.
in its decision,the district court reasoned that the phrase as underlying insurance when used in the context chosen by appellant in the defense portion of its own policy can only mean that upon the exhaustion of underlying coverages,appellant policy will defend in the same manner as,or according to the way the underlying planet policy operated,and that it will provide coverage for expenses to the same degree in which that policy did.see builders transport,ford motor,d.the costs were then apportioned and appellant was ordered to pay for its proportionate pro rata share of the costs and fees incurred by builders.appellants were also ordered to pay builders for reasonable costs and attorneys fees incurred in connection with this action.
appellant urges this court to reverse the finding of the district court and determine that it erred in applying pennsylvania law as opposed to texas law,and erred in failing to find that appellant had no duty to its insured to provide costs and expenses incurred prior to exhaustion of all underlying insurance that is,appellant should have no obligation to pay for costs and expenses incurred until after the payout of the first settlement on june.

the issue as to whether the law of pennsylvania or texas should apply.
in an attempt to resolve this problem,the district court conducted a conflicts analysis and determined that the law of pennsylvania should apply.this analysis was undertaken even though the district court found,and the parties agreed,that the laws of pennsylvania and texas are all in accord insofar as the issues before the court are concerned.builders transport,d at.appellee also concedes this in its brief.
however,if the laws of the states do not conflict,then no analysis is necessary.grace and continental cas,cir national union fire ins.cna ins.companies,cir.thus,the law of the forum state,texas,should apply here as there is no conflict between the substantive state law of texas and pennsylvania as each requires that insurance contracts,like other contracts,be interpreted according to their plain meaning.puckett united states fire insurance,ranieli mutual life ins.
even if a choice of law analysis was required to be made,the court determines that texas probably has the most significant relationship to the substantive issues to be resolved.under texas principles,contract disputes are governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the particular substantive issue.grace,at citing duncan cessna aircraft.see also hughes wood products,wagner.the only relationship that pennsylvania has to this case is that appellant was incorporated there,but had its headquarters in new york.builders had its headquarters in south carolina.all of the litigation giving rise to this case occurred in texas.all of the defense costs,which are the subject of this litigation were incurred in texas and involved texas attorneys.the mere fact of appellant incorporation in pennsylvania does not lead this court to believe that that state has the most significant relationship to the substantive issue to be resolved here.the court finds,therefore,that the law of texas is the proper choice of law and the district court erred in determining that the law of pennsylvania was the proper choice.
the dispute between the primary and excess insurance carriers as to the payment of defense costs.
in considering this issue,the district court first examined the policy of planet,an underlying carrier.no party takes exception to the finding that planet policy provided for a pro rata sharing of defense costs by all contributors to the settlement of a claim.the claim of error is made to the district court finding that the excess coverage policy of appellant must be construed to require it to provide coverage for expenses to the same degree provided for by planet policy.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court relied heavily on the holding in general accident insurance company of america safety national casualty corporation.i
