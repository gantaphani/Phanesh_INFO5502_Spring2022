plaintiffs cold creek compost,et hereafter collectively cold creek appeal from the judgment entered in favor of defendant state farm fire and casualty company state farm after state farm motion for summary judgment was granted in an insurance coverage dispute.the primary issue presented is whether the pollution exclusion in the policies bars coverage for liability for offensive and injurious odors emanating from a compostfacility and spreading over a mile away.we conclude that the exclusion applies and affirm the judgment for state farm.
background 
cold creek operates a facility in mendocino county that composts organic materials including animal waste manure,grape pomace,and yard trimmings.cold creek was insured by state farm during the relevant period under a business policy and a commercial liability umbrella policy.
in,people living within two miles of the facility,acting individually and as members of an association called preserve country neighborhoods pcn filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief preserve i to require the county of mendocino to void the use permit it issued allowing cold creek to expand its operations,and to prepare an environmental impact report eir.the preserve i plaintiffs did not seek damages,but alleged inter alia that an eir was required to address the project potential environmental effects in areas such as odors,dust,noise,erosion,and earth movement.the preserve i court declined to enjoin cold creek operations,but required preparation of an eir with respect to the permit.the eir was certified by the county in april.
in june,pcn and individuals owning or residing in properties in the vicinity of the facility filed a mandate petition and nuisance complaint against cold creek preserve ii.the petition for writ of mandate challenged the eir and the use permit the nuisance complaint sought damages and injunctive relief.
the nuisance cause of action alleged that cold creek had imported and stored on its property huge quantities of animal and poultry wastes,soiled animal stall bedding,weed ash and other forest product wastes which often contain poisonous chemicals,grape pomace,plant trimmings other agricultural waste materials,and that the composting operations caused foul and noxious odors,disruptive noise,polluting discharge of materials,excessive dust and truck traffic,and visual blight.the plaintiffs said they had complained of ongoing severe offensive odors from the composting operations and excessive noise and traffic dangers from trucks loaded with waste coming to and from the site,and had expressed ongoing concerns about leachate contamination of area groundwater and surface waters and health impacts of aspergillus and other airborne pathogens from the compost piles.the plaintiffs sought to enjoin cold creek from interfering with the use and enjoyment of their properties by allowing foul odors,disruptive noises,excessive dust,airborne pathogens,truck or heavy equipment traffic,bright reflected or direct glare from roofing materials,ground or surface water pollution to emanate or escape from the facility.
the mandate petition in preserve ii was severed from the nuisance claim and tried first to the court.the court filed its order denying the petition in october.
in august or september,while the court had the petition under submission,cold creek tendered its claim for defense and indemnification in preserve ii.in october,state farm advised cold creek that it would provide a defense in preserve ii under a reservation of rights.cold creek asked state farm to consider reimbursing the attorneys fees and costs it had incurred in preserve i,and state farm obtained an opinion of independent coverage counsel in june as to its obligations with respect to preserve i and preserve ii.counsel opined that there was no coverage in preserve i because no damages were sought in that case.for the same reason,counsel found no potential for coverage of the mandate portion of preserve ii.as for the nuisance cause of action,counsel thought that the pollution exclusion in the policies would apply to most,if not all of the plaintiffs allegations.
this exclusion,identical in both policies,provides in part 
t his insurance does not apply 
bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,seepage,migration,dispersal,spill,release or escape of pollutants

b if the operations are to test for,monitor,clean up,remove,contain,treat,detoxify or neutralize or in any way respond to or assess the effects of pollutants

request,demand or order that any insured or others test for,monitor,clean up,remove,contain,treat,detoxify or neutralize or in any way respond to or assess the effects of pollutants boldface type omitted.
p ollutants are defined in the policies to mean any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes material to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
coverage counsel believe d that the exclusion would apply to the plaintiffs allegations of damage resulting from leachate and bacterial contamination and foul and noxious odors.it is probable that the exclusion would apply as well to the allegations regarding the migration of dust from the insured is a solid and fairly characterized in this context as an irritant.on the other hand,plaintiffs have referred to other conditions of concern,including erosion and earth movement see preserve i complaint,page,which do not appear to be the subject of the pollution exclusion.at this point,given that neither the plaintiffs nuisance cause of action nor the associated damages claims have been the subject of any discovery,we are not in a position to rule out that in preserve ii plaintiffs are seeking to recover damages for some form of property damage which is not subject to the exclusion.
consistent with the foregoing opinions,state farm advised cold creek in august that it would reimburse cold creek litigation expenses in connection with the damages claim in preserve ii,but that it declined to pay such expenses in preserve i and the mandate portion of preserve ii.
the issue of nuisance damage in preserve ii proceeded to a jury trial.according to the plaintiffs trial brief the compost facility trucks massive quantities of waste products into the valley.the waste then putrefies as part of the production process.the smell of the rotting waste products is overpowering,carrying for several miles.defendants own experts have tested the odors created by the composting operations.their odor experts panel have described the stench from the defendants composting operations in the following terms rotten sewage,rotten fish,cat urine,stagnant water,sour garbage,manure,mold and rotten eggs the stench from the compost operation causes gagging,headache,watering eyes,nausea,and sinus congestion in people living in areas around defendant compost facility heavy clouds of dust from the wheeler trucks inundates homes,plants,and laundry drying on the line.noise constantly bombards surrounding residents when defendants are working.cold creek trial brief indicated that the facility was over one and miles away from the plaintiffs properties,and argued that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that odor,dust,or noise from the operations rose to the level of an actionable nuisance.
the jury rendered special verdicts awarding five individual plaintiffs damages totaling for d iscomfort,annoyance,inconvenience or other losses.the jurors found that cold creek had created a condition that was harmful to health,or offensive to the senses,or an obstruction to the free use of property that could be abated and that interfered with the plaintiffs use or enjoyment of their land.
in a march posttrial report to state farm,cold creek defense counsel stated that the plaintiffs and other lay witnesses testified to experience ing odor from the facility,and government officials testified that verified odor complaints had been lodged against the operation.defense witnesses included an odor expert,a noise expert,and neighbors of the plaintiffs who testified to the lack of odor,noise or dust impacts.after the verdicts were returned,counsel spoke with several jurors and learned that the jury believed the plaintiffs smelled something.dust and noise were not nuisance factors.
in april,state farm obtained an opinion from independent coverage counsel as to its ongoing obligations in preserve ii.counsel opined that claims based on odors from cold creek facility were probably sufficient to constitute bodily injury under the policies this conclusion was based on the allegations in the plaintiffs trial brief that the odors caused gagging,headache,watering eyes,nausea,and sinus congestion,and counsel understanding that there was testimony at trial regarding nausea,but no evidence of medical treatment rendered for such illness.allegations that laundry hanging on the line outdoors was damaged as were patios,fruit trees and flowers which were covered by clouds of dust constituted claims of property damage as defined in the policies none of the allegations were for personal injury as defined in the policies because the coverage for invasion of the right of private occupancy of property was limited to the situation.
although some of the plaintiffs allegations were potentially covered by the policies,counsel concluded the policies pollution exclusion eliminated any indemnification obligation for the damages awarded.counsel reasoned that the only potentially covered claims for bodily injury or property damage are the result of the alleged fumes and dust which were dispersed or released from the insureds compost operations.a ny dust or other airborne chemicals would constitute an irritant or contaminant.likewise,any noxious odors which cause nausea or any other physical ailment,would also be considered an irritant.based upon the foregoing,it is our opinion that the absolute pollution exclusion eliminates any duty to indemnify the insureds in this situation.counsel further concluded that state farm could withdraw its defense of preserve ii at this point,it appears the only basis for defending the action was the possible claim for erosion and earth movement which could constitute property damage and which would not be excluded by the pollution exclusion.however,we note the allegations regarding erosion and earth movement were contained in preserve i.those same allegations are not part of preserve ii.furthermore,it does not appear that the issue of erosion or earth movement was a part of the case which was tried and now subject to a potential appeal.any appeal at this point would be to challenge the amount of the award which is based upon claims.for this reason,it is our opinion that state farm has satisfied its obligation to defend the insured and could withdraw from the defense at this point.
in may,state farm advised cold creek that it was withdrawing its defense of the preserve ii action,and refusing to indemnify cold creek for its liability in the case.state farm letter stated among other things that,even if the plaintiffs damages were for bodily injury or property damage under the policies,coverage was negated by the pollution exclusion.
in january,an injunction enjoining and abating commission of nuisance was entered in preserve ii.the injunction prevented cold creek from conducting composting operations without implementing the dust control measures recommended by public agencies and the odor control measures specified in the injunction.
in march,cold creek sued state farm herein for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unfair business practices bus,et,for failures to defend and indemnify in preserve ii.
both sides moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication.state farm argued that the pollution exclusion foreclosed indemnity coverage for damages in preserve ii to the extent that the damages were awarded for odor and dust,and that damages awarded for noise were not covered by the policies irrespective of the exclusion.cold creek argued that the preserve ii damages were for bodily injury,property damage,or personal injury under the policies,and were not subject to the pollution exclusion.each side cited the decision in mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d,mackinnon,in support of its position.
the court granted state farm motion for summary judgment,finding that the pollution exclusion was controlling,and ruling that 
preserve ii did involve pollution subject to that exclusion.the odors emanating from the facility were determined to be a nuisance by a jury.this court believes that an odor emanating from a compost plant that reaches the point of being declared a nuisance is pollution as defined by the mackinnon court.
furthermore,though state farm extended a defense to cold creek for the nuisance portion of the preserve ii litigation,based on the pollution exclusion,it did not owe a duty to defend cold creek.once the jury special verdicts in preserve ii were issued,and a judgment entered,it was evident that the basis for the verdicts against cold creek was pollution from their compost operation,an act that was not covered by the policy.
additionally,since cold creek had no insurance coverage for its acts of pollution,state farm can not be held in breach of contract under either the business or umbrella policies nor can it be held in violation of business and professions code section,unfair business practices.
finally,this court finds state farm did not act in bad faith when it denied coverage and withdrew its defense of cold creek the facts indicate that state farm had good faith reliance on the advice of its counsel when it made the coverage decision,and there was a legitimate dispute as to state farm coverage obligations under california law.
ii.discussion 
cold creek contends that the trial court erred in concluding that,by virtue of the pollution exclusion in the policies,state farm had no duty of defense or indemnity with respect to the preserve ii damage claims based on odors emanating from the facility.we are called upon to independently review the trial court interpretation of the policies and its granting of the motion for summary judgment.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d,summary judgments are review de novo interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.
our analysis is governed by mackinnon,which interpreted a pollution exclusion identical in material respects to the one here the issue in mackinnon was whether the exclusion applied to exclude injury to a tenant from a landlord allegedly negligent use of pesticides on his property.the court held that the exclusion did not apply because it did not plainly and clearly exclude ordinary acts of negligence involving toxic chemicals such as pesticides.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
mackinnon identified two schools of thought as to the scope of the exclusion.one camp maintains that the exclusion applies only to traditional environmental pollution into the air,water,and soil,but generally not to all injuries involving the negligent use or handling of toxic substances that occur in the normal course of business.these courts generally find ambiguity in the wording of the pollution exclusion when it is applied to such negligence and interpret such ambiguity against the insurance company in favor of coverage.the other camp maintains that the clause applies equally to negligence involving toxic substances and traditional environmental pollution,and that the clause is as unambiguous in excluding the former as the latter.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court cited california cases involving groundwater contamination from industrial operations or bacteria as examples of traditional environmental pollution.id.at,fn,d.the court cited cases from other jurisdictions showing that the narrower interpretation of the pollution exclusion represented the majority view.id.at,fn,d.in these cases,which presumably did not involve traditional environmental pollution,the injuries resulted from causes such as carbon monoxide leaks from a furnace or oven inhalation of fumes from a concrete curing compound toxic smoke emitted from a fire soot and smoke emitted from candles ingestion of lead paint chips hydrogen sulfide fumes accidentally emitted from a truck insecticide accidentally sprayed on bystanders and hydrocarbons and hydrofluoric acid accidentally released from oil refineries.ibid.
the court rejected a broad,literal construction of the pollution exclusion that would encompass virtually all acts of negligence involving substances that can be characterized as irritants or contaminants mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d,and determined that the exclusion applied only to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution id.at,d.the court adopted this interpretation for a number of reasons.
the court reading was consistent with the historical background of the exclusion and the purpose of its implementation.the exclusion at issue,commonly referred to as the absolute pollution exclusion,was not formulated to exclude all injuries from toxic substances,but rather as a means of avoiding potential liability arising from the gradual or repeated discharge of hazardous substances into the environment.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
the court interpretation was consistent with the familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that the words of the exclusion were to be construed in their ordinary and popular sense as a layperson would reasonably interpret them.id.at,d.from that standpoint,the words discharge,dispersal,release,and escape would imply expulsion of the pollutant over a considerable area rather than a localized toxic accident or injury occurring in the vicinity of intended use.id.at,d,see also id.at,d.the court observed that to disperse can mean to spread widely id.at,d,and that t he notion of dispersal as a substantial dissemination is reinforced by its use with the term pollutant.indeed,the word dispersal,when in conjunction with pollutant,is commonly used to describe the spreading of pollution widely enough to cause its dissipation and dilution.ibid.
the court interpretation also served to avoid absurd results.to regard every irritant or contaminant as a pollutant would cut a broad and arbitrary swath through liability insurance protections mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d,because v irtually any substance can act under the proper circumstances as an irritant or contaminant id.at,d.without some limiting principle,the exclusion would apply to virtually all injuries involving substances that cause harm id.at,d,including injuries that few if any would think of as arising from pollution in any recognizable sense,such as a child accidental ingestion of a toxic substance left in an empty soft drink bottle id.at,d.
as for the claim at issue in mackinnon,the court found it far from clear that injuries arising from the normal,though negligent,residential application of pesticides,would be commonly thought of as pollution.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the policy language did not clearly exclude such injuries because it would be unusual to speak of the normal,intentional application of pesticides as a release or escape of pesticides,and the application of pesticides in and around an apartment building does not plainly signify to the common understanding the dispersal of a pollutant.id.at,d.moreover,the term discharge is commonly used with pesticides to describe pesticide runoff behaving as a traditional environmental pollutant rather than pesticides being normally applied.id.at,d.thus,w hile pesticides may be pollutants under some circumstances,it is unlikely a reasonable policyholder would think of the act of spraying pesticides under these circumstances as an act of pollution t he common understanding of the word pollute indicates that it is something creating impurity,something objectionable and unwanted.the normal application of pesticides around an apartment building in order to kill yellow jackets would not comport with the common understanding of the word pollute.id.at,d.
the decision in mackinnon supports state farm here.the odors emanating from cold creek facility were unquestionably an impurity,something objectionable and unwanted in the air where the preserve ii plaintiffs lived the odors polluted the air,as the term pollute is commonly understood.in the ordinary and popular sense of the words of the pollution exclusion,the odors were discharged and released by the composting and escaped from the facility.the odors spread a mile and a half to the plaintiffs substantial dissemination to the point of dissipation and dilution ordinarily understood as a dispersal of pollutants into the environment.the preserve ii plaintiffs did not suffer a localized toxic accident like the one in mackinnon they were harmed by a persistent of cold creek business operations,what mackinnon called traditional environmental industrial pollution.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.in garamendi golden eagle ins.th,d garamendi,the court held that,unlike the residential use of a pesticide for the purpose of killing insects,the widespread dissemination of silica dust as an incidental of industrial sandblasting operations most assuredly is what is commonly thought of as pollution and environmental pollution under the reasoning of mackinnon.similarly here,we conclude that the widespread dissemination of offensive and injurious odors from a commercial compost facility is environmental pollution under mackinnon,and thus excluded from coverage by the pollution exclusion in the policies.
this conclusion is consistent with the one reached in city of spokane united nat.d spokane,which appears to be the only reported case involving the pollution exclusion application to odors from a compost facility.the owner of the compost facility in that case was sued by nearby residents for damages caused by odors emitted from the facility.the owner incurred substantial defense costs,paid more than million to settle the case,and sought indemnification under liability insurance policies that contained pollution exclusions.the court took into account how an average purchaser of insurance would have understood the language of the exclusions id.at,and held in favor of the insurers id.at.the court reasoned although d efendants pollution exclusions did not explicitly list odors in the definitions for pollutant or contaminant,the policies clearly exclude coverage for odors produced by the colbert compost facility r eading the insurance policies to include coverage of odors from solid the policies clearly exclude coverage for gases,fumes,vapors,contaminants and require a strained interpretation and produce an absurd result.migration of odors from a solid waste facility clearly constitutes contamination,or pollution,of the environment.id.at.
the same conclusion was reached in an analogous context in city of bremerton harbor ins,bremerton.there,residents in the vicinity of a sewage treatment plant sued for damages for noxious and toxic fumes,and foul and obnoxious odors and toxic gases emitted by the facility.id.at.the court held that the pollution exclusion applied the policy defines a pollutant as any irritant or contaminant and specifically lists fumes and gasses as examples.the language unambiguously excludes claims arising from fumes and gases from coverage.furthermore,the specified examples of irritants or contaminants in the exclusion language are listed as t
