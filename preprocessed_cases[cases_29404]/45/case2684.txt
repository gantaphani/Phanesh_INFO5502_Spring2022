appellant joaquin camacho camacho,an uninsured driver,a driver insured by interinsurance exchange of the automobile club exchange.exchange indemnified its insured and assigned to respondent bell corporation of america bell for collection its claim of against camacho after paying of the sum claimed,camacho filed this purported class action against exchange,bell,the automobile club of southern california and acsc management services.we refer to exchange,bell,the automobile club of southern california and acsc management services,collectively as the defendants.since portions of this opinion do not involve bell,we refer to exchange,automobile club of southern california and acsc management services,as the insurance defendants.
acting pursuant to its own motion,and after receiving briefing by the parties,the trial court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of all of the defendants.camacho appeals from this judgment,which we affirm.
while the action was pending and before judgment was entered,exchange filed a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section slapp the trial court denied this motion,and exchange appeals from this order.we agree with the trial court reason for denying this motion and affirm the order.
procedural background 
following the filing of camacho complaint on may,exchange filed its slapp motion,as well as a demurrer,in july.the demurrer was based on three grounds.they were camacho claims were barred by the litigation privilege the class allegations were inadequate as to the predominance of common issues of law and fact and the inequitable nature of camacho to reward uninsured motorists who are trying to avoid financial a bar to the equitable relief under business and professions code section et.
on september,on the same day that the demurrer and the motion to strike were argued,the trial court issued a written order,which stated that,on the court own motion,the matter of a judgment on the pleadings was to be heard on october,in relevant part,the order stated that the court has serious reservations as to whether bell alleged collection practices constitute unfair business practices.specifically,after perusing the letters attached to the complaint,the court does not find them to be unlawful,deceptive or unfair.the parties were given an opportunity to submit briefs on the court motion for a judgment on the pleadings.
the court ruled on all matters on october.the court sustained the demurrer to the class allegations with leave to amend and overruled the balance of the demurrer.the court denied the motion to strike on the ground that the moving parties had not shown that bell statements were in connection with an issue of public interest.
in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings,the trial court,citing shvarts budget group,th,d,ruled that the complaint failed to allege that the gravity of the harm to camacho outweighed the utility of the defendants conduct and that,even if defendants conduct was theoretically unfair,no actual unfairness is alleged to have harmed plaintiff.the court also found that the causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation failed to plead facts sufficient to constitute causes of action because no jury could find that the letters sent by bell were likely to deceive.the trial court also rejected the claim that bell had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.
for the purpose of reviewing the court ruling on the judgment on the pleadings,we turn to the material facts that are pleaded in the complaint,which,except for contentions,deductions or conclusions of law,are deemed to be true in this appeal.pang beverly hospital,th,d.
the first of five causes of action of this purported class action is based on business and professions code section for unfair practices in which all of the defendants are allegedly engaged in.these allegations center on the efforts of bell to collect monies allegedly due to the insurance defendants two letters demanding payment sent to camacho by bell are attached as exhibits to the complaint.
in part,the approach taken by the complaint is to allege,as facts,how a recipient of the bell letters construes the collection letters sent by bell.thus,the complaint alleges as unfair,unlawful or fraudulent activity the following suggesting in the collection letter that the subrogation claim asserted by defendants is a liquidated debt creating the false impression in the mind of a reasonable recipient of the collection letter that he or she is receiving the protection of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa when in fact the defendants are not complying with fdcpa and asserting in the letter that an investigation has revealed that the recipient of the letter is responsible for the accident,even though responsibility is determined by means of a court action or uninsured motorist arbitration.
the complaint also sets forth allegedly unfair conduct that is not predicated on the collection letters.thus,the complaint alleges that defendants threaten to report the failure to pay the subrogation claim to credit reporting bureaus,as though it was an unsatisfied consumer debt improperly report the failure to pay the subrogation claim to credit reporting bureaus collect the insured deductible,even though defendants are not entitled to it and threaten to petition the department of motor vehicles to revoke the recipient driver license if he or she does not pay the claimed debt.
the first cause of action closes by alleging as a pattern and practice of unfair,unlawful and fraudulent conduct the following a ttempting to collect collecting monies from uninsured motorists without first obtaining a judicial or arbitration determination of fault liability of the parties to the automobile accident in a forum in which the uninsured was a party attempting to collect collecting through bell,and other collection agencies or similar entities,monies from uninsured motorists utilizing the methods,representations and omissions alleged above and sending misleading form letters that are intended to intimidate,coerce to dupe the recipient to pay whatever sums of money the said insurance defendant and bell claims they are owed.the complaint also alleges that bell is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.
the second cause of action seeks a judicial declaration that form letters sent by bell deceive the uninsured motorist into believing that he or she actually owes the sum demanded,that form letters and subsequent telephone calls amount to coercion and are designed to place the plaintiff class under duress,and that the defendants practices are unfair and unlawful business practices.the third cause of action is for injunctive relief along the same lines.
the fourth and fifth causes of action,respectively for fraud and negligent misrepresentation,are based on the same factual allegations as are set forth in the first cause of action.
discussion 
the judgment on the pleadingsa.camacho can not show that defendants practices are unfair in terms of business and professions code section 
the question is whether the complaint alleges facts that constitute an unfair practice under business and professions code section section the trial court concluded that it does not allege such facts.however,the test that the trial court applied has been disapproved by the california supreme court in communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d,see text,post.
as we explain below,there is some uncertainty about the appropriate definition of the word unfair in consumer cases brought under section.since the issue of the correct definition of unfair in consumer cases was not briefed,we solicited the views of the parties on the matter.independently of our request,the california attorney general requested,and was given,leave to file an amicus brief on this issue.the parties have had an opportunity to comment on the views expressed in the attorney general amicus brief.
assisted by these contributions,we endeavor to state below what,in our opinion,is the correct definition of unfair in section consumer cases.we conclude that,under this test,camacho has not,and can not,allege facts that constitute an unfair practice under section.
we begin with,where the court addressed the question when conduct is unfair within the meaning of the unfair competition law.after stating that the california supreme court had not as yet defined unfair and that courts may not apply purely subjective notions of fairness,the court noted that some appellate courts had attempted to define this term.among those definitions was the one adopted by the trial court in the case at bar,the test that the court must weigh the utility of the defendants conduct against the gravity of the harm to the victim,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that the various definitions pioneered by the appellate courts,including the one named,are too amorphous and provide too little guidance to courts and businesses.id.at,d.the court went on to state 
accordingly,we believe we must devise a more precise test for determining what is unfair under the unfair competition law.to do so,we may turn for guidance to the jurisprudence arising under the parallel barquis merchants collection cal d,section of the federal trade commission act a section.in view of the similarity of language and obvious identity of purpose of the two statutes,decisions of the federal court on the subject are more than ordinarily persuasive.people ex rel.mosk national research of cal.d.see also bank of the west superior court cal th,d,supra,cal th at,d.
after reviewing federal law on the subject,the supreme court concluded 
these principles convince us that,to guide courts and the business community adequately and to promote consumer protection,we must require that any finding of unfairness to competitors under section be tethered to some legislatively declared policy or proof of some actual or threatened impact on competition.we thus adopt the following test when a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor unfair act or practice invokes section,the word unfair in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
in handing down this ruling,the supreme court also made clear that involved an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices,and not an action by consumers for a business practice alleged to be unfair,supra,cal th at,fn,d.it has been noted that this has resulted in a split in the courts of appeal.stern,bus.practice the rutter group.one line of cases applies definition of unfair to consumer cases,gregory albertson,th,d the other recognizes the new definition,but applies the old definitions to consumer cases,walker countrywide home loans,th,d.
as the attorney general points out,the definitions of unfair are not limited to the balancing test applied by the trial court,but also include the tripartite test set forth in ftc sperry hutchinson,footnote,d.this test was first applied by a california court in a section setting in people casa blanca convalescent homes,d.
the question is whether definition of unfair overrules appellate court opinions that use other definitions.we think that it does.definitions that are too amorphous in the context of anticompetitive practices are not converted into satisfactorily precise tests in consumer cases.this squares with the fact that,in disapproving appellate court opinions defining unfair in amorphous terms,the supreme court did not hold that the old definitions were appropriate in consumer cases.
we do not think,however,that this means that the finding,in a consumer case,that the practice is unfair must be tethered to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions,as one court of appeal has put it.gregory albertson,supra,th at,d see also fn,ante.in other words,we do not think that definition of unfair in cases involving anticompetitive practices applies to consumer cases.
there are two reasons for this.
first,tethering a finding of unfairness to specific constitutional,statutory or regulatory provisions does not comport with the broad scope of section tethering the concept of unfairness to existing positive law undercuts the principle that a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive,even if it not unlawful or vice versa,supra,cal th at,d.as our supreme court has put it,the courts need to deal with innumerable new schemes that the fertility of man invention can contrive barquis merchants collection,supra,cal d at,in the context of consumer cases,tethering to positive law undercuts the ability of the courts to deal with new situations,and new abuses.
second,anticompetitive conduct is best defined in terms of the policy and spirit of antitrust laws the same can not be said of a business practice that is unfair or deceptive in the terms of section.that is,cases involving anticompetitive conduct move in a far smaller,and more clearly defined,universe than unfair or deceptive business practices.it is therefore possible to tether anticompetitive conduct to the antitrust laws,while the universe of laws regulations that bear on unfair practices is so varied that it is not possible to achieve a consensus which of these laws and regulations might apply to define an unfair practice.
itself holds the key to the definition of unfair in consumer cases.holds that we may turn for guidance to the jurisprudence arising under section of the federal trade commission act,supra,cal th at,d.since,the factors that define unfairness under section are the consumer injury must be substantial the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.orkin exterminating cir.these factors have now been codified in title united state code section n this definition of unfair is on its face geared to consumers and is for that reason appropriate in consumer cases.it is also suitably broad and is therefore in keeping with the sweeping nature of section.we will refer to this as the section test.
the attorney general suggests that,in a setting,the courts should apply the older,test set forth in ftc sperry hutchinson,supra,d,which was applied in california in people casa blanca convalescent homes,supra,d.see fn.accompanying text,ante.the attorney general reasons that this test is flexible enough to accommodate the expansive sweep of unfair competition law and that it ensures the application of normative principles of unfairness.we think that the attorney general has identified sound objectives,but that the sperry test suffers from too many of the ills in the old definitions of unfair that our supreme court has identified in the decision.the section test is more focused,less dependent on subjective notions of fairness and,for these reasons,easier to apply and administer.the element of this test that requires the injury to be weighed against the benefits of the practice claimed to be unfair ensures that the practice is subjected to normative standards.
we invited the parties to comment on applying the section test to define unfair in consumer cases arising under section et.respondents support applying the section test to consumer cases.appellant and the attorney general pose various objections,which we do not find persuasive.
appellant contends that the first prong of the section test,that the consumer injury must be substantial,engrafts a substantial injury requirement on business and professions code section,which only requires that a person who brings an action under section must have sustained an injury in fact.this confuses the standing requirement of business and professions code section with a normative definition of unfair in consumer cases brought under section.a definition of unfair in section consumer cases does not affect the general standing requirement of section.appellant also questions a bright line test,assuming the section test is such a test,in light of our supreme court observation in that such tests should be avoided in order to deal with the innumerable new schem
