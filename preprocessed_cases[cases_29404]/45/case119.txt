this appeal involves a coverage dispute between essex insurance company and its insured,bloomsouth flooring corporation.essex brought a declaratory judgment action claiming that,pursuant to business risk exclusions in its policies,it had neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify bloomsouth in connection with an underlying state court action against bloomsouth.the magistrate judge,presiding by mutual consent,see c,granted essex motion for summary judgment,finding that the pertinent exclusions relieved essex of both its duties to defend and to indemnify.on appeal,bloomsouth targets only the duty to defend.
because the exclusions,as applied to the underlying complaint,do not relieve essex of its duty to defend,we reverse the district court summary judgment ruling in pertinent part.
background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to bloomsouth,the party against whom summary judgment was granted.see millipore travelers indem,cir.
in,boston financial data services bfds retained suffolk construction corporation as general contractor for a tenant improvement project at its offices in massachusetts.in undertaking the project,suffolk subcontracted with bloomsouth for the installation of carpet tile and related materials throughout the building.the subcontract required bloomsouth to perform minor preparation work before laying the carpet.this work included testing and cleaning the concrete floor.bloomsouth itself subcontracted out the installation to two other companies.one was charged with supplying the carpet and the other with installing it.
during all material times bloomsouth had commercial general liability policies with essex.the general contractor suffolk was an additional insured on the essex policies that were issued to bloomsouth.bloomsouth subcontract also required it to defend and indemnify suffolk for claims against suffolk arising out of bloomsouth work.coverage under a first policy began on july,and extended through july,coverage under a second policy began on july,and extended through july.
both policies specifically covered,among other types of damage,liability for property damage that occurred in the coverage territory and during the policy period.the policies define property damage as both p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property,and l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.both policies also contain a number of what are commonly referred to as business risk exclusions that serve to deny coverage for certain types of claims that relate directly to the insured faulty workmanship,as opposed to damage caused to a third party.in turn,many of these exclusions contain exceptions that,if operable,will restore coverage to the insured.
in late april or early may,the carpet was installed.although it is unclear exactly when bfds employees moved into the building,after moving in they noticed an odor.the employees described the odor as a locker room smell,a playdough smell,or a sour chemical smell.some further complained that the odor caused headaches or other ill effects.
bfds notified suffolk of the offensive odor.in an effort to eliminate the odor,one of bloomsouth subcontractors scraped up the original carpet adhesive and the floor.that effort failed to correct the problem and the odor spread to other areas of the building.as a result,the subcontractor and suffolk conducted tests of the carpet,the floor,and the air in the building.test results were inconclusive.the subcontractor blamed the smell on a chemical reaction between the carpet and the concrete floor,and suffolk claimed that the subcontractor had installed defective carpet,causing the odor.bfds presented a claim of property damage to suffolk and demanded that suffolk remove the carpet and eliminate the smell.suffolk subsequently requested that bloomsouth respond to bfds claim.bloomsouth refused,and as a result,suffolk paid bfds for remediation efforts.during the remediation process,suffolk,pursuant to its status as an additional insured under bloomsouth policy with essex,notified essex of bfds claim and demanded that essex defend and indemnify suffolk.in april,essex disclaimed coverage to suffolk for bfds claim.
in due course,suffolk sued bloomsouth in state court.suffolk asserted claims for negligence,contractual indemnity,breach of the implied warranty of merchantability,breach of express warranty,breach of contract,and contribution under ch.suffolk complaint alleged that bloomsouth was responsible for negligently and defectively providing and installing carpet resulting in damage to and loss of use of the building,including an alleged unwanted odor which permeated the building,and bloomsouth negligent and defective work caused suffolk to spend money in an attempt to eliminate the alleged odor.money was spent on,among other things,the installation of carbon air filters to the ventilation system in the building,and removal of the existing carpet tile and adhesives,of the concrete floor and replacement of the carpet tile and related materials.
shortly after suffolk filed its action against bloomsouth in state court,essex filed a diversity action in the district of massachusetts,seeking a declaratory judgment against bloomsouth and suffolk.essex sought a declaration that,under the insurance policies issued to bloomsouth,it was not required to defend or indemnify either suffolk or bloomsouth for the claims being asserted in suffolk state court action or for the claims asserted by bfds against suffolk.essex specifically claimed that various business risk exclusions relieved it of any duty to provide defense or indemnity.bloomsouth and suffolk filed counterclaims seeking a declaration that essex was required to defend and indemnify them.
after consenting to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge,the parties agreed to conduct discovery jointly with the discovery in suffolk underlying state court action against bloomsouth.after the completion of discovery,all parties moved for summary judgment in the federal court action.
the court granted essex motion for summary judgment.although the court appeared to assume that suffolk alleged property damage sufficient to give rise to coverage,it concluded that business risk exclusions labeled m and k relieved essex of its policy obligations.exclusion m barred coverage for property damage to impaired property,defined as property that has not been physically injured.the court held that this exclusion barred coverage for suffolk allegation that an unwanted odor permeated the building because it was an allegation of damage to impaired property.exclusion k excluded coverage for property damage to the insured own product,and the court determined that this exclusion applied to suffolk allegation that the concrete floor had to be prior to the installation of replacement carpet.the court arrived at this conclusion by reasoning that during the original installation process the concrete floor had essentially become bloomsouth product.finding that these exclusions effectively encompassed all of the contingencies presented in suffolk complaint the court concluded that essex had no duty to defend or indemnify bloomsouth or suffolk.bloomsouth appeals from the final judgment of the court.

the law regarding an insurer duty to defend is in massachusetts.hdh atl.charter ins.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.herbert sullivan,at.in order to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend,a comparison must be made of the facts alleged in the underlying complaint with the insurance policy provisions.id.if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,the insurer has a duty to defend.airy ins.greenbaum,cir noting duty to defend may be triggered even if the allegations of the underlying complaint are baseless see also cont l casualty gilbane.in sum,the obligation of an insurer to defend is not,and can not be,determined by reference to the facts proven at trial.rather,the duty to defend is based on the facts alleged in the complaint and those facts which are known by the insurer.boston symphony orchestra,commercial union ins,citing desrosiers royal ins.i nformation derived from outside the complaint may not serve to negate the duty to defend.metallized prods.travelers ins,wl at,citing millipore,at.

the insured initially bears the burden of showing that the allegations in the underlying complaint fit within the covered risks in the policy.highlands ins.aerovox.once the insured has satisfied this burden,it falls to the insurer to prove the applicability of one or more separate and distinct exclusionary provisions.b t masonry const,at citing highlands ins,at.both an allegation creates the possibility of a covered claim,and whether an exclusion applies to relieve an insurer of its duty to on whether the insured would have reasonably understood the exclusion to bar coverage.see atlantic mut.ins.mcfadden.
as previously noted,the district court implicitly assumed that bloomsouth had met its initial burden of showing that the underlying complaint alleged physical injury to tangible property within the meaning of the policy.on appeal,the parties do not address directly the issue of whether there was physical injury to tangible property.rather,they address the issue only in the context of the impaired property exclusion m.as this is a threshold issue,we confront it at the outset,after which we analyze whether essex can show that exclusions nonetheless serve to relieve it of the duty to defend.
bloomsouth argues that two of the underlying allegations are reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that they assert claims of physical injury.these allegations are that an unwanted odor permeated the building,and that the concrete floor in the building required.we agree.
allegation of a permeating odor 
the massachusetts supreme judicial court has not determined whether the presence of a permeating odor may constitute physical injury.accordingly,we make an informed prophecy of what the court would do if confronted with the question.truck serv.caterpillar,cir,cert.denied,d.in making such a prophecy,we look to analogous cases decided by other courts in the forum state,persuasive reasoning in cases from other states,and learned treatises.see also andrew robinson int l,hartford fire ins,cir.
the parties have identified two cases,albeit unpublished,from massachusetts lower courts that support a finding that the presence of odor in a building can constitute physical injury to the building.in matzner seaco ins,wl,the insureds claimed that contaminated their apartment building,entitling them to coverage under an insurance policy that protected against direct physical loss or damage to property.the court first noted that the phrase direct physical loss was ambiguous and that it should therefore be interpreted in the manner most favorable to the insured.id.at.accordingly,the court ruled that carbon monoxide contamination constitutes a direct physical loss of or damage to property.id.at.it is important to note that matzner was a claim,and thus the duty to defend was not at issue.given that the salient question before us involves the lesser burden of determining whether the underlying complaint is reasonably susceptible of stating a covered claim,airy ins,at,we need not resolve the ambiguity issue to conclude that the complaint can be so read.
in arbeiter cambridge mut.fire ins,wl.march,the insureds claimed that the presence of oil fumes in their home constituted a physical loss to the building triggering insurance coverage.the court,in partially denying summary judgment for the insurer,was persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that fumes are a physical loss which attach to the property.id.at.
the two massachusetts cases,arbeiter and matzner,relied on cases from other jurisdictions to support their conclusions.in farmers ins.of or.trutanich,upon which arbeiter relied without further discussion,the oregon court of appeals held for an insured who claimed that methamphetamine odors had physically injured his home.the court found that the pervasive odors were physical because they infiltrated the house and that such damage qualified as a physical loss under the terms of his insurance policy.id.at.similarly,in fire ins.first presbyterian church,the supreme court of colorado upheld coverage where an insured argued that gasoline vapors physically damaged the property because they contaminated the foundation,halls,and rooms of a building.the court dismissed the concept that physical damage could only occur if some tangible injury to the physical structure itself could be detected,noting,c ommon sense requires that a policy should not be so interpreted in the absence of a provision specifically limiting coverage in this manner.id.at citation omitted.
essex makes three arguments in response.first,it argues that the underlying claim does not reference injury to tangible property,but instead alleges that the odors injured the air.second,essex asserts that an odor can not constitute physical injury to property.finally,essex says that,even if there is an allegation of injury to tangible property,and even if odors can constitute physical injury to property,the complaint still would not trigger the duty to defend because the cases suggest that the odor must have persisted in and permeated the structural components of the properties after their original source was removed to be considered physical injury to property.essex claims that the odor here does not qualify because once the carpet was removed there was no persistent odor remaining.
we reject each argument.first,essex reads too much into suffolk complaint when it states that suffolk bfds odors only permeated the building air.suffolk in fact alleged that an unwanted odor permeated the building emphasis added.such an allegation may be reasonably construed as claiming damage to property.
second,essex does not provide any authority in support of its contention that odor can not constitute physical injury to property.given arbeiter,matzner,and the cases upon which they rely,the appellant has met its initial burden on this issue.
third and finally,although essex may be correct that odor can only constitute physical injury to property if it is permeating or pervasive,nothing in the complaint the controlling document in the duty to defend inquiry indicates that the odor was not pervasive or permeating.on the contrary,the underlying complaint explicitly asserts that the odor permeated the building and that suffolk expended funds to remediate the alleged odor.
essex claims that the odor was not pervasive or permeating because,when the carpet was removed,the smell went out with the carpet.that claim,however,impermissibly relies on extrinsic evidence,which massachusetts law proscribes see sterilite,at what is not permitted is that an insurer shall escape its duty to defend the insured against a liability arising on the face of the complaint and policy,by dint of its own assertion that there is no coverage in fact nashua liberty mut.ins,wl,at,w here a complaint is susceptible on its face of a reading that brings the claim within the policy,the insurer can not rely on facts outside the complaint to justify a unilateral refusal to defend.
against this legal and factual backdrop,we are persuaded both that odor can constitute physical injury to property under massachusetts law,and also that allegations that an unwanted odor permeated the building and resulted in a loss of use of the building are reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that physical injury to property has been claimed.further,since nothing in essex policies suggests that odor can not constitute physical injury to property,suffolk claim is colorable under the policies.see fire ins,at.
of the concrete floor 
suffolk allegation that the concrete floor required because of bloomsouth negligent and defective work and materials may also be reasonably interpreted as alleging physical injury to property,the concrete substrate.
suffolk complaint alleged that property bfds concrete floor had to be because of bloomsouth faulty work the defective carpet which was placed upon the concrete floor.the import of this allegation is that bloomsouth carpet,or its installation,caused physical injury to bfds concrete floor.that is essentially the view of suffolk allegation that the magistrate judge adopted.the court,in paraphrasing suffolk complaint,stated,suffolk seeks remuneration for the concrete floor to eradicate voc contamination caused by the carpet or its installation.
essex argues that suffolk allegation can not be reasonably construed as indicating physical injury to property.it asserts that the allegation itself conclusively establishes that the was part of the replacement process for the defective carpet.
we reject essex argument.the claim that suffolk allegation conclusively establishes that was part of a replacement opposed to a remedial overstated.as we have noted,the allegation is reasonably susceptible to a different interpretation the one adopted by the magistrate judge.moreover,were we to read the complaint as essex suggests,we would be endorsing a more exacting pleading standard than currently exists for establishing the duty to defend.see lee aetna cas.sure,cir,when the complaint comprehends an injury which may be within the policy,we hold that the promise to defend includes it cited with approval in sterilite see also sterilite,at there is no requirement that the facts alleged in the complaint specifically and unequivocally make out a claim within the coverage.citation omitted.
exclusions 
having determined that suffolk and bfds allegations can be reasonably interpreted as giving rise to a duty to defend,we next consider whether the business risk exclusions nonetheless relieve essex of its duty to defend.the appellant argues that exclusion m is not applicable,because suffolk allegation did not involve impaired property as that term is defined in the policies.it contends that exclusion k does not apply either,because suffolk allegation that the concrete floor had to be showed there was damage to a third party real concrete than damage to bloomsouth own product.thus,the argument goes,the court determination that exclusion k applied was erroneous because this exclusion operates to deny coverage only for damage to the insured own product.
exclusion m 
we begin our analysis with the broad observation that exclusion m is one of several business risk exclusions in a commercial general liability policy.these business risks are those 
which management can and should control or reduce to manageable proportions risk which management can not effectively avoid because of the nature of the business operations and risks which relate to the repair or replacement of faulty work or products.these risks are a normal,foreseeable and expected incident of doing business and should be reflected in the price of the product or service rather than as a cost of insurance to be shared by others.
sterilite,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,a distinction is drawn between faulty workmanship claims involving only the insured own work product,for which a defense need not be provided,and claims for damage to the property of a third party,for which a defense is required.frankel watson.
exclusion m bars coverage for property damage to impaired property,which the exclusion internally defines as property that has not been physically injured.emphasis added further,for the exclusion to apply the alleged damage must arise out of a defect,deficiency,inadequacy,or dangerous condition in the insured product or work.
the first reason why the exclusion does not apply is plain.suffolk complaint alleged that odor permeated the building.as we have concluded,this allegation is reasonably susceptible to an interpretation that the odor physically injured the property.
the policies more detailed definition of impaired property provides the second reason for concluding that the exclusion is inapplicable.the policies define impaired property as tangible property,other than the insured product or work,that can not be used or is less useful because it incorporates part of the insured product or work that is known or thought to be defective,deficient,inadequate,or dangerous.this definition is,however,somewhat narrowed by a condition that property is impaired property only if such property can be restored to use by i the repair,replacement,adjustment,or removal of the insured product or work,or ii the insured fulfilling the terms of its contract or agreement.
although the complaint alleges property damage odor to tangible property the building that can not be used or is less useful because it incorporates the insured defective,deficient,inadequate,or dangerous product the carpet,we also must consider the definition internal limiting condition.property can only be impaired property if it can be restored to use by the repair,replacement,adjustment or removal of the insured product or work.if it can not be so restored,then it is not impaired property.dorchester mut.fire ins.first kostas,other cases implicating this exclusion have turned on the fact that the exclusion applies only if the damaged property can be restored to use by the repair,replacement,adjustment or removal of the insured work.citation omitted.
a fair reading of suffolk complaint suggests the property could not be restored to use simply by repairing,replacing,adjusting,or removing bloomsouth product or work.the allegations thus fall outside the definition of impaired property.suffolk complaint states in relevant part,as a result of the defendant negligent and defective work and materials,and in order to eliminate the alleged odor suffolk expended monies in attempting to remediate the alleged odor including the installation of carbon air filters to the ventilation system in the building.emphasis added 
admittedly,there is no express indication in the complaint that the installation of the air filters actually restored the property to use.on the other hand,neither is there any indication that repairing,replacing,adjusting,or removing the defective product the carpet restored the property to use.the closest the complaint comes to using such language is in the allegation that reads,suffolk was ultimately required to pay bfds for removal of the existing carpet and adhesives,of the concrete floor and replacement of the carpet and related materials.but even this language indicates that,a remedial effort that may be distinct from removal and replacement of the carpet,was necessary to restore the property to use.a legitimate reading of the complaint is that suffolk attempted to remediate the alleged injury odor by installing carbon air filters and the concrete floor.whether it was these actions,the removal and replacement of the offending carpet,or some combination that restored the building to use is unclear.what is clear is that essex had the burden of proving the applicability of exclusion m.see highlands ins,at.such a hurdle simply can not be cleared given the wording of suffolk complaint
