procedural history 
student richard houghton was severely injured on april,while riding in a school bus leased by sbt and driven by an sbt employee,whose negligence was the sole cause of the student injuries houghton action against sbt settled in may appellant and respondent each contributed million toward the total payment of million on may,self filed its action for declaratory relief seeking a declaration the self moc excludes coverage for sbt and the driver regarding the houghton settlement westport and westchester have a duty to indemnify sbt and the driver for the houghton settlement under the terms of their policies and westport or westchester must reimburse self million payment to the houghton settlement.self based its complaint on recovery on theories of equitable subrogation,contribution,and indemnity.
self alleged it is a joint powers authority and a california public entity formed pursuant to government code section et.moreover,the complaint alleged that defendants insurance policies provided coverage and such coverage was excluded under the moc issued by self.furthermore,the moc allegedly contains an endorsement naming sbt as an additional covered party and the moc specifically excludes coverage for the sole negligence of any additional covered party.
over the objection of self,westchester,seeking recovery of its million payment in the houghton settlement,relying on its recent discovery of the alleged mutual mistake westchester contended that the initial intent of sbt and westchester,as discovered by westchester in,was not to insure the buses owned by the district under the sbt policies and,contrary to a provision in the moc,not to exclude coverage by self for the sole negligence of any additional covered party such as sbt.in about december,sbt and westchester mutually executed an endorsement to the subject policy,made retroactive to january,purportedly to express the original,mutual agreement of the parties that the westchester policy was not to provide coverage for sbt liability arising out of the operations of vehicles owned by the school district for which coverage was provided through the school district insurance program.the validity of this auto endorsement is the first issue presented on appeal.
self answered the and filed a motion for summary judgment msj.after opposition was filed,self filed an ex parte application for permission to file an amended complaint,to reopen discovery regarding the auto endorsement,and to continue the trial date and the msj.particularly concerned about the recent production of evidence the that might exclude coverage by westchester,the court granted additional time for limited discovery,took the msj off calendar,granted both sides leave to amend the pleadings,and told westchester this would give it an opportunity to consider whether any further defenses should be raised by answer or whether further claims should be made in the 
thereafter,self amended its first and operative second amended sac complaints.in its sac for declaratory relief,equitable subrogation,equitable contribution,and equitable indemnity,self alleged that westchester provided excess commercial general liability coverage to sbt and the driver for amounts up to million,above the million provided by westport insurance corporation,which provided primary coverage.furthermore,self moc was allegedly not an insurance policy and therefore was not other insurance subject to any other policy.in addition,self moc allegedly specifically excluded coverage for the sole negligence of any additional covered party,and sbt is named in the moc as an additional covered party.westchester amended its answer but did not include a defense of mutual mistake or amend its to assert a cause of action for reformation.
self second msj was based on coverage under westchester policy invalidity of the retroactive endorsement between westchester and sbt in december and the argument that coverage,if any,by self was not other insurance and therefore westchester policy must be exhausted before self coverage was brought into play.that is,even if there was coverage by self,westchester layer of coverage precedes self.
the operative second msj was argued june,and granted on the ground that self moc was not insurance pursuant to government code section,that the westchester policy covered the houghton loss,and the auto endorsement was invalid.in giving its tentative ruling,the trial court accurately noted that the case involves l whether the endorsement is retroactive and whether the district agreement to indemnify sbt changed respondent from noninsurance under government code section to insurance.as to the first question,the court believed that reformation could not be retroactive and,in any event,there was no cause of action for reformation in this case.moreover,the court was concerned about harm to self,asking is that the reformation agreement a mistake or is that a retroactive endorsement trying to protect oneself after the event there is a big difference there.the court was concerned that the parties reformation stripped the court of its equitable power in weighing the different factors.
as to the second question,the court found as a matter of law,that self did not become insurance when the district agreed to indemnify sbt because its purpose was to enhance the services of the district.and as long as that is that limited purpose,it is my opinion that self has not transmuted itself into insurance.judgment was entered july,
on september,the trial court denied westchester motion for new trial to vacate judgment in giving its tentative ruling,the court characterized the case as one in which two people on their own decide two years later to change the contract to the detriment of a known entity,self.the court was particularly concerned that westchester had no request for judicial reformation and deemed judicial intervention inappropriate after mutually agreed upon modification executed by the parties pursuant to civil code section d moreover,the court concluded that the absence of a request for judicial reformation creates possibility of collusion.third parties can be totally harmed and the actions here smack of vigilantism in terms of retroactive amendment.
westchester appeals from the judgment.

discussion 
the trial court erred in deciding the validity of westchester auto endorsement on summary judgment.
westchester contends that,through a mutual mistake of fact,its policy as originally issued did not exclude the auto exposure of sbt for its operation of the district buses but that the mutual mistake was corrected through an endorsement mutually executed by westchester and sbt,its insured.furthermore,westchester contends it properly sought reformation was not required to plead a separate cause of action for reformation demonstrated substantial and undisputed grounds for reformation that self has no legal or factual basis to assert it was prejudiced by the auto endorsement and the endorsement applies to exclude coverage under the westchester policy.
westchester statement of facts includes evidence that it was the mutual understanding of sbt and westchester from the outset that sbt operation of buses owned by the school district were not covered under the westchester policy but that such coverage was to be provided by the school district own insurance program.self msj contains evidence to the contrary 
the court in alderson insurance company of north america,supra,d,relied on by westchester,concluded that inclusion of a provision in the policy by reformation to reflect the intent of the contracting parties was proper even where the rights of third party claimants who are not parties to the insurance contract are adversely affected.citation.truck ins.exch.wilshire ins.d.insurance of north america bechtel d.italics added.including the provision by reformation was found to be proper in alderson,supra,d,to reflect the undisputed intent of the contracting parties.the policy as reformed in alderson,however,did not meet the statutory requirements for.the court found that neither the original policy nor the policy as reformed satisfied the statutory requirements for a retained limit of and thus concluded that the policy exclusion of coverage for permissive users was void.alderson,supra,d.thus,the language about the adversely affected rights of third party claimants is dicta we are not persuaded that the trial court was compelled to find in westchester favor based on the attempted reformation reached by westchester and sbt after this litigation commenced.
we agree with the trial court that where the parties attempt reformation years after the policy was executed and only after the adverse impact to third parties is apparent,such prejudice should be considered in determining the initial intent of the contracting parties.under such circumstances,although they may eventually achieve reformation,they are not free merely to decide between themselves that something other than their clear written provision was their initial intent.a court of equity must look at the whole picture in deciding if there was mutual mistake that permits reformation.
civil code section provides when,through fraud or a mutual mistake of the parties,or a mistake of one party,which the other at the time knew or suspected,a written contract does not truly express the intention of the parties,it may be revised on the application of a party aggrieved,so as to express that intention so far as it can be done without prejudice to rights acquired by third persons,in good faith,and for value.given the conflicting evidence about intent in the msj and opposition,there is a material issue of fact as to mutual mistake between sbt and westchester sufficient to overcome the msj.
we next address whether westchester primary position in the trial court not to allow the trial court to decide the applicability of the mutual mistake doctrine precludes its argument on appeal by in effect forcing the trial court not to be a gatekeeper in the decision on mutual mistake or to decide that a matter of law mutual mistake existed and resulted in the desired reformation.on appeal as well,westchester initially eschewed a trial on the issue of mutual mistake,instead asking for directions that the auto endorsement reflects the original mutual intent of the parties at the inception of the westchester fire policy and should be applied retroactively to the houghton loss.on the other hand,without citation to the record,westchester argued in its reply brief that the trial court had the authority to review the evidence to determine whether there was a mutual mistake in the issuance of the excess policy and that the auto endorsement properly reflects the original intent of the parties.that the trial court refused to exercise this authority,despite the express request of westchester fire,is one of the harmful errors which resulted in the judgment below.
at the very end of the hearing on the new trial motion,westchester counsel stated that the court did have the power to exercise to interpret the endorsement and to determine whether there was a mutual mistake of fact italics added.similarly,while reluctant to make the argument,counsel for westchester at oral argument in this court eventually granted as an alternative ground for reversal that the trial court could exercise its gatekeeper role to determine if there had been mutual mistake.
in sum,our review of the record demonstrates that westchester raised the issue of mutual mistake in its and adequately,though reluctantly,would have allowed the trial court to decide the issue of mutual mistake.given our appellate function in reviewing summary judgment see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,we conclude a material issue of fact exists,was not waived,and the summary judgment must be reversed.
self coverage afforded to a member is not insurance subject to westchester other insurance clause.
division three of this court in city of south el monte southern cal.joint powers ins.authority th,d,sets forth an excellent history of municipal joint liability pools.the legislative response to the municipal insurance crisis and implementation of the pooling arrangement was senate bill.the purpose of this bill was to amend section and recognize these pools as an alternative to insurance and remove them from regulation under the insurance code,italics added.in orange county water dist.association of cal.water.authority,supra,th,d,footnote omitted,the court was similarly asked to consider whether a public entity pool,formed by several water agencies pursuant to a joint exercise of powers agreement,is insurance subject to a commercial insurer policy provision that its coverage will not apply until all other insurance is exhausted.because the statutes authorizing creation of public entity pools specifically provide such arrangements are not to be considered insurance,subd.c,we conclude the other insurance clause is not applicable and affirm the judgment.accord,southgate recreation park dist.california for park recreation ins.th,d because joint authority risk pools are ultimately member created and directed,they are not considered insurance in a conventional sense they are an alternative to commercial insurance.
westchester acknowledges that,as a general principle,third party liability coverage issued by risk pools operating as a joint pool arrangement is not insurance,agreeing with self and amici curiae rather,westchester contends that self acted outside the statutory exemption for insurance set forth in government code section by affording coverage to sbt,not a member of the jpa and not a public entity,and that such coverage is insurance and thus subject to the other insurance clause of westchester policy,which controls who pays what.the argument is that self went beyond its authorized mandate to provide for public entities and undertook the task of insuring nonmembers.moreover,according to westchester,strict construction does not allow for the extension of the immunity provided under government code section merely because a contractor is acting on behalf of a member public entity,the position taken by amici.see kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,conc.opn.of mosk,under the california constitution,therefore,the courts have no general authority by virtue of the judicial power to rewrite a statute,even to salvage its validity.accord vershbow reiner d.westchester principal point is that section does not include contractors who are acting on behalf of a public entity,but includ
