plaintiff stephen thompson sued the automobile club of southern california the auto club in this putative class action.he challenges the auto club policies relating to renewal,specifically,its practice of backdating late renewals to the member original expiration date if the renewal occurs within days.he claims this practice results in members receiving less than a full year of services.the auto club counters that the day period is a grace period and that members are generally permitted to continue receiving services,particularly during the first days.this practice,the auto club further argues,prevents the member from incurring a fee to start a new membership.
thompson moved for class certification,and the trial court denied the motion.the court concluded,among other things,that the proposed class was overbroad,lacked commonality,and that thompson claims and defenses were not typical of the class.further,it ruled that a class action is not a superior method of adjudication.thompson appeals the trial court decision,arguing the court decision was unsupported by substantial evidence,contrary to established law,and was premised on the trial court misunderstanding of the plaintiff claims.the auto club argues the class certification motion was properly denied for the reasons stated by the trial court.
based on the deferential standard of review appropriate to a motion for class certification,we find no error.contrary to thompson arguments,the court decision reflects that it understood the facts and used appropriate criteria for its decision.therefore,there was no abuse of discretion,and we affirm.
factsa.background 
defendant the auto club is a regional affiliate of aaa,an association of automobile clubs with more than million members in the united states.the auto club is a,mutual benefit corporation and has more than six million members.its services include emergency roadside assistance,a travel agency,dmv transactions,and other benefits.
the auto club membership dues are billed and collected annually.since,when joining for the first time,or when rejoining after a cancelled membership,members are generally charged a enrollment fee.upon joining,the member receives various documents,including a membership card showing the member expiration date,and a copy of the auto club bylaws.prior to expiration of membership each year,the auto club mails the member several renewal notices,which vary depending on the member level of service and billing plan.over different versions of notices exist,and they are changed periodically.the auto club also communicates with members regarding renewals by phone.
how the auto club handles membership renewals is the subject of this case.according to the auto club,members who fail to timely renew a membership enjoy a day grace period from the expiration date to renew.thus,if the member renews at any point during the day period,the auto club treats the renewal as retroactive to the date of the expiration.for example,if a member joins on january,the membership expires january.if the member renews at any time up until april,the renewal dates back to january.after the day,the member file is closed,and any new membership is subject to the new membership fee.
according to the auto club,during the grace period,a delinquent member remains eligible to receive services.all services are available during the first days after the failure to renew,and from the to day,whether services are provided is a matter of discretion on the part of the auto club agent assisting the member.exercise of that discretion depends upon various factors,including the length of the membership,the exigency of the circumstances,and the agent belief regarding the member intent to renew.if a delinquent member receives roadside assistance and subsequently renews,the service call is treated as one that occurred during the membership period.if the member does not renew,any such services are billed.
plaintiff stephen thompson began his current membership with the auto club in december.his membership expiration date since that time has been december of each year.between and,thompson renewed his membership late,although he intended to renew each year.
the complaint in this action discusses only the renewals for the years and.there was,however,evidence in the record regarding his renewal.shortly after his membership expired in,he received a mailed notice from the auto club informing him that his membership had not been renewed.the notice stated we will still continue to provide you with roadside assistance service for days after your expiration date.however,if we do not receive your payment,we will be required to bill you for an amount that covers our cost of providing you the service during that day period.if you renew now,all roadside assistance calls during the unpaid period will be counted toward your four free calls.
in early,thompson renewed his membership by phone.at the end of the call,he specifically asked the representative if his membership started right now and goes for months forward.thompson was informed that the membership could only be started from that date if he paid a new membership fee,otherwise it went back to the date of the expiration.thompson felt that was not fair,but he chose not to begin a new membership.
b.the lawsuit 
in july,thompson filed the instant lawsuit as a purported class action,alleging claims for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and violations of the unfair competition law bus,et the ucl and the consumer legal remedies act,et the clra.he also sought injunctive relief.after a demurrer was sustained,the injunctive relief cause of action was dropped in the amended complaint.in sum,thompson alleged that the auto club renewal policy was depriving members of receiving months of benefits,that members were not informed of the policy,and that members were being monetarily damaged.
discovery proceeded,and in november,thompson moved for class certification.he proposed to define the class as all persons who,at any time on or after july,purchased and paid for a new term of auto club membership after their prior membership term expired,and whose new membership term was deemed by auto club to have begun on or about the prior expiration date.the auto club filed its own motion to deny certification.the parties filed their respective oppositions and replies in due course.both sides also submitted evidence,which we will discuss in more detail below,to support their respective claims.evidentiary objections were also filed.
after a hearing,the court denied the motion and directed the auto club to prepare an order.thompson objected to the auto club proposed order and submitted his own,but the court signed the auto club order.the court concluded that thompson had failed to present sufficient evidence to demonstrate a community of interest.plaintiff has failed to support his allegation that the auto club routinely denies members who renew late a full twelve months of benefits by backdating membership renewals,or that this issue could be litigated on a basis.by contrast,the auto club has demonstrated that individual issues would predominate in determining the claims alleged in this action,that the proposed class is overbroad,that plaintiff is not typical of the class he seeks to represent,and that a class action would not be a superior method of litigating these claims.given the court ruling,it was unnecessary to decide the auto club motion to deny certification,but the court had considered all the evidence and briefs on each motion.the court also overruled all evidentiary objections.thompson now appeals the court order.
discussiona.standard of review 
with respect to the factual issues surrounding class certification,we afford the trial court great discretion in granting or denying certification.in re tobacco ii cases cal th.the trial court ruling will be reversed only if a manifest abuse of discretion is present.brinker restaurant superior court cal th.a certification order generally will not be disturbed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence,it rests on improper criteria,or it rests on erroneous legal assumptions.citations.citations.ibid.
we must p resum e in favor of the certification order the existence of every fact the trial court could reasonably deduce from the record citation.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at.where a certification order turns on inferences to be drawn from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.citation.davis miller automobile club of southern california th.b ecause group action also has the potential to create injustice,trial courts are required to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts.citations.linder thrifty oil cal th.
we must also examine the trial court stated reasons for denying class certification.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at.ordinarily,appellate review is not concerned with the trial court reasoning but only with whether the result was correct or incorrect.citation.but on appeal from the denial of class certification,we review the reasons given by the trial court for denial of class certification,and ignore any unexpressed grounds that might support denial.citation.we may not reverse,however,simply because some of the court reasoning was faulty,so long as any of the stated reasons are sufficient to justify the order.citation.kaldenbach mutual of omaha life ins.th.any valid,pertinent reason will be sufficient to uphold the trial court order.sav on drug stores,superior court cal th.
it is worth highlighting the proper role of the appellate court because thompson briefs rely heavily on federal trial court rulings,including several that involve similar cases against other aaa affiliates.these mostly unpublished and orders obviously have no binding precedential effect on this court.further,their ability to provide useful guidance is somewhat limited because we do not stand in the trial court place.our review is narrowly circumscribed.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at.our task on appeal is not to determine in the first instance whether the requested class is appropriate but rather whether the trial court has abused its discretion in denying certification.osborne subaru of america,d.
thus,each of the trial court decisions thompson cites may be correct,and if we were reviewing them,they might well be affirmed.but it does not necessarily follow that because the trial court in this case viewed the facts or legal issues differently than another trial court,an abuse of discretion occurred.the great discretion in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at trial courts are accorded in the matter of class certification almost guarantees that such differences of opinion between trial courts will occur and are entirely permissible.the questions before us are limited to whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence,and whether the decision was based on improper criteria or erroneous legal assumptions.brinker restaurant superior court,supra,cal th at.
relevant statutory frameworks 
thompson complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract,unjust enrichment,and violations of the ucl and clra.while the first three claims are analyzed under the same statutory framework for determining whether a class action is appropriate,the clra sets forth a slightly different standard.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the general requirements for certifying class actions.thus,it applies to thompson common law claims,and also to class actions under the ucl.in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at.a class action is authorized when the question is one of a common or general interest,of many persons,or when the parties are numerous,and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court.the party seeking class certification must establish the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members.washington mutual bank superior court cal th,linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at richmond dart industries,cal d.the community of interest requirement involves three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.richmond dart industries,supra,cal d at.an additional criteria of the superiority of the class action procedure is also sometimes considered.sav on drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at.
the clra enables a consumer to bring a class action on behalf of himself or herself and other consumers similarly situated if the consumer has suffered any damage from the use of any of enumerated acts or practices,subd.a,subd.a.the clra has its own class action requirements pursuant to civil code section,subdivision b the impracticability of bringing all members of the class before the court questions of law or fact common to the class are substantially similar and predominate over the questions affecting the individual members the claims of the class representative are typical of the class the class representatives will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class,subd.b.
the statutory requirements are substantial similar each requires the potential class to be sufficiently numerous as to make individual adjudication impractical,although the clra does not explicitly require an ascertainable class.code of civil procedure section community of interest requirements are,for all practical purposes,the same as the clra final three requirements the predominance of common issues of law or fact,the typicality of the class representative claims,and the adequacy of the class representative.the questions of a sufficiently large class and the representative adequacy are not at issue here.we therefore analyze the remaining requirements of the statutes simultaneously,with the exception of the superiority question,which applies only under code of civil procedure section.
ascertainable class 
whether a class is ascertainable within the meaning of section is determined by examining the class definition,the size of the class,and the means available for identifying the class members.citations.reyes board of supervisors d.class members are ascertainable where they may be readily identified without unreasonable expense or time by reference to official records.citation.citation.in determining whether a class is ascertainable,the trial court examines the class definition,the size of the class and the means of identifying class members.citation.lee dynamex,th.
ascertainability also addresses the breadth of the class.courts have recognized that class certification can be denied for lack of ascertainability when the proposed definition is overbroad and the plaintiff offers no means by which only those class members who have claims can be identified from those who should not be included in the class.citation.sevidal target th.
the court order denying certification noted the following with respect to the ascertainability of the class the putative class is not ascertainable on any of plaintiff causes of action.the auto club has presented evidence demonstrating that the proposed class is substantially overbroad in that it contains auto club members who would not be entitled to relief from the auto club on any of plaintiff causes of action because the members i received services during their delinquency ii had the auto club renewal policy explicitly disclosed to them iii were not injured by the auto club renewal practices because they were economically better off under the auto club system of renewal than they would have been if they had begun new memberships on the date of payment and paid the new membership fee the court cited to evidence on each point.
thompson argues the court ruling on this point is flawed because it misapprehends the nature of his claims and flies in the face of the evidence and violates established law,which holds that a corporate defendant shoddy does not prevent class certification.in thompson view,determining who the class members are is simple he believes that any member who renewed after the prior year expiration date should be a member,
