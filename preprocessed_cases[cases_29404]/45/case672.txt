robert miller pled guilty to mail fraud for insurers for services rendered in his medical practice.on appeal,miller argues that,when sentencing him,the district court miscalculated the amount of loss resulting from this fraud.finding no reversible error in the district court loss calculation,we affirm.
a grand jury indicted miller on counts of mail fraud in violation of west.the indictment charged miller with submitting false claims to medicaid,medicare,west virginia workers compensation program,and other health insurance providers.miller pled guilty to one count of mail fraud.the district court conditionally accepted miller plea pending receipt and review of a presentence investigation report psr.
in the psr,the probation officer concluded that miller defrauded medicare,medicaid,workers compensation,and private insurers in four different ways.first,attempting to seek a higher reimbursement rate,miller billed ordinary new patient visits as more expensive consultations.second,miller routinely upcoded services performed during office visits,claiming reimbursement for a higher level of service than he actually provided.third,miller engaged in phantom billing submitting claims for office visits,services,and equipment that he never provided.finally,miller used false diagnosis codes to claim reimbursement for services not covered by medicare and medicaid.
in preparing the psr,the probation officer reviewed over medicare and medicaid reports in an attempt to estimate the total loss resulting from miller fraudulent conduct.this review disclosed an error rate of in miller medicare billing and in his medicaid billing.this review also revealed that miller practice of upcoding could result in payment three times or more than legally authorized.
additionally,the probation officer relied on the results of an investigation by several undercover law enforcement officers who made visits to miller.in out of the visits made by the officers,miller submitted fraudulent claims to the government or private insurers.finally,the officer noted in the psr that miller paid million to settle the civil suit filed by the government,of which represented alleged overpayments by medicare and medicaid.
in summary,the psr estimated that total losses to medicare,medicaid,workers compensation,and private insurers exceeded.however,the psr recommended that the district court adopt the more conservative estimate of in losses,based only on losses to medicare and medicaid for fraudulent consultations.this figure did not include any losses to workers compensation or private insurers,nor did it include losses to medicare or medicaid resulting from miller fraudulent practices of upcoding,phantom billing,or false diagnoses.pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual b h,which establishes an increase of seven offense levels if an offense involves more than but less than,the psr recommended an increase of seven offense levels based on the estimated loss of.
miller filed objections to the psr,disputing the loss calculation contained in the report.he also moved for a downward departure pursuant to.in his written objection to the psr,and orally at the sentencing hearing,miller argued that the proper measure of loss for sentencing purposes was the difference between the amount he actually received from medicare and medicaid and the amount to which he was legitimately entitled for the services he rendered.using this formula,and after comparing his patient records with medicare and medicaid billing information,a billing specialist hired by the defense estimated the proper loss amount to be between and.according to miller calculations,the offense level based on the estimated loss should therefore have been increased by four levels,rather than the seven recommended in the psr.see b e.
at the sentencing hearing,the government conceded that some of miller objections to the psr were reasonable and that the defense expert loss estimate was based on better data than the psr.however,the government argued that the proper formula for calculating loss was the difference between the amount miller billed rather than the amount he actually received and the amount to which he was legitimately entitled.under this formula,the government computed losses of approximately,using miller own,most generous estimate of the amount of money to which he was entitled.pursuant to b g,the government therefore recommended increasing the offense level by six levels based on estimated loss in the range of to.
relying on the findings in the psr and the evidence presented by miller and the government at the sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that would be a conservative estimate of the loss in this case.however,because the government conceded at the sentencing hearing that it had only established loss in an amount ranging from to,the court held that the total loss amount was between and and accordingly increased miller offense level by six levels.see b g.the court also denied miller motion for a downward departure.
the sentencing guidelines direct courts to increase the offense level for defendants convicted of fraud commensurate with the amount of loss involved in the fraud.see b.miller challenges the district court interpretation of loss under the sentencing guidelines on two grounds.first,he contends that the district court erred in interpreting the term loss under the guidelines to encompass intended,rather than actual,loss.second,he argues that even if the district court correctly used intended loss in its calculations,the guidelines limit intended loss to the amount of loss that was likely,or possible,and the loss calculated by the district court was not likely.
we consider each of these arguments in turn,reviewing the district court interpretation of the term loss under the sentencing guidelines de novo.see united states dawkins,cir united states parsons,cir.
miller argues initially that precedent and the commentary to the sentencing guidelines require,in cases like his,that courts use the actual,rather than the intended,amount obtained through fraud to compute loss for sentencing purposes.he maintains that the district court erred,therefore,in using the amount he intended to obtain to compute the loss attributable to his fraud.in support of this proposition,miller cites language from dawkins,parsons,and,application note d.miller misreads our precedent and note d.
neither parsons nor dawkins addresses the actual rather than intended loss question.moreover,other circuit precedent makes clear that a court may use intended,rather than just actual,loss in calculating the loss attributable to fraud for sentencing purposes.
parsons,at,involved an employee of the united states postal service convicted of mail fraud for submitting false travel vouchers for cash advances or reimbursement.the vouchers sought reimbursement for some nonexistent expenses,but also sought reimbursement for some expenses legitimately incurred in the course of business.id.at sentencing,the district court held that the amount of loss was the total amount claimed on the false vouchers.id.we vacated that determination because the district court had failed to subtract legitimate expenses from the total amount of loss.id.we explained that l oss is not the total amount of the benefits the defendant received,because some benefits may be rightfully due instead,loss is measured by the amount diverted from proper purposes.id.at.
in dawkins,at,a jury convicted another postal worker of making false statements to obtain federal employee compensation benefits.the district court found that the postal worker false statements had disentitled him to any compensation benefits,and that the loss,therefore,was the entire amount of benefits dawkins received as a result of his false statements.id.at.we vacated,holding that parsons dictated that loss be calculated as the difference between the amount of benefits dawkins actually received and the amount he would have received had he truthfully and accurately completed the benefits forms.id.at citing parsons,at.
in this case,miller focuses on our use of the phrase benefits actually received in dawkins,and similar language in parsons,at tangible economic loss of the victim,to argue that the district court erred in using the loss he intended in calculating the fraud loss amount.however,neither parsons nor dawkins involved intended,but unrealized,losses.unlike miller,both parsons and dawkins actually received the full amount of money that they fraudulently claimed.thus,parsons and dawkins simply hold that when determining losses for sentencing purposes,a court must subtract the amount of money or benefits to which a defendant is legitimately entitled from the amount fraudulently claimed.in this case,therefore,the district court properly applied parsons and dawkins when it calculated the loss,subtracting the value of the services to which miller was actually entitled,the value of the services he actually performed from the amount that he billed.
although neither parsons nor dawkins addresses the issue that miller loss under the sentencing guidelines includes intended loss,or merely actual other cases we have squarely endorsed the use of intended loss rather than just actual loss.in united states wells,cir,for example,we considered a mail fraud conviction involving fraudulent financial instruments called comptroller warrants.we upheld the district court calculation of loss amount as including warrants in sealed envelopes that had never been mailed to the addressees,finding that the warrants were properly included in the loss calculation as an intended loss.id.at see also united states brothers constr,cir i f an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.quoting,cmt.united states loayza,cir where the intended loss is greater than the actual loss,the intended loss should be used.united states williams,cir under the guidelines,a fraud loss for sentencing purposes includes not just actual loss but intended loss whenever the latter can be determined.indeed,even parsons recognizes that loss calculations may include,actual,probable,or intended loss to the victims.at quoting united states marcus,cir.
accordingly,the relevant case law provides no support for miller argument that the guidelines limit loss to actual,rather than intended,loss.
like the case law,application note of,on which miller also relies for his actual loss argument,offers him little assistance.the note generally provides that if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss,cmt.because the intended loss in miller case exceeded the actual loss,the note apparently requires use of the intended loss figure.miller,however,argues that in cases involving losses to government programs like medicare and medicaid,note d modifies the general directive in note to use intended loss whenever possible.
note d states,in a case involving diversion of government program benefits,loss is the value of the benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses,cmt.d.miller maintains that this subsection instructs courts to use only actual losses to government programs,rather than intended losses.in essence,miller asks us to read note d to mean in a case involving diversion of public program benefits,loss is the value of the benefits actually diverted,rather than the value of the benefits intended to be diverted.
assuming that the case at hand can properly be characterized as one involving diversion of government program benefits,united states nastasi,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,miller makes the same error in interpreting note d,as he does in interpreting dawkins and parsons.like those cases,note d simply does not speak to the issue of whether courts can use intended rather than actual loss,but instead deals with an issue altogether different from the one to which miller would have it apply.specifically,note d directs courts to include the diversion of government program benefits as losses,even if the government funds ultimately go to eligible recipients.in other words,in cases involving government program benefits,loss is the value of the benefits diverted,as opposed to merely the value of benefits that ultimately end up in the hands of ineligible recipients,or are used for an unauthorized purpose.
a sampling of cases applying note d illustrates this point.for example,in brothers,at,we considered a fraud involving the distribution of federal highway funds.federal regulations require contractors,like the defendants in brothers,to comply with state programs fostering the development of disadvantaged business enterprises dbes.id.a jury convicted the brothers construction company of fraudulently representing that work done by a had been done by a dbe.id.the government uncovered this fraud before the completion of the project,however,and the contractors were able to change their arrangements,and ultimately satisfy the dbe requirements.id.at.
relying on the same application note that miller cites the contractors argued that no loss could be attributed to their conduct because the dbe requirements had ultimately been satisfied,and at no additional cost to the government.id.thus,they maintained that no government funds had actually been diverted from their intended recipients because the federal highway funds ultimately ended up in the hands of a contractor that satisfied the dbe requirements.id.we rejected this argument,holding that the contractors intention to divert the funds to a was sufficient to establish a loss under the.id.at if an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.quoting,cmt.
similarly,in united states brown,cir,the sixth circuit relied on the same note to reject brown argument that because his conduct had not resulted in any money being unlawfully taken,no loss had occurred.id.at.federal law required brown,an administrator of a section housing program,to place applicants for benefits on a waiting list,and then select persons from that waiting list in a particular order.id.at.however,brown chose certain individuals out of order in exchange for bribes and other consideration.id.at.on appeal,brown argued that the united states department of housing and urban development had suffered no loss as a result of his conduct because all persons selected for section benefits were,in fact,qualified to receive those benefits.id.at.the sixth circuit rejected this argument,holding that by choosing persons out of order,brown diverted or attempted to divert funds from the recipients contemplated by the application regulations.see also united states kosth,cir united states hayes,cir.
thus,these cases make clear that note d is not meant to distinguish actual loss of government program benefits from intended loss of government program benefits,as miller would have us read it.rather,note d clarifies that loss includes the amount of government program benefits diverted from intended recipients or uses,even if those funds are ultimately distributed to eligible recipients,or used for an otherwise authorized purpose.indeed,as in both brothers and brown,when note d is read in conjunction with the general directive relating to intended losses,extends to situations in which there may be no actual loss to the government because the diverted funds went to otherwise lawful recipients.
in sum,the district court did not err in interpreting loss under the sentencing guidelines to encompass intended loss.accordingly,we reject miller first argument.
alternatively,miller contends that even if the district court properly interpreted loss to include intended loss,the guidelines limit intended loss to that which is likely or possible.therefore,miller insists,the court erred in using the amount he billed to medicare and medicaid,rather than the payments those programs allow,in estimating the amount of loss he intended because he could not have any reasonable expectation to be paid any monies beyond what the programs allow.brief of appellant at.
as an initial matter,we note that this argument finds some support in case law from the sixth and tenth circuits.for example,in u
