ii.factual and procedural background 
prieto purchased a disability insurance policy the policy from paul revere in.the policy provided for two types of disability and residual.the policy defined total disability as follows 
total disability means that because of injury or sickness 
the insured is unable to perform the important duties of his regular occupation and 
the insured is not engaged in any other gainful occupation and 
the insured is under the regular and personal care of a physician.
total disability benefits were not payable until the day of the disability.this period was referred to as the elimination period.the policy also provided for residual disability benefits,which were defined as follows 
residual disability means that because of injury or sickness 
the insured is unable to perform all of the important duties of his regular occupation but is performing one or more important duties of that occupation or 
the insured is engaged in another occupation and 
the insured monthly earnings are reduced to percent or less of his prior earnings and 
the insured is under the regular and personal care of a physician.
residual benefits were payable only if the disability immediately followed a period of total disability lasting for the specified qualification period.the qualification period here was days.
prieto,who suffers from diabetes,was a chiropractic physician for years.in late,he developed an infection in his left foot that required the amputation of one toe on february.he was hospitalized for some time while his physician performed muscle and skin grafts.
following his release,prieto submitted a claim for disability benefits.on april,a paul revere representative,tom jolicoeur jolicoeur,met with prieto at his home.during that meeting,jolicoeur determined that prieto was totally disabled as defined by the policy.in addition,prieto informed jolicoeur that he believed he would be disabled for at least five months.because of the policy elimination period,jolicoeur determined that prieto would be entitled to two months of disability payments.although benefits were typically paid after the period ended,prieto requested that he be paid in advance due to financial difficulties.jolicoeur agreed and issued a check at that time jolicoeur then told prieto that if his disability continued beyond the anticipated five months,he should contact paul revere.
in august,prieto contacted paul revere to request additional benefits dating back to.the following month,he sent paul revere a letter in which he described his disability and its effect on his ability to work,and asked paul revere to reconsider his claim for total or partial disability in addition to relaying what he believed would be evidence supporting his claim,prieto mentioned that he had attempted to return to work on a basis from through october.
in response,paul revere sent another representative to interview prieto,requested his medical records,and reviewed the financial records of his chiropractic office.as a result of this investigation,paul revere determined that prieto did not qualify for total disability because he still worked as a chiropractor in a limited capacity.paul revere also concluded that prieto was not entitled to residual benefits because his chiropractic practice had been in decline before his surgery and it believed prieto reduced earnings were therefore not caused by his injury.prieto subsequently declined paul revere offer to buy out the remainder of his policy for.
on july,prieto brought suit against paul revere in arizona state court.paul revere removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds.after some discovery,prieto filed a motion for summary judgment on his breach of contract claim,seeking an award of total disability benefits.paul revere filed a for summary judgment as to prieto bad faith and punitive damages claims.
the district court denied prieto motion and held that paul revere had presented evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact regarding prieto ability to perform the important duties of his occupation.the district court granted paul revere,finding that prieto had not submitted evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that paul revere acted in bad faith.
after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for prieto.it found that he was entitled to residual disability benefits from august to september,and as a result of an additional toe amputation that occurred during litigation,total disability benefits from october onward.the district court also found sua sponte that,because prieto failed to contact paul revere between august and august,prieto had waived any claim to benefits for that time period.prieto was awarded a total of inclusive of interest,of which was related to the august period at issue here.this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
a claim of bad faith arises when the insurance company intentionally denies,fails to process or pay a claim without a reasonable basis for such action.noble am.life ins.in this case,the district court held that prieto had not presented evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that paul revere acted in bad faith and thus granted partial summary judgment to paul revere.on appeal,prieto argues first that the district court misapplied arizona law,and second that there was sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact as to whether paul revere acted reasonably in denying his claim.
arizona law 
prior to,arizona courts generally held that a bad faith claim can not exist for claims that are fairly debatable.tobel travelers ins,citing noble,at.in other words,if the insurance company grounds for denying the claim had some reasonable basis,plaintiff bad faith claim failed.in zilisch state farm mut.auto.ins,the arizona supreme court changed its approach somewhat,finding that 
while fair debatability is a necessary condition to avoid a claim of bad faith,it is not always a sufficient condition.the appropriate inquiry is whether there is sufficient evidence from which reasonable jurors could conclude that in the investigation,evaluation,and processing of the claim,the insurer acted unreasonably and either knew or was conscious of the fact that its conduct was unreasonable.
at citing noble,at.at issue here is whether the district court erred in finding that bad faith could be decided as a matter of law on summary judgment.we review the district court application of state substantive law in diversity cases de novo.see,salve regina coll.russell,d.
the zilisch court held that w hile an insurer may challenge claims which are fairly debatable its belief in fair debatability is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.at quoting sparks republic life ins.the district court in this case held that the conduct alleged by prieto did not raise a genuine issue of material fact whether paul revere dealt unfairly or dishonestly with prieto claim or failed to give fair and equal consideration to his interests.order.because this standard of law enunciated by the district court is consistent with and its predecessors,the district court did not err in its construction of arizona law.
sufficiency of evidence 
prieto next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to paul revere because there was sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could have found that paul revere intentionally denied his claim and thus acted in bad faith.specifically,prieto points to paul revere focus on prieto loss of income minimal investigation into prieto medical condition and various offenses as testified to by an expert.
