funeral financial systems funeral financial,asks this court to find that the district court incorrectly held the assignment of a world war ii veteran insurance benefits to funeral financial violative of the policy terms and,thereby,erroneously granted the united states motion for summary judgment.for the reasons stated below,we agree with the district court determination regarding the validity of the assignment,and we affirm that court decision.
world war ii veteran chafois gilliam gilliam died on january.as a result of his service to his country,gilliam obtained a national service life insurance nsli policy from the united states government in,valued at,pursuant to the national service life insurance act of.gilliam designated his wife,shirley gilliam,and son,dwight gilliam,as joint beneficiaries of the policy.
four days after gilliam death,shirley and dwight gilliam assigned all rights,title,and interest in of the insurance benefits available to as joint beneficiaries of the policy to another of gilliam sons,keith gilliam.on the very next day,keith gilliam purported to assign the interest he had just acquired to the funeral home in return for funeral services for gilliam,in turn,purported to assign this interest to funeral financial in exchange for immediate funds from funeral financial to pay for gilliam funeral expenses.
funeral financial attempted to collect the life insurance policy proceeds by contacting the united states department of veterans affairs the veterans administration.funeral financial provided the veterans administration with written notice of the purported assignment from,and copies of the preceding purported assignments of the insurance benefits.upon review of this information,the veterans administration notified funeral financial that the proceeds of a government life insurance policy can not be assigned to a funeral home or to any funeral financial service company.
responding to the government refusal to pay funeral financial the proceeds from gilliam nsli policy,funeral financial filed a civil action in the chancery division of the circuit court of cook county,illinois,seeking declaratory relief against national service life insurance company.funeral financial urged a determination that the assignments were valid and that the veterans administration must pay funeral financial.the united states removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,eastern division,pursuant to a.additionally,because national service life insurance is not a separate entity,but instead is a program implemented by the department of veterans affairs,the united states was substituted as the proper party defendant.funeral financial then sought relief pursuant to a,which provides for federal district court review of claims against the united states involving nsli policies.
the united states filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the assignment clause in gilliam policy restricts the assignability of his nsli death benefits and renders the purported assignments invalid.additionally,the government argued that prohibits any assignment of nsli benefits that is not specifically authorized by law,and mandates that these benefits shall be exempt from the claim of creditors,such as funeral financial.
the district court agreed with the government that the purported assignments were invalid.in explaining its conclusion,the district court focused on the assignment clause in gilliam policy,which states,this policy is not assignable by the insured.a beneficiary may assign all or any part of interest in this policy to the insured widow,widower,child,father,mother,grandfather,grandmother,brother,or sister,when the designated contingent beneficiary,if any,joins in the assignment.the district court found that this language,which is taken from the language of a,clearly prohibits the assignment from keith gilliam to,as well as the subsequent assignment from to funeral financial.

funeral financial asserts numerous arguments in support of its position that summary judgment was improperly granted because the attempted assignment of of gilliam insurance benefits to funeral financial was valid.we find all of these arguments unpersuasive.thus,we need only address three of funeral financial strongest arguments in explaining why the district court correctly granted the government motion for summary judgment.
a.the language of the assignment clause 
the validity of the assignment at issue can be determined by examining the language of the assignment clause in gilliam insurance policy.gilliam policy,issued pursuant to a federal statute providing military veterans with insurance,is a written government contract.see prudential ins.of america athmer,cir discussing life insurance policy issued pursuant to the servicemen group life insurance act of.interpreting the meaning of a provision in a federal government contract is a matter of federal common law,and therefore,we must apply federal common law rules of contract interpretation to determine whether the purported assignments of gilliam insurance proceeds were valid.see id.at see also pitcher principal mut.ins,cir.
