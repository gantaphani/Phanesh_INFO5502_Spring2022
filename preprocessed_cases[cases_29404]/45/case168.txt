this appeal concerns a settlement reached in between,fac and cooperativa de seguros de vida de puerto rico cosvi.fac is a consulting firm that was hired by the puerto rico department of health the department to review certain past medicare cost reimbursement claims submitted by the department to the federal government.cosvi is a fiscal intermediary acting for the federal government medicare program in evaluating claims submitted by claimants.
it appears that fac contracted with the department to look for unreimbursed or medicare claims from past years and to obtain reopening of such claims,receiving in exchange the promise of a portion of any new recovery.in july fac did submit a package of claims to cosvi,seeking enlarged reimbursement for the department.cosvi rejected the reimbursement claims,ultimately leading the department to terminate its contract with fac.
in fac sued cosvi in the federal district court in puerto rico.in this suit,fac charged cosvi with violations of rico,a,d,based on alleged extortion attempts relating to the reimbursement requests fac had made on behalf of the department.on april,on the third day of a jury trial,fac and cosvi reached a settlement agreement.they subsequently informed the district court that they had settled,and,at the parties request,the court on april,dismissed the case with prejudice pursuant to.a.
unfortunately,the settlement agreement was oral,which is permissible,see quint staley,cir,cert.denied,d,although often unwise.thereafter,the district court was on two different occasions asked to clarify and enforce the settlement.importantly,both parties sought and benefitted from the district court intervention after the settlement was reached.
as early as may,fac began a succession of court filings and protest letters to cosvi,claiming that cosvi was not living up to the settlement.most pertinent to the present appeal,fac complained that cosvi had not sent a promised letter to the centers for medicare and medicaid cms,the federal agency that had power to approve the reopening of certain of the past reimbursement claims identified by fac 
both sides agreed that a letter was promised,but they differed as to its terms.fac construed cosvi obligation as one of admitting to cms that fraud had occurred within the cosvi organization.cosvi,writing to cms in may to request reopening of the claims,was apparently anxious to minimize the scope of any admissions and went no further than to explain that t his request is based on facts learned by cosvi as a result of its litigation with fac,and pursuant to cfr section d.the cited regulation permits an intermediary determination to be reopened and revised at any time if it is established that such determination was procured by fraud or similar fault of any party to the determination.d.
cms refused to reopen,saying only that the exceptions to the otherwise applicable time limit on reopening include subsection d do not fit the facts of this case.cosvi wrote a second letter in july that went no further in admissions but offered to seek a court order to provide certain documentary evidence for cms to consider,possibly an oblique reference to fbi reports.cms still took no action to reopen the claims.
in the meantime,cosvi,in response to filings by fac in the district court seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement,not only defended its own actions but in turn sought district court action to compel fac to dismiss claims it had earlier brought against cosvi in the local puerto rico trial court.these local claims encompassed the same underlying conduct as fac federal court rico claims,but sought relief on behalf of individual plaintiffs under puerto rico defamation law.cosvi argued to the district court,and fac denied,that dismissal of such claims was part of the federal court settlement.
in august,the district court resolved the matter by amending its original april judgment of dismissal with prejudice.the amended august judgment began by summarizing the court understanding of the settlement as follows 
this court actively participated in the settlement discussions held by the parties before and during the trial of the case.the court understood the agreements reached to be summarized as follows 
a.the payment to plaintiff officials by defendant cosvi of an amount that the parties agreed not to disclose publicly.
b.the payment is to be in consideration of plaintiff claims under laws ann.and,as all allegations under rico have been dismissed.
c.the sending of a letter by cosvi to cms,on behalf of fac,requesting the reopening of the medicare part a reimbursement claims.
d.that any payments made as a result of the audit of the medicare claims would be deposited in this court for distribution purposes.
e.the dismissal with prejudice of the instant case and of fac local court action.
the amended judgment then discussed the dispute between the parties as to whether the settlement agreement required fac to dismiss its local court action,and determined that it did.the judgment concluded by saying as per the terms of the settlement agreement and.a,the amended complaint is hereby dismissed with prejudice neither side appealed from this amended judgment fac dismissed the state claims and the district court subsequently disbursed certain funds that had been deposited with the court by cosvi to implement the settlement.
during,cms was apparently given access to further information relating to an fbi investigation,but it still did not authorize the reopening of the disputed claims.in late,fac filed a motion asking the district court to order cosvi to comply with various obligations which fac claimed to be part of the settlement,including reopening the claims in question on its own authority.cosvi denied that it could reopen the claims on its own authority and said it had complied with all its obligations,including the required request to cms to reopen the claims.
in september and october,the district court denied fac new motion and then,on fac reconsideration motion,reopened the matter.in august,the district court entered a new order discussing at length the procedural history of the case and concluding that cosvi earlier letter to cms had not complied with its settlement obligations.the court ordered cosvi to send cms a new request for reopening,which was to include the following sentence it has come to our attention that fraudulent activities took place within our organization with regard to the claims at issue,and,pursuant to cfr section a and d,we request that you reopen and reassess the claims in question due to a finding of fraud or similar fault.
cosvi then filed the present appeal to this court and obtained a stay pendente lite of the direction that it send the new letter.on this appeal,cosvi argues that the district court had not retained jurisdiction to construe and enforce the settlement.in the alternative,it says that the district judge improperly modified the terms of the settlement and erred in concluding that cosvi had failed to comply with it.we begin,of course,with the jurisdictional objection.see bolduc united states,cir.
in the district court,cosvi did not object to the court authority to construe and enforce the settlement,but the objection to subject matter jurisdiction is not waivable and may be raised for the first time on appeal.am.fiber finishing,tyco healthcare group,lp,cir.if the district court authority rested solely on the original judgment,we would agree that the settlement could not be enforced,save by an independent law suit but,as we will see,the entry of the amended judgment alters the situation adversely to cosvi.
the law is now settled that a federal court does not have inherent jurisdiction to enforce a settlement merely because it presided over the law suit that led to the settlement.kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.the federal court has ancillary jurisdiction to enforce only if 
the parties obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of by separate provision such as a provision retaining jurisdiction over the settlement agreement or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in t
