we must decide whether unloading an injured passenger from a motor vehicle constitutes use of that motor vehicle,under california law.we conclude that it does.
background 
this case arises out of an automobile accident.alexandra van horn was a passenger in a car driven by a man named anthony glen watson.watson lost control of his vehicle the car ran off the road and crashed into a light pole.a second car,which was not involved in the crash,stopped at the scene of the accident to render aid.a woman named lisa torti was a passenger in the second car.torti saw van horn inside the wrecked car,and allegedly feared that van horn might be in danger.torti later testified that watson car was smoking and leaking fluid,causing her to fear that the car might catch fire or explode.torti grabbed van horn and physically removed her from watson car.
van horn suffered severe spinal injuries after the car accident,and became a paraplegic.van horn sued torti in california state court,alleging that torti caused van horn injuries when she removed van horn from watson car.see van horn watson,cal 
at the time of the accident,torti was insured under a package policy including car insurance,homeowners insurance,and personal excess liability insurance issued by encompass insurance company torti tendered her defense against van horn lawsuit to encompass.encompass accepted the tender,and assumed responsibility for torti defense.
torti also sought to tender her defense to two additional insurance companies insurance company and coast national insurance company.
mid century had issued a car insurance policy to torti.the mid century policy covered damages for which an insured person is legally liable because of bodily injury to any person arising out of the use of a private passenger car though torti obtained the mid century policy in connection with her own car which was not involved in the accident,the policy also covered torti use of any other private passenger car if such use was with the permission of the owner.thus,if torti used watson car with watson permission when she removed van horn from watson car,the mid century policy covered torti.
coast national had issued a car insurance policy to watson,the driver of the car that crashed.the coast national policy covered liability for personal injuries for which any insured becomes legally responsible because of an accident.the policy insured not only watson,but also a ny person using watson covered auto with watson permission.thus,if torti used watson car with watson permission when she removed van horn from watson car,the coast national policy also covered torti.
both mid century and coast national rejected torti tender,refusing to accept any responsibility for her legal defense.encompass continued to bear sole responsibility for torti defense,and ultimately settled van horn claims against torti for million.
after settling van horn lawsuit against torti,encompass brought this lawsuit against mid century and coast national.in this lawsuit,encompass seeks contribution or subrogation for the expenses encompass incurred in its defense and indemnification of torti.encompass argues that mid century and coast national had their own duty to defend and indemnify torti according to encompass,the mid century and coast national insurance policies covered torti when torti removed van horn from watson car,because that act constituted permissive use of watson car.mid century and coast national deny that their insurance policies covered torti,arguing that torti did not engage in permissive use of watson car.
the district court entered judgment in favor of midcentury and coast national the district court reasoned that torti did not use watson car when she removed van horn from that car.the district court did not reach the issue of permission.
this appeal followed.

discussion 
we must decide whether torti used watson car when she removed van horn from that car.the parties do not dispute that torti unloaded van horn from watson car.thus,we must decide whether unloading an injured passenger from an automobile constitutes use of that automobile,within the meaning of mid century and coast national insurance policies.we conclude that it does.
in this case,determining the meaning of the term use is an exercise in statutory construction.the relevant language in the mid century and coast national insurance policies is required by the california insurance code with some exceptions,insurance code section,subdivision b requires every automobile liability insurer to provide permissive user coverage to the same extent as that afforded to the named insured.haynes farmers ins,cal see cal.b.language required by the california insurance code must be construed to effect not the intent of the parties,but the intent of the legislature.therefore,the rules of statutory construction apply.galanty paul revere life ins,cal.thus,to determine whether unloading a motor vehicle constitutes use of that motor vehicle as defined in the insurance policies at issue here,we must determine whether the california insurance code defines unloading a motor vehicle as use of that motor vehicle.
the text of the california insurance code makes clear that unloading a motor vehicle constitutes use of that motor vehicle.the california insurance code provides,in relevant part the term use when applied to a motor vehicle shall only mean operating,maintaining,loading,or unloading a motor vehicle.cal.g emphasis added.section g unambiguously equates the unloading of a motor vehicle with the use of a motor vehicle,and our inquiry should end there.see kavanaugh sonoma cnty.union high sch,cal if the language of the statute is not ambiguous,the plain meaning controls.
as one would expect from the text of section g,california courts consistently define use of a vehicle to include unloading.see scottsdale ins.state farm mut.auto.ins,d,as a matter of law,an injured person was using the insured truck if he was operating,maintaining,loading,or unloading it.citing cal.g city of los angeles allianz ins,d,the city contends it was a user of the truck under the controlling case law,which holds that use of a vehicle includes its loading and unloading.from this principle,which is correct internal citation omitted am.ins.coburn,t he use of a vehicle includes its loading and unloading.we can find no case adopting the dissent theory that,under section g,the unloading of a vehicle constitutes use of the vehicle only when the unloading is part of the user act of availing herself of the vehicle.dissenting opinion at.on the contrary,california courts have consistently said that unloading a vehicle without more constitutes use.
mid century and coast national,for their part,argue that unloading a motor vehicle only constitutes use of that motor vehicle if the unloading is integral to the function of the vehicle as a means of transport,so that the person doing the unloading gain s a benefit from the vehicle.mid century and coast national point to travelers insurance northwestern mutual insurance,which held that performing maintenance on a motor vehicle without more was not necessarily use of the motor vehicle.this argument fails,for two reasons.
first,travelers can tell us nothing about the definition of use under section g travelers was decided in,and section g was not enacted until.see cal.stat.ch.to the extent that travelers is inconsistent with section g,we are bound by section g,and not by trav
