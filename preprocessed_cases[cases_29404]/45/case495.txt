opinion of the court 
appellant astenjohnson,asten,manufactured asbestos dryer felts and other materials used in the paper industry.appellees columbia casualty company columbia and american insurance company american issued million of comprehensive liability insurance to asten in and.these policies contained an exclusion from coverage for any claim alleging an exposure to or the contracting of asbestosis the asbestosis exclusion clause.both columbia and american have denied coverage under this exclusion for all bodily injury claims.asten here seeks,inter alia,a declaratory judgment that its coverage under these policies includes all claims related to asbestos exposure other than those involving the fibrotic lung disease,asbestosis.after a bench trial,the district court denied asten the declaratory relief sought.the primary issues before us are whether asten was entitled to a jury trial under the seventh amendment,and whether the district court resolution of the coverage issue should stand.
background 
a.the policies at issue the subject policies.columbia policiesa.april,to april,policy period 
columbia sold asten a comprehensive general liability insurance policy covering the period between april,and april,columbia primary policy.the policy provided limits of and had a per claim deductible.columbia also sold asten an excess liability policy for this period,which provided limits of columbia excess policy.
april,to october,policy period 
columbia sold asten a comprehensive liability policy for the period between april,and october,providing limits of and having a per claim deductible columbia primary policy.columbia also sold asten an excess third party liability policy providing per limits of columbia excess policy.the policy was in excess to the limits set forth in the underlying american policy.
terms of the columbia policies 
the columbia policies contain the following exclusion 
it is agreed that this policy does not apply to any claim alleging an exposure to or the contracting of asbestosis or any liability resulting therefrom.
it is further agreed that this policy does not apply to any claim arising out the insured membership in the asbestos textile institute.
asbestosis was not defined in any of the policies.
the primary policies contained a notice provision,stating in relevant part that i n the event of an occurrence,written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information shall be given as soon as practicable.the excess policies also contained a provision stating that notice shall be given as soon as practicable.
american policies 
a.the policy period 
in,american sold asten a blanket excess policy with in annual indemnity limits,excess to a primary policy issued by argonaut insurance company.the policy did not contain an exclusion.the american policy contained a products liability endorsement,however,which stated that the policy did not apply except insofar as coverage is available to the insured under primary policies.
april,to april,policy period 
for the annual period beginning april,american sold asten a blanket excess liability policy american umbrella policy with a annual indemnity limit,excess to the columbia primary policy.this policy contained no language,but provided a product liability endorsement which indicated that the policy did not apply unless coverage was available under the columbia primary policy.it further contained a notice provision,which stated that w hen an occurrence takes place which is reasonably likely to give rise to a claim under this policy notice shall be provided as soon as practicable to the company.
april,to october,
for the period beginning april,american sold asten a blanket excess liability coverage american umbrella policy that was substantially identical to the american umbrella policy.the relevant notice portion of the policy stated that t he insured shall immediately advise the company of any occurrence or disaster which will probably result in liability under this policy.
american also sold to asten an additional blanket excess liability policy for the policy period april,to october,american excess policy.the american excess policy had liability limits of,excess to the underlying limits contained in the american umbrella policy and the columbia excess policy.
pretrial proceedings.
asten march,complaint asserted three claims relating to its asbestos litigation which it describes as claims for legal relief declaratory judgment claims against columbia and american and a breach of contract claim against columbia.it insists that the district court improperly denied it a jury trial on these claims.
count i,containing the declaratory judgment claims,alleged that columbia and american had refused to honor their obligations under the insurance contracts and asked,inter alia,for a declaration that asten was entitled to have columbia and american reimburse astenjohnson for,or pay on behalf of astenjohnson,any and all judgments or settlements reached in the underlying actions,until such time as the total aggregate limits of each of the foregoing insurance policies have been exhausted.the underlying actions were suits filed against asten as of the filing of the complaint.count i also sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the aggregate limits of liability under american umbrella and excess policies and with respect to american duty to pay defense costs under its excess policy.
count ii alleged a breach of contract claim against columbia for refusing to defend and indemnify asten for certain claims that had been tendered to it in the fall of.it asks for an award requiring columbia to pay all monetary damages suffered by asten.
after the close of discovery and in anticipation of the final conference on january,and the then scheduled january,trial,the parties were required by local rule to file memoranda including a list of every item of monetary damage claimed,including as appropriate computations.asten memorandum contained no itemization or computation of the money damages it had thus far suffered and identified no expert witnesses who intended to testify about those damages.at the conference,asten counsel was unable to articulate in response to the court direct questions what damages asten had suffered.as a result,columbia and american filed motions to strike asten jury demands.
the trial was delayed and the motions to strike were not heard until june,four months after their filing.prior to that hearing,asten tendered no description of the damages it sought or the evidence it proposed to introduce in support of its damage claim.at the hearing,asten counsel acknowledged to the court that asten had not yet suffered losses because it had had its other carriers pay to defend and indemnify it.when asked what asten would be asking the jury to award it,the response was as follows 
the court what will you be asking the jury to award to you 
ellison we be asking the jury to award us the amount of insurance we have had to use up in coverage,that is coverage that had to be used for claims,that we were required to use or needed to use because the coverage that was available under the columbia policy was wrongfully denied to us same with american.
the court and what that amount 
ellison that amount,your honor,millions of dollars.do know the exact number.young and gibson both have firsthand knowledge that process.
the court well,you you ten days from trial and you ca tell me what number you going to ask the jury to award to you 
ellison can tell you it millions of dollars.the burn rate over the last couple of years has been about million a year in coverage that they have used up.
the court so,on the jury interrogatory we say to the jury,what amount do you award to the plaintiff,you want them to write in millions of dollars 
ellison no,it will be million.
there was no further tender of evidence of damages by asten prior to or at trial.
c.the district court decisions 
the district court granted the motion to strike asten jury demand.it noted that the seventh amendment right to a jury trial attaches to actions at law,but not actions in equity,and that in its analysis it was required to look to the substance of a claim rather than the labeling used by the party asserting it.because asten as of two weeks prior to trial had tendered no competent evidence that recoverable damage had yet been suffered by asten and because resultant damages were an essential element of a cause of action for breach of contract under pennsylvania law,the court concluded that the breach of contract claim did not require a jury trial.it then held that asten remaining claims were equitable and,accordingly,that a bench trial was appropriate.
following a bench trial,the district court found that the parties had intended the exclusion clause to exclude all cases.it recognized that asbestosis was a specific respiratory disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.it noted,however,that read literally the phrase exposure to asbestosis would only exclude liability for someone alleging that he or she was harmed by being exposed to a person with a disease.the court therefore declined to attribute to the parties the literal meaning of the text without considering the other permissible aids to contract interpretation under pennsylvania,trade usage,the performance of the parties,and the situation and negotiations providing context for the parties original agreement.i nformed by the usage of trade,usage of the parties,and the course of performance of the parties,the court concluded that the asbestosis exclusion len t itself to only one interpretation it was intended by the parties to exclude from coverage all claims deriving from the exposure to asten products.
the district court also held that asten declaratory judgment claim against columbia,although not its claim against american,was barred by laches and that the defendants were entitled to reformation of the exclusion clause to clearly exclude all claims.finally,the court ruled that the aggregate liability limit applied to the entire months of each of american policies and that american excess policies did not impose a duty to defend or pay defense costs.the court declined to reach the defendants defense that asten was barred from relief by its failure to comply with the notice provisions of the policies.
ii.declaratory judgment as a matter of law 
asten insists that the exclusion clause is unambiguous,that the district court improperly considered anything other than the text of that clause,that there are no material disputes of fact,and that it is entitled to the declaratory judgment it seeks as a matter of law.we can not agree.
the district court properly considered the extrinsic evidence which it did.pennsylvania law follows the restatement approach to the interpretation of written,integrated contracts.sunbeam liberty mutual ins,restatement second of contracts,et.parol evidence can not be used to contradict the provisions of such a contract.in determining whether such a contradiction would occur,however,the text of the contract must first be interpreted in light of any evidence of trade usage and the performance of the parties under the contract.sunbeam,at.if after the consideration of such evidence,the intent of the parties remains unclear,evidence concerning the negotiations of the parties may also be considered in reaching a conclusion concerning the intention of the parties.resolution trust urban redev.auth.of pittsburgh.
the district court first found,based on expert testimony and the testimony of asten procuring agent,gloria forbes,that in the insurance world of the the term asbestosis was used to mean two different things.first,the term was used to mean the specific disease discussed above and found in a medical dictionary.second,it was used as a generic term,an all encompassing term that includes all diseases.the district court next looked to the course of performance,finding that asten course of performance over the twenty plus years after the execution of the subject policies is the most compelling evidence of the intention of the parties.in the view of the court,that evidence clearly demonstrates that asten understood and intended the asbestosis exclusion to bar all claims alleging any disease.id.
only after these conclusions did the district court turn to the circumstances surrounding the entering of the policies.at that point,there was clearly sufficient doubt about the literal reading of the text to warrant consideration of parol evidence.based on the parol evidence,the court found that the april,communication between dvua and babb,agents for columbia and asten respectively,reflect ed a meeting of the minds,that all claims would be excluded.the court further concluded that the circumstances surrounding the issuance of the policies strongly suggested that the exclusion was not intended to exclude liability for asbestosis only.as the court put it 
given the nature of the underlying complaints in the early,where plaintiffs often would allege an asbestosis injury along with other injuries,the asbestosis exclusion that only applied to the specific disease asbestosis would offer an insurance company very little protection.that is because under pennsylvania law,an insurer excluding just asbestosis claims would still be required to defend any asbestos lawsuit alleging asbestosis and any other of the diseases that result from exposure to asbestos.the insurer duty to defend would only be relieved if the claimant disease was narrowed down to asbestosis only.and if the diagnosis could never be narrowed down to exclude all disease but asbestosis,the insurer would have to indemnify as well.
and both asten and columbia were well aware of this.as it learned in canada,asten knew it would not be able to acquire coverage for claims.asten manufactured asbestos and its exposure to asbestos liability had begun prior to.columbia knew asten history and it expressed to asten agent its desire to exclude all claims.
footnote omitted.
as we have indicated,we find no fault with the district court consideration of evidence beyond the text of the policies.asten primary arguments to the contrary are that the text of the asbestosis exclusion is not ambiguous,and that consideration of evidence indicating trade use of asbestosis as a catchall for disease was improper because it was not shown to be continuous,uniform,and notorious.we address those arguments in turn.
asten points to dictionary definitions of exposure which include the act of being open to something that poses a danger or risk.based on this definition,asten insists that exposure to asbestosis in the context of the contractual language exposure to or contracting of asbestosis unambiguously means exposure to the risk of contracting asbestosis.asten interpretation equates exposure to the asbestosis disease with the risk of contracting that disease.however,as noted by the district court,these are separate and distinct harms.the district court,employing the dictionary definition relied upon by asten,pointed out that someone exposed to the asbestosis disease runs no risk of contracting that disease.while asten suggested interpretation under some circumstances might be a permissible one,it does not render exposure to asbestosis unambiguous.moreover,as we have indicated,under pennsylvania law,the district court would be entitled to consider trade usage and party performance even if asten suggested reading were consistent with a literal reading of the text of the exclusion.
asten further argues that the district court improperly considered the trade usage evidence that asbestosis was commonly used in the insurance world in the early to refer to all diseases.in support of this argument,asten points to evidence that those in the industry regularly used asbestosis to mean the specific disease,evidence that policies issued by others broadly excluded all diseases without using asbestosis as shorthand for the broad exclusion,and the fact that the defendants trade usage evidence did not include other policies in which asbestosis was used to mean diseases.as we read pennsylvania law,however,to be an interpretation aid,trade usage evidence need not demonstrate that a particular term always carries a particular meaning or that the particular meaning claimed can not be otherwise stated.while evidence of nearly universal use of a trade usage term might well be required in order to alter what would otherwise be an unambiguous contract term or phrase,where,as here,a literal reading of the contract produces a nonsensical or unclear meaning and the court finds that the trade usage term is in frequent use by people in the trade at the relevant time,we conclude that the trade use evidence of the kind here presented can properly be considered.
it follows that asten is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its declaratory judgment claims regarding the asbestosis exclusion clause.
iii.jury trial 
first,we conclude that the district court was entitled to find that asten was unable to prove recoverable damages at trial and to rely upon that fact in resolving the seventh amendment issue before it.contrary to asten suggestion,this was not a situation in which damage evidence was found to be too speculative or uncertain.this was a situation where it was firmly established that asten was not prepared to prove recoverable damages.while it is true,as asten stresses before us,that it is not impossible for an insured to experience recoverable loss as a result of having to resort to alternative sources of coverage,an insured is obviously not entitled to recover litigation expenses and indemnity for a particular claim twice from two different insurers.moreover,far more than a burn rate needs to be shown to successfully support the premature exhaustion theory which asten appears to be pressing in its brief before us and no such evidence was tendered in response to the district court call for a tender.in short,no evidence has been tendered to prove that asten had yet suffered a loss as a result of columbia denial of coverage.

we now turn to the issue of whether the declaratory judgment claims that went to trial were ones that entitled asten to a jury trial the controlling law is set forth in our opinion in,lake shore land,cir 
in this diversity action,the plaintiff asked for a declaratory judgment establishing its right under an option agreement to compel the defendant conveyance of certain realty at a future date.asserting that its answer presented legal issues,the defendant demanded a jury trial,but the district court determined that the suit was the counterpart of an equitable action for specific performance and struck the request for a jury.
declaratory judgments were created as a remedy in the federal courts some four years before the merger of law and equity took effect.see.the remedy may be granted upon either legal or equitable claims and is sui generis 
to effectuate the statute neutral position on the jury trial,postmerger courts have found it necessary to preserve the distinction between law and equity in the declaratory judgment context.a workable formula that has been developed is to determine in what kind of suit the claim would have come to court if there were no declaratory judgment remedy.see wright miller,supra.if the declaratory judgment action does not fit into one of the existing equitable patterns but is essentially an inverted law action brought by one who would have been a defendant at common the parties have a right to a jury.but if the action is the counterpart of a suit in equity,there is no such right.see james,and hazard,civil procedure,at ed.
applying this test the district court properly characterized the case at bar as equitable.the complaint centered on the defendant obligation to convey title to the plaintiff at a certain time in the was no claim for damages or any other legal remedy.an action for specific performance without a claim for damages is purely equitable and historically has always been tried to the court.see klein shell oil,cir moore federal practice,ed wright miller,supra.the plaintiff suit,therefore,is not an inverted law suit,but rather is a claim cast in declaratory judgment form because the right to specific performance had not ripened at the time the action was filed 
see,james pennsylvania general ins,question is whether an action in equity could be maintained if declaratory judgment was not available.see also wright miller,supra same.the court itself has noted that the fact that the action is in form a declaratory judgment case should not obscure the essential nature of the action.see simler conner,supra at,d.
id.at footnote omitted emphasis supplied.
the teachings of reflect the law generally.see,fischer imaging,cir finding a seventh amendment right to a jury trial in a declaratory judgment action,in which the plaintiff had not yet suffered injury,because,absent declaratory judgment procedures,the plaintiff claim would have come to the court in a suit on the contract am.safety equip.maguire,cir to assess seventh amendment claim courts have looked to the basic nature of the suit in which the issues involved would have arisen if congress had not created the declaratory judgment act.
like this case,was not an inverted lawsuit situation,and our court therefore looked to the nature of the claim set forth in the complaint.it concluded that a jury trial was not required because the issues raised in the complaint which allege the right to compel a transfer of real estate to plaintiff at a later date would come to court in a suit for specific performance if there were no declaratory judgment remedy.
if we ask in what kind of suit asten claim s would have come to court if there were no declaratory judgment remedy,at,it seems clear that the answer is an action in assumpsit for damages consisting,inter alia,of reimbursement of litigation costs and amounts paid to victims.see,charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.there is no possibility that it would arise in a suit for specific performance because an action in assumpsit is an available and adequate remedy at law,see,vanderveen erie indem,and in the federal courts equity has always only acted when legal remedies were inadequate.beacon theatres,westover,d.
columbia and american insist that asten count i is in the nature of a claim for specific performance or a bill quia timet,a legal doctrine that allows a person to seek equitable relief from a future probable harm to a specific right or interest.pennsylvania nat.mut.cas.ins.city of pine bluff,cir quoting black law dictionary ed.as we have indicated,asten claims could not be adjudicated in an action for specific performance because it would have an adequate remedy at law.with respect to bills of quia timet,american cites a string of cases which state that a declaratory judgment is analogous to or had its genesis in the equitable bill of quia timet.none involved a situation analogous to this case,and any suggestion that quia timet and declaratory judgments are synonymous would prove too would result in all declaratory judgment actions being equitable,and we know that not to be the case.
it is true that a bill of quia timet allows a person to seek equitable relief from a future probable harm,that he or she fears.as one would expect,however,it does not under all circumstances allow relief from feared harm that has not yet occurred.essential to quia timet equity jurisdiction is the absence of an adequate remedy at law.as the supreme court explained in di giovanni camden fire ins.ass.
this court has recently pointed out that equity will not compel the cancellation and surrender of an insurance policy procured by fraud where the loss has occurred and a suit at law to recover the amount of the loss is pending or threatened.enelow new york life insurance.the alleged fraud of petitioners,as well as their alleged destruction of the property insured are defenses available in suits at law upon the policies.while equity may afford relief quia timet by way of cancellation of a document if there is a danger that the defense to an action at law upon it may be lost or prejudiced,no such danger is apparent where,as respondent bill affirmatively shows,the loss has occurred and suits at law on the policies are imminent,and there is no showing that the defenses can not be set up and litigated as readily in a suit at law as in equity.see enelow new york life insurance,supra.
see also in re lockwood,vacated,d bills quia timet were generally appropriate if there was a danger that a defense at law might be prejudiced or lost if not tried immediately.equity.the objective of bills quia timet is to prevent anticipated mischiefs which could not after their occurrence be adequately redressed.
based on these authorities,the issue posed to us is whether a declaratory judgment claim based on a contract,which would otherwise clearly be a legal claim entitling the plaintiff to a jury,becomes an equitable claim when filed in anticipation of harm but before harm has been suffered.our answer is no unless special circumstances exist which indicate that a suit on the contract is likely to be inadequate when it is available.since no such circumstances have been shown to exist,we conclude that asten is entitled to a jury trial on its declaratory judgment claims 
the district court held that asten coverage suit against columbia was barred under the doctrine of laches,but that asten coverage suit against american was not.citing our decision in central.teamsters pension fund mccormick dray line,cir,the district court began its analysis by recognizing that the doctrine of laches consists of two essential elements inexcusable delay in instituting suit and prejudice resulting to the defendant from such delay.id.at.see also class of two hundred admin.faculty members scanlon,a laches defense poses the issue of whether,under the circumstances of the particular case,the complaining party is guilty of want of due diligence in failing to institute his action to another prejudice quoting wilson king of prussia,
in support of the first prong of its holding,the district court cited asten failure to join columbia in a coverage action it brought against other insurers in its failure to notify columbia of its hundreds of claims when they were asserted against asten and its delay in notifying columbia of the underlying claims after it acknowledged in its belief that the defendants may dispute the construction of the asbestosis exclusion.
asten primary response to the district court laches holding is based on the supreme court of pennsylvania decision in france refractories allstate ins,a case involving an insured with multiple insurance policies covering injuries.the court there endorsed the multiple trigger theory of liability and held as follows 
in keeping with this analysis,we conclude that each insurer which was on the risk during the development of an disease is a primary insurer.in order to accord france the coverage promised by the insurance policies,france should be free to select the policy or policies under which it is to be indemnified.
when the policy limits of a given insurer are exhausted,france is entitled to seek indemnification from any of the remaining insurers which was on the risk during the development of the disease.any policy in effect during the period from exposure through manifestation must indemnify the insured until its coverage is exhausted.we believe this resolution of the allocation of liability issue to be most consistent with the theory of liability.
this conclusion does not alter the rules of contribution or the provisions of other insurance clauses in the applicable policies.
based on france,asten insists that,under the controlling law of pennsylvania,it was entitled to select the order in which it brought suit against its insurers and that it had no duty to file suit against columbia until the limits of its other policies had been exhausted.it stresses that the claims it tendered to columbia in the fall of and sued upon here on march,were filed against it in and that earlier claims had been covered by other carriers.asten concludes that,when an insured exercises its right to delay triggering coverage under some policies until it exhausts others,that delay,as a matter of law,can not be found unreasonable.we agree.
columbia primary response to france is that it is a tender case,not a notice case.appellant br.at emphasis in original this is undeniably true.columbia fails to explain,however,how a party which has not unreasonably delayed in tendering a claim and filing suit can be barred from going forward by laches based on a failure to give earlier notice of its claim.columbia has cited no authority for this proposition,and we have found none.as we have earlier noted,laches speaks to inexcusable delay in instituting suit and one who is entitled to delay bringing suit under the applicable law can not be found to be barred by that doctrine.
the district court apparently took the same view of france,as columbia does,also without further explanation.it rejected american laches defense,while sustaining columbia,based on the fact that american,unlike columbia,had gotten notice of the claims starting in 
we do not,of course,suggest that the history of notice giving in these matters is irrelevant.as we have earlier noted,the policies contain various provisions requiring that notice of claims be given by the insured and breaches of the duties imposed there may,indeed,bar asten coverage suit against columbia,as well as american.but the district court expressly declined to rule on columbia late notice affirmative defense,finding it moot and noting that resolution of it would require it to unnecessarily examine an uncertain area of pennsylvania law.without the benefit of the district court views regarding the application of the various notice provisions to the record of this case,we,too,decline to address this issue.
reformation 
with respect to the defendants counterclaims for reformation of their policies,the district court held as follows 
based on the same evidence used to interpret the asbestosis exclusion course of performance and the circumstances surrounding the placement of the subject policies,and given that an exposure to asbestosis is literally impossible,an alternative ground for this court to reach the same conclusion regarding the scope of the exclusion is through the doctrine of reformation.if the asbestosis exclusion is interpreted to bar only asbestosis claims then that construction fails to set forth the true agreement of the parties.the parties believed that the asbestosis exclusion excluded all claims and reformation allows me to reform the exclusion to reflect that intent.
as is apparent from this holding,the reformation counterclaim and asten declaratory judgment claims regarding the asbestosis exclusion involve common issues.when litigation involves both legal and equitable claims,even if it is the plaintiff that joins such claims,the right to a jury trial on the legal claim,including all issues common to both claims,must be preserved by trying the legal claim to a jury first,or at least simultaneously with the equitable claim,and by accepting the jury findings on common facts for all purposes.lytle household,d tull united states,d.it follows,a fortiori,that asten right to a jury trial on its declaratory judgment claims can not be eliminated by the filing of an equitable counterclaim,like one for reformation.accordingly,we will vacate the district court judgment on the defendants counterclaim for reformation and remand for further proceedings on that counterclaim.
vi.duty to defend and pay defense costs under the american excess policy 
in response to asten request for a declaratory judgment regarding american duty to defend or pay defense costs under its excess policy,the district court pointed to the following provisions of that policy 
the company shall not be called upon to assume charge of the settlement or defense of any claims made or suits brought,or p
