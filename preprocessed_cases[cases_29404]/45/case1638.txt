appellants,members of a syndicate of underwriters,appeal the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of appellees on claims for coverage under a maritime insurance policy.we affirm.
appellee mep pleasant hill,llc mep contracted with appellee black veatch corporation black veatch jointly,appellees to design,procure equipment for,and build a electricity generating facility near pleasant hill,missouri.this construction effort was referred to as the aries project.
black veatch contracted with toshiba to manufacture heat recovery steam generators hrsgs for the aries project.hrsgs are boilers that convert waste heat from gas turbines into processed steam for electrical generation.the components comprising the hrsgs were to be shipped by toshiba from its facilities in japan to the united states.
appellants are members of a syndicate of underwriters at lloyd of london collectively,underwriters.black veatch,through a broker,procured a policy for marine cargo insurance from the underwriters.the policy offered two types of coverage.section i provided,among other things,physical loss coverage for the transport of equipment,machinery,supplies and materials.section ii included coverage for losses and for expenditures incurred to avoid or diminish such losses.
the parties agree that the policy established a facility or framework for insurance coverage,and that the facility did not,by itself,provide coverage for specific projects.instead,the risk for a project was added to the facility by way of declaration or endorsement.consequential loss coverage under section ii was available only in conjunction with projects selected for physical loss coverage under section i,and only if the underwriters specifically agreed to accept the risk on a basis.
as an apparent means of managing the risk of consequential loss,section ii provided that certain critical items presumably cargo must be surveyed.the facility does not define critical item.section ii provides warranted critical items to be surveyed by lsa london salvage association or their appointees,or surveyors to be approved by per warranty wording attached.
the attached survey warranty wording states with emphasis added 
warranted the salvage association or its appointee,at the assured expense,shall in respect of the items listed below 
approve vessel s,tug s,barge s,towing arrangements,all other carrying conveyances and all lifting equipment including cranes required or operations.
approve all packing,loading,stowage,securing and unloading arrangements.
attend and approve all stages of handling during the transportation.
approve all transport operations including transport to vessel,voyage arrangements and transport from vessel to site.
approve prevailing weather conditions or stipulate acceptable weather criteria for handling and transit operations.
and all recommendations complied with.
list of items if necessary to be listed on a separate schedule.
the salvage association to be advised of shipping schedules and any amendments and given all reasonable notice of required attendances in order that the above warranties can be complied with.
underwriters shall be entitled to receive any advices,reports or recommendations from the salvage association its appointed surveyor.
no items were listed below in the survey warranty wording,and no other document appended to the policy was denominated specifically a separate schedule of critical items.
endorsement added the aries project to the facility in respect of marine cargo and consequential loss insurance cover.endorsement amended certain wording of the policy relating to the aries project.both endorsement and endorsement include an effective date of april.
on july,a ship carrying certain hrsg components departed japan for the united states.no survey had been conducted.on july,the ship was caught in a typhoon,which caused severe damage to most of the hrsg components on board.
toshiba replaced the damaged hrsg components at no cost to appellees.however,the replacements did not arrive at the aries project site until approximately six months after the originally scheduled delivery date.in anticipation of this delay,black veatch changed the construction sequencing and employed additional labor and management in an effort to avoid delay in the of the plant.as a result of these efforts,the deadline for completing the plant was met.black veatch states that these efforts resulted in additional costs of million for appellees.
black veatch and mep submitted claims to the underwriters for consequential damages and the expenses incurred to avoid the delay in.the underwriters denied the claims on the basis that no survey had been conducted.
the underwriters filed a complaint in the district court seeking a declaration that the policy provided no coverage because of appellees failure to comply with the survey requirement.appellees each filed counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that their losses were covered under the policy.the parties filed for summary judgment on the question whether the underwriters were liable under the policy.the district court ruled that no survey was required,and that the claims were covered under section ii of the policy.this interlocutory appeal followed pursuant to a.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.we also review de novo a district court interpretation of an insurance policy,which is a question of law for the court,united fire cas.gravette,cir.disputes arising under marine insurance contracts are governed by state law,unless an established federal admiralty rule addresses the issue raised.wilburn boat fireman fund ins.yu albany ins,cir.
we conclude that state law governs the issues necessary to the resolution of this appeal,and the parties agree that the applicable state law is that of missouri.under missouri law,the language in an insurance contract is to be given its plain meaning,shahan shahan,banc.if a policy is unambiguous,then it is to be enforced according to its terms.id.a court may resort to extrinsic evidence to guide its interpretation only if the policy language is ambiguous.aetna cas.sur.general dynamics,cir hathman,sigma alpha epsilon club.the policy language will be viewed in light of the meaning that would ordinarily be understood by the party who bought and paid for the policy.krombach mayflower ins,en banc.language is ambiguous if it is reasonably open to different constructions,such as when there is duplicity,indistinctness,or uncertainty in the meaning of words used in the contract.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
at the outset,we believe the policy unambiguously states that a survey is required only for items contained in the list of items described in the survey warranty wording referenced in section ii of the policy.the policy is also clear that this list of critical items must be included within the policy,and not in an ancillary document that is outside the written agreement.section ii provides that the critical items are to be surveyed as per warranty wording attached.the warranty wording attached sets forth duties the salvage association shall perform in respect of the items listed below.emphasis added.the policy then provides a space for a list of items,with a provision that if necessary,the items are to be listed on a separate schedule.
the reference to a separate schedule must be read in conjunction with the previous language stating that the critical items will be listed below.this means the items will be listed within the same on the same page if space permits,perhaps on a separate schedule that is made part of the after or below the introductory language.no reasonable interpretation of the language would permit us to find that items listed on a separate document not incorporated into the contract were items listed below the introductory language.we thus reject the underwriters suggestion that a list of items set forth in a proposed endorsement,which was never made part of the agreement,constituted the list of items contemplated by section ii of the policy.
the underwriters argue the hrsgs were designated as critical items in endorsement.as noted,en
