cincinnati insurance company cincinnati brought an action for declaratory judgment against zen design group,zen design and sun yu yu,the president and owner of zen design collectively zen.although zen was a holder of a business insurance policy from cincinnati,cincinnati argued that it had no duty to defend or indemnify zen in a suit brought against zen by armament systems and procedures,asp alleging,among other things,trademark and trade dress infringement.both parties filed motions for summary judgment cincinnati desired a declaration that it had no duty to defend under its policy on any of asp claims,while zen sought for cincinnati to assume the defense of the asp action.because nearly all of asp claims against zen were not covered under the policy,except for the possible claim of alleged infringement of slogan,the district court granted cincinnati summary judgment motion on indemnification for all claims other than the infringement of slogan claim.however,the district court granted zen motion for partial summary judgment because zen policy with cincinnati covered infringement of slogan actions and one of asp claims against zen possibly raised an infringement of slogan claim thus triggering cincinnati duty to defend.cincinnati timely appealed the district court decision.
on appeal,cincinnati argues that the district court erred in its determination that cincinnati had an obligation to defend the asp action.cincinnati asserts that the phrase the wearable light was not a slogan but was another name for asp light emitting diode led.in response,zen argues that three of asp claims against it activate the coverage provisions of the policy,namely,infringement of slogan,misappropriation of advertising idea or style of doing business,and disparagement.we affirm the district court decision to grant zen partial summary judgment motion declaring that cincinnati has a duty to defend on the infringement of slogan claim and thereby has a duty to defend the whole asp case

on september,asp,a competitor of zen,sued zen and several other parties.asp complaint stated causes of action for trade dress infringement under a trademark infringement under a unfair competition under a dilution under c common law unfair competition,and violation of wisconsin fraudulent representations act.in the complaint,brought in federal district court in wisconsin,asp asserted that it marketed and advertised its led handheld flashlights using the trademarks wearable light and sapphire.at asp compl.asp not only claimed that zen and others infringed on these trademarks but also asserted that zen copied the shape and trade dress of its handheld flashlights in order to capitalize on asp name and business good will.
in october,zen tendered the defense of this action to cincinnati and cincinnati denied its responsibility for defense and indemnification coverage.in a response letter to zen,cincinnati cited this court opinion in advance watch kemper national insurance,cir,for the proposition that the claims in the underlying action against zen were not covered by the policy and therefore cincinnati had no duty to defend against it.thereafter,cincinnati filed a complaint in the district court for the eastern district of michigan on july,seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify zen in the asp action.cincinnati complaint also requested costs and attorney fees.on november,zen filed a motion for partial summary judgment requesting a declaration that cincinnati had breached its contractual duty to defend zen as well as seeking costs and attorney fees for cincinnati failure to defend the underlying action as provided in the insurance policy.on november,cincinnati filed a for summary judgment seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify zen from the claims in the asp suit.
before the district court,zen primary argument was that because asp action raised an advertising injury based on misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business,cincinnati was obligated to defend the action and indemnify zen for any damages awarded.zen also relied on two other injuries contained in the asp complaint,disparagement and infringement of slogan,as justification for requiring cincinnati to provide a defense.cincinnati successfully argued that this court decision in advance precluded the misappropriation of advertising ideas or claim.the district court determined that cincinnati policy did not cover the infringement of trade dress and trademark claims because the heart of asp zen marketed and advertised a similar product which infringed on asp trademarks and trade not an advertising injury because it did not arise predominantly from advertising activities.however,the district court determined that it could not conclude that asp allegations were not covered under the portion of cincinnati policy.following general principles of michigan law,the court reasoned that any doubts as to the policy coverage are to be resolved in favor of the insured.
the district court granted cincinnati motion for summary judgment in part and denied it in part.first,the court determined that the underlying lawsuit was covered under the advertising injury provision because the advertising and causation requirements were met.however,only the potential infringement of slogan claim generated a duty to defend because advance watch precluded a defense under the misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business and the disparagement claims.second,the district court granted zen partial summary judgment motion because one of asp possible claims against zen was based on infringement of slogan and because zen policy with cincinnati covered infringement of slogan actions,cincinnati had a duty to defend.the district court reasoned that under the insurance policy,cincinnati was obligated to defend zen against claims for advertising injuries of infringement of slogan.at.the court concluded that because cincinnati was obligated to defend zen on this one potential claim,cincinnati was responsible for the attorney fees and costs in defending the entire underlying action.in its judgment,the district court ordered that cincinnati had a duty to indemnify zen in the underlying infringement of slogan action and a duty to defend zen on all of asp claims against zen in the underlying action.cincinnati now appeals from this judgment with respect to the component.

duty to defend 
michigan insurance contracts 
the parties do not dispute that michigan law governs.under michigan law,courts construe an insurer duty to defend more broadly than its duty to indemnify.see generally radenbaugh farm bureau ins.of,it is well settled in michigan that an insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.quotation omitted am.bumper hartford fire ins,noting that an insurer duty to defend extends even to nonmeritorious claims where those claims allege theories of recovery that fall within the policy.in advance watch,we borrowed the district court summation of michigan law with respect to an insurer duty to defend an insured 
in liability policies,the obligation of the insurer depends upon the allegations of the underlying complaint.the insurer only has a duty to defend the insured if the charges against the insured in the underlying action arguably fall within the language of the policy.however,the terminology that was used by the underlying plaintiff in the complaint is not dispositive.instead,the analysis of the issue must include the actual cause of the injury.any doubt as to the insurer liability must be resolved in favor of the insured.moreover,where only some of the claims against the insured party are covered,the insurer must defend the whole claim until it becomes apparent that no recovery is possible under the covered theory.

slogan infringement 
the broad question we must address is whether the asp complaint arguably stated any claim for liability for an advertising injury,as defined in cincinnati insurance policy.freeman,at.more specifically,this dispute requires us to resolve whether the allegations in asp complaint that zen used the phrase the wearable light in its advertisements results in a claim for infringement of slogan covered by the insurance policy such that cincinnati has a duty to defend the entire action.
according to cincinnati policy,advertising injury coverage has three requirements.first,there must be an advertising activity by the insured.second,the underlying action must implicate a specific advertising injury covered by the policy.third,there must be a causal relationship between the alleged advertising injury and the insured advertising activity.see gaf sales,hastings mut.ins,interpreting identical or near identical policy language.the district court determined that in the present case there was an advertising activity with a sufficiently close nexus to the asserted liability and concluded that cincinnati was required to defend zen because the allegation that zen used the phrase the wearable light in zen advertisements possibly raised an infringement of slogan claim.although the district court expressed many doubts about whether the wearable light was a slogan it was unable to conclude that coverage under the policy was not possible for zen on this claim.at.as zen notes in its appellate brief,cincinnati does not dispute that the causation and advertising injury elements of
