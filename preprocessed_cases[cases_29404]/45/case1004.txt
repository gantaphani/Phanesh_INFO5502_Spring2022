a.the doe contract 
in november,the united states department of energy the doe contracted with maitland to construct a pipeline from the strategic petroleum reserve at bryan mound,texas to the gulf of mexico.as part of the contract between the doe and maitland the doe contract,the doe required maitland to maintain comprehensive general liability and third party property damage insurance,naming the united states as an additional insured.in addition,the doe required that its contracting officer receive thirty days advance written notice,by mail,of any changes in,or cancellation of,such insurance policies.the doe contract also contained the federal acquisition regulations the far applicable to the project.one of these far,titled on a government installation far,required maitland to maintain certain types of insurance,certify that the required insurance had been obtained,and provide at least thirty days notice of cancellation.additionally,far stated the contractor shall insert the substance of this clause,including this paragraph c,in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a government installation.the doe contract also provided that maitland was fully responsible for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors.appellant ina was the surety under the performance and payment bonds issued to maitland pursuant to the doe contract requirements.
b.the offshore subcontract 
on november,maitland entered into a contract the subcontract with offshore,under which offshore was to provide diving services in connection with maitland construction of the pipeline.prior to signing the subcontract,maitland comptroller,peter comly,discussed insurance requirements with offshore and spoke to offshore insurer,aberdeen.after the parties signed the subcontract,aberdeen sent maitland a certificate of insurance confirming that maitland was an additional insured on offshore policies,that the required insurance was in effect,and that maitland would be provided thirty days notice prior to cancellation of offshore insurance.paragraph one of the subcontract stated t he assumes with respect to the general contractor all of the obligations which the general contractor owes to the owner under the contract and all of the contract documents forming part of the contract for the doe contract 
offshore insurance 
aberdeen was the domestic broker for offshore comprehensive general liability and property damage insurance policy the cover note.the underwriters subscribed to the security on the cover note.offshore paid the bulk of the cover note through a premium financing agreement with premium finance specialists,pfs that required offshore to pay pfs in monthly installments.offshore failed to make its scheduled premium payments to pfs,so,on january,pfs issued offshore a note of intent to cancel.the cover note was canceled effective january.maitland received no notice of the cancellation.
d.the accident 
on march,offshore anchors struck a portion of the pipeline,breaking it into two sections on march,peter comly telephoned aberdeen to inform it of the pipe break.he explained that maitland was responsible for the repairs and asked aberdeen to investigate.on march,aberdeen sent a notice of cancellation to maitland,indicating that the cover note had been cancelled effective january,due to offshore failure to pay its premiums.the underwriters denied coverage of the loss in an april,letter stating that the accident was outside the policy period and therefore of no concern to underwriters.
repair of the pipeline 
after receiving the underwriters april letter,maitland contacted ina,its insurer,for financial assistance in repairing the pipeline.the doe informed maitland that under the doe contract,maitland was responsible for its subcontractors performance and thus was responsible for the delays caused by the march accident.maitland devised a repair plan,which the doe approved.maitland attempted repairs until,when ina became dissatisfied with maitland repair efforts and removed it from the job.ina hired ray mcdermott mcdermott to complete the repairs.on july,mcdermott struck the pipeline,causing additional damage.mcdermott billed approximately million for its work,of which ina paid for work prior to the july pipe break.subsequently,ina,mcdermott,and mcdermott insurer entered into a negotiated settlement the mcdermott settlement,in which they apportioned the damage caused by offshore march break and mcdermott july break,concluding that of mcdermott work was related solely to repairing offshore break.
when the contract between maitland and the doe was not timely completed,the doe was entitled under the contract to assess liquidated damages of per day against maitland.following completion of the project,ina and the doe entered into a settlement agreement under which the doe assessed liquidated damages of the doe settlement.
f.the proceedings below 
in january,ina and maitland sued aberdeen and the underwriters,alleging that maitland was an additional insured entitled to coverage under offshore cover note the cover note required that the underwriters give maitland thirty days notice prior to cancellation and the january,cancellation of the cover note was ineffective as to maitland because the underwriters failed to provide the required notice.the underwriters counterclaimed,alleging that appellants suit was baseless and brought in bad faith.
following an trial,the jury found for ina and maitland on their claims against the underwriters,concluding that maitland and offshore agreed in the subcontract that maitland would be an additional insured under the cover note maitland and offshore agreed in the subcontract that thirty days notice of cancellation would be given to maitland before cancellation would be effective as to maitland maitland was obligated to insert the substance of clause of the doe contract containing far into the subcontract the subcontract inserted the substance of clause of the doe contract the underwriters agreed in the cover note to provide thirty days advance written notice of cancellation to maitland the underwriters failed to give thirty days written notice to maitland prior to cancellation of the cover note maitland incurred a loss that was covered and payable under the cover note maitland faced potential liability to the doe for the damages caused by offshore to the pipeline,and appellants entered into a reasonable,prudent,settlement with the doe to resolve that potential liability appellants incurred damages in the amount of in settling with the doe maitland presented aberdeen,the underwriters actual or apparent agent,with a claim for damages arising out of the march,pipeline break and the underwriters denied maitland claim.the jury also found for maitland and ina on the underwriters counterclaim,concluding that appellants did not bring suit in bad faith or for purposes of harassment.
on june,the district court entered an order finding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury conclusions that maitland and offshore agreed in the subcontract that maitland would be an additional insured under the cover note maitland and offshore agreed in the subcontract that thirty days notice of cancellation would be given to maitland before cancellation would be effective as to maitland the underwriters failed to give thirty days written notice to maitland prior to cancellation of the cover note and maitland incurred a loss that was covered and payable under the cover note.however,the court also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings that the subcontract inserted the substance of clause of the doe contract which contained far the underwriters agreed in the cover note to provide thirty days advance written notice of cancellation to maitland maitland faced potential liability to the doe for the damages caused by offshore to the pipeline appellants incurred damages in the amount of in settling with the doe maitland presented aberdeen,the underwriters actual or apparent agent,with a claim for damages arising out of the march,pipeline break and the underwriters denied the claim.the district court went on to find as a matter of law that the subcontract did not incorporate by reference the substance of clause of the doe contract.finally,the court found that the cover note did not provide coverage for liquidated damages.based on these findings,the court entered judgment that ina and maitland receive no damages from the underwriters,and denied as moot the underwriters motion for judgment as a matter of law on their counterclaim.
ina and maitland appeal from the judgment of the district court partially reversing the jury findings.the underwriters appeal the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law on their counterclaim,as well as the court upholding of the jury finding that maitland suffered a loss that was covered by offshore cover note.
we review the district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.baltazor holmes,cir.all evidence and reasonable inferences are viewed in favor of the nonmoving party.id.if the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable jurors could not arrive at a contrary verdict,the court properly granted the motion.robertson bell helicopter textron,cir.if there is substantial is,evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and jurors might reach a different the court should have denied the motion.id.at.
notice of cancellation 
appellants contend that the underwriters were required to provide maitland with thirty days notice prior to the cancellation of offshore cover note,and that the failure to do so renders the cancellation ineffective as to maitland.the district court rejected the findings of the jury,which were consistent with appellants contention.as neither the subcontract nor the cover note contains an express requirement that the underwriters provide maitland with advance notice of cancellation,appellants advance several theories in support of their argument that such notice was required.
first,appellants assert that article of the texas insurance code imposed a statutory notice obligation upon the underwriters.article requires a premium finance company to issue a written notice of intent to cancel for payment default to the insured prior to mailing a notice of cancellation to the insurer.id.c.specifically,article provides,in pertinent part all contractual restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a third party apply where cancellation is effected under this section.id.e.
article e offers no support for appellants claim that the underwriters were obligated to provide advance notice of cancellation.it merely provides that any contractual provision requiring notice of cancellation to a third party remains in full force and effect notwithstanding the additional notice requirements imposed upon premium finance companies by article.thus,if the underwriters were under a contractual obligation to provide notice to appellants prior to cancelling offshore cover note,article e simply would confirm that this obligation exists even where the cancellation occurs pursuant to a premium finance company termination for nonpayment of premiums.conversely,if the underwriters had no such contractual notice obligation,article would not create an independent notice requirement.accordingly,appellants argument that the underwriters had an independent statutory obligation to provide maitland notice prior to cancelling offshore policy fails.
appellants next argue that the underwriters duty to provide advance notice of cancellation was created by the incorporation language in paragraph of the subcontract between maitland and offshore,which states t he assumes with respect to the general contractor all of the obligations which the general contractor owes to the owner under the doe contract.appellants argue that this clause incorporated the provisions of the doe contract requiring notice of cancellation into the subcontract by reference.appellants identify two provisions in the doe contract that arguably were incorporated into the subcontract,thereby imposing a duty to provide maitland with notice of cancellation far,entitled on a government installation and section of the doe contract,entitled insurance.
far inserts into the doe contract verbatim,stating,in pertinent part 
a the contractor shall maintain during the entire performance of this contract,at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the schedule or elsewhere in the contract.
b the policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the government interest shall not be effective until days after the insurer or the contractor gives written notice to the contracting officer,whichever period is longer.
c the contractor shall insert the substance of this clause,including this paragraph c,in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a government installation 
despite their failure to insert the text of far into the subcontract,appellants argue that the incorporation language in paragraph inserted the substance of far,including the notice requirement.generally,federal acquisition regulations should be incorporated by reference to the maximum practical extent.a.however,it is clear that unlike other federal acquisition regulations,far must be inserted into certain contracts.see id.a the contracting officer shall insert the clause at,on a government installation,in solicitations and contracts when a contract is contemplated,the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold,and the contract will require work on a government installation.emphasis added.this specific requirement supersedes the general principle that federal acquisition regulations may be incorporated by reference,and is at odds with appellants argument that far may be inserted automatically into a contract via a general incorporation clause furthermore,far itself contains the independent requirement that t he contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in subcontracts under this contract.id.c.the plain meaning of these provisions contradicts appellants argument that far was incorporated into the subcontract by reference.therefore,the district court correctly concluded that the subcontract did not incorporate far as a matter of law,and thus far created no obligation for the underwriters to provide maitland notice before cancelling offshore insurance.
however,we agree with appellants alternative argument that section of the doe contract imposed a duty upon the underwriters to provide notice of cancellation.section states,in pertinent part 
the contractor shall maintain,at his expense,workmen compensation,liability insurance,and all other insurance as provided below.provisions shall be made for thirty days advance written notice by mail to the contracting officer of any changes in or cancellation of any such insurance.
appellants argue that this provision,which obligated maitland to provide for written notice to the doe,in combination with paragraph of the subcontract,obligated offshore to provide for written notice to maitland.the underwriters respond that offshore was not aware of the notice requirement when it signed the subcontract,so no such duty existed.alternatively,the underwriters claim that even if section obligated offshore to provide for advance notice,it imposed no duty upon the insurer to provide notice of cancellation.
it is well settled that where a contract is incorporated by reference into a subcontract,the subcontractor is conclusively presumed to undertake the work subject to the conditions and limitations of the prime contract.hartwell fridner.furthermore,e ach contracting party owes a duty to the other party to read and know the contents of the contract before each one signs it.kaplan bernard lumber.accordingly,when offshore entered into the subcontract,in which the first paragraph contained a clause incorporating by reference the terms of the doe contract,it is presumed to have knowingly assumed duties under the doe contract.therefore,we reject the underwriters argument that offshore had no duty to provide for written notice to maitland simply because offshore allegedly was unaware of its duties under the doe contract.
the underwriters second contention,that section imposes no duty upon the insurer,is also flawed.section of the doe contract imposed a duty upon maitland to provide for notice of cancellation,and paragraph of the subcontract transferred that duty to offshore.the underwriters witnesses testified,and the district court found,that the cover note notice provision automatically required the underwriters to provide notice to third parties if offshore entered into a written contract requiring such notice.thus,because the subcontract incorporated section of the doe contract by reference,causing offshore to assume the duty of making provisions for notice of cancellation to maitland,the cover note notice provisions automatically required the underwriters to provide notice to maitland.
we conclude that the district court erroneously relied on maitland failure to insert the substance of far into the subcontract in holding that the underwriters had no duty to provide notice of cancellation.instead,we hold that section of the doe contract provided an independent basis for imposing upon offshore,and thus upon the underwriters through the cover note,the duty to provide notice to maitland.accordingly,because the subcontract incorporated section of the doe contract by reference,the underwriters had a duty to provide maitland with thirty days notice prior to cancellation of offshore policy.we therefore reinstate the jury finding that the underwriters had such a duty.
since the underwriters failure to provide the required notice to maitland before cancelling offshore cover note renders the cancellation ineffective as to maitland,we next must address whether offshore cover note covered maitland loss,and whether the underwriters thus were obligated to compensate appellants for the loss.the district court upheld the jury finding that the cover note provided coverage for maitland loss.however,the court rejected the jury determination that maitland faced potential liability to the doe and entered into a settlement to resolve that liability.
although the district court treated the issues of coverage and potential liability separately,the issues are in fact closely related.in arguing that there was no coverage for maitland loss,the underwriters contend that maitland must be legally liable for a doe claim before there is a loss that the underwriters are obligated to pay,and that many liability insurance policies require either that a claim be made or a suit for damages be brought before insurer liability is triggered.see couch on ins.ed.since the doe never made a claim against maitland,the underwriters argue that their liability on the policy was not triggered.we disagree.
the authority the underwriters cite for the proposition that a claim is required to trigger liability merely states that many policies of liability insurance have such a requirement,but it does not address whether the cover note has such a requirement.the cover note states,in pertinent part 
this insurance is to indemnify or pay on behalf of the insured s all sum s they may be liable or obligated responsible to pay as damages or by reason of the liability being imposed upon the insured whether it be assumed,under contract or otherwise,arising out of the operation s of the insured worldwide emphasis added.
the cover note thus contains broad language,providing coverage where the insured becomes liable or obligated responsible to pay as damages.the cover note broad language distinguishes this case from the case law cited by the underwriters,which deals with policies providing coverage where the insured has become legally liable or legally obligated to pay as damages.see continental oil bonanza,cir data specialties,transcontinental ins,cir.it is uncontroverted that offshore was responsible for damage to the pipeline as a result of the march break,and that section of the doe contract held maitland fully responsible for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors.the doe repeatedly stated that it held maitland responsible for the actions of its subcontractors and for the delays caused by the march break.accordingly,there was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to find that maitland was responsible to pay for the damages caused by offshore,and thus that offshore cover note covered maitland loss.therefore,the district court correctly denied the underwriters motion for judgment as a matter of law on the coverage issue.
however,after determining that offshore cover note provided coverage for maitland loss,the district court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings that maitland faced potential liability to the doe as a result of the damage caused by offshore and that maitland entered into a settlement to resolve that liability.we disagree with the district court conclusion.
in support of its holding,the district court stated that there was no evidence from any maitland witness that the doe ever claimed that maitland was responsible for the march,pipeline damage.however,at trial appellants introduced a letter from the doe dated march,holding maitland responsible for its subcontractors actions.appellants also introduced a july,letter,holding maitland responsible for the delays caused by the march,incident.these letters contradict the district court conclusion that the doe never claimed maitland was responsible for the march damage.moreover,the cover note broad language,indemnifying maitland for all sums it may be liable or obligated responsible to pay as damages,combined with the doe contract provision holding maitland fully responsible for all acts and omissions of its subcontractors,provides ample basis for the jury conclusion that maitland was potentially liable to the doe.thus,we hold that the district court erred in concluding that maitland had no potential liability to the doe,and reinstate the jury finding to the contrary.
appellants next contend that the district court erred in finding that maitland ina did not enter into a reasonable,prudent,and settlement with the doe.under texas law,where an indemnitee enters into a settlement with a third party,it may recover from the indemnitor only upon a showing that potential liability existed,and that the settlement was reasonable,prudent,and in good faith under the circumstances.transamerica ins.avenell,cir.the settling indemnitee need not prove actual liability to the third party before recovering from the indemnitor.id.
appellants identify two settlements that could have formed the basis for the jury conclusion that
