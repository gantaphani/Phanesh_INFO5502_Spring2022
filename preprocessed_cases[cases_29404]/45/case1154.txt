this is a diversity contract dispute in which the plaintiff,wausau underwriters insurance company wausau,claims vulcan development,vulcan breached its contract with wausau by failing to tender certain premium payments for workers compensation insurance coverage.vulcan counterclaimed,alleging that wausau was the breaching party and that the insurer tortiously interfered with its business relations.the district court granted summary judgment to wausau on its breach of contract claim and dismissed vulcan tort allegation on statute of limitations grounds.
before this court,vulcan does not highlight any genuine issues of material fact,but,rather,argues that the majority of wausau claims were barred by the statute of limitations when asserted and that wausau was the first to breach the parties contracts by failing to charge appropriate and reasonable premiums for the insurance provided thereunder.vulcan also argues that,pursuant to.comp.laws,its counterclaim for tortious interference with a business relationship is not barred by the statute of limitations.
we find that the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of wausau on its breach of contract claim,but find that the district court erred in determining that did not excuse vulcan untimely counterclaim.because we conclude,however,that vulcan has failed to state a claim for tortious interference with a business relationship under michigan law,we find that summary judgment on that claim is appropriate,regardless of our reading of.comp.laws.we therefore affirm the district court judgment,albeit,in some instances,for different reasons.
factual background 
vulcan is a management company that provides employees to various supermarkets in the detroit area.because it was unable to obtain workers compensation coverage in the open market,vulcan turned to the michigan workers compensation placement facility the facility for coverage.
the facility was created by the michigan legislature to provide workers compensation insurance to employees who are unable to procure the insurance through ordinary methods.comp.laws a.for the first policy year,the employer,working with its insurance agent,completes an application form and computes an estimated annual premium for the forthcoming policy year.the estimated premium is based upon the employer total estimated payroll for the year.the amount of the premium due is determined by multiplying the facility rates by the premium basis.the applicable rates are determined by the classification,or job description,of each employee covered by the policy.the employer pays the initial deposit premium,which is based upon a percentage of the employer estimated annual premium,to bind coverage.the agent forwards the application and the deposit premium to the facility.the facility binds the coverage and randomly selects a servicing carrier to whom the employer is assigned.the servicing carrier issues a policy in its own name and provides the same type of service that it would for a policy written on the open market.however,unlike the open market,t he employer is subject to the classifications,rates,experience modifications and rules,determined by the facility.workers compensation placement facility info.proc.handbook.see also.comp.laws.the final premium is determined by an audit of the insured actual payroll records at the end of the policy period.
the employer remains assigned to the same servicing carrier until the coverage is canceled or not renewed.each year,in addition to calculating the final premium due for the prior policy period,the servicing carrier computes an estimated deposit premium for the upcoming year based upon the payroll information supplied by the employer.the servicing carrier then notifies the employer,the agent,and the facility that it will renew the policy upon the receipt of the deposit premium.
on august,vulcan,through its own insurance agent,midwest underwriters,applied to the facility to procure a policy of workers compensation insurance.the facility assigned wausau as the servicing carrier for vulcan policy.the first policy wausau issued to vulcan covered the period from august,to august.the second policy issued to vulcan acted as a renewal of the first,and covered the period from august,to august.vulcan was issued a third policy,which renewed the second,and covered the period from august,to august.the fourth and final policy issued to vulcan renewed the third and covered the period from august,to august.this last policy ultimately was terminated early on december,for of premiums.all four policies were identical in structure and scope of coverage.
vulcan paid both the deposit premium and the estimated premium for the first,second,and third policies at or shortly after each policy was issued.vulcan disputed,however,and therefore refused to pay,the amount of the final premium calculated by wausau under all four policies.vulcan claimed that wausau improperly classified certain of vulcan employees as supermarket employees when they were,in fact,clerical employees.vulcan claimed that these misclassifications unduly increased the premiums wausau sought to charge vulcan because,given the risk of injury associated with each position,the rate charged for supermarket employees was many times higher than the rate charged for clerical employees.vulcan asserted that many of its employees should have been reclassified as clerical rather than supermarket employees and that its premium obligations should have been reduced.
wausau did not agree with vulcan request for reclassification and insisted on the payment of those premiums it claimed were due.after unsuccessful efforts to obtain payment of those premiums,wausau sent a letter on september,to the facility,advising it that vulcan had failed to pay its outstanding premium balance and that wausau believed vulcan was no longer acting in good faith or entitled to further insurance.
the facility made an initial determination as to the proper classification of vulcan employees,essentially agreeing with wausau classifications.vulcan still did not pay any further premiums to wausau and,instead,appealed the facility determination to the facility appeals committee on december.on january,after a decision by the facility appeals committee approving the facility classifications,vulcan appealed the classification issue to the michigan insurance commissioner.on july,the commissioner conducted a hearing on this matter and a settlement was placed on the record by which vulcan and the facility agreed to a partial reclassification of vulcan employees.a was conducted by the facility based upon the settlement and the first,second,and third final premium calculations were revised.finally,on june,the settlement was finalized by a written stipulation for settlement signed by both vulcan and the facility declaring vulcan outstanding obligation to wausau to be.despite agreeing to the reclassifications,however,and executing the stipulation for settlement based on the reaudit,vulcan still failed to pay wausau any additional premium payments.
ii.procedural background 
on february,after vulcan refused to remit the final premiums to wausau,wausau commenced this diversity action for breach of contract and unjust enrichment.on november,the district court allowed vulcan to assert counterclaims against wausau for breach of contract and for tortious interference with a business relationship,the latter allegedly arising out of the september,letter wausau sent to the facility.
vulcan moved for summary judgment on wausau claims,arguing to the district court that wausau breach of contract claim was untimely under michigan statute of limitations for actions on a written contract and that,because a written contract existed between the parties,wausau could not assert a claim for unjust enrichment.vulcan also argued that,in the event wausau contract claim was timely,it was wausau and not vulcan who breached the agreement between the parties.wausau also moved for summary judgment,arguing that there were no material issues of fact on its breach of contract claim and that wausau was entitled to judgment on that claim as a matter of law in the settlement amount.the district court rejected vulcan arguments and granted summary judgment in favor of wausau on the parties competing contract claims.the district court did,however,grant summary judgment for vulcan on the issue of wausau unjust enrichment claim,finding that the parties contract governed wausau right to relief.
wausau also moved,pursuant to rule b,to dismiss vulcan tortious interference with business relationship counterclaim,arguing that it was untimely under michigan statute of limitations for tort actions of that nature.while acknowledging the untimeliness of its counterclaim,vulcan argued that it could still assert the claim pursuant to a special savings statute governing counterclaims.comp.laws.the district court found inapplicable and granted wausau motion to dismiss vulcan counterclaim.
on april,the district court entered judgment in favor of wausau and against vulcan in the amount of vulcan filed a timely motion for reconsideration and to amend order on april,with respect to the court order granting summary judgment to wausau.vulcan filed another timely motion for reconsideration and to amend judgment on april,this time as to the court order dismissing the counterclaim the district court denied both of these motions on may.this appeal followed.
iii.analysis 
a.the district court correctly granted summary judgment to wausau on its breach of contract claim 
the district court found that vulcan breached its contracts of insurance with wausau when it refused to remit the final premiums due as designated in the stipulation of settlement.the district court also found that wausau contract claim was timely because it was filed within six years of the premium determinations reflected in the settlement agreement.although the district court acknowledged that vulcan initial refusal to pay any additional premiums occurred,as to two of the three policy years,more than six years before the filing of the complaint,the district court concluded that contract claims for those payments did not accrue for statute of limitations purposes until the michigan insurance commissioner determined the precise amount due.on this point,the district court reasoned that the statutory appeals process vulcan was entitled to,and did invoke,was implied into each policy of insurance issued at the direction of the facility.thus,the district court concluded that wausau could not enforce its asserted right to premiums until the appeals process with respect to the scope of the premiums owed was completed,and that the statute of limitations with respect to any claim for such premiums did not begin to run until that point.having found a valid contract,and an enforceable contract claim,the district court dismissed wausau unjust enrichment claim.
vulcan makes the same arguments here that it presented below regarding the timeliness of wausau contract action and the parties rights and obligations under the policies of insurance.we have reviewed the parties briefs and the record below,and find that the district court correctly and meticulously analyzed these issues.we find it unnecessary to restate that analysis here and,instead,adopt the district court analysis as our own.for the reasons stated in section iii of the district court opinion,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to wausau on its breach of contract claim and vulcan breach of contract counterclaim and affirm the dismissal of wausau unjust enrichment claim.
b.the district court erred in determining that does not apply 
we hold,however,that the district court erred in finding that vulcan counterclaim for tortious interference with a business relationship is barred by the statute of limitations.
vulcan counterclaim is based on the letter wausau sent to the facility on september.as the district court correctly determined,a tortious interference with business relationship claim is generally governed by a statute of limitations.comp.laws.james logee.wausau argues,accordingly,that vulcan had only until september,to file this claim against it,a deadline vulcan did not meet vulcan did not file the counterclaim until november.
vulcan argues that,despite.comp.laws,its counterclaim is timely by virtue of michigan counterclaim savings statute,which provides 
t o the extent of the amounts established by plaintiff claim the periods of limitations prescribed in this chapter do not bar a claim made by way of counterclaim unless the counterclaim was barred at the time the plaintiff claim accrued.
comp.laws.in essence,this statute allows a defendant to bring an otherwise untimely counterclaim if the counterclaim would have been timely had it been filed when the plaintiff claim accrued.the statute exacts a cost for this right,however.the defendant recovery is limited to the amount,if any,the plaintiff recovers against other words,the defendant can only use this provision to offset any obligations it might have to the plaintiff,but not as an independent basis for recovery it can operate as a shield,but not as a sword.
in the first part of its opinion,the district court concluded,and we concur,that wausau breach of contract claim accrued,at the earliest,on july,vulcan agreed on the record in front of the michigan insurance commissioner to a mechanism for assessing the premiums owed under the,at the latest,on june,vulcan acknowledged its debt in writing after the.both of these accrual dates falls within three years of september,the date on which vulcan asserts wausau committed the acts giving rise to its tortious interference counterclaim.thus,if applies,vulcan counterclaim,though otherwise untimely,could still be asserted as an offset against wausau contract claims.
the district court agreed with wausau,however,that vulcan counterclaim must relate to wausau breach of contract claim in order for to apply.because vulcan counterclaim sounds in tort and is entirely independent of wausau contract claim,the district court found that the counterclaim savings statute did not apply.
in reaching its conclusion,the district court relied on the michigan court of appeal opinion in thiel v.the scene.there,the state court dismissed a number of as untimely,explicitly finding that they were not saved because they were independent of the claims in the principal action.the question presented in that case did not arise under,however.as the court noted in thiel,provides for the tolling of counterclaims it does not apply to.id.at.thus,the state court concluded that it would need to resort to its equitable powers if it were to allow a to assert otherwise untimely claims against.id.while the court concluded that it did have such power,it also concluded that it should limit the exercise of that power to circumstances in which the assert claims for indemnification or contribution.id.the court reasoned that,because such claims could not have been brought in the absence of the principal action,it was equitable to allow those claims to be asserted,even if untimely.because its decision was based on the exercise of its equitable powers,however,the court refused to allow the assertion of wholly independent,untimely,finding that equity did not counsel such a result.the court in thiel then ordered the in that case dismissed because they were independent of the principal law suit.id.while the court in thiel may have created an equitable savings provision for,it did not purport to apply or interpret regarding counterclaims.indeed,it made quite clear that it was not doing so.
more instructive to the question we face are the two per curiam decisions in wallace patterson,and.wallace and patterson were involved in a motor vehicle collision that presumably killed patterson.wallace,at.wallace filed suit against patterson estate ten days before the statute of limitations ran on his claim a few months later,after filing an answer,patterson estate filed a counterclaim.wallace filed a motion for partial summary judgment,arguing that the counterclaim was barred by the statute of limitations.the trial court agreed that the counterclaim was untimely,but allowed the counterclaim under.pursuant to,the trial court limited recovery under the countercl
