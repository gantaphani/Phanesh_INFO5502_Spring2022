ellen peck appeals from a summary judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut goettel,dismissing her action to recover damages from public service mutual insurance company public service under connecticut direct action statute.this action arises out of an underlying tort action brought by peck in connecticut superior court against,inter alia,south norwalk redevelopment limited partnership south norwalk.south norwalk never notified its insurer,public service,of peck tort action.a default judgment was subsequently entered against south norwalk as a result of its failure to respond to peck outstanding discovery requests,and a jury later awarded peck in damages.as part of a settlement with peck,south norwalk assigned to her whatever claims it had against public service.
after peck filed the instant diversity action against public service,the latter moved for summary judgment on several grounds,one of which was that public service had been materially prejudiced by south norwalk failure to provide it with timely notice of peck underlying tort action.it was solely upon this ground that the district court entered summary judgment for public service and dismissed peck complaint.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the district court erred in holding as a matter of law that peck failed to carry her burden of showing that public service was not materially prejudiced by any untimely notice public service received of peck underlying tort action.accordingly,we vacate the summary judgment and remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
events leading up to peck underlying tort action 
south norwalk,a connecticut limited partnership,owned the washington market building in south norwalk,connecticut.on may,south norwalk entered into a commercial lease with rattlesnake ventures,rattlesnake,a connecticut corporation,for premises in washington market building to be used for the operation of a restaurant called the rattlesnake bar and grill.the lease required,in relevant part,that rattlesnake purchase commercial liability insurance,that rattlesnake name south norwalk as an additional insured on the policy,and that rattlesnake deposit the policy with south norwalk.
peck owned and resided in a condominium unit located directly above the premises leased by rattlesnake in the washington market building.in or about october,live rock and roll bands began performing several nights a week between the hours of and at the rattlesnake bar and grill.according to peck,these live performances resulted in incredibly loud noises and vibrations emanat ing into the street and throughout her condominium unit,in violation of local noise ordinances.peck complaints to the rattlesnake bar and grill about the noise went unremedied.instead,peck alleged that she was subjected to vulgar and obscene comments from the staff of the rattlesnake bar and grill and threatened with physical harm.on one occasion,peck claimed that someone spread cooking grease on the stairs leading to her condominium.
ii.peck filing of the underlying tort action and south norwalk bankruptcy filing 
neither the noise nor peck distaste for the late night rock and roll music abated.consequently,on june,peck filed suit in connecticut superior court against rattlesnake,south norwalk,and william opper,the president of rattlesnake,pleading causes of action for negligence per se,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and violations of connecticut unfair trade practices act.et.in particular,peck alleged that she had been routinely and regularly subjected to excessively loud music,vibration,and crowd noise on an ongoing,regular basis since october,resulting in r egular loss of sleep n eedless anxiety and severe emotional distress r egular deprivation of her rightful enjoyment to the peace,quiet and enjoyment of her home and s evere impairment to the value of and diminution in her dwelling place.she sought money damages and injunctive relief.five days after peck complaint was filed,attorney kenneth bernhard of the law firm goldstein and peck,entered an appearance on behalf of a ll defendants.
on august,south norwalk filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of connecticut two weeks later,peck filed a revised complaint,and on october,rattlesnake and opper filed their answer.on december,attorney paul mccullough filed a notice of appearance for south norwalk.mccullough had represented south norwalk in connection with the rattlesnake lease.
iii.the public service insurance policy 
it was not until january,than six months after the underlying tort action was commenced and about five months after south norwalk filed for public service,a new york corporation,issued an insurance policy to rattlesnake,naming south norwalk as an additional insured.the policy defined the policy period as to the policy further provided that it applied to bodily injury or property damage only if the bodily injury or property damage occurred during the policy period.the policy defined bodily injury as bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by a person and property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.finally,south norwalk was required to notify public service as soon as practicable of any occurrence that might result in a claim or of any claim or suit,and immediately to send copies of any demands,notices,summonses,or legal papers received in connection with a claim or lawsuit.
iv.the underlying litigation progresses and rattlesnake notifies public service of the underlying tort action 
on january,the law firm of gildea stevens,which had been retained by another rattlensake insurer,greater new york mutual insurance company filed a notice of appearance on behalf of rattlesnake and opper.on march,attorney thomas stevens of gildea stevens filed an amended answer and special defense on behalf of rattlesnake and opper.the following month,peck made an offer to rattlesnake,agreeing to accept in full settlement of her claims.the offer was rejected.
by letter dated september,attorney eugene cedarbaum of goldstein and peck,requested that ronald fitelson,rattlesnake insurance broker,notify public service of the underlying tort action.four days later,fitelson faxed to public service a loss notice and the summons,which separately listed each defendant in the underlying action.fitelson also instructed public service to contact attorney cedarbaum.on september,daniel jaconetti,the head of litigation at public service,set up a claims file and filled out a claims division transaction sheet.the following day,he opened a claims file in which he made handwritten notes about the claims alleged in peck complaint,and assigned the file to insurance adjuster barry blecher.as to the ninth and tenth counts of the complaint,which alleged negligence per se and negligent infliction of emotional distress against south norwalk,jaconetti wrote possibly depending upon lease agr.and if co is add insd.on policy.jaconetti also wrote has co sought def.indem.from insd and has anyone answered for co yet 
on september,attorney cedarbaum forwarded a copy of peck august revised complaint to public service.on october,blecher faxed a document to cederbaum,asking him to identify south norwalk and whether it was the landlord of the property leased by rattlesnake.a week later,blecher sent another letter to attorney cederbaum confirming receipt of the original summons and complaint,the revised complaint,and explaining that he needed a copy of the lease to help public service determine its position regarding the availability of coverage.on october attorney cederbaum sent blecher copies of various papers pertaining to the litigation,and indicated that he would soon send a copy of the lease.additionally,cederbaum informed blecher that t he premises on which the restaurant is located is rented from south norwalk and that peck deposition was scheduled for october.
in early november,public service received a copy of the lease agreement.on november,public service sent a letter to rattlesnake denying insurance coverage to rattlesnake on the grounds that the date of the loss was october,prior to the effective date of the policy notice of the claim was not timely provided by rattlesnake over a year after service of the complaint and intentional acts were excluded from the policy coverage.no disclaimer of coverage was ever sent to south norwalk,and south norwalk was not referred to in the letter.
default judgment entered against south norwalk in the underlying tort action 
on august,months after the automatic stay in the south norwalk bankruptcy proceeding was lifted with respect to peck action against south served south norwalk with interrogatories and document production requests.south norwalk failed to respond to these discovery requests,and by motion dated november,peck moved for the entry of a default against south norwalk.a copy of the notice was sent to attorney mccullough,among others.a default judgment was entered against south norwalk on july.
vi.the underlying action proceeds to trial without south norwalk participation 
in april,peck filed an offer of judgment to settle the case against south norwalk for,which was never accepted.on may,attorney brian gildea of gildea and associates entered an appearance in the underlying action on behalf of a ll defendants,although attorney mccullough had previously appeared for south norwalk.on june,peck filed an amended complaint that was substantially similar to the original complaint.the only difference was the addition of allegations pertaining to the injuries sustained by peck 
at a july pretrial conference at which attorney gildea was in attendance,attorney mccullough indicated that he would not be participating in the trial because of his belief later admitted by him to have been mistaken that south norwalk liability to peck had been discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding which he believed had been converted from a chapter into a chapter proceeding mccullough also indicated at the pretrial conference his belief that peck claim was covered by insurance,although he stated that he did not know the identity of the insurance company providing coverage.the superior court judge explained to mccullough that it was up to him and his client to notify the insurance company of the claim and that if the insurer wanted to come in and ask for a continuance,the court would consider such a request.the court continued so if you could notify the insurance company as soon as possible i would appreciate it actually not appreciated.i will order it.notwithstanding this unequivocal order,mccullough later admitted that he never notified public service.
immediately upon overhearing the colloquy between the superior court judge and attorney mccullough concerning the notice to south norwalk insurer,attorney gildea notified a claims handler at public service that the trial in the case was scheduled to commence shortly and that south norwalk counsel had been given permission not to attend.according to gildea,the claims handler responded that public service had closed its file on this matter,and had no intention of hiring defense counsel or taking any other steps to get involved in the litigation.the trial proceeded to verdict without south norwalk participation,rattlesnake and opper being defended by the two other insurers that insured only rattlesnake,and mccullough testifying as a fact witness in peck rebuttal case.on or about august,the jury returned a verdict against the defendants,and awarded damages in the amount of against rattlesnake and opper on the negligence per se claims against rattlesnake on the negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against opper on the negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress claims and with respect to the default judgment against south norwalk,subsequently,rattlesnake and opper filed various motions to set aside the verdict or for remittiturs.
attorney cederbaum notified public service of the verdict in a september letter and invited the insurer to participate in efforts to settle or appeal the case.the following month,blecher responded by requesting a copy of the trial transcript.on november,the superior court granted rattlesnake and opper request to set aside the awarded to peck for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress,finding those injuries to have been compensated in the jury award on the negligence per se counts.final judgment was entered on november.
on april,counsel for peck sent a letter to blecher confirming the tort judgment,indicating that i n accordance with the lease agreement between south norwalk and rattlesnake,south norwalk was named as an additional insured,and properly appears as such on the declarations page,and formally demanding that public service satisfy the judgment rendered against south norwalk.in september,as part of a settlement with rattlesnake and peck,south norwalk assigned whatever claim s it had against public service to peck in exchange for one dollar and a covenant contained in a subsequent letter from peck not to pursue any claims against south norwalk for any judgment not covered by insurance and to limit her recovery to the available insurance proceeds.
vii.proceedings in the district court 
in may,peck sued public service as assignee and subrogee of south norwalk in the district court under connecticut direct action statute.the complaint was amended on april,and alleged that public service breached its insurance contract with south norwalk breached the implied covenant of good faith in that contract violated the connecticut unfair insurance practices act,id.et violated connecticut unfair trade practices act,id.et and breached its duty to peck,who was alleged to be a beneficiary of the insurance contract.in june,public service moved for summary judgment on the grounds that south norwalk failed to provide timely notice of the claim,there was no coverage due to the fact that the underlying action was filed before the policy effective date,and there was no coverage due to the fact that the injuries alleged by peck were not covered by the policy.
in a november,unpublished decision and order,the district court granted summary judgment for public service solely on the late notice defense.applying connecticut law,the district court interpreted the notice language in the insurance policy as meaning within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances of the case.the district court then proceeded to examine the evidence regarding timeliness of the notice,commenting that it was uncontested that south norwalk did not comply with the policy requirement that it provide public service with notice of the suit as soon as practicable nor did it send copies of the legal papers to its insurer.indeed,south norwalk never specifically asked for representation or a defense,apparently believing that,because the suit had begun before the policy went into effect,there would be no coverage.instead,the district court observed,south norwalk undertook its own defense,which the district court characterized as,if not a sham,an absolute disaster.
the district court then concluded that peck had failed to satisfy her burden under connecticut law of showing that public service was not materially prejudiced by south norwalk failure to give timely notice of the underlying action.according to the district court,it was hard to imagine any greater prejudice to public service than a demand for payment of a default judgment of which it was totally ignorant and as to which,through south norwalk failure to comply with the terms of the contract,public service has been deprived of its right to defend.indeed,because south norwalk failed to cure the default and defend on the merits,the district court opined that an argument could be made that south norwalk was colluding with peck since ultimately it was assured that neither it nor its general partners would be subject to any claim.accordingly,summary judgment was granted without reaching the other arguments advanced by public service.
peck subsequently moved for reconsideration of the di
