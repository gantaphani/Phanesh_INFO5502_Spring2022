introduction 
adnan mustafa yousef and his company,american liberty bail bonds,american liberty,are licensed bail agents.in,the orange county district attorney filed a felony complaint charging them with various crimes relating to their bail bond business.based on that felony complaint,california insurance commissioner,john garamendi,and the california department of insurance collectively the commissioner,suspended yousef and american liberty from participating in the business of an insurer or production agency.the commissioner issued the suspension order under insurance code section,subdivision e,which provides that if a subject person has been charged with certain types of crimes and if the commissioner finds that a failure to issue a suspension order threatens an insurer solvency or may cause financial or other injury to any person,then the commissioner shall immediately suspend that subject person from participating in the business of an insurer or production agency.section,subdivision e,neither gives a subject person the right to a presuspension hearing nor were yousef and american liberty given a presuspension hearing.
yousef filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court claiming,among other things,that the failure of insurance code section,subdivision e,to provide a presuspension hearing violates due process and that the postsuspension hearing that is provided under that section also violates due process.american liberty filed a petition for writ of mandate that also raised these due process arguments,as well as the argument that section,subdivision e,applies only to natural persons,and not to entities such as corporations.the superior court rejected yousef due process arguments,but agreed with american liberty that the statute applies only to natural persons.
no appellate court has interpreted insurance code section,subdivision e.relying,however,in part on united states supreme court authority,we conclude that the commissioner did not violate yousef due process rights in suspending his license under section,subdivision e.relying on the plain language of the section and its legislative history,we also conclude that the section applies only to natural persons.we therefore affirm the judgments.
factual and procedural background 
i.the commissioner issues an order of immediate suspension.
american liberty is licensed by the department of insurance to act as a bail agent.yousef,who also was a licensed bail agent,is american liberty sole shareholder.american liberty employs about people and has more than offices in southern california.in,it produced about million in gross bail.
on september,the orange county district attorney filed a felony criminal complaint naming,among others,american liberty and yousef as defendants.an amended felony complaint charged them with violations of the penal and insurance codes,namely,conspiracy to commit a kidnapping,kidnapping for extortion,conspiracy to commit unlawful bail solicitation,counts of undertaking bail without a license,conspiracy to commit grand theft,conspiracy to knowingly commit performing a notarial act on a false or forged trust deed,conspiracy to falsify a trust deed,conspiracy to make,alter or pass documents,grand theft,and conspiracy to commit embezzlement.all counts arose out of american liberty and yousef bail bond business.for example,the complaint alleged that a bail bond had been posted for a man who then refused to sign a bail bond agreement and to pay fees.yousef participated in a scheme to abduct the man from his home,to transport him to american liberty offices,and to force him to sign a bail bond agreement.the complaint also alleged that yousef employed unlicensed bail agents and that he forged a trust deed document to secure a lien against property without the property owner knowledge or consent.
soon after the felony criminal complaint was filed,the commissioner,on september,issued an order of immediate suspension under insurance code section,subdivision e hereafter section e.the order stated,b ased on the matters set forth herein,respondents have been charged in a felony complaint,the felony complaint alleges misconduct committed in respondents capacity as licensed production agents,and,based upon the foregoing,the commissioner finds that failure to immediately issue this order may cause present and future financial or other injury to any person within the meaning of insurance code section e b.american liberty and yousef were therefore immediately suspended from employment with any production agency or participation in any manner in the conduct of the business of an insurer or any insurance production agency,including bail bond agenc ies,except with the prior consent of the insurance commissioner.the order also notified american liberty and yousef that within days after the order was issued they could file an application for a hearing on the order,which hearing would be scheduled within days after the application was filed 
ii.the petitions for writ of mandate.
instead of applying for a hearing on the order,american liberty and yousef filed petitions for writ of mandate under california code of civil procedure section.they argued that section e violates due process because it permits subject persons to be immediately suspended without a predeprivation hearing,the suspension may be based solely on the filing of a criminal complaint,the postdeprivation hearing is illusory,and the section is vague and overbroad.american liberty also argued that section e applies to individuals and not to corporations.after full briefing on the petitions,the trial court denied yousef petition,but granted american liberty petition.the trial court found that section e does not violate due process,but that subject person as used in section means a natural person and excludes corporations such as american liberty 
the trial court issued the judgments.thereafter,the commissioner filed a timely appeal from the judgment in american liberty favor,and yousef filed a timely appeal from the judgment against him.
discussion 
standard of review.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,states a writ of mandate may be issued by any court to any inferior tribunal,corporation,board,or person,to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station,or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right mandamus will lie to compel an official both to exercise his or her discretion,if he or she is required by law to do so,and to exercise it under a proper interpretation of the applicable law.common cause board of supervisors cal d.to be entitled to relief,a petitioner must show that the respondent has a clear,present,and ministerial duty to perform an act in obedience to the mandate of legal authority and that the petitioner has a clear,present,and beneficial right to performance of that duty entitling it to a writ of mandate.kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,d.where,as here,the trial court decision on a petition for writ of mandate did not turn on disputed facts,the trial court legal interpretation of the insurance code is subject to de novo review.ibid.
ii.a corporation is not a subject person under section e.
the trial court,when it granted american liberty petition for writ of mandate,found that the definition of subject person in section refers only to individuals,and not to entities like american liberty.rules of statutory construction and legislative history compel us to agree.
our task in construing a statute is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.we first look at the words themselves because they are the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.ibid.we give the words of a statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole.ibid.if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and does not involve an absurdity,the plain meaning governs.people garcia cal th,d.we examine statutory language in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine the scope and purpose of a particular statute and harmonize it with the various parts of the statutory scheme.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.if the statute is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including legislative history,the statute purpose,and public policy.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.
the statute at issue,section e,provides if the commissioner finds both of the following,he or she shall immediately issue an order suspending a subject person from his or her office or employment with a production agency and prohibiting the subject person from participating in any manner in the conduct of the business of an insurer or production agency,except with the prior consent of the commissioner a the subject person has been charged in an indictment issued by a grand jury,or in an information,complaint,or similar pleading issued by a united states attorney,district attorney,or other governmental official or agency authorized to prosecute crimes,with a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and which involves as one of its necessary elements a fraudulent act or an act of dishonesty in the acceptance,custody,or payment of money or property and b that a failure to immediately issue the order threatens the financial solvency of an insurer or may cause financial or other injury to any person.in the event the criminal proceedings are terminated other than by judgment of conviction,an order issued pursuant to paragraph of this subdivision shall be deemed rescinded as if it had not been issued.e,italics added.
section e thus allows the commissioner to suspend a subject person.a subject person is any person who has participated or may participate in any manner in the business of a production agency,or any person licensed as a producer,subd.a.focusing on the last part of that definition any person licensed as a producer the commissioner argues that because american liberty is licensed as a producer,it is a subject person.it buttresses that argument by pointing to section of the insurance code,which generally defines person as any person,association,organization,partnership,business trust,limited liability company,or corporation.that general provision governs construction of the code,u nless the context otherwise requires.
here,the context otherwise requires us not to rely on the general definition of person in section.section e states that the commissioner may suspend a subject person from his or her office or employment with a production agency and may prohibit the subject person from participating in any manner in the conduct of the business of an insurer or production agency.e,italics added.only a natural person can be suspended from office or employment with a production agency a production agency can not be suspended from office or employment with itself or another entity.similarly,a natural person can be suspended from participating in an insurer or production agency business a production agency can not be suspended from participating with itself in the conduct of its business.thus,subject person must refer only to individuals,otherwise the subdivision does not make sense.
reading section e in the context of the statute as a whole also supports this interpretation that a subject person is separate and distinct from an entity such as a production agency.for example,subdivision h states it is unlawful for a subject person against whom a suspension order has been issued to serve or act as a subject person for any insurer or production agency or to directly or indirectly vote any shares or other securities of an insurer or production agency,subd.h a,b.the commonsense reading of subdivision h is that it precludes a subject natural person from participating in an entity acting as a production agency.also,subdivision h permits the commissioner to assess a penalty against a production agency that has knowingly aided and abetted a subject person,subd.h.again,the commonsense reading of subdivision h is a penalty can be assessed against a production agency that aids and abets a natural person,because a production agency can not aid and abet a production agency that is,the statute juxtaposition of subject person and production agency means that the two phrases can not mean the same thing.
section legislative history,although it does not expressly address whether the statute applies only to natural persons,nonetheless also supports interpreting the statute to exclude entities such as corporations.senate bill was enacted in to,among other things,add section to the insurance code it was enacted in response to the insolvency of several insurance companies,which left an million loss that was paid by california automobile policyholders through ciga surcharges on their automobile policies.com.on,claims,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.incompetent management and fraudulent sales practices contributed to the insolvency.ibid.those individuals who engaged in such acts continued their insurance careers by going to other insurance companies this is a very important bill which will plug existing gaps in the law that now permit law breakers and those engaging in willful acts of dishonesty that imperil the solvency of an insurer from continuing on in an industry that holds other people money.patrick johnston,letter to governor pete wilson.
in support of the bill,the commissioner wrote,the purpose of this bill is to empower the insurance commissioner to remove from the insurance industry those bad actors who cause the public serious harm we have seen the same players move from the wreckage of one insurer or producer to wreak new havoc on other insurers and their policyholders.this bill would enable the insurance commissioner to protect consumers from those individuals who,by their repeated conduct,have shown that they have no place in the insurance business.my existing authority over licenses and certificates of authority is,unfortunately,inadequate in many circumstances.there is a tremendous range of activities within the insurance industry which does not require personal licensure.and it makes little sense to revoke the certificate of authority of an insurer,with the related fallout on policyholders and others,including shareholders and employees,when the surgical removal of the bad apple can resolve the problem.ins.comr.john garamendi,letter to assem.jud.com.chair phillip isenberg.
senate bill was amended six times.section was not added until the fifth amendment in the assembly on september,as first added to the bill,the section defined subject person as any director,officer or employee of a production agency,or any natural person who participates in the management or control of the business of a production agency.a subject person of a production agency participates in the control of a production agency if he or she comes within the definition of controlling person as specified in subdivision b of section.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.therefore,in its first incarnation,a subject person was clearly a natural person.
but section was again amended in assembly to define a subject person as any director,officer or employee of a production agency,any natural person who participates in the management or control of the business of a production agency,or any person licensed as a producer.a subject person of a production agency participates in the control of a production agency if he or she comes within the definition of controlling person as specified in subdivision b of section.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess,italics added.this definition of subject person was passed.
to support its expansive interpretation of the statute,the commissioner focuses on the highlighted language and the omission of the word natural before any person licensed as a producer.based on that omission,the commissioner argues that person encompasses a corporation under the general definition set forth in section.
there are at least two reasons why this argument is not persuasive.first,the addition of the italicized language was described as merely a technical amendment that specifies that persons subject to discipline working for production agencies include those persons licensed as producers.patrick johnston,sponsor statement,bill reg.sess.thus,the addition only clarified that licensed and unlicensed persons are subject to section.the additional language was not intended to broaden the definition of subject person to include entities.second,at the time section was added in,only natural persons could become producers.former.it was not until that corporations,under certain conditions,also could be licensed,subd.b.therefore,as originally enacted subject person included only natural persons.
after its enactment in,section was amended by senate bill in.the amendment removed the reference to natural person.specifically,senate bill proposed amending the definition of subject person to mean any person who has participated or may participate in any manner in the business of a production agency,or any person licensed as a producer.other than a letter from a senior legislative counsel to the bill author,senator jackie speier,requesting that section be strengthened by,among other things,b roadening the definition of subject person to any person who has participated or may participate,in any manner in a production agency,there is no discussion of the amendment in senate bill legislative history.the absence of such a discussion suggests that the amendment was merely a technical one,and not one to make the section more expansive by including corporations.
we therefore conclude,based on this legislative history and the face of section,that corporations,such as american liberty,may not be suspended under that statute.our conclusion that the commissioner may not suspend american liberty under section e,however,does not leave the commissioner without recourse.the commissioner may pursue action against american liberty license under section,which provides for a suspension of a license after a hearing and notice and for a temporary suspension 
iii.the failure of section e to provide a predeprivation hearing does not violate due process.
due process of law is required before a state may deprive a person of life,liberty or property,cal,art.i.the process that is due under any given circumstance may include a hearing before a person is deprived of such interests.but here the commissioner suspended yousef from participating in a production agency without first affording him a hearing,and,moreover,the commissioner based that suspension on the fact that a criminal complaint had been filed naming yousef as a defendant.section e,however,permits the commissioner to immediately suspend a subject person if the person has been charged with a certain type of crime.and neither a suspension that is based on a criminal charge nor one that occurs without a predeprivation hearing offends due process.
rather,to answer the question what process is due before a person can be deprived of property we balance the following factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest mathews eldridge,d,see also people ramirez cal d,i identification of the dictates of due process generally requires consideration of the private interest that will be affected by the official action,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards,the dignitary interest in informing individuals of the nature,grounds and consequences of the action and in enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible governmental official,and the governmental interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.
using the mathews eldridge balancing test,the united states supreme court has found that a person is not always entitled to a hearing before being deprived of a property interest.see,gilbert homar,d gilbert fdic mallen,d mallen barry barchi,d barry.rather,d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.citation.gilbert,supra,at.
for example,in mallen,supra,d,a bank president was suspended under former title united states code section g.section g,like section e,provided that whenever any director or officer of an insured bank,or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such bank,is charged in any information,indictment,or complaint authorized by a united states attorney,with the commission of or participation in a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year under state or federal law,the appropriate federal banking agency may,if continued service or participation by the individual may pose a threat to the interests of the bank depositors or may threaten to impair public confidence in the bank,by written notice suspend him from office or prohibit him from further participation in any manner in the conduct of the affairs of the bank.mallen,supra,at,fn,italics omitted.
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic suspended mallen under former title united states code section g without first affording him a predeprivation hearing.although mallen did not contend he was entitled to a predeprivation hearing,the court noted that a n important government interest,accompanied by a substantial assurance that the deprivation is not baseless or unwarranted,may in limited cases demanding prompt action justify postponing the opportunity to be heard until after the initial deprivation.citations.mallen,supra,at.the court thus first found that there was an important government interest at issue.namely,congress had found that prompt suspension of bank officers might be necessary to protect depositors and to maintain public confidence in banking institutions.id.at.second,the indictment against mallen established that an independent body has determined that there is probable cause to believe that the person has committed a crime described under section g.mallen,supra,at.the indictment,coupled with the congressional finding that a prompt suspension is important to the integrity of our banking institutions,thus supported the issuance of the suspension order without a predeprivation hearing.id.at.see also gilbert,supra,at.this court has recognized,on many occasions,that where a state must act quickly,or where it would be impractical to provide predeprivation process,postdeprivation process satisfies the requirements of the due process clause.
here too there is an important government interest at stake that is accompanied by a substantial assurance the deprivation is warranted.the state interest,which prompted the enactment of section e,is premised on a legislative finding that the commissioner needs tools to immediately suspend persons against whom certain types of criminal charges have been filed.such persons,our legislature has found,may threaten the financial solvency of insurers or cause financial or other injury to people.preserving the insurance industry,and hence the public confidence in that industry,is the governmental interest underlying section e.
thus,although there is no doubt that yousef has a private interest in his bail agent license and in his ability to participate in his bail bond business see,barry,supra,at.zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners cal th,d,the right to practice one profession is sufficiently precious to surround it with a panoply of legal protection citation,that private interest is counterbalanced by the state interest.given that our legislature has made findings concerning how to maintain the integrity of the insurance industry,substantial justification exists to suspend subject persons,like yousef,without a predeprivation hearing where they have been charged in an information with a crime described in section,subdivision e a 
that the suspension in mallen was based on an indictment whereas yousef suspension is based on an information does not render the risk here of erroneous deprivation any greater than the risk in mallen.in gilbert,supra,d,the court held that a university police officer could be suspended without a presuspension hearing when he had been arrested and formally charged with a felony.the court said,it is true that there is more reason to believe an employee has committed a felony when he is indicted rather than merely arrested and formally charged but for present purposes arrest and charge give reason enough.they serve to assure that the state employer decision to suspend the employee is not baseless or unwarranted,citation,in that an independent third party has determined that there is probable cause to believe the employee committed a serious crime.id.at.see also id.at.the state has a significant interest in immediately suspending,when felony charges are filed against them,employees who occupy positions of great public trust and high public visibility.
here,the orange county district attorney filed an information against yousef.that information was filed by a body independent from the commissioner,and it had to be based on reasonable or probable cause or it was subject to being set aside.see.therefore,the information,like an indictment,provides adequate assurances that the suspension is not unjustified.gilbert,supra,at.
moreover,under mallen and gilbert,we do not see a problem with permitting an information to constitute evidence that a failure to immediately issue a suspension order would threaten the financial solvency of an insurer or may cause financial or other injury to any person,subd.e b.yousef argues,to the contrary,that section e requires two separate findings a the subject person has been charged with a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more and which involves as one of its necessary elements a fraudulent act or an act of dishonesty involving money and b a failure to immediately issue the order threatens an insurer financial solvency or may cause financial or other injury to any person.the charging instrument may not,argues yousef,be used as evidence to support the second finding of a threat or injury.
the court in mallen,supra,at page,however,rejected a similar argument.former title united states code section g required the fdic to make two findings first,the individual had been charged with a specific type of crime and,second,the individual posed a threat to the bank depositors or to public confidence in the bank.the court impliedly found that the indictment alone evidenced the threat the court noted that an indictment establishes probable cause that the individual has committed the crime,and therefore the indictment should certainly be sufficient,when coupled with the congressional finding that a prompt suspension is important to the integrity of our banking institutions,to support the order entered in this case ibid.
section e similarly permits the commissioner to conflate the findings required under section,subdivision e a and b.nor do we believe that this is improper where the legislature has determined that the integrity of the insurance industry may be threatened by the continued participation in that industry of subject persons against whom specific types of criminal charges have been filed.such filings are generally a matter of public record,and may therefore have an immediate impact on public confidence in the insurance industry.an immediate response,where certain limited circumstances are present,our legislature has found,therefore may be necessary 
notwithstanding that mallen and gilbert control the outcome here,yousef cites gray superior court th,d gray,to support his contentions he should have been given a presuspension hearing and that the mere filing of a criminal complaint does not provide a sufficient basis to suspend him.gray,a licensed doctor,was charged with,among other things,unlawfully prescribing and possessing a controlled substance,misdemeanor possession of child pornography,and sexually exploiting a patient or former patient.without prior notice,the medical board appeared at gray arraignment and requested that his medical license be suspended until resolution of the criminal conditions as a condition of bail.the trial court granted the bail condition,and gray filed a writ of mandate petition in the court of appeal.the court of appeal noted that there are a number of statutory procedures under which the medical board may suspend a physician license,all of which accord with due process.but the medical board ignored those procedures.the court of appeal rejected the board suggestion that it can seek an immediate and indefinite suspension of a medical license without notice,evidence,or an adequate opportunity to litigate the issues,simply because criminal charges have been filed.we find no support for the proposition that the due process and proof required for a license suspension may be ignored when a criminal complaint has been filed against a licensee.gray,supra,th at,d.the court additionally noted that had the medical board sought a preliminary injunction against gray,the unverified criminal complaint would not have been competent evidence demonstrating a serious threat of injury to the public.the complaint,by itself,does not provide the required evidentiary showing.id.at,d.
gray is distinguishable from this case the commissioner here suspended yousef license under a specific statute providing for such suspensions,section e.in contrast,the court in gray was primarily concerned with the medical board complete failure to follow any of the procedures for suspending a physician license.in bypassing the statute,the medical board afforded gray no notice or opportunity to be heard either before or after the suspension.thus,the court statement that there is no support for the proposition that the due process and proof required for a license suspension may be ignored when a criminal complaint has been filed against a licensee,was made in the specific context of the statutory scheme the medical board must follow before suspending a physician license,which scheme specified an evidentiary burden of proof.gray,supra,th at,d.
but to the extent gray can be construed as a general statement on what process is due before a license can be suspended,there is support for the proposition a license suspension may be based on the filing of a criminal complaint without a presuspension hearing mallen,supra,at pages,and gilbert,supra,at page.under that united states supreme court authority,where,as here,there has been a legislative finding that the immediate suspension of subject persons who have been charged with certain crimes is necessary to protect the insurance industry integrity,due process is not violated by the absence of a predeprivation hearing,so long as a postdeprivation hearing is available.
it is thus to the postdeprivation hearing provided under section that we now turn.
iv.the postdeprivation hearing does not violate due process.
under section,subdivision f,a subject person who has been suspended under subdivision e may seek immediate judicial review under code of civil procedure section,subd.f b.alternatively,he or she may,within days after a suspension order has been issued,apply for a hearing on the order,subd.f a.yousef contends that the hearing on the order violates due process because it allows the commissioner to rely on the charging instrument and because the hearing is not on the merits,the subject person is not afforded an opportunity to dispute the criminal allegations.we agree with that assessment,but we disagree that the hearing on the order under section,subdivision f violates due process.
due process requires an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner barry,supra,at.to be meaningful,a hearing need not be a full adversarial one.to the contrary,a hearing that excludes the issue of the subject person guilt or innocence on an underlying criminal charge comports with due process.see feinberg federal deposit ins.feinberg.feinberg held that title of the united states code section g,as originally enacted,was unconstitutional because it did not provide,among other things,for either a predeprivation or a postdeprivation hearing.in discussing what should occur at a postdeprivation hearing,the court said that the question relating to the issuance of a notice and order of suspension is not the person guilt or innocence but,rather,whether the crime charged can be characterized as a crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust,and whether the decision to issue a notice and order of suspension in a particular case is necessary to further the legislative purpose of the statute.id.at,fn.omitted.the court went on to say that the hearing will involve a complex legal question whether the crime charged is one involving dishonesty or breach of trust,as well as a question requiring the subtle interrelation of fact and policy the effect upon the public of the indictees holding office and participating in the affairs of the bank.id.at.
after feinberg,the statute was amended to provide for a postdeprivation hearing within thirty days from service of any notice of suspension or order of removal the director,officer,or other person concerned may request in writing an opportunity to appear before the agency to show that the continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the bank by such individual does not,or is not likely to,pose a threat to the interests of the bank depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the bank.mallen,supra,at,fn,citing former g,italics added.thus,the hearing under section g is on the order as opposed to an adjudication of the subject person guilt or innocence.
yousef argues that the problem with limiting the hearing in this manner is that the commissioner is allowed to rely solely on the criminal complaint to support the suspension.that is true,but it does not necessarily render the hearing meaningless.t he fact that an indictment is considered adequate evidence to effect a suspension does not mean that the indictment is considered conclusive evidence.rutigliano paper stock serv.admin,rutigliano.
in rutigliano,supra,rutigliano and his company were indicted for various crimes concerning their business.based on the indictment,the united states general services administration suspended them,under the federal acquisition regulation far,from receiving government contracts.the far provides that a contractor can be suspended upon adequate evidence.an indictment for specified crimes constitutes adequate evidence.if suspended,a contractor has the right to submit information and argument in opposition to the suspension,including any additional specific information raising a genuine dispute of material facts.but if the suspension is based on an indictment,the suspending official decision is based on the administrative record,as well as the additional evidence,mitigating circumstances,the gravity of the charged offense,the probability of guilt,and well founded claims of innocence.there are no additional factfinding proceedings.rutigliano,supra,at.
the court in rutigliano first rejected appellants argument that the hearing was not meaningful because the government was allowed to rely on the indictment to justify the suspension.rutigliano,supra.at.the court suggested that the indictment gave rise to a rebuttable presumption,which the contractor could produce evidence to rebut.the court said,g rounding a rebuttable presumption upon the indictment does not violate due process,since the indictment itself gives rise to a presumption of probable cause.id.at.the court next rejected an argument that the absence of fact finding at the hearing violates due process the purpose of the opportunity to be heard is not to contest the indictment,but rather to demonstrate that the suspension should not be imposed,either because it is not in the government interest to do so,or because in light of the compelling evidence presented by the contractor,a governmental decision to rely only on the indictment would be arbitrary,capricious,or in abuse of discretion within the meaning of a.citations.in this context,due process does not require a full adversarial hearing and fact finding.rutigliano,supra,at.
similarly,section,subdivision f a,neither provides for a full adversarial hearing nor does due process require one.a person suspended under section e is entitled to a postdeprivation hearing.but the hearing is limited to a determination of a whether the crime charged is punishable by a term exceeding one year and involves a fraudulent act or an act of dishonesty in the acceptance,custody,or payment of money or property and b whether a failure to immediately issue the order threatens the financial solvency of an insurer or may cause financial or other injury to any person.the hearing is not one to determine the subject person guilt or innocence on the underlying criminal charges,for a guilt determination is,we believe,potentially fraught with greater constitutional peril than a hearing on the order.an administrative hearing at which the subject person guilt or innocence is at issue raises,among other things,collateral estoppel and fifth amendment issues.but those issues are avoided by limiting the hearing to the issue of whether the crime with which the subject person has been charged involves the necessary elements under a whether they pose a threat under b 
moreover,to aid a subject person in making that showing,the hearing must be conducted in accordance with government code section et,subd.i.the government code requires the hearing to be conducted before an administrative law judge,and gives the parties an opportunity,for example,to conduct discovery and to call and to witnesses.the decision after the hearing is also subject to judicial review.
therefore,contrary to yousef suggestion that the postdeprivation hearing is illusory,all the process that is due is afforded at the section,subdivision f a,hearing.
section is not void for vagueness.
yousef makes the additional contention that section e is void for vagueness because it permits the commissioner to suspend a license based on a finding that a failure to issue the order may cause financial or other injury to any person.we disagree.
due process requires fair notice of what conduct is prohibited.citation.in that regard,a statute must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for citizens and guidance for officials to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.ibid.a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.citations.a statute must be definite enough to provide a standard of conduct for those whose activities are proscribed as well as a standard for the ascertainment of guilt by the courts called upon to apply it.citations.citations.however,a statute is not vague if,as here,any reasonable and practical construction can be given to its language.reasonable certainty is all that is required.citations.citations.valiyee department of motor vehicles th,d.
section e affords reasonable certainty to licensees as to what conduct might subject them to action thereunder.indeed,the statute is quite specific.to avoid possible suspension,a subject person must avoid committing a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for a term greater than one year and that has as one of its elements a fraudulent act or an act of dishonesty in the acceptance,custody,or payment of money or property.furthermore,the failure to issue an order may threaten an insurer solvency or cause financial or other injury to any person.it thus seems quite clear that the statute is aimed at prohibiting those crimes that would impact the insurance business.for example,the crimes alleged against yousef all arise out of conduct taken in connection with his bail bond a man and holding him until he signed a bail agreement and forging documents to obtain security.these are the quintessential types of crimes at which the statute is aimed.
vi.section does not conflict with section.
yousef contends that section,rather than section,provides the proper procedure for the suspension of licensed bail agents,and that section conflicts with section.we do not agree.
section requires a predeprivation hearing before a bail agent license may be suspended.section provides,the commissioner shall not suspend or revoke any license,issued under this article,without first granting a hearing,upon reasonable notice to the applicant,except that he may temporarily suspend any such license for a period not exceeding days pending such hearing.where a hearing is held under this section the proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter of part of division of title of the government code,and the commissioner shall have all the powers granted therein.the difference between section and is section is limited to licensees.in contrast,section broadly applies to a subject person which includes licensed and unlicensed persons.
an argument can thus be made that section e is an around section requirement of a predeprivation hearing,at least when section e is used against licensees.but a suspension order under section e can issue only under certain limited circumstances,namely,a subject person has been formally charged with certain types of crimes.this scheme suggests a legislative determination that the filing of a criminal complaint against a subject person,including a licensee,is a special,emergent circumstance justifying immediate action.we therefore will not secondguess the legislature determination it needs the special tool of section e to protect the public.
disposition
