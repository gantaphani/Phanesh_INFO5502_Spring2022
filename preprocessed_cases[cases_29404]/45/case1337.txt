continental casualty continental filed suit against american national insurance anico,a in the associated accident and health reinsurance underwriters aahru reinsurance pool managed by ioa re,ioa re.continental attempted to leave the reinsurance arrangement in.it sought a declaratory judgment that it owed no duty to indemnify anico pursuant to a quota share personal accident retrocession contract quota share contract executed in by anico and ioa re.continental maintained that ioa re lacked the authority to enter into the contract on continental behalf.in response,anico moved for dismissal on the grounds,among others,that arbitration clauses in the quota share contract between ioa re and anico,and in the aahru participation agreement between ioa re and continental,required the parties to arbitrate.
the district court agreed with anico,holding that ioa re had apparent authority as a matter of law to bind continental to the quota share contract and that the participation agreement arbitration clause also compelled arbitration.because the arbitration venue was not the northern district of illinois,the district court dismissed the action and continental appeals.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
continental and anico were major participants in the reinsurance pool,aahru as part of the participation agreements covering each member participation in the pool,the fund manager,ioa re,was granted the authority to enter into reinsurance contracts on behalf of the members.on july,continental notified ioa re of its intent to terminate its participation in aahru at the end of.it followed this communication with two more notices on july and november.on august,continental also revoked certain aspects of ioa re agency authority,including the authority to enter into contracts on continental behalf and to reinsurance policies.continental did not notify any of the other three aahru members of its withdrawal.it notified only the pool manager ioa re.
anico claims that in it sought to cede certain reinsurance business to aahru.this cession was reduced to writing in a quota share contract.for reasons that are unexplained by anico and are not clear from the record,the formal contract was not executed until april,continental withdrawal from the pool.however,the contract was and given an effective date of january.the ceded block of policies included risks covering the world trade center that were implicated by the terrorist attacks of september.continental asserts that it learned of the quota share contract when,in the wake of the attacks,anico asked for partial indemnification under the agreement.
continental participation is important to anico because,in,continental represented almost of the total aahru participation.without continental,anico indemnification from other insurers would be reduced significantly.anico claims that it would not have entered into the reinsurance contract with ioa re if it had known that continental would not be a participant in the reinsurance pool.
district court proceedings 
continental filed this action against anico,seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not bound by,and owed anico no duty under,the quota share contract.anico then filed a motion to dismiss,contending that the quota share contract contained an arbitration clause,and arbitration was required under the federal arbitration act faa,et the venue was improper,see.b and continental had failed to join ioa re,an indispensable party,see id.b.
anico grounded its arbitration argument in the arbitration clauses of two different agreements the quota share contract entered into by ioa re and anico and the participation agreement between ioa re and continental establishing continental membership in aahru.the district court first determined,as a matter of law,that ioa re had the apparent authority to bind continental to the quota share contract that ioa re had signed with anico.therefore,held the court,continental was bound to arbitrate any disputes under the quota share contract.
in the alternative,the court determined that the dispute over continental liability under the quota share contract arose under the participation agreement.the court reasoned that,although anico was not a signatory to the re agreement,anico was a beneficiary to the participation agreement and thus was entitled to invoke the agreement arbitration clause.as the district court viewed the matter,then,the dispute before it was subject to two arbitration clauses the quota share contract required arbitration and continental participation agreement arbitration clause also covered any dispute arising from the arrangement.accordingly,the district court held that under either the quota share contract or the participation agreement,a valid arbitration agreement exists however,in either case,the forum for arbitration is not in the northern district of illinois.at.the court accordingly dismissed the action.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,lauer,cir snyder smith,cir,overruled on other grounds by felzen andreas,cir.
continental then brought this appeal,seeking review of the two alternative holdings of the district court.
discussion 
before embarking on our analysis,we pause to set forth some basic governing principles.although the federal arbitration act favors resolution of disputes through arbitration,its provisions are not to be construed so broadly as to include claims that were never intended for arbitration.american united logistics,catellus dev,cir.whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate is a question normally answered by the court rather than by an arbitrator.the issue is governed by state law principles governing contract formation.first options of chicago,kaplan,d reliance ins.raybestos prods,cir.nevertheless,we must be mindful that the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements and that questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d.a s a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration id.at.
we begin our analysis by dealing with a threshold issue on which the parties have spent a great deal of time and energy in the course of this appeal.in this court the parties dispute the procedural posture in which this case comes to us.anico takes the view that the district court acted under federal rule of civil procedure b and dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction.continental contends,however,that the district court dismissed the case under rule b for failure to state a claim.the parties believe that this disagreement is important for two reasons.first,continental submits that,if the motion was decided under rule b,the district court erred by considering matters outside of the pleadings,specifically the participation agreement,without affording continental rule procedural protections.see.b continental points out that the only rule b ground with an evidentiary limitation is b thus,continental argues,the district court taking the time to explain why it considered the participation agreement to be part of the pleadings indicates that it was proceeding under rule b 
second,the parties believe that the procedural characterization of the district court action is important because it affects our standard of review or,more particularly,our presumptions in exercising that review.if anico is correct,and the district court dismissed the action under rule b,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact,in particular,the court finding that anico had apparent authority,for clear error.united phosphorus,angus chem,cir en banc.if,as continental urges,the motion to dismiss came under rule b or was an improperly converted rule motion,then we must review the district court ruling de novo but draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.see anderer jones,cir jet,shell oil,cir.
there is some authority to support the view of each party.some courts have taken the view that,if a d
