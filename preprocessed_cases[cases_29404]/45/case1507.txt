corn plus is a minnesota cooperative which operates an ethanol processing facility.in january corn plus hired wanzek construction,wanzek,a general mechanical contractor,to perform welding work in an expansion of its ethanol facility in winnebago,mn.under their contract wanzek was responsible for welding the pipes that carry the corn mash used to produce ethanol.while wanzek substantially completed its work,it did not meet the project specifications due to incomplete weld penetration,which resulted in bacterial contamination of the corn mash as it lodged in cavities caused by the incomplete welds.corn plus asserts that the bacterial contamination has led to decreased ethanol production and can not be permanently eliminated,although it can be alleviated with antibiotics.for these reasons corn plus claims that repairs of the defective welds are necessary to avoid the risk of structural damage to the piping system.
in january wanzek brought a mechanic lien foreclosure action against corn plus in minnesota state court arguing that corn plus owed it million for its welding work under the contract.corn plus counterclaimed on a number of grounds,including breach of contract and negligence,and alleged damages as a result of wanzek defective welding of the pipes.
wanzek carried commercial general liability insurance of up to million with continental and excess coverage insurance with lumbermens.wanzek tendered corn plus counterclaims to continental,its primary insurer.continental and lumbermens both denied coverage,contending that their policies excluded coverage for repairing wanzek faulty work.nevertheless continental agreed to defend wanzek against the counterclaim subject to a reservation of its rights to contest coverage.in may continental brought a declaratory judgment action against wanzek in state court submitting that it had no duty to defend or indemnify wanzek for the counterclaims that resulted from the defective welding.lumbermens was not party to this declaratory judgment action.
after corn plus and wanzek failed in an initial attempt to mediate,a second effort was undertaken in december.corn plus submitted a mediation brief itemizing its alleged damages from the faulty welding,which amounted to approximately million.corn plus made a million cash settlement offer which wanzek rejected.instead,wanzek proposed a settlement in the same amount.corn plus and wanzek informed continental and lumbermens that they were negotiating a settlement,but neither insurer chose to participate in the negotiations or to provide settlement funds.
corn plus and wanzek reached a agreement in march to settle their case for million.wanzek stipulated to negligence in its welding resulting in damages to the ethanol manufacturing process and facility.the agreement,which includes a severability provision,did not allocate the million into itemized damages.as part of the settlement,corn plus agreed to pay wanzek approximately to satisfy wanzek million demand for breach of contract and mechanic lien claims.the parties also entered into an addendum which provided that if a court were to find the million amount unreasonable,it should determine the largest fair and reasonable amount and substitute that for the million.the state trial court approved the settlement between corn plus and wanzek and ordered that judgment be entered pursuant to the agreement.
in light of the agreement corn plus moved to intervene as a defendant in the declaratory judgment action between continental and wanzek.the state trial court granted the motion and dismissed wanzek.because the million agreement exceeded continental million coverage policy,lumbermens,the excess coverage insurer,intervened as a plaintiff in the declaratory judgment action.the court also realigned the parties,designating corn plus as plaintiff and continental and lumbermens as defendants.
lumbermens removed the case to federal district court on diversity of citizenship grounds,and corn plus subsequently filed an amended complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that its claims are covered by the insurers policies and that its agreement with wanzek is enforceable.corn plus then moved for partial summary judgment on the coverage issue and argued that the insurers policies cover not just the contaminated corn mash and its consequential damages,but also the costs to repair wanzek defective work and all attendant current and future economic losses.the district court ruled that property damage caused by wanzek faulty welding triggered insurance coverage.it identified the covered property damage as the bacterially contaminated corn mash and consequential costs causally related to the contamination,such as antibiotic treatments and disinfection of the mash,cleaning of the pipes,and plant shutdowns required to change cooling lines and address centrifuge issues.the district court also concluded,however,that two policy exclusions the damage to your work exclusion and the impaired property exclusion precluded coverage for repairing the defective welding and its consequential costs,as well as for loss of use of the facility,including decreased ethanol production,caused by its incorporation of the defective welds.
following the coverage decision,the insurers moved for summary judgment asserting that the agreement is unenforceable.the district court granted their motion because the agreement had not allocated the damages by type of loss,and the settlement amount thus included covered and noncovered claims.the district court also declined to enforce for public policy reasons the agreement addendum,which purported to empower a court to determine a reasonable settlement amount if it found the agreement unenforceable.
corn plus appeals the summary judgment grant in favor of the insurers on several grounds,claiming that the district court incorrectly ruled that the insurance policy exclusions barred coverage for welding repairs and consequential loss of use of the facility.it also argues that the district court erred in finding the agreement unreasonable and in refusing to enforce its addendum.finally,corn plus seeks an order to reinstate its underlying litigation with wanzek if we uphold the district court rulings.the insurers ask us to affirm,choosing not to appeal the district court conclusion that the contaminated corn mash and related damages are not excluded from coverage.
