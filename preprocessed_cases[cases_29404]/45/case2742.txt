in fireman fund ins.companies cal d,the supreme court held that a third party individual who is injured by the alleged negligence of an insured not have a private right of action against the insurer for unfair settlement practices.this case presents the question,one of first impression in california,of whether that rule applies where the third party claimant is insured by the same insurer as the other party.
we hold that bars such an action because the coincidental fact that plaintiffs are insured by the same insurer as the other party does not change plaintiffs position as strangers to the other party insurance policy and as adversaries to the insurer.thus,the insurer owes no duty of good faith and fair dealing to plaintiffs in settling their claims against the other party.
we also conclude that where there is no duty of good faith and fair dealing,there is no duty that would give rise to a claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.finally,we determine that the insurer conduct here does not reach the level of outrageousness necessary to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
background 
on september,plaintiffs philip and robin coleman were involved in a traffic accident with jesus gonzalez.at the time,the colemans were insured by republic insurance company of california republic and gonzalez was insured by infinity insurance company infinity.infinity is the parent company of republic and controls over percent of the voting securities in republic.the two companies share management and a common claims processing office.
in march,infinity paid the colemans property damage claim against gonzalez.on july,infinity sent a letter to the colemans informing them that the statute of limitations for their personal injury claim would run on september.
on august,infinity adjuster told the colemans that as long as they submitted their medical records and authorization forms prior to september,their claim would be processed and settled regardless of the statute of limitations.they promptly submitted all requested materials to the adjuster.in a phone call on august,the adjuster told the colemans that with all necessary documentation now in hand,infinity would complete the processing and settlement of their personal injury claim against gonzalez.he also told them that because the matter was straightforward,they did not need an attorney to represent them.
the colemans called the adjuster again in early october to check on the status of the settlement.he apologized for the delay and told them that the proposed settlement had been sent to infinity underwriters for approval.he suggested that the colemans call him back in about a week.they called back as instructed but had difficulty getting in touch with the adjuster,who did not return their calls.they reached him on october.in that conversation,the adjuster referred the colemans to his supervisor,who informed them that the statute of limitations had run and that infinity would not pay their claim.this statement directly contradicted the assurances given by the adjuster on august that their claim would be processed and settled regardless of the statute of limitations.the manner in which their claim was handled caused the colemans severe emotional distress,mental suffering,sleeplessness,and humiliation.
on march,the colemans filed this action in los angeles superior court against gonzalez and his insurer,infinity,and the colemans own insurer,republic.the complaint alleged a cause of action for negligence against gonzalez,and causes of action for fraud,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent infliction of emotional distress,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against both infinity and republic.
infinity and republic demurred.the trial court overruled the demurrers to the negligence cause of action because only gonzalez was named in that count,but sustained infinity and republic demurrers to the remaining causes of action,with leave to amend,determining that the colemans had not pleaded facts sufficient to show fraud,extreme and outrageous conduct,severe emotional distress,or unreasonable denial of the claim.
the colemans filed their first amended complaint,essentially alleging the same facts and including the same causes of action,except the fraud claim,which they did not pursue.the parties stipulated to severing the negligence cause of action against gonzalez.
infinity and republic again demurred.the trial court sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint,without leave to amend,concluding under that the colemans could not bring an action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligent infliction of emotional distress,or intentional infliction of emotional distress against the insurers because the colemans were insured by republic,not infinity,they were third party claimants to benefits under gonzalez insurance policy and,under,could not bring an action against gonzalez insurer for unfair settlement practices.the colemans appealed.
discussion 
the standard of review for an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend is de novo.blank kirwan cal d.we exercise our independent judgment as to whether,as a matter of law,the colemans first amended complaint states a cause of action.see ibid.
the colemans contend that infinity and republic,based on their affiliation,are corporate alter egos that should be treated as the same insurer.they rely on insurance code section,subdivision b for the proposition that because infinity allegedly owns over percent of the voting securities in republic,infinity is presumed to control republic and therefore the two companies are essentially the same entity we assume for the sake of discussion that the colemans alter ego analysis is correct and hereafter refer to infinity and republic collectively as the insurer.
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
as stated,the issue of whether an insurer owes a duty of good faith and fair dealing to a third party claimant whom it also insures,under an unrelated policy,is one of first impression in california.the colemans contend that the insurer owed them such a duty.we disagree.
in,supra,cal d,the california supreme court overruled its holding in royal globe ins.superior court cal d,royal globe that allowed third party claimants a private right of action against insurers for unfair settlement practices under the unfair practices act,et.a third party claimant is an individual who is injured by the alleged negligence of an insured citation,supra,cal d at.the court concluded that such suits by third party claimants against insurers were undesirable because of the adverse social and economic consequences discussed below.id.at.
such an action against insurers promotes multiple litigation,because royal globe holding contemplates,indeed encourages,two lawsuits by the injured claimant an initial suit against the insured,followed by a second suit against the insurer for bad faith refusal to settle.citation.as a corollary,royal globe may tend to encourage unwarranted settlement demands by claimants,and to coerce inflated settlements by insurers seeking to avoid the cost of a second lawsuit and exposure to a bad faith action.citations.the public ultimately will be affected by the additional drain on judicial resources.moreover,the public will indeed suffer from escalating costs of insurance coverage,a certain result of inflated settlement demands and costly litigation.citation.other commentators agree that royal globe,and its allowance of a direct action against the insurer,may result in escalating insurance costs to the general public resulting from insurers increased expenditures to fund coerced settlements,excessive jury awards and increased attorney fees.citations.a nother unfortunate consequence of our holding in royal globe that insurers owe a direct duty to third party claimants it tends to create a serious conflict of interest for the insurer,who must not only protect the interests of its insured,but also must safeguard its own interests from the adverse claims of the third party claimant.this conflict disrupts the settlement process and may disadvantage the insured.citations,supra,cal d at.
the colemans are individual s who were injured by the alleged negligence of an insured,gonzalez,and therefore are third party claimants,supra,cal d at.nevertheless,they argue that because they are also insured by the insurer,their case is an exception to the rule in and a situation in which the insurer owed them a duty of good faith and fair dealing in settling their claim against gonzalez.yet the colemans action still implicates the court policy concerns about multiple lawsuits,coercive settlement demands,judicial resources,increased costs of insurance,and the conflict of interest between an insurer and its other insured because it is still a third party action against an insurer.here,we are called on to decide whether the insurer relationship with the colemans,as holders of an unrelated insurance policy,outweighs those concerns.
cases from other jurisdictions 
the majority of other jurisdictions that have dealt with this issue have held that insurers do not owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing to third party claimants whom they also insure.in pixton state farm utah pixton,both drivers in a traffic accident were insured by state farm under unrelated policies.one of the drivers,the plaintiff,alleged that the other driver negligence caused the accident.the plaintiff made a first party claim for medical expenses under her own policy and a third party claim against the other driver for the cost of rehabilitation services.id.at.
after state farm paid the plaintiff medical expenses under her own policy,it hired an independent rehabilitation company to evaluate her medical condition and estimate the cost of her rehabilitation.state farm then offered to settle her third party claim,but,according to the plaintiff,refused to provide her with the results of the rehabilitation evaluation,which she deemed necessary to determine if the settlement offered was reasonable.the plaintiff eventually obtained the evaluation report and asserted state farm had mischaracterized some of the costs for her rehabilitation,resulting in the undervaluation of her third party claim.she then settled with the other driver and brought suit against state farm for breach of contract,fraud,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on its alleged earlier refusal to disclose information to her and for its use of the same adjuster for both her first and her third party claims.pixton,supra,at.
the court of appeals of utah affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment to state farm,concluding that the insurer owed no duty of good faith and fair dealing to the plaintiff,because the other driver insurance policy,and not her own,was at issue in the underlying action.pixton,supra,at.
the pixton court explained the plaintiff has no relevant contractual relationship with state farm.the plaintiff makes no claim that state farm failed to perform any obligation under her insurance policy with state farm.all the plaintiff claims are grounded in her status as an injured claimant attempting to recover against state farm as the insurer of the tortfeasor the plaintiff claims state farm acted in bad faith by failing to properly settle her claim against the tortfeasor but all her claims were settled to her satisfaction in sum,we are persuaded that there is no duty of good faith and fair dealing imposed upon an insurer running to a claimant,such as the plaintiff,seeking to recover against the company insured.this conclusion is consistent with the commentators and the great majority of courts in other jurisdictions that have been confronted with the issue the plaintiff attempts to distinguish her claimant position claiming that she had a contractual relationship with state farm under her policy.however,she does not challenge the settlement of her claim under that policy or articulate how state farm breached any duty under her contract with it.pixton,supra,at.
similarly,in martin state farm mut.auto.ins.d,martin,both drivers in a traffic accident were insured by state farm under unrelated policies.the plaintiff filed a claim with state farm against the other driver.maintaining that state farm concealed the full extent of coverage to which plaintiffs were entitled under the other driver policy by failing to disclose that they were entitled to additional compensation for the diminished value of their vehicle,the plaintiff sued state farm for breach of contract,fraud,breach of a voluntary undertaking and breach of a fiduciary duty.id.at,at.
the trial court dismissed the suit for failure to state a cause of action.the appellate court of illinois affirmed,observing that courts have generally declined to recognize a special duty extending from the insurer to the claimant even where the claimant is also insured by the same insurer,the rationale being that the claimant remains in an adversarial position despite this coincidence.martin,supra,at,emphasis omitted.
the same result was reached in clinton state farm mutual automobile ins,clinton.again,both parties involved in a traffic accident were covered by state farm under unrelated policies.one driver,the plaintiff,sued the other driver for personal injuries.according to the plaintiff,state farm adjuster assured the plaintiff that the company would take care of him and that he would receive a decent settlement state farm stalled,then told the plaintiff that the statute of limitations had run and his claim was barred.id.at,at.the plaintiff sued state farm for multifariousness and duplicity,georgia version of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
the trial court sustained state farm general demurrer.the court of appeals of georgia affirmed,concluding that the action must fail because state farm was the agent of the other driver,not that of the plaintiff t he insurance company is the agent for the other insured in adjusting liability claims against him under his policy state farm was the agent of the other insured in any negotiations that may have been had with the plaintiff looking to the adjustment of the plaintiff claim against the other insured under the other insured policy consequently there was no relationship between the plaintiff and state farm citations.clinton,supra,at.
courts in other jurisdictions have also determined that an insurer owes no duty of good faith and fair dealing to a third party claimant whom it also insures the supreme court of wyoming herrig herrig,the court of appeals of texas caserotti state farm ins,and the united states district court for the district of south carolina myers state farm mut.auto.ins.
we agree with these cases and apply them to the matter before us and conclude that the colemans can not maintain their action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the colemans own insurance policy was not related to their claim against gonzalez and thus is not a relevant contractual relationship which would give rise to such an action.pixton,supra,at.the colemans remained in an adversarial position toward the insurer despite the coincidence of also being insured by the insurer.martin,supra,at.imposing a duty of good faith and fair dealing running from the insurer to the colemans would create a serious conflict of interest for the insurer by obligating it to safeguard both the colemans and gonzalez interests,supra,cal d at.to extend that duty to claimants would place the insurer in the untenable position of owing a duty of good faith to both the insured tortfeasor and his adversary.martin,supra,at.
the colemans rely on rawlings apodaca,rawlings,a supreme court of arizona case,for the proposition that an insurer owes a duty of good faith to a third party claimant whom it also insures.rawlings is distinguishable because it involved a first party claim.
in rawlings,a fire damaged the plaintiff dairy farm.the plaintiff filed a claim for compensation under his own homeowners insurance policy.as part of the process of settling the plaintiff first party claim,the insurer hired an investigator,who determined that the neighbor probably caused the fire and tha
