first national bank of manitowoc extended credit to a local dealership based in part on the dealership presentation of leases signed by its customers.unbeknownst to the bank,in many instances the dealership president forged customers signatures on leases that were fabricated or altered.the dealership eventually defaulted on the loans,and the bank lost more than million.the bank filed a claim for the loss with its insurer,cincinnati insurance company.the policy cincinnati had issued to the bank was similar but not identical to an outdated version of the standard bankers blanket bond,now known as a financial institutions bond.generally speaking,these bonds provide coverage to financial institutions for losses caused by specified dishonest,fraudulent,or criminal acts.
cincinnati denied the bank claim and this suit ensued.both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court denied cincinnati motion and granted the bank in substantial part,rejecting only its claim for statutory interest.both parties appealed.because the cincinnati policy covers the bank losses and statutory interest was properly denied,we affirm.
background 
first national bank of manitowoc is a national bank headquartered in manitowoc,wisconsin.in the bank began doing business with west town auto,a dealership also located in manitowoc.the bank had several lending relationships with west town,including a line of credit through which west town purchased vehicles to lease.west town would enter into a preliminary lease agreement with a customer at the dealership,and lee kust,west town president,would procure a loan to purchase the vehicle.
kust would call the bank or fax it the lease terms and wait for the bank approval once the lease was approved sometimes several days later,kust would finalize the transaction with his customer and bring the signed lease agreement to the bank.at that time kust would execute several documents,including a business note,an assignment of lease payments,and a chattel security agreement granting the bank a security interest in the vehicle.under the terms of its line of credit with the bank,west town was responsible for making loan payments to the bank west town customers made their lease payments directly to west town.
the facts surrounding kust fraud are undisputed.the scam worked in one of two ways kust either fabricated a lease agreement for a nonexistent vehicle and transaction or altered the terms of a valid lease agreement and submitted the altered version to the bank as examples of the latter fraud,kust would alter a vehicle condition,make,or model,thereby enabling him to obtain a larger loan.under both scenarios,kust forged customer signatures by tracing a valid signature onto a fabricated or altered lease form.in kust suddenly disappeared and west town defaulted on the loan.until then,however,west town had been making monthly payments as required,although the bank had assessed late charges on several occasions.
cincinnati does not suggest that any bank employees were aware of kust fraudulent scheme,but the insurer does point to what it says are red flags during the course of the lending relationship that it believes ought to affect coverage.for example,the bank did not have a copy of each vehicle certificate of title and relied on kust to record and perfect its security interest.bank employees were aware that lien confirmations were not on file for many vehicles,and those that were on file contained discrepancies the vehicle identification number vin on the confirmations did not always match the vin number identified on the lease and loan documents.on several occasions one vin number served as collateral for two separate loans.after kust disappeared it only took a few phone calls to west town lessees for the bank to realize there was a problem.
after the bank assessed its losses,it sought coverage under an insurance policy it had purchased from cincinnati in called the depository institutions blanket bond,no.the cincinnati bond borrows from the bankers blanket bond,standard form,an insurance policy for commercial banks offered by several carriers.the standard bankers blanket bond is a agreement between the underwriter and the insured financial institution,pursuant to which the underwriter agrees to indemnify the insured against loss sustained by reason of specific perils described under six insuring agreements,which are commonly referred to by the letter designating them in the bond.peter broeman,an overview of the financial institution bond,standard form,banking.the standard bond also includes several exclusions which subtract from coverage provided by the insuring agreements.cont l aetna cas.sur,cir e xclusions are expressly intended to modify coverage clauses and to limit their scope.cornell paperboard prods,bulen west bend mut.ins.
here,we are primarily concerned with insuring agreement e and exclusion insuring agreement e covers loss resulting from a financial institution reliance on forged or counterfeit documents.cincinnati version of insuring agreement e reads as follows 
all risk forgery 
loss by reason of the insured a having in good faith and in the usual course of business extended any credit or assumed any liability or otherwise acted upon any security,document,or other written instrument which proves to have been a forgery or to have been altered or raised or counterfeited 
actual physical possession of such security,document or other written instrument by the insured is a condition precedent to the insured having relied on the faith of,or otherwise acted upon,such security,document or,other written instrument.
forgery is defined in the cincinnati policy as the signing of the name of another with intent to deceive.exclusion h excludes coverage for loss caused by an employee,except when covered under insuring agreement insuring agreement a covers losses resulting directly from dishonest or fraudulent acts of an employee.
the bank submitted a proof of claim to cincinnati for coverage under insuring agreements d and e of the policy cincinnati denied coverage and the bank filed suit in state court.cincinnati removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction,and both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court denied cincinnati motion and granted the bank motion in part,holding that insuring agreement e covered the bank loss but that questions of fact existed with respect to damages.to move the case along,the parties stipulated to damages about million,and the district court awarded the bank prejudgment interest at a rate of.the court denied the bank request for statutory interest at the higher rate of.
both parties appealed.cincinnati appealed from the district court orders partially granting the bank motion for summary judgment on coverage,denying cincinnati motion for summary judgment,denying cincinnati motion to strike an affidavit and awarding the bank prejudgment interest.the bank appealed from the district court order awarding interest,arguing that it is entitled to statutory prejudgment interest at a rate of under section of the wisconsin statutes.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.with cross summary judgment motions,we construe all facts and inferences therefrom in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.in re united air lines,cir quoting kort diversified collection,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the parties agree that wisconsin law governs this diversity suit.
coverage under the cincinnati bond 
the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.cont l,at citing kraemer united states fire ins,folkman quamme.an insurance policy is construed to give effect to the intent of the parties as expressed in the language of the policy,which is interpreted as a reasonable person in the position of the insured would understand it.folkman,at danbeck am.family mut.ins.if the language of the policy is plain and unambiguous,it is enforced as written,without resort to rules of construction.folkman,at danbeck,at.policy language is interpreted not in isolation but in the context of the policy as a whole.folkman,at.if the policy language is ambiguous,it is construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.id.at frost ex rel.anderson whitbeck,if terms in an insurance policy are ambiguous,they should be construed against the insurance company that drafted the policy.danbeck,at.
this last principle,however,generally does not apply where the policy in question is a standard fidelity or bankers blanket bond,drafted by representatives from both the banking and insurance industries.tri city bank fed.ins,citing state bank of viroqua capitol indem,these bonds are not the usual contracts of adhesion and the familiar rule of interpreting a contract strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured should not apply.sharp fed.sav.loan ins,cir the principle that insurance contracts are to be construed against the underwriter does not apply when the contract was in fact a joint effort of both insurers and the insureds.as best we can tell,the language of the cincinnati bond appears to not an older version of the standard bankers blanket bond.accordingly,any ambiguity in language unique to the cincinnati bond may be resolved by reference to the general practice of construing ambiguities against the and in favor of coverage.
a brief history of the standard bankers blanket bond is in order.the surety association of america drafted the first american bankers blanket bond in.edward gallagher,a concise history of standard form,edition,in annotated financial institution bond,michael keeley,ed.by the bond had undergone several input from the american bankers association and other trade was termed the bankers blanket bond,standard form.broeman,an overview of the financial institution bond,supra,at gallagher,a concise history,supra,at.additional revisions were made over the years,and beginning with the revision,the bond was renamed the financial institution bond,standard form.gallagher,a concise history,supra,at.the standard bond contains six insuring agreements insuring agreements which cover the insured financial institution against loss arising from specified dishonest,fraudulent,or criminal acts.broeman,an overview of the financial institution bond,supra,at.
because there are several revisions of the bond in circulation,courts initially ought to determine which version,if any,the policy in question adopts case law interpreting one revision may be unhelpful or even irrelevant to the task of interpreting another.the language of the cincinnati bond is not entirely consistent with the standard bond version,the revision,in use at the time it was issued.for example,the cincinnati bond adds eight insuring agreements to the standard bond six,covering such additional risks as directors and officers expenses in defending suits,all risk safe deposit box,and audit expense.insuring agreement e,at issue here,is called all risk forgery and most closely resembles insuring agreement e as it appeared in the and revisions of the standard bond,though it does not precisely track the language of either of these versions.
as noted above,insuring agreement e in the cincinnati bond covers loss by reason of the insured having in good faith and in the usual course of business extended any credit or assumed any liability or otherwise acted upon any security,document,or other written instrument which proves to have been a forgery or to have been altered or raised or counterfeit.cincinnati argues that the in good faith and in the usual course of business language imposes a duty on the bank to follow sound banking practices in connection with the events underlying the claim,and that this is a condition for coverage.we disagree.although we interpret the policy as a whole,to interpret in good faith and in the usual course of business as together imposing a prerequisite normative standard of banking conduct ignores the independent meaning of each phrase.rabinovitz travelers ins,some meaning must be given to each sentence,phrase,and word used,and when this may fairly and properly be done,no part of the language used can be rejected as superfluous or unmeaning.
neither phrase is defined by the policy,but the bank points to section of the wisconsin statutes,adopting the ucc definition of good faith as honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.we have stated that good faith usually establishes a subjective standard,and pointed out that m any negligent acts are committed with pure hearts and empty heads.state bank of the lakes.bankers sur,cir.cincinnati asserts there are material issues of fact regarding whether the bank was selectively ignorant in extending credit to kust however,its corporate designee conceded that bank employees acted honestly and in good faith,with no knowledge of kust fraudulent scheme we hold the requirement does not impose a sound business practices prerequisite to coverage.
this leaves the question of whether the phrase in the usual course of business means consistent with sound business practices or otherwise imposes a particular standard of conduct on the bank for its loss to be covered.on its face,the phrase does not suggest a duty of care but,rather,a certain category of,those usually conducted in the banking business.because the language of the cincinnati bond is not standard in this respect case law provides little guidance.however,wisconsin courts that have addressed this phrase in other contexts have understood it to mean actions normally taken by a bank.fid.deposit of peoples exch.bank of thorp,the check here was complete and regular on its face and,so far as the bank was concerned,it had no notice of any infirmity in it or any defect in the title of the person cashing it,and took it in the usual course of business.banking comm first.bank of milwaukee,the usual course of business upon a bank loan is to credit the account of the borrowing customer and respond to checks.
this is the interpretation the district court adopted in its opinion,and we agree.because the bank acted upon the kinds of documents that it would normally act upon in its business,such as leases,checks,securities,rather than documents outside that usual course,the bank acted in the usual course of business fid.deposit of,at.
cincinnati also argues that insuring agreement e covers only losses directly caused by forgery and not losses arising from loans made on forged documents describing nonexistent assets or transactions.here,cincinnati argues,the forged signatures on the leases did not directly cause the bank loss,the absence of collateral did.this argument ignores the plain language of insuring agreement e,which covers loss by reason of the insured having in good faith and in the usual course of business extended any credit or otherwise acted upon any document which proves to have been a forgery.the bank loss easily comes within this language the bank sustained a loss because it extended credit to west town based on vehicle leases which proved to be forgeries.
insuring agreement d in the cincinnati bond,entitled forgery,alteration and unauthorized signatures,covers among other things loss resulting directly from forgery or alteration of,on or in any negotiable instrument,acceptance,withdrawal order,receipt for the withdrawal of property,certificate of deposit or letter of credit.insuring agreements d and e thus cover similar and potentially overlapping categories of loss,but the language of each is distinct the former covers loss resulting directly from the forgery or alteration of certain documents,the latter covers loss by reason of the bank having extended any credit or otherwise acted upon a document which proves to have been a forgery.the coverage granted in insuring agreement e does not simply duplicate the coverage granted in insuring agreement d cincinnati interpretation essentially conflates the two.
cincinnati asserts that courts have overwhelmingly held that insuring agreement e does not cover losses from loans based on forged documents describing fictitious transactions or assets.this is not true.of the cases cincinnati c
