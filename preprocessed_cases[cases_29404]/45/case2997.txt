these cases represent another chapter in,or more precisely a sequel to,the protracted dispute between the city and county of san francisco city and plaintiffs peter bullock and elke schlosser,concerning bullock efforts to convert the abigail hotel,formerly a residential hotel,into a hotel for tourists and city visitors.plaintiffs brought this action to require certain liability insurers to absorb costs plaintiffs incurred in defending an action the city brought against them in.the trial court entered judgments on demurrer in favor of defendants liberty national fire insurance and maryland casualty,and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants american guaranty liability insurance,fireman fund insurance,and western heritage insurance.we will affirm the judgments.
background 
related matters have been before us on at least three prior occasions.in bullock city and county of san francisco d.bullock i,we reviewed certain orders made in an action brought by bullock against the city,as well as orders made in an action brought by the city against bullock in october the underlying action here,discussed in more detail below.we referred to an earlier,unpublished decision setting aside the dismissal of yet another action by plaintiffs,or persons associated with them,against the city.id.at,fn.however,in city and county of san francisco bullock,review denied and opinion ordered nonpublished february,we affirmed the ultimate dismissal of plaintiffs claims.
in this action plaintiffs seek to recover costs of defense they incurred in the city action against them,parts of which were before us in bullock i.in its complaint in that action,a copy of which was incorporated by reference in the complaint here,the city alleged as follows the abigail hotel contained tourist units and residential units regulated by the city residential hotel conversion and demolition ordinance see san francisco ord,added in san francisco ord,added in the ordinance.the ordinance imposed restrictions on the rental of residential units to persons other than permanent residents.for at least six years preceding the filing of the complaint,plaintiffs violated these restrictions,renting too many residential units to persons other than permanent residents.from late to mid,plaintiffs acted under a preliminary injunction that permitted plaintiffs to rent all of the hotel vacant rooms to tourists.however,on july,the superior court dissolved the injunction and denied plaintiffs any exemption from the terms of the ordinance.
based on these allegations the city asserted five causes of action that by the conduct described above,and also by failing to post certain required notices and reports and maintain certain daily logs,plaintiffs were violating the ordinance that by offering advertising the premises for use as a tourist hotel,plaintiffs were violating the city planning code planning code that plaintiffs violations of the planning code and the ordinance were a public nuisance,abatement of which was authorized by state and municipal laws that plaintiffs conduct constituted unfair and unlawful business practices under business and professions code section et and that plaintiffs conduct warranted the imposition of various civil penalties under the planning code,the ordinance,and business and professions code section.
the city prayed for preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting plaintiffs from renting residential units to nonresidential renters in violation of the ordinance injunctions against violating the posting and provisions of the ordinance injunctions against violating the planning code restrictions on tourist hotels injunctions against,and abatement of,the public nuisances presented by the premises appointment of a receiver under business and professions code section to take over management and control of the premises in order to prevent continuing unfair practices civil penalties of per day under the planning code civil penalties of per day per violation of the ordinance civil penalties of per violation under the business and professions code costs and attorneys fees and such further and other relief as the court deems just.
the city apparently dismissed its complaint on or about october.two years years after the city filed its brought this action against insurance companies they alleged had sold them liability insurance during the period of at least to.plaintiffs alleged that they had tendered the defense of the city action separately to each defendant,but each defendant refused to defend the action and denied coverage,and that each defendant repeated that refusal when plaintiffs asked them to reconsider.plaintiffs further alleged that defendants failed to fully and fairly investigate the renewed tender of defense,and that s ome defendants failed to respond in a timely manner.
based on these allegations,plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract,bad faith,and fraud.the five defendants now before us challenged the complaint by general demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings.the trial court sustained each of these challenges,reciting in all but one case that the orders were made without leave to amend.the one exception was silent as to leave to amend,but the court thereafter entered judgment on that order,as on the others.plaintiffs filed three timely appeals.
discussion 
compliance.introduction.
plaintiffs contend that the city complaint exposed them to potential liability for damages because it implicitly sought to compel their compliance with provisions of the ordinance requiring them to incur or pay what plaintiffs refer to as mitigation costs.in particular they cite former section of the ordinance,which requires that any owner seeking to convert a hotel to nonresidential use must,as a condition of the required conversion permit,provide or pay for housing to replace the units that will be removed from the residential market.ibid.plaintiffs also cite provisions making it unlawful to change the use of a unit,or eliminate or convert a unit,without a conversion permit,and empowering the superintendent of building inspection to institute a civil proceeding for injunctive relief in response to any action unlawful under this chapter.ordinance,subds.a and e.
plaintiffs contend that these provisions bring the city complaint within the rationale of aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu,where the supreme court held that comprehensive general liability cgl policies,materially similar to those at issue here,could be reasonably understood to cover toxic cleanup costs imposed in litigation under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act et and related state and federal laws.the city claim against plaintiffs,however,differs in several critical respects from those before the court in aiu.
the insured in aiu sought to establish coverage with respect to a number of suits by public agencies alleging that the insured was responsible for the contamination of certain waste disposal sites.the agencies sought injunctions to prevent further contamination and to require the cleanup of contamination already caused,plus reimbursement of the agencies costs of investigating,monitoring,and initiating cleanup of hazardous waste for which the insured allegedly is responsible.aiu,supra,cal d at.the supreme court concluded that the monetary reimbursement sought by the agencies response costs could fall within the reasonable expectations of an insured as to what constitutes damages.id.at.the court further held that cleanup costs incurred by an insured under compulsion of an injunction could also be covered,primarily because they appeared to be the functional equivalent of reimbursing costs,and an insured would not expect coverage to depend on the prosecuting agency fortuitous choice of remedies.id.at.
in seeking to apply this holding to the present case,plaintiffs focus almost exclusively on the supposed mitigative nature of the remedy at issue in aiu,arguing that the city action exposed them to similar mitigative measures.quoting our own opinion in bullock i,plaintiffs assert that section operates to mitigat e the adverse impact on the persons who will be displaced by plaintiff conversion bullock i,supra,d at,and that their exposure to the imposition of such mitigation costs makes the city suit indistinguishable from the actions considered in aiu.we reject this contention,first because plaintiffs have failed to allege,and apparently can not allege,that they were in danger of being legally obligated to incur the mitigation expenses in question,and second because those expenses are not comparable to the remedies held in aiu to be the equivalent of damages.
legally obligated to pay.
plaintiffs exclusive emphasis on the supposed mitigative character of the expenses at issue overlooks a critical part of the aiu analysis.the court there declared that the question of coverage turned on three subsidiary questions whether an adverse order in the underlying suits would legally obligate the insured to pay cleanup costs whether the costs would constitute damages under the terms of the policies,and whether the costs would be incurred because of property damage.aiu,supra,cal d at.only if all three conditions are fulfilled,the court wrote,will the insurers duty to provide coverage arise under the policies.ibid.in other words,it is not enough that a claimant seeks to exact by some means a payment that might serve the function of damages.the lawsuit must expose the insured to the possibility of being legally obligated to make such payments.in aiu this obligation was in little doubt the underlying suits expressly sought judgments or court orders compelling the insured to pay or incur the expenses at issue.see id.at.the only point of controversy was whether the phrase legally obligated extended to payments compelled by equitable remedies,such as injunctive or specific relief,as distinguished from the quintessentially legal remedy of a judgment for damages.ibid.not surprisingly,the court found the distinction inadequate to defeat coverage.id.at.
here the insureds face a difficulty not present in aiu,because it does not appear that an order obligating plaintiffs to pay or incur mitigation costs either was sought,or could have been made.apart from some correspondence outside the complaint,which we discuss below,plaintiffs have offered no reason to suspect that the city ever contemplated seeking a judgment requiring plaintiffs to comply with section.so far as the pleadings and the terms of the ordinance show,the city lacked the authority to obtain such relief,and made no attempt to seek it.
nothing in the city complaint suggests the possibility of an order compelling compliance with section.the city did not pray for an award of in lieu fees nor did it seek an injunction compelling plaintiffs to construct,acquire,or otherwise provide substitute housing,as contemplated by section.instead the city prayed for injunctions prohibiting violations of the ordinance and abating the public nuisances allegedly arising from those violations,appointment of a receiver,and civil penalties.
nor does it appear that the ordinance authorized the city to seek,or a court to issue,the mandatory mitigative relief on which plaintiffs argument depends.the ordinance specifically authorized city officials to recover civil penalties in specified amounts for such infractions as insufficient filing or failing to post and submit certain required reports ordinance,subds.d e,subd.d recover a civil penalty for unlawful conversion,consisting of three times the daily rate per day,not to exceed ordinance,subd.c and obtain injunctive relief,implicitly against any action unlawful under this chapter ordinance,subd.e.in addition,the ordinance provided that any permanent resident injured by any action unlawful under this chapter could bring an action for injunctive relief and damages.ordinance,subd.e,italics added.the ordinance did not authorize the city to recover damages of any kind,and it did not authorize anyone to obtain any kind of relief mandating compliance with section.the specific enumeration of some remedies while not mentioning others strongly implies that the excluded forms of relief are not in fact available.see,fair employment housing com.cal d,applying maxim expressio unius exclusio alterius est,to express one thing is to exclude another.
section itself contains no remedial terms it provides for no relief in the legal sense at all.rather it prescribes conditions under which a permit may be issued.the only apparent effect of failure to satisfy these conditions is that no permit will issue,and the owner will be prohibited by the ordinance from engaging in the regulated notably,renting residential rooms to nonresidential occupants.an owner subject to the permit requirement may choose either to comply with the condition,refrain from the regulated conduct,or as plaintiffs did engage in the regulated conduct without a permit,thereby violating the ordinance.in none of these situations does that person become legally obligated to pay the costs of complying with section.he or she remains legally free not to pay them.section imposes on hotel owners no legal obligat ion whatsoever.by its plain terms it imposes only a condition on a permit required under the ordinance to engage in specified activities.
rather than discuss the actual text of the ordinance,or its logical effect,plaintiffs cite our opinion in bullock i for the proposition that b y its complaint,the city sought to compel bullock compliance with section.the short answer to that assertion is that compulsion comes in many forms,only one of which legal obligat ion triggers coverage under defendants policies.in bullock i we were concerned only with the validity of the ordinance insofar as it interfered with plaintiffs right under state law to go out of the residential hotel business,quoted in bullock i,supra,d at.we held in effect that section imposed an undue burden on that right,and was preempted.id.at.we had no occasion to decide,and did not even contemplate,the distinctions relevant to the issue now before us.even so,our analysis there is explicitly consistent with those distinctions.we wrote that section conditions issuance of a permit to convert on the owner either furnishing comparable units or making a substantial in lieu payment d at,italics added,and that the city sought to condition plaintiff departure from the residential hotel business upon the payment of ransom id.at.
our vivid description of the act contemplated by the condition does nothing to alter the fact that a conditional regulatory imposition simply is not,without more,a legal obligation to pay.the city may well have intended,as plaintiffs asserted below,to coerce compliance with section by enjoining bullock in his operation of the hotel until he complied with those provisions.alternatively,the city may have hoped to prevent the removal of plaintiffs hotel from the residential housing market.in either case,the city made no apparent effort to legally obligate plaintiffs to pay the expenses or undertake the acts described in section.the coercive tool the only tool the ordinance appeared to a traditional prohibitory injunction barring plaintiffs,on pain of contempt,from continuing to rent rooms to nonresidents without a permit.such an injunction would not become the equivalent of damages merely because it would compel plaintiffs to choose,on pain of contempt,between complying with the conditions of a permit and refraining from conduct requiring a permit.
we are satisfied that neither the city complaint nor the terms of the ordinance suggest any potential for making plaintiffs legally obligated to pay the costs contemplated by section.
c.the letters.
plaintiffs contend somewhat obliquely that whether or not the city was entitled to obtain a judgment compelling compliance with section,the city sought such a judgment,or threatened to do so,thereby triggering a duty to defend.this suggestion tacitly invokes the principle that a liability insurer may not decline to defend a suit merely because it is devoid of merit.montrose i,supra,cal th at,d.however,the principle does not apply here because the city in fact never asserted the meritless claim in question.
as evidence to the contrary,plaintiffs refer to letters and a notice t
