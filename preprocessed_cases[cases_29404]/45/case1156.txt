plaintiff,carollton darland darland,appeals from the district court judgment granting defendant,fortis benefits insurance company fortis,motion for affirmation of its decision denying continued long ltd benefits for darland granting summary judgment on fortis counterclaim against darland for reimbursement of an overpayment of ltd benefits and denying darland motion for summary judgment seeking to recover ltd benefits and dismissing his claim under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.specifically,the district court concluded that fortis did not abuse its discretion in determining that darland ltd benefits under its policy were limited to a period of months,finding that darland disabling condition did not prevent him from performing all the material duties of his job so as to qualify for continued ltd benefits.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court order granting fortis counterclaim for reimbursement,reverse that portion of the district court order affirming fortis denial of continued ltd benefits to darland and denying summary judgment to darland for the same,and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
procedural history 
this action arises from darland claim that he was entitled to recover continued ltd benefits,pursuant to an employee welfare benefit plan,maintained by his employer,market finders insurance corporation market finders.while employed by market finders,darland elected to participate in its employee welfare benefit plan,which is governed by erisa,and the ltd policy available as part of the plan.fortis,as the plan insurance carrier for market finders,provides the plan ltd benefits darland claims that he is totally and permanently disabled due to degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis in his back.from october,through august,fortis paid darland monthly disability benefits.however,the ltd policy contained a special conditions provision limiting the payment of ltd benefits to a maximum period of months for certain disabling conditions.while fortis eventually conceded that darland was exempt from the special conditions provision of the policy because his disabling condition resulted from arthritis,it denied darland claim for continued disability benefits on the ground that he failed to satisfy the occupation test as defined in the policy because his disability did not prevent him from performing the material duties of his regular occupation.consequently,darland filed a complaint in jefferson circuit court in kentucky on june,including a claim for benefits under erisa.fortis timely removed the action to federal court.after the parties exchanged initial disclosures,fortis filed its motion for affirmation and for summary judgment.darland countered with his own motion for summary judgment.on march,the district court entered a memorandum opinion and order granting fortis motion for affirmation and summary judgment and denying darland for summary judgment.on the same date,the district court entered a judgment in favor of fortis,dismissing darland case with prejudice and assessing costs against him.from this judgment,darland filed a timely appeal on june.thereafter,in an order of clarification issued on july,the district court stated that its march,memorandum opinion and order also granted summary judgment in favor of fortis on its counterclaim for reimbursement of an overpayment of insurance benefits and that the total award on its counterclaim is.

at emphasis added.
darland complained of chronic back problems for many years.on february,he was treated by raymond shea,an orthopedic surgeon in louisville,kentucky.since then,darland has continued under shea care.on his initial visit,shea obtained,which revealed degenerative disc disease in darland low back at levels and at and.at.upon shea advice,darland underwent epidural injections by elmer dunbar at columbia audubon hospital in louisville,kentucky on february,february,and march.during this time,darland was unable to work for approximately one month,although he attempted to return to work,despite shea observation that his prognosis was poor.
darland continued to be seen by shea on march,april,and july,and was referred to a neurological surgeon,john guarnaschelli of louisville imaging services,for a second opinion.after obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging mri of darland lumbar spine,david petruska of louisville imaging services met with him on august,to report that based upon the results of his mri scan,there was evidence of multilevel lumbar degenerative disc disease,thus confirming shea diagnosis regarding darland low back problems.at.
after july,darland was not able to return to work at market finders because of his continued low back problems.following shea recommendation,darland applied for ltd benefits on september,claiming that he was disabled due to degenerative disc disease.in support of darland claim,shea completed and submitted to fortis an attending physician statement.according to shea records,darland back problem extended throughout his spine and caused him severe pain,stiffness and limited movement of his neck and back.darland also suffered from dizziness and drowsiness from taking many powerful medications.thus,according to shea,darland could not perform in his position as an executive due to his physical limitations and to his inability to think and concentrate as a result of the physical pain and the effect of his medications.
from october,through august,fortis,as the disability insurance carrier for market finders,paid darland monthly disability benefits in the amount of.while fortis was paying the monthly ltd benefits to darland,it also continued to gather information about darland to assess his medical condition and his eligibility for continued ltd benefits based upon the policy.at fortis request,darland appeared for an independent medical evaluation performed by ellen ballard of rehabilitation associates,of louisville,kentucky in february of.in her evaluation,ballard states in part 
at the present time,i feel that the patient has had appropriate treatment to date and i do feel that darland current condition is one that would be aggravated by prolonged sitting and standing.i do think that it is somewhat unusual that darland has the amount of difficulty he does given that he is an executive and people with similar conditions often do not have difficulty continuing to be employed 
i feel that it is possible that he might benefit from a pain program,but it is obvious from some of his questions that there is a possible issue of motivation in terms of his return to work.he has not been maintaining contact with his company and it would appear that he has accepted his disability and does not feel that he can return to work.therefore,the prognosis for this patient condition overall improving is somewhat poor.he might benefit from evaluation at a pain treatment center.
at emphasis added.
thereafter,on july,fortis sent a letter to darland informing him that his disabling condition was subject to a policy limitation that restricted disability benefits to a period of months.the special conditions provision of the policy limiting the payment of ltd benefits to a maximum period of months for certain disabling conditions provides as follows 
special conditions 
we pay only a limited benefit for periods of disability for special conditions.the maximum benefit period for all such periods of disability is months.this is not a separate maximum for each such condition,or for each period of disability,but a combined maximum for all periods of disability and for all of these conditions.
at.the ltd policy defines special conditions,in relevant part,as follows 
special conditions means 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders of the neck and back including any disease or disorder of the cervical thoracic and lumbosacral back and its surrounding soft tissue including sprains and strains of joints and adjacent muscles,except 
at.by a letter dated august,darland challenged fortis attempt to limit his payment of future disability benefits,claiming that the special conditions provision did not appear in his copy of fortis policy and that shea diagnosis indicated that he suffered from an arthritic condition that avoided the special conditions provision.in support,darland provided fortis with a copy of shea letter dated august,noting that darland has been treated for arthritis for many years and this has been the cause of his permanent medical impairment.at.
thereafter,fortis began to examine whether darland claim for arthritis exempted him from the special conditions provision of the policy so as to entitle him to ltd benefits beyond the month period.specifically,fortis clinical service department reviewed darland file to evaluate his claim that arthritis caused his alleged disability.in a report on october,fortis clinical service department states 
while degenerative disease of the spine can involve the apophyseal joint,intervertebral discs,paraspinous ligaments,the term osteoarthritis of the spine should be reserved for degeneration of the apophyseal joints true diathrodial joints 
a diagnosis of spinal arthritis is equivocal at best.there is no radiographic evidence to support it as a primary diagnosis no indication of osteophytic spurring sclerosis,changes in the bony contours or degeneration of the apophyseal joints.
while it is true that the severity of symptoms often bears little relation to the radiologic findings,darland disabling diagnosis has consistently been listed as degenerative disc disease and his treatment has been targeted in that way.though conservative therapy,the use of a tens unit,analgesic and medications are indicated both for ddd degenerative disc disease and arthritis,the use of epidermal steroid injections like those prescribed for the claimant are not used to treat arthritis of the spine.intra or periarticular steroid injections may produce marked symptomatic relief,but that it is not the type of steroid injection darland received.
conclusion 
though the claimant may also have arthritis of the spine,his primary and disabling diagnosis is degenerative disc disease.

shea wrote a letter on october,to fortis clinical service department reiterating that darland suffered from both degenerative disc disease and degenerative osteoarthritis of both the lumbosacral and cervical spine.at.by way of letter dated october,fortis indicated to darland that it had written to shea for a clarification of what it considered to be conflicting information.at.in a letter to darland dated october,fortis informed him that it would take the matter under advisement.
fortis then submitted darland file to its medical director,polly galbraith,for further review.galbraith agreed with fortis clinical service department that there was no objective evidence that darland alleged disabling condition was caused by arthritis.in addition,galbraith did not find conclusive proof that darland alleged disability limited him from performing his job.under fortis policy,disability or disabled is defined as follows 
disability or disabled means that in a particular month,you satisfy either the occupation test or the earnings test,as described below.you may satisfy both the occupation test and earnings test,but you need only satisfy one test to be considered disabled.
at emphasis in original.the occupation test is defined,in pertinent part,as follows 
occupation test 
if you are a covered person in class ii 
during a period of disability including the qualifying period,an injury,sickness,or pregnancy requires that you be under the regular care and attendance of a doctor,and prevents you from performing at least one of the material duties of your regular occupation.
at emphasis in original.material duties are defined in the following terms 
material duties means the sets of tasks or skills required generally be sic employers from those engaged in a particular occupation.one material duty of your regular occupation is the ability to work for an employer on a basis as defined in the policy.
at.means working at least hours per week,unless indicated otherwise in the policy.at.on the basis of the occupation test,galbraith stated that she did not find conclusive proof that darland could not perform all the material duties of his position.
fortis then sent darland a letter dated december,informing him that it had not changed its position that his disabling condition did not fall within the arthritis exception to the special conditions provision of the policy,and that his ltd benefits were thus limited to a period of months under the policy.the letter also advised darland of his right to appeal fortis decision denying him continued ltd benefits.in the letter,fortis,after noting that darland suffered from some other limiting medical conditions,also requested a complete list of darland physicians and the name of his pharmacy.
darland responded to fortis request for information about his doctors and pharmacy in a handwritten letter dated january,formally asking for reconsideration of its decision to enforce the special conditions provision of the ltd policy.in addition,darland provided fortis with another letter written by shea on december,stating,this patient is permanently and totally disabled because of osteoarthritis throughout his cervical and lumbosacral spine.he will not return to any type of gainful employment.at.darland also provided fortis with a december,report prepared by shea explaining his disabling condition.on january,fortis wrote darland acknowledging receipt of his request for an appeal.
fortis then investigated the matter further.at fortis request,darland was referred to affinity rehabilitation,of louisville,kentucky for a functional capabilities evaluation.in its report about darland functional capabilities,affinity rehabilitation stated in pertinent part 
evaluation results 
the actual test results indicate that darland is incapable of performing work today.in part due to his inability to do any lifting from below knee level and his decreased standing duration.i have enclosed the fce form showing these results.
blankenship system behavioral profile 
darland did not exhibit symptom exaggeration,inappropriate illness behavior and he passed of his validity criteria giving him a valid validity profile.
therefore,the results of this evaluation are considered valid and do indicate maximal effort.
in a letter dated march,fortis acknowledged that darland had provided it with records from his doctors and pharmacy,and that he had attended the functional capabilities evaluation.in the letter,the fortis representative also stated that his file had been forwarded to its director of clinical services for further review.as requested by fortis,shea continued to provide fortis with disability statements.in a letter dated april,shea restated that darland disability was based upon osteoarthritis and degenerative disc disease.at.upon receipt of darland additional medical records and the results of his functional capabilities evaluation,fortis resubmitted darland file to its medical director and other management personnel for review and so advised darland.fortis then wrote to darland on april,advising him of its decision to uphold its previous decision enforcing the special conditions provision.in pertinent part,the letter states 
the results of this review indicates that there is no documentation of an arthritis condition despite shea statement amending his original diagnosis from degenerative disc disease to osteoarthritis.shea office was contacted in regards to his records.it was confirmed that there has never been an evaluation for arthritis such as sed rate,rana or rheumatoid factor.there appears to be no radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis nor is such demonstrated on the mris.therefore,we have no documentation that would cause a reversal of our original determination to impose the special conditions provision of your contract.
in response,darland asserted that the special conditions provision did not apply to him because it did not appear in the market finder copy of the ltd policy until after the commencement of his disability.fortis,however,maintained that the special conditions provision was added to market finders policy at darland own request to decrease his insurance rates.specifically,in a letter to fortis dated april,darland states p lease issue our may,renewal per the changes we discussed in our march,meeting.at.thus,fortis denied darland appeal inasmuch as the special conditions provision was part of the market finders policy at the time that darland alleged a disability on july.
by a letter dated may,darland again appealed fortis decision denying his request for continued ltd benefits,providing fortis with additional copies of letters from shea,as well as laboratory test data from david newstadt,a rheumatologist involved in his care.fortis acknowledged receipt of darland request to appeal its decision in a letter dated june.
in the meantime,fortis requested that darland apply for social security disability benefits.thereafter,on july,the social security administration granted darland application for disability benefits,finding in pertinent part that he suffered from degenerative disc disease,osteoarthritis,bone spurs,hiatal hernia,and coronary artery disease,that he was totally disabled as of july,and that there are no jobs existing in significant numbers which he can perform.at.
thereafter,in letters dated july,and august,fortis advised darland that it was still considering his request for continued ltd benefits under the policy.subsequently,fortis contacted network medical review company to convene an independent peer review panel to issue a report about darland case.constituting the peer review panel were robert petrie,a physiatrist saad,a physician of occupational medicine and paul anderson,a cardiologist.none of these doctors personally evaluated darland.
the peer review panel found in fortis favor in a report issued on september.in pertinent part,robert petrie states 
darland has remained active despite the fact his back pain has reportedly been present for most of his life.an april,note from shay sic stated,has continued pain and stiffness in the back.stayed on cataflam and restoril,return in two months.he will play golf.the next month,on september,he returned to shay sic,and the note reported,has much less pain.he is applying for ssi,two different insurance.no surgery is indicated.in other words,as of august,he was reportedly capable of playing golf.on september,he reportedly had less pain,but ironically was applying for disability benefits.there is no indication in the record that his condition had objectively changed between august and september.
in summary,darland is a gentlemen with mild degenerative disk disease evident on.the findings are consistent with an individual of this particular age.such radiologic changes are not an established known cause of pain,and they have been slowly progressive over darland lifetime.as recently as,darland was capable of playing golf,an activity which requires considerable flexibility and rapid movement.there is insufficient objective evidence of darland having a neuromuscular impairment with his reported normal reflexes,normal sensation,no atrophy,and no dermatomal sensory deficits or emg changes.
at.petrie thus concluded there is no reason why he could not perform his own occupation,and he possesses the ability to pursue other forms of gainful employment as well.at,who provided the physical medicine and rehabilitation assessment,stated in pertinent part 
after a thorough review of the medical records,darland diagnosis is chronic low back pain from degenerative disk disease.he reports that his discomfort has gotten worse since.darland job description is work and individuals with similar conditions do not have difficulty continuing this kind of employment.
darland appears to exaggerate his symptoms,and has the ability to be employed full time in his previous job.he is not a surgical candidate and will not benefit from any kind of therapy,including pain management.
there is no documentation in the medical records of arthritis,other than degenerative disk disease.this is a common problem in the normal population.darland is capable of performing light work duties,if he so desires.
at.as for the cardiology assessment,anderson noted in pertinent part that darland has a number of significant medical problems particularly related to degenerative arthritis and neurosensory hearing loss.at.
based upon the findings of the peer review panel,fortis,through its disability specialist,brenda smith,informed darland,in a letter dated september,that his request for continued ltd benefits was once again denied.in pertinent part,the letter states 
the results of the peer reviews indicates there is insufficient objective evidence of physical impairment which would prevent you from performing your occupational activities as an executive.therefore,the report supports our assessment that you are not limited from performing the material duties of your occupation.
at.the letter also acknowledges that t here is no documentation in your records of arthritis of any clinical significance other than degenerative.id.applying the occupation test as defined in the policy,fortis concluded that darland did not suffer from a disability that prevented him from performing at least one of the material duties of your regular occupation.id.
in the september,letter,fortis also informed darland that it had overpaid him beginning on january,when he started to receive his social security disability award in the amount of per month.fortis thus requested that darland reimburse it for the overpayment.
darland appealed,seeking review of fortis decision requesting reimbursement for the overpayment and its finding that he was not prevented from performing all the material duties of his occupation.in a letter dated november,darland expressed his strong disagreement with fortis conclusion that he did not qualify for continued ltd benefits under the policy,attaching additional documentation which supports my disability and suggests that i not only can not perform one task of my previous job,but in fact can not perform the majority of them.at.on november,fortis sent darland a letter acknowledging receipt of his request for another appeal and advising him that his file would again be reviewed and evaluated.in a letter dated december,fortis informed darland that his claim was being scheduled for review in an upcoming appeal committee hearing.thereafter,fortis notified darland in a letter on january,that his appeal would be heard on january.at the january,hearing,the appeal committee concluded that additional peer review was needed to address the issue of osteoarthritis degenerative disc disease and the main cause of pain in this particular claimant.at.
fortis again arranged with network medical review company to establish a second peer review panel.the second peer review panel consisted of richard silver,who was in orthopedic surgery david stadnick,in internal medicine and rheumatology and saad,who sat on the initial peer review panel providing the physical medicine and rehabilitation assessment.again,none of these doctors personally evaluated darland.
the peer review panel,once again,found in fortis favor.in his orthopedic assessment,silver noted that darland had o steoarthritis of the cervical lumbosacral spine,with r adiographic studies indicat ing that his facet joints are minimally involved.nonetheless,silver found 
records support that darland is capable of performing his usual duties as an executive,which are primarily sedentary in nature,even with frequent travel trips and conventions where he would stand for periods of time that exceeded more than an hour.in his specific activities,he should require frequent position changes so that he could sit,stand,or walk a minimum of minutes,maximum of hours for each.even with these modifications,he remains capable of performing the essential functions of his job as an executive.
at.according to silver,darland could return to his normal gainful employment and has been capable of returning to his normal gainful employment for quite some time.at.in his rheumatology assessment,stadnick stated in pertinent part 
as a matter of straight forward sic clinical fact,the symptoms generated by osteoarthritis and by degenerative disk disease are actually quite similar and do overlap to a great degree.it is quite frequently not possible,from a purely clinical perspective,to be able to separate and differentiate symptoms of degenerative disk disease from osteoarthritis of the spine.both conditions will cause pain and stiffness in the affected areas of the spine,as well as limited range of motion.since both conditions can cause similar or identical symptoms,there is also not a clinical differentiation that can be made between these two conditions.such differentiation relies upon other tests such as or an mri for instance.
at.stadnick diagnosed the primary cause of darland pain symptoms from a rheumatology perspective as degenerative spinal disease,which i am using as a combination term including both osteoarthritis of the facet joints and degenerative disk disease.at.however,stadnick found that darland is capable of some time period each day of sedentary activity and that c ertainly watching the television and reading books and walking at home is more or less equivalent to using a computer,reviewing written materials and walking at work.at.finally,after noting that darland degenerative disk disease and facet arthritis present mild impairments,again concluded that darland records support his ability to perform light level work,including the duties of his occupation.at.
based upon the second peer review report,fortis upheld its decision to deny darland request for continued ltd benefits beyond august.in a letter to darland dated february,fortis stated in pertinent part 
while we have reached a determination that your condition would not be subject to the special conditions option of the policy,as further medical opinion indicates that in your case,it is more difficult to cite the distinction between degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis,we still must uphold our denial regarding our determination that you are capable of performing the material duties of your regular occupation of executive vice president,as you have the ability to perform sedentary and even aspects of light duty work.
at.darland thereafter filed suit.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment in an erisa action.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d booker brown williamson tobacco,cir.
on appeal,darland argues that the district court erred in applying an arbitrary and capricious,rather than a de novo,standard of review of fortis determination to discontinue payment of disability benefits to him.in evaluating an administrator or fiduciary interpretation of an plan,the district court applies a de novo standard unless the plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d williams int l paper,cir.if the plan gives such discretionary authority,this court reviews the administrator decision to deny benefits using the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.killian healthsource provident adm rs,cir citing firestone tire rubber,at.
in the case at hand,the language of the policy expressly grants fortis discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe plan terms.specifically,the section of the policy entitled claims provisions states in pertinent part 
we have the sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility for participation or benefits and to interpret the terms of the policy.all determinations and interpretations made by us are conclusive and binding on all parties.
at.thus,this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment to determine if there is any genuine issue of material fact whether the insurance company decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious.killian,at quoting miller metro.life ins,cir.under this deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,this court will uphold a benefit determination if it is rational in light of the plan provisions.yeager reliance standard life ins,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.therefore,w hen it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence,for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.davis kentucky finance.ret.plan,cir internal quotations and citation omitted.
notwithstanding this deferential standard of review,courts must be aware of a possible conflict of interest and consider it as a factor in determining whether the decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious.id.at see also borda hardy,lewis,pollard page,cir noting that the abuse of discretion or arbitrary and capricious standard still applies,but application of the standard should be shaped by the circumstances of the inherent conflict of interest quoting miller,at.as noted by the court in firestone tire rubber,if a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber,at.quoting restatement second of trusts,cmt d.
in this case,we believe that the district court should have considered whether fortis was operating under an apparent conflict of interest when it denied darland claim for continued ltd benefits.as darland points out,this court in killian noted,there is an actual,readily apparent conflict here,not a mere potential for one when the insurance administrator is the insurer that ultimately pays the benefits.killian,at.in this case,fortis ultimate disability determination was based upon the peer review panels selected by network medical review company,which fortis had contracted to assess darland claim as the plan administrator,fortis had a clear incentive to contract with a company whose medical experts were inclined to find in its favor that darland was not entitled to continued ltd benefits.regula delta disability survivorship plan,cir noting the conflict of interest inherent when benefit plans repeatedly hire particular physicians as experts since these experts have a clear incentive to make a finding of not disabled in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.accordingly,the existence of an apparent conflict of interest must be taken into account as a factor in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber,at.davis,at.
taking into consideration fortis apparent conflict of interest in applying the abuse of discretion standard and the weight of the evidence considered by the district court,we conclude that the district court erred in denying darland motion for summary judgment seeking to recover continued ltd benefits and granting fortis motion for affirmation because fortis decision denying darland claim for continued ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious.
we note at the outset that although fortis initially denied darland claim for continued ltd benefits on the basis that his disabling condition did not fall within an exemption to the special conditions provision of the policy limiting ltd benefits to months,fortis has conceded that darland degenerative disc disease was indistinguishable from arthritis,thus constituting an exception to the special conditions provision.therefore,to qualify for continued ltd benefits,darland has to satisfy the occupation test,which states that the disability prevents you from performing at least one of the material duties of your regular occupation.in this case,fortis decision to deny continued ltd benefits to darland was based solely upon its determination that his disabling condition did not prevent him from performing all the material duties of his position as an executive of market finders.
it is clear from a review of the records of all the physicians who actually saw and evaluated darland,principally shea,his treating physician,that his disability prevents him from performing at least one of the material duties of his former occupation.as darland points out,courts have reversed a plan administrator decision denying disability benefits where the plan administrator ignored evidence of treating physicians supporting disability.see williams,at finding that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to consider letters of attending physicians supporting the plaintiff claim for disability benefits.according to the records of shea,darland back problem extended throughout his spine and caused him severe pain,stiffness and limited movement of his neck and back.in addition,as a result of taking many strong medications for his back problem,darland suffered from dizziness and drowsiness.thus,shea,found that darland could not perform in his position as an executive due to his physical limitations and to his inability to think and concentrate as a result of the physical pain and the effect of his medication regime.specifically,darland could not stand for long periods of time,which was required when he attended meetings,seminars and conventions.darland also could not sit for prolonged periods of time,which was required by his job.see at listing one of responsibilities of the executive position as having to attend m eetings,seminars and conventions that involve long hours of standing,and having c onsiderable telephone contact with industry and agency personnel thus requir ing many hours of remaining seated.
shea finding that darland could not perform all the material duties of his job was confirmed by ellen ballard,who evaluated darland at fortis request in february of.in her evaluation,ballard found that darland current condition is one that would be aggravated by prolonged sitting and standing,and that the prognosis for this patient condition overall improving is somewhat poor.in addition,darland underwent a functional capabilities evaluation requested by fortis,which also confirmed darland inability to perform some of the tasks associated with his prior occupation,including his inability to stand for a prolonged duration.according to his behavioral profile,darland was not exaggerating his symptoms.moreover,at fortis insistence,darland applied for social security disability benefits.after a review of his medical records,the agency determined that darland was totally disabled,not only from performing the material duties associated with his former vocation,but from performing any gainful employment for which he is reasonably suited by virtue of his age,education and training.
we note that a plan administrator decision denying disability benefits where the social security administration has determined that the applicant was totally disabled has been found to be arbitrary and capricious.for example,in ladd itt,cir,the seventh circuit held that the plan administrator denial of disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious where none of the physicians who examined the plaintiff found that she was capable of working the insurance company encouraged and assisted the plaintiff in applying for social security disability benefits,which were granted after an administrative law judge found that the plaintiff was totally disabled and the plaintiff condition was worse when the plan administrator denied her benefits under the plan than when she was granted social security benefits.in that case,after the plaintiff was awarded social security disability benefits,she was referred by metlife to a doctor who worked for network medical review company,the same company employed by fortis in this case.without examining the plaintiff,the doctor for network medical review concluded in a perfunctory report that ladd had sufficient residual functional capacities to work a full day at a sedentary job.id.at.on appeal,the seventh circuit found that t he grant of social security benefits had additional significance 
it brings the case within the penumbra of the doctrine of judicial if a party wins a suit on one ground,it ca turn around and in further litigation with the same opponent repudiate the ground in order to win a further victory.the doctrine is technically not applicable here,because metlife and itt,the defendants in this suit,were not parties to the proceeding before the social security administration.yet they prevailed there in a practical sense because the grant of social security benefits to ladd reduced the amount of her claim against the employee welfare plan.if we reflect on the purpose of the doctrine,which is to reduce fraud in the legal process by forcing a modicum of consistency on a repeating litigant,we see that its spirit is applicable here.to lighten the cost to the employee welfare plan of ladd disability,the defendants encouraged and supported her effort to demonstrate total disability to the social security administration,going so far as to provide her with legal representation.to further lighten that cost,it then turned around and denied that ladd was totally disabled,even though her condition had meanwhile deteriorated.in effect,having won once the defendants repudiated the basis of their first victory in order to win a second victory.this sequence casts additional doubt on the adequacy of their evaluation of ladd claim,even if it does not provide an independent basis for rejecting that evaluation.
id.at citations omitted.
it is equally inconsistent in the present case for fortis to ignore the social security administration determination that darland is disabled.as in ladd,fortis requested that darland apply for social security disability benefits so as to reduce the amount of monthly disability payments that it paid darland under the plan.although fortis claims that the statutory criteria and factors considered by the social security administration may be markedly different from the criteria and factors considered by an insurer in determining whether a claimant is disabled,it is plainly evident that the social security standard for a disability determination is much more stringent than that required by fortis insurance policy moreover,after the social security administration determined on july,that darland was totally disabled as of july,fortis then requested that darland reimburse it for overpayment of insurance benefits,even though fortis terminated
