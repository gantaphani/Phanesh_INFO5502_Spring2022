background 
charles crovo and others engaged lane powell for legal representation regarding a number of commercial disputes that are unrelated to this matter.as lane powell unpaid invoices for attorney fees accumulated,lane powell and crovo entered into an amended fee arrangement in april of.by way of the arrangement,crovo granted mortgages to lane powell over two properties in massachusetts as security for payment of the fees owed the west tisbury mortgage and the newton mortgage.
there was some discussion between crovo and lane powell regarding the equity on the west tisbury and newton properties,as well as regarding liens on both properties that would be superior to lane powell mortgages.lane powell understood that these superior liens would take priority over its mortgages and accepted the inferior positions.
in august of,lane powell retained a massachusetts firm,coogan law office coogan,to examine title to the west tisbury and newton properties,to assist lane powell with recording a mortgage over each property,and to facilitate the issuance of a lender policy of title insurance for each property in favor of lane powell.for purposes of the tasks requested of coogan,paralegal kate iiams iiams of lane powell,and employees lori pfingst and jennifer cutrer of coogan handled most communications.there was apparently little or no direct dialogue between the attorneys of each firm.
coogan carried out the title searches for each property and reported to lane powell that the west tisbury property was encumbered by a mortgage in favor of ing bank ing mortgage,and the newton property was encumbered by two in favor of jp morgan chase bank chase mortgage and one in favor of raymond green,green mortgage.
on or about september,coogan provided lane powell with a commitment for title insurance west tisbury commitment and a draft title insurance policy for the west tisbury property draft west tisbury policy.the west tisbury commitment identifies the ing mortgage as an encumbrance to be discharged.the draft west tisbury policy,however,does not specifically except the ing mortgage from coverage.
on september,iiams of lane powell wrote coogan to inform him that lane powell did not expect the existing lien of with ing bank to be paid off or released on the west tisbury property.jennifer responded on behalf of coogan that if that mortgage is remaining and the mortgage we are putting on will be in addition to that one then we have to charge the full rate.on september,first american,by way of its agent coogan,issued the west tisbury policy of title insurance west tisbury policy to lane powell.like the west tisbury commitment,the west tisbury policy does not specifically except the ing mortgage from coverage.
coogan never provided lane powell with a commitment for title insurance or a draft policy for the newton property,though it did inform lane powell of the chase and green mortgages that encumbered the newton property when it reported on the results of its title search in august of.on october,lori from coogan wrote iiams from lane powell and asked whether lane powell intended to pay off the chase and green mortgages will this mortgage be paying off any of the outstanding mortgages on the property in order to qualify for a refinance rate.in response,iiams,on behalf of lane powell,confirmed it would not be paying off any existing mortgages on the newton property.on march,coogan relayed to lane powell a policy of title insurance for the newton property newton policy.the chase and green mortgages are not excepted from coverage under the newton policy.
crovo defaulted on his debt to lane powell,as well as on debts owed to ing bank and raymond green,leading the latter two to foreclose on their respective mortgages over the west tisbury and newton properties.lane powell recovered no proceeds from these foreclosures.on october,lane powell notified first american of its claim under the newton policy.first american responded on october,informing lane powell that first american would afford it coverage according to the terms of the newton policy.shortly thereafter,however,on november,first american reneged,and it denied coverage under the newton policy.as to the west tisbury policy,though it remains unclear when exactly the parties discussed the matter,first american denied coverage from the outset.
first american filed for declaratory judgment in massachusetts state court,seeking reformation of the west tisbury and newton policies on grounds of mutual mistake.first american also argued that a clause in the policies,exclusion a,excludes from coverage the mortgages superior to lane powell.the underlying theory is that the true intent of both parties was to except the superior liens from coverage under the policies.the policies do not read this way,first american contends,because of a mere clerical error overlooked by first american when it reduced the policies to writing a simple case of scrivener error.
lane powell removed the action to the district court of massachusetts and discovery ensued.the parties elicited deposition testimony from brian powell powell and john neeleman neeleman,both partners at lane powell,and from iiams.
powell reviewed title to the west tisbury and newton properties in connection with lane powell efforts to record its mortgages and secure title insurance over both properties.powell testified that he was aware that both properties were encumbered by mortgages that would be superior to lane powell.he also understood that,because of lane powell inferior position,its potential to recover proceeds from the foreclosure of superior liens depended on the amount of equity in each property.powell thus conceded that lane powell mortgages would be in junior positions and that foreclosure of the senior liens might result in no recovery for lane powell at all.
neeleman written communications to powell show that he was also aware that lane powell mortgages would be inferior to prior encumbrances on both the west tisbury and newton properties.neeleman also testified,however,that in his mind,the rank of lane powell mortgages in the land registry bore no relation to the title insurance policies.finally,neeleman testified that,upon receiving notice of the foreclosures,he reviewed both title insurance policies and thought it was interesting that they did not except the prior mortgages from coverage.
iiams testified that she was charged with inquiring with coogan as to the price of the newton policy,and that she understood that the policy premium would be higher if lane powell decided not to pay off the prior mortgages.thus,iiams was also aware of the senior mortgages.
lane powell moved for summary judgment on may.lane powell argued that the prior mortgages in question are not excepted from the west tisbury or newton policies,and,as per the letter of the policies,first american must provide it coverage.first american for summary judgment,advancing its theory that despite the letter of
