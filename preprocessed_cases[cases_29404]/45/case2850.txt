this action involves contribution claims among insurers,arising from the settlement of complaints filed after a fatal crane accident.paul mercury insurance company insured bigge crane and rigging company bigge as an additional insured under the liability policy of schuff steel company schuff,which rented the crane from bigge.additionally,frontier pacific insurance company frontier and american international specialty lines insurance company aislic covered bigge under primary and excess policies,respectively.
paul persuasively contends the trial court erred by interpreting ambiguous terms in paul policy against it to cover bigge for its own negligence and strict products liability,as bigge had no objectively reasonable expectation of such coverage.frontier,aislic and bigge persuasively contend the court erred by refusing to allocate fault for the underlying accident between schuff and bigge,since that is the only means of determining whether paul policy is primary to frontier policy for any portion of the settlement.we reverse the november,judgment on paul complaint against frontier,aislic and bigge,and frontier against paul,insofar as it concerns these findings,and remand the matter with instructions.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment.
this case also involves frontier and bigge against schuff for breach of contract and related causes of action,based on schuff alleged failure to obtain the amount of primary insurance for bigge required under the crane lease.frontier and bigge contend the court erred by rendering judgment for schuff.bigge,however,has not shown it was damaged by any breach of contract,and frontier has not shown it is an express third party beneficiary under the lease.accordingly,we affirm the january,judgment for schuff.
factual and procedural background 
in january schuff entered into a bare equipment lease agreement the lease with bigge to rent a crane.schuff was a subcontractor of robert bayley construction,bayley,the general contractor on the fashion valley center fashion valley expansion in san diego,and needed the crane to place steel beams.
paragraph of the lease,titled hold,required schuff to indemnify bigge against claims for injury or death in any way caused by schuff occasioned by the use,maintenance,operation,handling,transportation or storage of the equipment during the rental term.italics added.the provision also required schuff to obtain million in liability insurance to protect bigge from such liability and risk of loss,and to furnish additional insured endorsements making such coverages primary to all other coverages.italics added.
schuff was insured under a commercial general liability cgl and excess liability policy issued by paul.the policy contained an additional protected persons endorsement app endorsement,which provided coverage for injury or damage resulting from schuff maintenance,operation or use of the crane.the endorsement excluded coverage for injury or damage that results from any act or failure to act of bigge,other than the general supervision of work performed for bigge by schuff.
paul also issued a separate endorsement,which named bigge as an additional insured and referred to the fashion valley project,but stated the policy provided coverage to bigge only with respect to liability arising out of schuff operations performed for bigge.the policy had per occurrence limits of million and aggregate,or per project,limits of million,and umbrella coverage of million.the policy limit for any additional insured,however,was not greater than the limits of liability required in the indemnity contract.
schuff provided bigge with a certificate of insurance showing it was an additional insured under the paul policy with respect to schuff rental of a crane from bigge.the certificate described schuff operations as the fashion valley project.
bigge was also a named insured under a cgl policy issued by frontier,with per occurrence and aggregate limits of million,and under an umbrella policy issued by aislic,with limits of million.the aislic policy identifies the frontier policy as the underlying liability insurance.
in june a schuff employee,wayne cvitkovich,was killed when a steel beam fell from the crane and struck him.cvitkovich wife and children sued bigge for negligence,strict products liability and spoliation of evidence.the plaintiffs alleged bigge negligently inspected and maintained the crane,the crane was defective and the load line holding the beam failed allowing the beam to descend while still attached to the line.the cvitkoviches also sued bayley.
additionally,schuff crane operator,dwight bennett,sued bigge for negligence and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.bennett alleged the crane malfunctioned and he sustained injuries when he tried to prevent the steel beam from falling and when schuff employees attacked him after the accident.bennett also named as defendants bayley and schuff,alleging supervisors of those companies illegally ordered him to disconnect the horn on the crane,and thus he was unable to warn ironworkers working below that the steel beam held aloft by the crane was rapidly descend ing down on them.bennett wife joined in the suit and alleged loss of consortium.
another schuff employee,james alvernaz,sued bigge for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress.alvernaz alleged the crane was unsafe and he was standing near cvitkovich when the accident occurred and seriously injured his wrist as he reeled backwards.alvernaz also named as defendants bayley and schuff,alleging their employees ordered bennett to disconnect the crane horn because individuals residing near fashion valley were complaining about the noise level at the construction site.
the three cases were consolidated the underlying litigation.as the plaintiffs employer,schuff was dismissed from the action 
frontier initially defended bigge in the underlying litigation.however,frontier withdrew its defense when paul agreed to participate in bigge defense.frontier and aislic refused to participate in settlement negotiations.
paul filed this action against frontier and bigge for declaratory relief and contribution,seeking a reallocation of any settlement among the insurers paul later added aislic as a defendant.frontier against paul for declaratory relief.additionally,frontier and bigge against schuff for breach of contract and related counts,alleging that if it were determined the paul policy did not cover bigge exposure for its own negligence or strict products liability,or provide million in primary insurance,schuff breached its obligations under the lease.
the court in this case ordered frontier to attend settlement negotiations in the underlying litigation.the plaintiffs accepted a total of for their claims against bigge.of that amount,paul paid and frontier paid.additionally,paul paid a total of for claims against bayley,which was an additional insured under schuff policy.
in this case,paul moved for summary adjudication,seeking a ruling frontier shared in the duty to defend bigge in the underlying litigation.frontier moved for summary judgment on the complaint and its,arguing paul policy was primary to frontier policy,and thus paul had the sole defense obligation and was required to indemnify bigge for the first million paid in settlement of the underlying litigation.aislic moved for summary judgment on the complaint,arguing that as an excess carrier it had no duty to defend bigge.bigge joined in frontier and aislic motions.
the court granted paul motion and denied frontier and aislic motions.the court determined the coverage provisions of the paul policy and additional insured endorsements were ambiguous,and construed them against paul to cover bigge for the negligence of schuff or bigge,plus products liability.however,the court found the indemnity provision in the lease governed whether paul policy was primary to frontier policy.the court ruled that since the indemnity provision obligated schuff to indemnify bigge only for claims arising from schuff negligence,paul policy was primary over frontier policy only to the extent the damage was caused by schuff negligence.
during a bench trial,the court allowed paul to amend its complaint to seek contribution from frontier and aislic for the settlement of the underlying litigation.the court initially intended to allow evidence regarding the comparative fault of schuff and bigge,to determine whether paul policy was primary over frontier policy for any portion of the settlement.however,the court ultimately refused to conduct a trial within a trial.rather,the court presumed percent of the settlement was solely for bigge own negligence or strict products liability,as opposed to including an exposure for schuff negligence on a joint and several basis.the court made the presumption irrebuttable absent evidence the insurers expressly agreed to apportion fault in this action,and there was no such evidence.
the court determined there was a single occurrence or event for all claims arising out of the same accident.the court found paul policy is not primary to frontier policy for any portion of the settlement,based on its presumption the settlement was only for bigge negligence or strict products liability.rather,paul and frontier are bigge insurers and obligated to pay their respective million policy limits.the court found paul and aislic are insurers and each is responsible for of the in excess liability.additionally,the court found paul and frontier each responsible for of bigge defense costs.the court ordered frontier to pay paul the remainder of its policy limit,plus for defense costs,and aislic to pay paul.judgment on paul complaint and frontier was entered on november.
further,on january,the court entered judgment for schuff on frontier and bigge.the court found schuff satisfied the lease by procur ing the requisite insurance coverage for bigge in the underlying litigation and by provid ing the defense and indemnity of bigge.

istandard of review 
when the facts are undisputed,as here,the interpretation of contractual obligations is a purely legal matter subject to our independent review.continental heller amtech mechanical services,th,d.
athe indemnity agreement and bigge expectation of coverage 
paul contends the court erred by interpreting ambiguous coverage terms against it to cover bigge for claims arising from its own negligence or strict products liability.paul asserts the court should have first considered bigge objectively reasonable expectations of coverage,and given the indemnity provision in paragraph of the lease bigge had no such expectation.for reasons explained,we agree.
insurance policies are construed under the same rules that govern the interpretation of other contracts.accordingly,paul policy must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties at the time of contracting,and such intent is ascertained,if possible,from the clear and explicit language of the contract.paul fire marine ins.american dynasty surplus lines ins.th,d american dynasty continental heller amtech mechanical services,supra,th at,d.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.on the other hand,when policy language is ambiguous,rules applicable to resolving ambiguity control.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.
an insurance policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions both of which are reasonable.bay cities paving grading,lawyer mutual ins.cal th,d.coverage provisions must be construed in the context of the policy as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.the proper question is whether the particular phrase is ambiguous in the context of this policy and the circumstance of this case.citation.this question must be answered through the eyes of a reasonable person in the position of the insured.citation.words used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning which a layman would ordinarily attach to them.courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.american dynasty,supra,th at,d.
the app endorsement in paul policy covers bigge for claims arising from schuff negligence and excludes claims arising from bigge acts or omissions.the court presumably found coverage terms ambiguous because paul also issued the endorsement,which refers to the fashion valley project,but covers bigge as an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of schuff ongoing operations performed for bigge.italics added.
the arising out of language has been broadly interpreted in favor of coverage for the additional insured for its own wrongdoing.in acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d syufy,a theater owner hired an electrical contractor to upgrade lighting and temperature controls.the contractor added the owner as an additional insured on its cgl policy,and the endorsement provided the additional coverage was only with respect to liability arising out of the contractor work for that insured by or for the contractor.id.at,d.during construction,one of the contractor employees was injured at the theater when he climbed through a defective roof hatch to leave work.the contractor insurer paid to settle the matter on behalf of the owner,and then filed an equitable contribution action against the owner and the owner excess insurer.
the appellate court affirmed a summary judgment granted in favor of the owner and its insurer,holding that when an insurer grants coverage for liability arising out of the named insured work,the additional insured is covered without regard to whether injury was caused by the named insured or the additional insured.syufy,supra,th at,d.the court explained that california courts have consistently given a broad interpretation to the terms arising out of or arising from in various kinds of insurance provisions.it is settled that this language does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.rather,it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability,and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.id.at,d see also fireman fund ins.atlantic richfield th,d sufficient causal connection to cover insured when employee of insured was injured on owner defective wooden steps while performing work for contractor.
ordinarily,a reasonable layperson would not interpret the endorsement language only with respect to liability arising out of schuff ongoing operations performed for bigge italics added,as embracing schuff operations performed for a third party bayley unrelated to bigge.similar endorsements are issued when,for instance,a named is to perform work at the additional insured owner premises.see,syufy,supra,th at,d fireman fund ins.atlantic richfield,supra,th at,d.however,the endorsement is ambiguous in context because it covers bigge for claims arising from schuff work for bigge,but no such work was contemplated.the meaning of the endorsement can not be ascertained from its plain terms.moreover,the app endorsement and the endorsement can not be reconciled without essentially rendering one or the other superfluous.an ambiguity results when there is contradictory or necessarily inconsistent language in different portions of the instrument delgado heritage life ins.d.smith kandal real estate continental cas.th,d.
in resolving ambiguity,we must first attempt to interpret the ambiguous provision in the sense the insurer believed the insured would reasonably and objectively have understood it when the policy was issued.syufy,supra,th at,d.this rule protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citation.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.the disputed policy language must be examined in context with regard to its intended function in the policy.citations.this requires a consideration of the policy as a whole,the circumstances of the case in which the claim arises and common sense.american dynasty,supra,th at,d,citing bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.
when additional insured endorsements,by their own terms,depend on the existence of a written contract between the named insured and the additional insured,the contract is a significant circumstance in determining the objectively reasonable expectations of the additional insured.this is true whether or not the insurer ever actually read the contract.american dynasty,supra,th at,d.
the endorsement and the certificate of insurance refer to schuff fashion valley project.further,the certificate of insurance notes bigge was an additional insured with respect to schuff rental of the crane for the fashion valley project.additionally,the app endorsement covers bigge as an organization you schuff are required in a written contract to show as an additional protected person.italics added.frontier,in fact,concedes the insurers obligations were controlled by the indemnity agreement.by naming bigge as an additional insured,paul was obviously aware schuff was adding bigge to its policy because it was contractually obligated to do so.under the circumstances,paragraph of the lease is instrumental in assessing bigge objectively reasonable expectations.american dynasty,supra,th at,d.
paragraph of the lease requires schuff to indemnify bigge for claims for injury or death in any way caused by schuff,in its use,maintenance,operation,handling,transportation or storage of the crane italics added.in hernandez,this court held that substantively identical language required the lessee of a crane to indemnify the lessor only for the portion of the joint and several economic damage award to plaintiffs attributable to the lessee negligence.hernandez,supra,th at,d.accordingly,schuff fault is a prerequisite of contractual indemnity.the indemnity language does not evidence a mutual understanding of the parties that the indemnitor would indemnify the indemnitee even if its work was not negligent.indemnity provisions are to be strictly construed against the indemnitee,and had the parties intended to include an indemnity provision that would apply regardless of the indemnitor negligence,they would have had to use specific,unequivocal contractual language to that effect.heppler,supra,th at,d.
further,the endorsement is restricted to schuff ongoing operations,and as schuff was not to perform any work for bigge,the endorsement does not show the liability coverage was intended to be more expansive than schuff promise of indemnity.we can not conceive of how bigge could have had,objectively or reasonably,a contrary expectation.american dynasty,supra,th at,d.this is particularly true insofar as the strict product liability claim against bigge is concerned,as the purpose of imposing strict liability is to ensure the costs of injuries resulting from defective products are placed on the manufacturer and others including lessors who place the product on the market.san diego hospital superior court th,d westlye look sports,th,d.
because bigge had no reasonable expectations of coverage for its own negligence or strict products liability,the trial court erred by construing the ambiguity against paul in accordance with the app endorsement and paragraph of the lease,paul policy covers bigge only for liability arising from schuff negligence.bigge is thus contractually entitled to indemnification from schuff,and coverage from paul as the primary insurer,for any portion of the underlying plaintiffs economic damages attributable to schuff fault that bigge may have paid in settlement on a joint and several basis.hernandez,supra,th at,d maryland casualty bailey sons,th,d.therefore,frontier and aislic are bigge sole primary and excess carriers,respectively,for the settlement amount attributable to its own negligence or strict products liability.
paul contends this holding means its policy provides bigge no coverage,as the trial court presumed the settlement of the underlying litigation was solely for bigge negligence or strict products liability.however,as discussed below,we conclude the court presumption was incorrect and the matter must be remanded for a trial on allocation of fault.
frontier,aislic and bigge contend the court erred at trial by excluding evidence that schuff and bigge entered into an indemnity agreement other than that set forth in paragraph of the lease.frontier produced evidence the lease included the statement,t his lease agreement incorporates schuff purchase order in its entirety,and schuff and bigge initialed the statement schuff purchase order stated the a ttached letters dated the january letter and are part of this purchase order,and the reverse side of a page of the january letter included several conditions,including the following 
will indemnify bigge against loss or expense,including cost of defense,by reason of liability imposed by law for damages resulting from death or injury to persons or destruction of property occurring during the performance of the work under any contract made on the basis of this proposal,except to the extent that such death,injury or damage shall have been solely due to the negligent act or willful misconduct of bigge,its agents or employees italics added.
we conclude the court ruling was proper.in its first and second amended against paul,frontier quoted the language of paragraph of the lease as setting forth the indemnity agreement between schuff and bigge.additionally,in their complaint and first amended against schuff,frontier and bigge quoted paragraph of the lease in its entirety in support of the allegation schuff was required to obtain insurance to protect bigge.frontier and bigge claim their quote of paragraph was unrelated to indemnity,but the insurance obligation arises directly from the indemnity obligation.
in summary judgment or summary adjudication proceedings,a dmissions of material facts made in an opposing party pleadings are binding on that party as judicial admissions.they are conclusive concessions of the truth of those matters,are effectively removed as issues from the litigation,and may not be contradicted by the party whose pleadings are used against him or her.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group,foxborough van atta th,fn,d brown city of fremont d.a pleader can not blow hot and cold as to the facts positively stated.brown city of fremont,supra,at.accordingly,frontier and bigge are bound by their judicial admissions.
moreover,all parties relied exclusively on paragraph of the lease until the time of trial.in a separate statement in support of its motion for summary adjudication on frontier duty of defense,paul quoted paragraph of the lease as setting forth the indemnity agreement between schuff and bigge.notably,aislic and bigge filed oppositions to the motion,as well as frontier.in their responsive separate statements,aislic and frontier did not dispute the accuracy of paul quote,but stated it did not quote the entire agreement.frontier submitted all documents arguably part of the lease,including the january letter,but no party alerted the court to the indemnity provision in the letter.
contrary to the suggestion of frontier,aislic and bigge,the trial court has no burden to search through the parties evidence for a triable issue of fact.the parties separate statements are intended to permit the judge to determine quickly whether the motion is supported by sufficient undisputed facts.if the opposing statement disputes an essential fact alleged in support of the motion,the judge merely has to review the evidence cited in support of that fact.this saves the judge from having to review all the evidentiary materials filed in support of and in opposition to the motion.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil proceedings before trial,supra.further,during the hearing frontier presented a board displaying the language of paragraph of the lease and the parties relied on it in argument.
ordinarily,parties may not relitigate issues summarily adjudicated.abadjian superior court d.if a motion for summary adjudication is granted,at the trial of the action,the cause or causes of action within the action,affirmative defense or defenses,claims for damages,or issue or issues of duty as to the motion which has been granted shall be deemed to be established and the action shall proceed as to the cause or causes of action,affirmative defense or defenses,claim for damages,or issue or issues of duty remaining.code civ,subd.n,italics added.t he policy behind summary adjudication motions is to promote and protect the administration of justice,and to expedite litigation by the elimination of needless trials.catalano superior court th,d federal deposit ins.superior court th,d.
however,an exception to this rule may apply when an insurer duty to defend has been summarily adjudicated.frontier,aislic and bigge rely on liberty mutual ins.superior court th,d liberty mutual,in which the court explained that a summary adjudication on an insurer duty to defend is ephemeral because an insurer may obtain summary adjudication of no duty to defend at any time it can conclusively eliminate the potential for coverage.id.at,d,citing haskel,superior court th,d haskel.in haskel,the issue was whether the insured motion for summary adjudication on duty to defend could be delayed until the insurer had a full opportunity to investigate and prepare.the court held no delay is available,but if a motion is granted the insurer may thereafter continue to search for and develop evidence that will ultimately enable them to conclusively defeat the insured coverage claim.haskel,supra,at,d.
in liberty mutual,the court declined to interpret haskel,supra,th,d,as requiring that an insurer subsequent motion to defeat the duty of defense be based on newly discovered facts.liberty mutual,supra,th at,d.the court found such a rule unworkable,as evidenced by the facts periods spanning years,more than million pages of documents,numerous actions against the insureds arising from contamination at approximately sites,as well as other complexities.id.at,d.
here,in contrast,the only documents relevant to the indemnity issue are the lease and its attachments,including the january letter,all of which were submitted during the summary adjudication proceedings.liberty mutual does not stand for the proposition that insurers may rely on one indemnification provision during summary adjudication proceedings,and then,dissatisfied with the result,relitigate the issue in reliance on another provision of which they were,or should have been,aware.
further,there is no merit to the claim the court interpretation of paragraph of the lease with respect to frontier duty to defend has no bearing on any of the parties indemnity obligations.a duty to defend arises if there is a potential for coverage under the policy,and that determination depends on the indemnity agreement between schuff and bigge.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.
additionally,no party raised the january indemnity provision in the august,joint trial readiness conference report rather,as to legal issues not in dispute,the parties stipulated as follows a motion for summary adjudication was granted in favor of paul,establishing that frontier had a duty to defend bigge in the underlying cases,and that paul policy was primary to frontier only as to the portion of bigge liability which was caused by schuff as provided in the lease crane agreement.italics added some capitalization omitted.the court indisputably relied on the indemnity provision in paragraph of the lease in determining whether paul policy was primary.
the parties did not bring the indemnity provision in the january letter to the court attention until they filed trial briefs on august frontier and bigge and august,aislic,a week or less before trial commenced,and they offered no explanation for their untimeliness or shift in theory.the record contains no explanation for the failure to raise the issue earlier,and on appeal frontier,aislic and bigge assert they overlooked it however,they did not move for any relief under code of civil procedure section on the ground of their or their counsels mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.code civ.proc,subd.b weil brown,cal.practice guide civil proceedings before trial,supra,to.the court was understandably piqued,and noted that i f i were to visit this new indemnity provision argument,i would be in the position of then opening the case to oral testimony as to what was the intent of the parties because it clearly creates a much larger ambiguity than we had before since the two indemnity provisions conflict.
the mandatory trial readiness conference report is designed to limit issues for trial.super.san diego county,local rules,div.ii,rule.failure to disclose and identify all trial exhibits and witnesses intended to be called at trial and all other items required by the report may,in the court discretion,result in exclusion or restriction of use at trial,italics added.items required by the report include issues in dispute and issues not in dispute.id.at append.discretion is abused whenever,in its exercise,the court exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances before it being considered.denham superior court cal d.the court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence in support of an issue not divulged in the report.
further,t he doctrine of judicial estoppel is invoked to prevent a party from changing its position over the course of judicial proceedings when such positional changes have an adverse impact on the judicial process the policies underlying preclusion of inconsistent positions are general consideration s of the orderly administration of justice and regard for the dignity of judicial proceedings.jackson county of los angeles th,d.i t has long been settled that o ne to whom two inconsistent courses of action are open and who elects to pursue one of them is afterward precluded from pursuing the other.id.at,d.although the doctrine can not be invoked where the position first assumed was taken as a result of ignorance or mistake,ibid.the parties here raised no such defense.we find no abuse of discretion or other error.
allocation of fault between schuff and bigge 
under paragraph of the lease,schuff was required to obtain million in insurance to protect bigge from liability for schuff negligence,and the insurance was to be primary to all other coverages.in the summary adjudication proceedings,the court determined paul policy was primary over frontier policy only to the extent damage was caused by schuff negligence.
in its trial brief,frontier stated it could establish schuff was primarily responsible for the accident because it was required to maintain the crane during the lease period,but did not heed warnings the service brake was in disrepair it cut the crane warning horn it did not hire an operator experienced with the type of crane leased the operator lowered loads exceeding tons with the controlled load lowering clutch in power down mode with the modulated clutch engaged,an improper manner of lowering loads of that weight,because the crane tends to drive the loads to the ground the operator placed the crane in power down mode and then engaged the modulation the load toward the slowing the load with the service brake,an improper procedure with a ton load because it caused the clutch linings to wear and the clutch slipped and there was no phone man on duty to advise the operator whether the drop zone was clear of personnel.
at trial,the court noted it appeared there was significant liability to bigge and significant liability on schuff.however,the court nonetheless conclusively presumed the settlement of the underlying litigation was limited to bigge liability for its own negligence or strict products liability.the court found that because schuff had been dismissed from the underlying litigation,there was no liability of schuff which could have been settled.
however,the court improperly ignored bigge joint and several liability for the underlying plaintiffs economic damages attributable to schuff negligence.see hernandez,supra,th at,d.indeed,because schuff was immune to suit by employees or their heirs,there was an increased likelihood that bigge settlement of the underlying litigation included sums attributable to schuff fault.we conclude the court erred by refusing to allocate fault between schuff and bigge for purposes of deter
