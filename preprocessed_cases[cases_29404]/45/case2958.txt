an insurer refused to indemnify its insured for the settlement of an action alleging that the insured engaged in the market manipulation of stock in violation of corporations code sections and we hold that liability under section requires a wilful act within the meaning of insurance code section,which precludes coverage under directors and officers liability insurance.
a class action was filed against appellants california amplifier,cal amp and its officers,ira coron and david nichols,seeking damages under section based on allegations that appellants made false and misleading statements to inflate the price of cal amp stock.appellants filed this case for breach of contract and bad faith when respondent rli insurance company rli denied coverage.
the trial court granted rli motion for judgment on the pleadings,concluding that coverage was precluded by insurance code section.appellants contend that coverage is permitted because section liability may be based on negligent conduct.we disagree and affirm.
facts and procedural history 
appellants obtained a primary policy of directors and officers insurance from american alliance insurance company.rli issued a policy for excess coverage.the policies insured cal amp directors and officers against liability for wrongful acts performed in their capacity as directors or officers,including violation of state laws concerning the offering,registration,sale or purchase of securities.the policies did not cover losses incurred by cal amp for its own liability.the primary policy also included an endorsement allocating liability between covered and claims and parties when a lawsuit is filed against both the company and its directors and officers.the rli excess policy provides that it is subject to the same terms and conditions as the primary policy.
appellants cal amp,coron,and nichols were all named as defendants in a class action for securities fraud in violation of sections,subdivision d,and.the complaint alleges that appellants made false statements to the securities market exaggerating the future demand for cal amp products as part of a scheme to raise the price of cal amp stock.the complaint alleges that plaintiff class members purchased cal amp stock at prices that were artificially inflated by the false statements.the class action was settled at the beginning of trial under terms which obligated cal amp to pay a substantial sum of money.
the primary insurer and another excess insurer paid a portion of the settlement,but rli denied coverage and refused to contribute to the settlement.appellants then filed this action against rli alleging causes of action for breach of its policy,bad faith in refusing to respond to cal amp demand for payment,and unfair business practices arising out of the same conduct.
rli moved for judgment on the pleadings arguing that the securities fraud alleged in the class action was uninsurable under insurance code section and,alternatively,that the policy endorsement required that the entire settlement amount be allocated to cal amp,which was not an insured.the trial court granted the motion basing its ruling on insurance code section.it did not address the policy endorsement issue.
discussion 
section liability requires knowing and intentional conduct 
a motion for judgment on the pleadings tests the sufficiency of the complaint.as with a demurrer,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation and accept all allegations of material fact as true.smiley citibank cal th,d.the judgment must be affirmed if any basis for the motion has merit and shows that plaintiffs can not state a cause of action.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,shin kong th,d.we independently review the trial court ruling.smiley,supra,at,d.
cal amp contends that the trial court erred by finding that liability under sections,subdivision d and requires an uninsurable wilful act under insurance code section.cal amp argues that,since section,subdivision d,may be violated by negligent as well as intentional conduct,application of insurance code section can not be determined on the basis of the pleadings we disagree.since a defendant must knowingly and intentionally make a false or misleading statement to be liable under section,coverage is precluded by insurance code section as a matter of law.
fraudulent and prohibited practices under corporate securities law 
sections and are part of the corporate securities law of et act.we construe those statutes according to their purpose and by harmonizing them with related sections of the act to the extent possible.people simon cal th,d,walnut creek manor fair employment housing com.cal d.
the act includes three sections that create fraudulent and prohibited practices in the purchase and sale of securities.section prohibits false and misleading statements designed to manipulate the securities markets diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d,diamond multimedia.market manipulation,essentially a term of art,covers fraudulent practices such as wash sales,matched orders,and rigged prices,that are intended to mislead investors by artificially creating market activity in a security.id.at,fn,d.section is a broader statute that prohibits misrepresentations in connection with the purchase or sale of securities in general.section prohibits insider trading.these three sections are penal in nature.a violation could result in imprisonment for five years and a fine of up to million,subd.b.
each of these three fraudulent practices sections has a corresponding section which establishes a private remedy for damages.the purpose of the act in this regard is to create statutory liability that eliminates some of the elements of common law fraud,but balances this expansion of liability by placing other restrictions on recovery.boam trident financial th,d bowden robinson d.section creates the private remedy for violations of section and extends liability to all persons affected by market manipulation without requiring reliance or privity.but,section is limited to intentional misrepresentations.see bowden,supra,at.sections and extend liability to some negligent conduct,but retain the privity requirement from common law fraud.
section,subdivision d 
section,subdivision d,makes it unlawful for any person selling or offering for sale or purchasing or offering to purchase the security,to make,for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others,any statement which was,at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made,false or misleading and which he knew or had reasonable ground to believe was so false or misleading.enforcement of section is limited to administrative proceedings initiated by the department of corporations.
appellants contend that,by prohibiting statements that a person had reasonable ground to believe were false or misleading,section,subdivision d can be violated by negligent conduct.we agree that a reasonable ground to believe a statement is false creates a standard,but it is a standard that is not satisfied by ordinary negligence.it requires a higher level of culpability than common law negligent misrepresentation,which is satisfied if the defendant has no reason to believe a statement is true.home budget loans,jacoby meyers law offices d.
the required level of culpability for a section,subdivision d violation is the equivalent of recklessness.recklessness involves more than inadvertence or incompetence.it entails a conscious choice of a course of action with knowledge of the serious danger to others involved in it.delaney baker cal th,d.in the context of securities fraud,recklessness exists when the danger of misleading buyers or sellers is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.hollinger titan capital cir.similarly,section,subdivision d requires a person to make the statement despite having a belief that it may be false or misleading.
moreover,knowledge or a reasonable ground to believe a statement is false or misleading is only one necessary element of a section,subdivision d violation.the statement also must be made for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of a security by another person,subd.d.a person must have a specific intent to affect the price of a security in order to induce its purchase or sale.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
the requirement of a specific intent to affect the price and induce a purchase or sale raises the level of scienter required for a section,subdivision d violation.recklessness satisfies one element of the statute,but deliberate intent is required to satisfy another element.as a result,a violation may be based on negligent reckless conduct in part,but not on negligent conduct alone.
we have found no case law which addresses the required level of scienter for a section,subdivision d violation when one element of the violation can be established through negligent reckless conduct and one element requires intent.a leading treatise,however,takes the position that intentional conduct is required for a violation.marsh volk,practice under the cal.securities laws b,marsh volk.
according to marsh volk,the for the purpose of inducing language in section,subdivision d,requires that the defendant knew what he or she was doing and did it intentionally.marsh volk,supra,b.in reaching this conclusion,marsh volk emphasize that liability extends to everyone whose market trades are affected by the market manipulation.in view of this potentially enormous and virtually unlimited liability,the intention of the defendant to affect the market by inducing the purchase or sale of the security by others was a necessary qualification of the defendant liability.marsh volk,supra,e,see diamond multimedia,supra,cal th at,d.it is reasonable to insist that the plaintiff prove that the defendant did something wrong.marsh volk,supra,at.
even if a standard of recklessness were sufficient for a section,subdivision d violation,the private cause of action for damages alleged in the underlying class action is governed by section.section imposes conditions for the recovery of damages,which are not included in section,subdivision d,and which make it clear that liability requires a knowingly false statement made with the deliberate intent to manipulate the price of a security.
section provides that a ny person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of section shall be liable to any other person who purchases or sells any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction for the damages sustained by the latter as a result of such act or transaction.the key to section is the clause limiting liability to a person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation of section.there are two areas of contention that must be resolved in order to construe this clause.
first,appellants and rli dispute the meaning of the phrase any act or transaction.according to appellants,the act or transaction referred to in section may constitute lawful conduct in general,provided that it includes a violation of section,subdivision d as one of its parts.appellants assert that an act or transaction fits the section requirement if it gives rise to a section violation.
we reject this interpretation,which incorrectly separates the act or transaction from the violation of section.we conclude that the act or transaction referred to in section is the violation of section itself.to be liable under section,a person must participate in market manipulation that violates section.when,as here,section,subdivision d is involved,section liability requires a person to make a false or misleading statement for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of stock.
as appellants concede,the phrase in violation of section modifies the verb participates,not the phrase in any act or transaction.therefore,as a matter of grammar,the person must participate in the section violation,not just participate in an act or transaction that includes a violation.in addition,section provides that the price of the security must be affected by such act or transaction in order for there to be liability.italics added.since only the false or misleading statement can affect the price of the security,such act or transaction must be interpreted as referring to the false or misleading statement itself.
the more difficult question in construing section concerns the meaning of its willfully participates requirement.only a person who willfully participates in the act or transaction that violates section,subdivision d can be liable for damages.appellants argue that,since the adverb willfully modifies the verb participates and not the phrase in violation of section,the statute should be read as requiring willful participation in a violation of section,and not willful participation in a willful violation of section.
we agree that the word willfully appears only once in section.but,we can discern no material difference between willfully participating in a violation of section,and willfully participating in a willful violation of section.
we conclude that the purpose and intent of the willful participation requirement is to clarify and underscore the high level of scienter required for a violation of section.the most reasonable interpretation of the phrase willfully participates is to limit section liability to situations where there is an intent to defraud through a knowingly false statement.only persons who willfully,not merely recklessly,violate section,subdivision d can be liable for damages.
this construction gives substantive meaning to the language of section and acknowledges that the language imposes conditions on liability.if a violation of section was all that was required for section liability,the legislature would have said so.the legislature would not have included language of limitation in section but,instead,would simply have provided that injured parties could recover damages caused by a violation of section.
we reject appellants contention that the willfully participates requirement in section imposes liability on two classes of persons people who personally violate section and people who willfully participate in an act or transaction that gives rise to a section violation.this interpretation deprives section of substantive significance and leaves section to determine the scope of the private remedy for damages.it also fails to adequately account for the section requirement of willful participation.
if there is section liability on the part of all persons who willfully participate in a transaction that includes a section,subdivision d violation,liability would extend far beyond the reach of section,subdivision d.an entire class of persons would be liable under section,but not under section,subdivision d.for example,under appellants view,a person who in an act or transaction that includes a false or misleading statement by another person might have liability.appellants do not acknowledge that section liability is that,but they also fail to demonstrate how their interpretation would limit liability in any manner.
appellants interpretation also ignores the enforcement scheme of the act as it applies to aiders and abettors.some sections of the act provide that aiders and abettors have liability.for example,section imposes liability on a person who materially aids an act or transaction that violates section or,and section imposes liability on persons who materially assist certain other violations.but,there is no such language in section or.to impose liability on persons who do not directly participate in a section violation would be contrary to the legislative decision to exclude aiders and abettors from section liability.see reiger altris software,tw jfs wl hudson capital management,no.mhp wl.
in addition,section is included in the fraudulent and prohibited practices part of the act,whereas section,concerning damages for violation of section,is in the enforcement part.this arrangement is inconsistent with the argument that civil liability for damages may be based on conduct which does not,in itself,also violate section.in fact,section provides that,e xcept as explicitly provided in this chapter,no civil liability in favor of any private party shall arise against any person by implication from or as a result of the violation
