in this diversity case,the allstate insurance company allstate,as subrogee of sam lakhia,appeals from the district court dismissal of its claim for property damage founded on the doctrine of strict liability for a defective product.there is a disagreement among the intermediate courts of appeals in illinois with respect to the applicable statute of limitations.the united states district court for the northern district of illinois decided that it should follow the rule established by the state intermediate court for the state appellate district in which the lawsuit would have been brought.accordingly,it determined that the present lawsuit had been filed beyond the time permitted by the statute of limitations and dismissed the action.because we believe that the district court erred in its belief that it was required to follow the rule of the state intermediate court of appeals for the state appellate district in which the suit would have been brought,we reverse its decision on that issue.finally,because of the importance of the question to the jurisprudence of illinois,we certify to the supreme court of illinois the issue of the applicable statute of limitations.
background 
prior to december,sam lakhia or a member of his family purchased a torchiere halogen lamp in a menards store in hillsdale,illinois.the lamp was placed in the family home in bellwood,illinois and situated along the south wall near the basement stairs for the purposes of providing ambient light.on december,there was a fire in the lakhia home that resulted in a claim by lakhia for for property damage and related living expenses incurred as a result of the fire.allstate,lakhia insurer and subrogee,paid the claim and then brought this action against menards on march.the jurisdiction of the district court was based on the diverse citizenship of the parties menards filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
in a hearing before the district court,the parties disagreed with respect to the applicable statute of limitations period for a products liability action.in allstate view,the applicable statute of limitations was five years.it relied upon the decision of the second district in american family insurance village,d.menards,on the other hand,submitted that the applicable statute of limitations was two years.it relied on the decisions of the first district in mcleish sony of america,d,and calumet country club roberts environmental control,d,
in discharging their responsibility to ascertain the content of state law in diversity cases,the sitting judges of the northern district of illinois have developed two conflicting approaches when confronted with no controlling decision of the supreme court of illinois and with conflicting decisions of the illinois appellate court some judges have followed the standard practice for a district court sitting in diversity and have attempted to predict how the supreme court of illinois would resolve the question others have deemed themselves bound by the prevailing rule of the state appellate district in which the suit would have been brought in state court reasoning that this approach would prevent forum shopping.the district court in this case had followed the latter approach in earlier cases and decided that,in the absence of explicit guidance from this court,it would not alter its course.accordingly,it followed the decisions of the first district and held that the applicable statute of limitations was two years and dismissed the action 
discussiona.
we first address whether the district court was correct in its decision to consider itself bound by the view of the state intermediate appellate court with jurisdiction over the place where the action would be brought in the state court.both parties before us,and all of the judges of the united states district court for the northern district of illinois who have addressed the matter,acknowledge that the ultimate responsibility of the district courts is to apply the law of the state in which the court sits with respect to substantive matters.see erie tompkins.it is further beyond dispute that,as a general rule,statutes of limitation are considered to be substantive matters for purposes of the erie doctrine.see guaranty trust york.
as we have noted already,the district court,relying on its past practice as well as the practice of some other judges sitting in this particular district,took the view that,in the absence of a definite ruling by the supreme court of illinois and faced with a conflict among the state intermediate appellate courts,it was obliged to follow the rule established by the illinois appellate court with jurisdiction over the place where the suit would have been filed,if it had been filed in state court.the view of the district court finds support in several published cases of the northern district of illinois.see,abbott labs.granite state ins.comm l discount king.as menards points out in its brief,these cases consider the main focus of erie to be a concern that for the same transaction the accident of suit by a nonresident litigant in a federal court instead of a state court a block away should not lead to a substantially different result.abbott.at quoting guaranty trust,at.the same theme,noted the district court in abbott laboratories,was expressed by the supreme court in klaxon stentor manufacturing,when the supreme court wrote that,unless state choice of law rules are treated as anything other than substantive,the accident of diversity of citizenship would constantly disturb equal administration of justice in coordinate state and federal courts sitting side by side.klaxon,at.the rule articulated in klaxon dealt with a state choice of law rules governing when it would apply its own substantive law and when it would apply the substantive law of another state.the district court in abbott laboratories maintained,however,that erie concern with the equal administration of justice requires that the same approach be taken with respect to a state internal choice of law rule that requires the state trial courts in illinois to follow the rule of the appellate court for the district in which it is located.abbott.at.thus,when state law itself contains a definitive rule as to the way to ascertain state law in case of intrastate appellate court disputes,we must follow that first state law in order to learn the second state law.comm l disc.at.in short,said the district court,the essential theory of erie is that a federal court must decide substantive questions in diversity cases in the same way that a state trial judge in the same location would.id.at quoting can whittaker.
in assessing this perspective,we believe that the most appropriate course is to start with erie itself.there can be no doubt that,in setting forth the rule that a district court sitting in diversity must apply the law of the state in which it sits,the supreme court was concerned with forum shopping.see erie,at.it is necessary,however,to go behind this concern and to perceive the reasons for the supreme court concern.erie is not simply the product of a search for a salutary rule of judicial administration,but a holding that the supreme court explicitly said was constitutionally compelled if only a question of statutory construction were involved,we should not be prepared to abandon a doctrine so widely applied throughout nearly a century.but,the unconstitutionality of the course pursued has now been made clear,and compels us to do so.erie,at.noting the federal government lack of constitutional authority to create substantive rules of law,the supreme court viewed its holding as restoring to the state governments the prerogative of fashioning principles of law in matters beyond the limited constitutional competence delineated for the federal government in the constitution 
except in matters governed by the federal constitution or by acts of congress,the law to be applied in any case is the law of the state.and,whether the law of the state shall be declared by its legislature in a statute or by the highest court in a decision is not a matter of federal concern.there is no general federal common law.congress has no power to declare substantive rules of common law applicable in a state whether they be local in their nature or general,be they commercial law or part of the law of torts.and no clause in the constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts.
id.at.see also bernhardt polygraphic of.majority,frankfurter,concurring.to maintain the constitutional line between limited federal lawmaking power and state residual lawmaking power,erie requires that the federal court follow an analytical path that ensures that the law applied in federal proceedings is the law that ultimately would be applied were the case to be litigated in the state courts.roberts life ins,emphasis in original 
application of the approach employed by the district court in this case would not achieve this result because it would deny the litigant any opportunity to receive a judicial assessment about what the supreme court of the state might determine the law to be through a resolution of conflicting precedent in the lower state appellate courts.the litigant in an illinois state court is no doubt bound by the approach articulated in people thorpe,d,and garcia hynes howes real estate,d,and therefore can expect to be bound in the trial court by the substantive rule of law articulated by the state appellate court for the district in which the trial court is located.upon rendition of judgment by the trial court,however,that litigant has the right to appeal to the intermediate appellate court and to convince that court that the prevailing rule ought to yield to that embraced by an appellate court in another district.absent satisfactory relief in that court,yet a further attempt may be made to convince the state highest tribunal to resolve the conflict among the districts.for the litigant in federal court,however,there is no such direct path to the supreme court of illinois.if the mandate of erie is to be satisfied and the law ultimately employed is to be the law of the state,the federal court,exercising its authority to hear diversity cases must make a predictive judgment as to how the supreme court of the state would decide the matter if it were presented presently to that tribunal.
in many instances,therefore,application of the rule employed in abbott laboratories would result in the precedent of the state intermediate appellate court being given more effect in federal court than it would receive in the state judicial system.under the rationale of that case,both the district court and this court would be bound by the precedent of the state intermediate appellate court.if the case were brought in the state system,however,that court would be free to reevaluate its own precedent and determine that,despite the usual constraints of stare decisis and precedent,that decision ought not stand.see geri yonover,ascertaining state law the continuing erie dilemma,depaul.
although the supreme court of the united states has not had to confront the precise issue before us today,its decisions make it clear that the court views the erie doctrine as imposing on federal courts the responsibility to determine the content of state law at the state,not the local,level.erie itself appears to have contemplated that the duty of the federal court,sitting in diversity,is to determine the content of state law as the highest court of the state would interpret it.see erie,at.see also wichita royalty city bank.in bernhardt,the court also focused on the clarity of the entire state decisional law in ascertaining the content of state law.see bernhardt,at.most recently,and perhaps most pointedly,in holding that federal courts of appeals must review de novo the district court determination of the content of state law,the supreme court noted that deferential review invites divergent development of state law among the federal trial courts even within a single state.salve regina college russell,d.
finally,we do not think that the supreme court decision in klaxon is of any help to menards.a fair reading of klaxon makes clear that its focus is on ensuring that,in determining whether to apply the substantive law of the state in which it sits or the substantive law of another state,a district court should follow the choice of law rules of the forum state to ensure that the replacement of one state law by another is based on a state policy decision and not a federal one.as the court stated 
any other ruling would do violence to the principle of uniformity within a state,upon which the tompkins decision is based.whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system,which leaves to a state,within the limits permitted by the constitution,the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors.it is not for the federal courts to thwart such local policies by enforcing an independent general law of conflict of laws.subject only to review by this court on any federal question that may arise,delaware is free to determine whether a given matter is to be governed by the law of the forum or some other law.
as one scholar has written 
all that was decided in klaxon was that the federal court in delaware should follow the conflict of laws rules prevailing in the state in which it sits.the conflict of laws rules contemplated by klaxon are those rules,whether they be traditional first restatement of conflict of laws method or one of the more modern approaches,which would direct the forum jurisdiction to apply the law of another jurisdiction.the intrastate precedential effect of intermediate state court decisions on state courts as exemplified by is an apple,or better yet an asparagus,compared to klaxon orange 
yonover,supra at.
although we believe that the task of the federal court sitting in diversity is to ascertain the substantive content of state law as it either has been determined by the highest court of the state or as it would be by that court if the present case were before it now,we pause to emphasize that this determination in no way implies any erosion of our precedent that,in the absence of prevailing authority from the state highest court,federal courts ought to give great weight to the holdings of the state intermediate appellate courts and ought to deviate from those holdings only when there are persuasive indications that the highest court of the state would decide the case differently from the decision of the intermediate appellate court.see state farm mut.auto.ins.pate,cir lexington ins.rugg knopp,cir allen transamerica ins,cir.see generally chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction at ed discussing supreme court authorities yonover,supra at.as the supreme court has held,w here an intermediate appellate state court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of which it announces,that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.west am.
in sum,we adhere today to the general rule,articulated and applied throughout the united states,that,in determining the content of state law,the federal courts must assume the perspective of the highest court in that state and attempt to ascertain the governing substantive law on the point in question.see allen,at.see generally charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction at.
as we have noted earlier,federal courts have,under article iii,the authority and,indeed,the duty to ascertain the content of state substantive law when called upon to do so in the exercise of the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts.exercising this responsibility is no easy task.as one has noted,f inding the applicable state law is a search that often proves elusive.moreover,although often lost in the debate about the continued importance of diversity jurisdiction in our constitutional debate that usually focuses on the number of cases is a significant impact on the health of our federalism as federal courts interpret,with increasing frequency,issues of state law a
