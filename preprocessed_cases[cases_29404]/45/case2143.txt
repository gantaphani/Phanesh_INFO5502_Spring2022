this is a diversity insurance coverage dispute governed by alabama law.the district court granted summary judgment to the appellee,finding that a clause in the policy bars coverage.we reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
the facts are undisputed.west west agreed to supply labor to appellant alabama river pulp arp.the contract between west and arp provided,in part 
to the fullest extent permitted by law,west shall indemnify and hold harmless arp from and against any and all claims,costs,losses and damages arising out of or in any way related to the performance of the work by west or the agents,servants,employees or subcontractors of west,in whatever manner the same may be caused,and whether or not the same may be caused,occasioned or contributed to by the negligence,sole or concurrent,of arp 
the contract also required west to obtain insurance to cover its indemnity obligation and to add arp to its policies as an additional insured.
both west and arp were insured at the time of the accident underlying this action.arp had a million primary commercial general liability policy from appellant twin city fire insurance company twin city,a million excess policy from twin city,and a million umbrella policy from appellant hartford casualty insurance company hartford casualty that was excess to both twin city policies.west had a million primary commercial general liability policy from amerisure insurance company amerisure and,in excess of that policy,a million commercial umbrella policy from appellee ohio casualty insurance company ohio casualty.west named arp as an additional insured on both the ohio casualty and the amerisure policies.
an accident at arp led to the insurance claims at issue in this case.james dumas and gerald stabler,employees of west,suffered burn injuries from a ruptured condensate storage tank during the course and scope of their employment with west.they were not working on the tank or on anything related to the tank at the time.rather,their work for west on arp premises brought them into the tank vicinity.the parties agree that arp actions were the cause of the rupture.
dumas filed negligence and wantonness claims against arp on november.on january,arp asked west and its insurers to defend and indemnify arp in the dumas litigation.twin city and arp filed the complaint in the instant case on may,seeking a declaratory judgment to resolve the respective insurance obligations.stabler filed a similar tort action on august.arp demanded a defense from west and its insurers in the stabler action on october.arp wrote separately to ohio casualty on december,included medical reports,and advised ohio casualty that the verdicts would likely be in the multimillion dollar range,implicating its policy.in april,arp and twin city amended the complaint in the declaratory action,adding ohio casualty and incorporating the stabler litigation.ohio casualty answered on may,and denied coverage.
ohio casualty was also given the opportunity to participate in the settlement negotiations for the dumas and stabler litigation.on june and july,arp notified ohio casualty of an upcoming mediation of the dumas and stabler actions,and again requested ohio casualty participation.then arp sent a letter to ohio casualty on july,the day before the mediation began,again inviting it to participate.ohio casualty did not attend the mediation or participate in the settlement.
under the terms of the settlement,amerisure agreed to pay its policy limit and fifty percent of the defense costs.twin city agreed to contribute up to its primary policy limit.it and hartford casualty contributed the rest of the funds necessary to defend and settle the actions,pending resolution of this case 
this declaratory action concerns who is responsible for the liability in excess of the amerisure and twin city primary policies.twin city,hartford casualty,and arp hereinafter referred to collectively as twin city seek reimbursement from ohio casualty for the costs of the settlement and defense.twin city first claims that west owes arp indemnity for all the settlement and defense costs,and that the ohio casualty policy covers that indemnity obligation.alternatively,twin city claims that arp is an additional insured covered directly under the ohio casualty policy,such that ohio casualty must share the excess liability at least pro rata with twin city and hartford casualty.ohio casualty denies coverage,claiming that it owes no part of the settlement or defense costs.
the district court granted summary judgment to ohio casualty and dismissed the action with prejudice against twin city.the district court found that the liability falls under the indemnity agreement between west and arp.the court,however,concluded that no coverage exists because a clause in the ohio casualty policy required either ohio casualty consent to a settlement,or final judgment after trial.the dumas and stabler settlement did not satisfy either condition.twin city appealed.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hilburn murata elecs,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the issues in this appeal concern the interpretation of an indemnity contract and an insurance policy.as a federal court sitting in diversity,we apply alabama law.erie tompkins.in alabama,the interpretation of a contract,including an insurance contract,is a question of law reviewed de novo.royal ins.of am.whitaker contracting,cir.
ohio casualty argument rests primarily on the clause contained in the insurance policy it issued to west.the clause states there will be no right of action against us under this insurance unless the amount you west owe has been determined by settlement with our consent or by actual trial and final judgment.ohio casualty argues that because there was neither a judgment against west nor a settlement to which ohio casualty consented,the clause bars coverage.
we disagree.in alabama,when an insurer has a right to defend its insured,receives notice of settlement negotiations,and refuses to participate,the insurer waives the right to assert the clause in a later suit to determine coverage.liberty mut.ins.wheelwright trucking,so d.the insurer becomes bound to pay the amount of any settlement made in good faith,and for which coverage exists.id.
the clause must be deemed waived to avoid putting the insured in a precarious situation.enforcing the clause on these facts would allow the insurer to refuse consent,force the insured to enter into an unconsented settlement,and then avoid coverage by claiming that there was no judgment and no consented settlement.that is a result the parties to the insurance contract could not possibly have intended.see bellsouth mobility,cellulink,so d,i t is the duty of the court to construe the contract so as to express the intent of the parties.
an insurer that wishes to deny coverage thus has two choices.it may participate in the settlement pursuant to a reservation of rights,preserving the opportunity to later dispute coverage.or it may refuse to participate,and become bound by any reasonable and good faith settlement of a claim that a court later determines falls under the policy coverage.
in this case,ohio casualty clearly waived the protection of the clause.it concedes that it had a right to defend its insured west and a right to participate in any settlement.further,ohio casualty had notice of the settlement and an opportunity to join the negotiations.arp made formal demands for a defense on west insurers,including ohio casualty,on january,and october.on december,arp followed up with a letter to ohio casualty advising that the verdict would implicate its policy,and enclosed medical reports to show the same.finally,on june and july,arp notified ohio casualty that the mediation was scheduled for july and.ohio casualty clearly knew about and could have chosen to participate in the settlement negotiations.
ohio casualty does not deny any of this,but explains by saying that west primary insurer,amerisure,advised ohio casualty not to participate in order to avoid tipping the plaintiffs that west insurers expected a multimillion dollar verdict.this only shows that ohio casualty did have notice and an opportunity to participate,but for strategic reasons declined to do so.because ohio casualty had a right to defend and notice of the settlement negotiations,it waived the protection of the clause in this declaratory coverage dispute.
ohio casualty makes several attempts to escape the reach of the alabama rule on clauses.first,it argues that,as the excess insurer,it had only a right to defend and not a duty,and thus did not waive the protection of the clause when it declined to participate in the settlement.but the waiver rule does not require a duty to defend.it applies so long as the insurer had a right and opportunity to defend.the alabama supreme court made this clear in wheelwright,where it repeatedly phrased the rule in terms of a right to defend.wheelwright,so d at a n insurer who has the right and opportunity to offer a defense and who declines to offer that defense may not relitigate the amount of a judgment its insured agreed to in good faith and within the limit of the insurer coverage.id.at id.at.moreover,it would make little sense to exempt from the waiver rule insurers with only a right to defend.that would allow such insurers to achieve the same prohibited result of denying coverage,causing the insured to enter into an unconsented settlement,and then setting up the clause as a bar to the coverage dispute.
second,ohio casualty draws a factual distinction between wheelwright and the instant case.ohio casualty notes that in wheelwright there was no indemnity relationship separating the plaintiff and the insurer the plaintiff proceeded against the insurer after obtaining a settlement directly against the named insured.in this case,twin city is seeking recovery against ohio casualty as the insurer of its insured indemnitor ohio casualty suggests that,notwithstanding wheelwright,arp or its insurers should have secured a judgment against west before proceeding against ohio casualty,and that in the absence of such a judgment,the clause applies 
however,ohio casualty does not explain why the aspect of the instant case should make a difference and preclude application of the wheelwright rationale.nor can we imagine any such reason.indeed,although wheelwright did not involve an indemnitee suing an insurer,the wheelwright court relied on an alabama case which held that an indemnitor who has notice of a claim and refuses to defend is bound by a good faith,reasonable settlement entered into by its indemnitee.stone.star,so d.we are thus confident the alabama supreme court would hold that an insurer waives the protection of the clause with respect to an indemnitee of its insured when it refuses to participate in a settlement involving that indemnitee.
in its final attempt to prevent reaching the merits of the coverage dispute,ohio casualty argues that the structure of the settlement relieves it from liability.in the settlement,twin city agreed not to execute judgment against or recover from west,and agreed to pursue recovery only against west insurers.the ohio casualty policy only requires it to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay.ohio casualty thus argues that because west never became obligated to pay the indemnity obligation,ohio casualty never had a legal duty that arose under the insurance policy and has no current obligation to reimburse arp or its insurers.
the alabama supreme court,however,rejected this argument in wheelwright,finding that legally obligated to pay language does not block an otherwise valid coverage obligation when an insurer refuses to defend the insured and the injured party enters into a reasonable and good faith settlement that precludes proceeding against the insured.wheelwright,so d at.ohio casualty argues that the holding was considerably narrower than this,noting that the wheelwright court may have attributed some importance to the fact that the insured in that case was in bankruptcy.id.at.but the court holding was not so narrow.first,the opinion ultimately based its holding on the weight of authority,which consisted of numerous cases where the insured was not in bankruptcy.see id.at citing coblentz am.surety,cir ins.paul fire marine ins,so d,red giant oil lawlor,iowa metcalf hartford acc.indem.
in addition,the wheelwright court acknowledged that the plaintiff response to the argument was essentially the same as the response to the clause argument.id.at.by holding for the plaintiff,then,the wheelwright court implicitly recognized that an insurer who has a right to defend,receives notice of settlement negotiations,and refuses to participate waives the protection of the condition,just as it waives the protection of the clause so long as the settlement is covered,reasonable,and made in good faith.the wheelwright court holding was thus just as broad as its clause holding.
because of west indemnity obligation,west in this case is in the same position as the insured in wheelwright.for the same reason,in this case,the condition must be deemed waived,and the settlement effective release of the named insured west does not bar recovery against ohio casualty.of course,the appellants still must prove that there was a valid indemnity obligation in order to recover.but a covenant not to pursue recovery against the indemnitor,west,does not prevent reaching that question on the merits.
here,ohio casualty had a right to defend,was invited to participate in the settlement negotiations,and refused to attend.it therefore may not assert the clause or the condition in this coverage dispute with the insurers of its insured indemnitee 
coverage of indemnity obligations under the ohio casualty policy.
because the clause and the condition do not bar coverage,we reach the merits of the coverage dispute.west agreed to indemnify arp for arp tort liability arising out of west work,which included tort liability to west employees.this indemnity obligation is clearly covered under the ohio casualty policy,which covers insured contracts where the named insured west assumes the tort liability of another party here,arp to pay for bodily injury to a third person 
c.the exclusion.
ohio casualty argues,however,that the indemnity obligation in this case falls within the terms of an express exclusion in the policy a clause that excludes a ny liability of any insured covered under this policy to any other insured covered under this policy.it notes that arp was an additional insured within the meaning of the policy,which covers any person included as an additional insured by virtue of an insured contract,and to which coverage is provided by the underlying insurance,and for no broader coverage than is provided by the underlying insurance to such additional insured.arp met all of these conditions.it was added as an additional insured by virtue of an insured contract the indemnity agreement,and the underlying amerisure policy provided coverage ohio casualty argues that because arp was an additional insured,and west was an insured,the clause excludes the indemnity liability owed from west to arp.
we conclude,however,that the exclusion is at best ambiguous with respect to obligations owed from an insured to an additional insured because the policy elsewhere expressly contemplates coverage of such obligations.in alabama,a provision in an insurance contract is ambiguous when more than one interpretation may fairly be given to a policy provision.twin city fire ins.alfa mut.ins,so d.in deciding whether a provision is ambiguous,the terms should be given a rational and practical construction.state farm fire cas.slade,so d.a court can not consider the language in the policy in isolation,but must consider the policy as a whole.id.the exclusion is ambiguous in this instance because it does not specify whether an insured includes an additional insured,for whom coverage is specifically provided elsewhere in the policy.
here,considering the policy as a whole,it would make little sense to apply the exclusion to indemnity obligations owed by a named insured to an addi
