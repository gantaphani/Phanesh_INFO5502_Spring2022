an injured construction worker brought a tort action against appellant food pro international,food pro,relating to an injury at a food processing plant.food pro tendered defense of both the worker action and a related action to its insurance carrier,respondent farmers insurance exchange farmers.farmers denied coverage,and this action against farmers for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing followed.the trial court entered judgment for farmers following a court trial on farmers duty to defend.on appeal,food pro contends the trial court erred in finding that farmers did not have a duty to defend food pro pursuant to a commercial general liability cgl insurance policy.food pro also appeals from the trial court earlier summary adjudication of food pro claim for punitive damages.we find no merit to food pro punitive damages argument,but conclude that the trial court erred in finding that farmers had no duty to defend food pro.we therefore reverse the judgment.
background 
factual background 
food pro is a consulting firm that prepares and implements plans for food processing and distribution operations.its personnel are food production and distribution specialists that offer a complete range of consulting engineering services from studies,long range planning,feasibility,site selection to construction and equipment installation management.
mariani packing company mariani,a fruit processor,hired food pro to assist the company in the relocation of its operations from san jose to a new vacaville plant.according to food pro proposal and contract with mariani,food pro work for mariani was divided into three phases a preliminary design phase involving the development of the conceptual plan and design criteria,a final design phase involving the development of detailed plans and specifications,and an equipment installation phase involving the coordination of the implementation of the plans to help insure that the final result conforms to the plans and specifications and is completed on time and within budget.during the final phase,food pro duties were to include acting as mariani representative the contractors and suppliers,coordinating contractor activities on the project,updating the schedule,and mak ing inspections of the work in progress as required to determine,in general,if the work is proceeding in accordance with the contract documents.food pro efforts during this phase were to be directed toward providing assurance that the completed project will conform to the contract documents and that the major elements of work are carried out in proper sequence.food pro was not required under the contract with mariani to take action to protect workers from injury or to otherwise ensure the safety of the site.
in february and march of,steve aamold,a processing specialist with food pro,was at the mariani plant in san jose to ensure that the relocation was proceeding smoothly and that the contractors were acting within the schedule.as part of food pro role in observing the process and reporting progress to mariani,aamold kept a daily log with notes recording which contractors were working on which projects and how the work was proceeding.as mariani production operations were ongoing alongside the relocation of equipment,a full complement of mariani employees was often on the site as well.food pro helped facilitate the simultaneous work,but was merely a consultant on the site.mariani acted as its own general contractor.although food pro was involved in the bid process for contractors,the contractors,once chosen,contracted directly with mariani.
walther electric company walther electric,an electrical contractor,was hired by mariani to disconnect equipment at the san jose plant.roy pettigrew was a walther electric employee.in february,walther electric disconnected the electrical for a fruit extruder machine that spanned the mezzanine level of the plant to the main floor below.valley welding and machine valley welding,a mechanical contractor,dismantled and removed the machine.the removal of the extruder left a large hole in the floor of the mezzanine,with a high curb around it,that valley welding failed to secure prior to leaving the site.aamold recognized a danger,and apprised mariani mechanics so that they would address the problem.mariani employees placed sheet metal and a plastic pallet over the opening,but did not bolt down the materials.the hole was in this condition for about a week prior to the incident at issue.
on march,walther electric crew returned to the san jose plant after a stint at the new vacaville facility.the crew arrived at the site about minutes before their foreman did,and began some electrical mapping work.around,while aamold was talking to the foreman,pettigrew fell through the extruder opening in the mezzanine to the floor below.he was severely injured.pettigrew said he was tracing electrical lines on the ceiling when he fell,but there were no eyewitnesses.pettigrew knew the opening was there,having seen it when the machine was removed,but had been absent from the site for about a week.
insurance background 
at the time of the pettigrew incident,food pro was covered by a million cgl insurance policy issued by farmers the cgl policy states generally that farmers will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies and will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.the cgl policy is modified by the following endorsement entitled,architects or surveyors professional liability this insurance does not apply to bodily injury,arising out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services by or for you,including.the preparing,approving,or failing to prepare or approve maps,drawings,opinions,reports,surveys,change orders,designs,specifications and.supervisory,inspection or engineering services.
in july,explorer insurance company explorer,the insurer responsible for pettigrew workers compensation benefits,notified food pro of a claim against food pro for reimbursement of the benefits paid to pettigrew.upon receipt of the letter from explorer,food pro notified farmers of the claim and farmers began an investigation.farmers representative obtained a recorded statement from aamold and william washburn,food pro president,on august.the representative also received a copy of the mariani contract and aamold log notes for the relevant period of time.on october,farmers notified food pro that it believed farmers had no obligation to indemnify food pro for the pettigrew incident,citing the professional services exclusion.food pro requested reconsideration of farmers position,explaining that the incident was not connected to food pro rendering or failing to render professional services.
in november,farmers referred the matter to outside counsel,berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone berger kahn for a coverage opinion.berger kahn agreed with farmers initial assessment and further found no duty to defend.before farmers had communicated this position to food pro,farmers received notice that pettigrew and explorer had filed suit against food pro.pettigrew complaint against food pro,mariani,and others,filed on march,alleged general negligence and premises liability.pettigrew claimed that the defendants failed to properly cover or guard the hole place warnings around the hole creating a dangerous condition and negligently allowed required and ordered pettigrew to work in the area of the dangerous hole.explorer,in a separate action,asserted a single cause of action against food pro for general negligence food pro tendered the defense of these actions to farmers,which then forwarded the complaints to berger kahn to reexamine farmers duties in light of the complaints allegations.berger kahn reiterated its recommendation to deny coverage.
on may,farmers informed food pro that it had concluded that it has no obligation or duty to defend or indemnify food pro in regard to the pettigrew or explorer actions and again cited the professional services exclusion.food pro objected to the denial of coverage on at least two subsequent occasions,providing additional information regarding the incident.additional correspondence between the parties followed,but farmers did not change its position.farmers asserted rationale was that the only reason that food pro was present at the site was to perform a contract for consulting engineering services thus,the claims sought by pettigrew and explorer were not covered.
in january,farmers sought a second coverage opinion from gordon rees regarding the claims against food pro.gordon rees likewise concluded that farmers had no duty to defend or to indemnify food pro due to the application of the professional services exclusion.additional correspondence with food pro and its counsel followed as food pro continued to assert that the allegations involved only ordinary negligence,not professional negligence,and stressed that food pro had no responsibility for the removal of the extruder.in july of,farmers offered to settle with food pro without admission of coverage or liability.the offer was left open until march,through settlement talks in the underlying actions,but food pro did not accept the offer to compromise.
initially,food pro retained counsel to defend the pettigrew and explorer actions,but food pro counsel eventually received permission to withdraw for nonpayment of fees.in march,unable to continue to defend the action due to a lack of funds,food pro agreed to have its answer stricken and a default judgment entered.after the default hearing on march,judgment was entered in favor of pettigrew in the net amount of and in favor of explorer in the net amount of.food pro tendered the judgments to farmers for payment.farmers denied the tender on september.
current action 
food pro filed a complaint against farmers on october,asserting breach of contract based on farmers refusal to defend food pro in the pettigrew and explorer actions and tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the complaint seeks both compensatory and punitive damages.
farmers moved for summary judgment.the trial court order,filed on november,states in relevant part the exclusion in the policy does not apply to food pro failure to render professional services that it was not obligated to render.in this case,there was an underlying factual dispute concerning whether food pro was responsible for creating or correcting the dangerous condition or for generally maintaining the safety of the san jose facility.until this underlying factual dispute was resolved,a legal determination could not be made as to whether pettigrew injuries occurred during food pro performance of professional services and whether pettigrew injuries were caused by the deliberate and intentional act of the rendering of professional services or advice.farmers had a duty to defend food pro until this potential for coverage was eliminated the court further denied farmers motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action,noting that an insurer reliance on the advice of counsel does not insulate it from a bad faith claim if the advice is unreasonable.however,the court granted farmers motion for summary adjudication as to the punitive damages claim,concluding that farmers had established that food pro does not have clear and convincing evidence of fraud,malice,or oppression.
farmers brought an ex parte application to modify the court summary judgment order and for other ancillary relief.in response,the trial court clarified its november order by stating,in part,that farmer motion was denied on the ground that farmers failed to meet its burden of establishing the absence of any potential for coverage because its evidence showed that there was a potential for coverage.the order also noted that the court had not granted summary judgment or adjudication to food pro,who had not moved for summary judgment.this court denied farmers subsequent petition for writ of mandate.
one month later,the duty to defend issue was again presented to the trial court in the form of a court trial.the parties made available the same evidence relied on in the summary judgment motion and presented a joint exhibit list for review.on december,the trial court issued its statement of decision.the court found that food pro easily established a prima facie case for coverage and a duty to defend by introducing the cgl policy and third party complaints filed against it in the underlying action.the court concluded a s a matter of law,however,that the undisputed extrinsic evidence known to farmers at the time of tender,and relied upon by farmers to deny coverage,conclusively negates coverage and establishes that the only reasonable conclusion possible is that the injury to pettigrew arose out of the rendering or failure to render professional services by or for foodpro employee,aamold,including supervisory,inspection or engineering services.the court found specifically that food pro was responsible for issuing all instructions to contractors and coordinating all contractor activities on site and that aamold log notes undisputedly established that he directed pettigrew and the walther electric crew to work in the area of the hole on the morning of the incident.the court thus concluded that the undisputed evidence establishes that the bodily injury suffered by pettigrew arose out of foodpro rendering of supervisory services,which is excluded under endorsement.
the trial court further found that because the injury occurred as a result of the rendering of professional services,which are intentionally provided,there was no occurrence under the terms of the policy and,therefore,no coverage.finally,the trial court found no reasonable expectation of coverage under the policy and held that judgment should be entered for farmers.
food pro subsequent motion for a new trial was denied,and the court entered judgment for farmers on january.food pro timely appealed.on appeal,food pro challenges both the duty to defend determination and the punitive damages ruling in the summary judgment order.
ii.discussion 
duty to defend 
we consider first food pro contention that the trial court erred in concluding that undisputed extrinsic evidence established that there was no potential for coverage and,thus,no duty to defend.
standard of review 
appellate courts apply an independent standard of review to decisions interpreting,constructing,and applying insurance policies to determine the scope of actual or potential coverage.powerine oil,superior court cal th,d.more specifically,w hen determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.
a cgl policy,often referred to as a business general liability policy,provides liability insurance for businesses.waller,supra,cal th at,d.in general,cgl policies are limited to providing coverage for accidental occurrences,and do not provide coverage for professional negligence claims.tradewinds escrow,truck ins.exchange th,d tradewinds.the policy is written in two essential parts the insuring agreement,which states the risk or risks covered by the policy,and the exclusion clauses,which remove coverage for risks that would otherwise fall within the insuring clause.waller,at,d.p olicy exclusions are strictly construed citations,while exceptions to exclusions are broadly construed in favor of the insured,zurich american ins.cal th,d.
general principles relating to the duty to defend 
it has long been a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller,supra,cal th at,d,montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.the duty to defend is both separate from and broader than a duty to indemnify.waller,at,d,horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d,horace mann.thus,to prevail in a duty to defend action the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential t he insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.montrose,at,d,italics in original.because the duty is based upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit,the duty may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.citation.montrose,at,d.as our high court has explained,i mposition of an immediate duty to defend is necessary to afford the insured what it is entitled to the full protection of a defense on its behalf.ibid.
t he determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.waller,supra,cal th at,d,ray valley forge ins.th,d.conversely,where the extrinsic facts eliminate the potential for coverage,the insurer may decline to defend even when the bare allegations in the complaint suggest potential liability.waller,at,d,see also atlantic mutual ins.lamb,th,d atlantic a n insurer may rely on an exclusion to deny coverage only if it provides conclusive evidence demonstrating that the exclusion applies.
professional services exclusion 
farmers position is that the mariani contract and aamold log notes established without dispute that the insured conduct fell squarely within the professional services exclusion and,thus,there was no duty to defend.food pro counters that farmers and the trial court mischaracterize the extrinsic evidence as undisputed and apply the professional services exclusion so broadly that the exception swallows the rule.we find merit in food pro argument.
professional services,broadly defined,involve specialized knowledge,labor,or skill,and the labor or skill involved is predominantly mental or intellectual.tradewinds,supra,th,d.food pro cgl policy further defines professional services as preparing,approving,maps,drawings,opinions,reports,surveys,change orders,designs,specifications,and s upervisory,inspection or engineering services.we note at the outset that it is clear that food pro,as an engineering consultant for equipment installation,provides professional services as the term is used in the cgl policy.moreover,food pro contract with mariani involved the provision of professional services,including the development of detailed designs and specifications and supervision of the plant relocation.this fact is not disputed.the issue presented involves the extent of food pro professional services,the nature of aamold actions as they relate to the pettigrew incident,and the breadth of the professional services exclusion.
first,we consider the court summation of the undisputed evidence.the trial court,without recognizing any alternative theories or contradictory evidence,accepted as undisputed farmers explanation of aamold role at the san jose plant and his involvement with walther electric on the day of the incident.the court stated broadly that a lthough foodpro was not expressly responsible for the safety of the san jose site by the terms of its contract with mariani,it was responsible for issuing all instructions to contractors,administering all building modification and equipment installation contracts,and coordinating all contractor activities.additionally,the court reasoned that aamold was indeed providing professional services at the san jose facility when he sent pettigrew to work in the area of the hole left by the removal of the extruder.knowing that the walther foreman responsible for his crew safety was not present and would not arrive until,aamold notes show that he ordered pettigrew and the other electricians at to start work near the area of the dangerous condition.pettigrew accident occurred shortly thereafter,while aamold was talking to the walther foreman.
the summary of food pro role at the san jose plant and the recital of aamold interaction with walther electric on march gloss over several contested details that impact the professional services analysis.from the first conversation with farmers,aamold and washburn explained unequivocally that it was mariani responsibility to cover the extruder opening.they noted that food pro was not obligated to ensure the safety of the site,that each contractor had its own set of safety standards,and that food pro informed the contractors that it was their responsibility to check the work areas and to confirm they were safe.aamold and washburn also explained that food pro role was to determine which equipment needed to be disconnected at what time and to keep the contractors to this overall schedule.it was,however,up to the individual contractor to determine how to complete each project that was an identified step in the relocation process.in other words,food pro supervisory role was limited to coordination of the overall process and the contractors were responsible for the details of their work.in addition,mariani hired valley welding to relocate the machine without food pro involvement and valley welding removed the extruder under direct instruction from the mariani staff.
at aamold november deposition,he reiterated that he was not under an obligation to ensure the safety conditions at the site and further explained he did not have the authority to direct mariani employees,just to request and advise he also reiterated that the removal of the extruder was independently arranged between miguel guzman of mariani and valley welding and was not part of our responsibility.
aamold interactions on march with the walther electric crew are likewise disputed.during the recorded conversation with farmers in august,aamold explained that before the foreman arrival,the walther electric crew began some electrical tracing work related to the extruder.they had disconnected the machine in a hurried fashion about a week earlier,and needed to verify the routing information to reinstall the machine in vacaville.aamold did not direct the crew that morning aamold presumed they were following prior orders from their foreman.aamold reiterated in his deposition that the crew,in the absence of their foreman,understood what needed to be done,and they were proceeding with their tracing of lines and doing their disconnect work.the crew had planned what to do a week earlier,before their break from the san jose site.thus,according to aamold,the crew was completing a predetermined project prior to their foreman arrival and at the time of pettigrew accident.this contradicts the court conclusion,based solely on aamold sparse log notes,that the crew had begun new work on the fruit stick line at aamold express direction at the time pettigrew was injured 
the above to farmers at the time of the initial declination of coverage in october and reaffirmed while the underlying actions were a plausible,description of aamold role and actions on march that differs significantly from the trial court summation and from farmers position on appeal.these facts indicate that food pro professional services to mariani did not extend to the creation of the hole,the safety of the site,or the direction of pettigrew and the walther electric crew to the extruder area on the morning of march.in other words,aamold was not providing supervisory or engineering services,or any other specialized skill,in relation to pettigrew accident.
food pro facts instead suggest aamold involvement in the accident was merely as an observer who noticed the danger and notified the responsible party.thus,any failure to rectify the situation or warn of the danger,as alleged in the pettigrew complaint,would implicate only ordinary negligence.pettigrew claimed that the defendants,including food pro,failed to secure the hole and negligently allowed required and ordered pettigrew to work in the area of the dangerous hole.the alleged link between food pro responsibility for pettigrew injury and its professional services is its supervisory role,the extent of which is disputed.the complaint does not allege,for instance,that the injury was related to food pro designs or specifications for the relocation and installation of mariani processing operations,or to other engineering work.this is consistent with mariani against food pro,which does not include any claim for breach of the consulting contract or for any form of professional malpractice.the facts available to farmers at the time it denied a duty to defend thus show potential liability arising from the breach of a common law duty,and not from the performance of professional services.faced with the disputed facts revealing a possibility the claim was covered,farmers could have filed a declaratory relief action or otherwise sought a judicial determination regarding its duty to defend.see generally amato mercury casualty company th,d amato if duty to defend is unclear,the insurer may,in addition to simply denying the defense,defend with a reservation of rights,file a separate declaratory relief action,file a for declaratory relief in the underlying action,or deny the request with the promise to reimburse if later investigation shows a defense is owed.absent a trial to resolve the genuine factual dispute,farmers could not conclusively negate the potential for coverage and,therefore,had a duty to defend food pro.see atlantic,supra,th,d amato,at,d,citing horace mann,supra,cal th,d,the existence of a disputed fact determinative of coverage,establishes the duty to defend.
farmers contends,however,that under any interpretation of the facts,aamold was only at the site to perform his professional duties thus,any act of his at the site that resulted in injury arises from a professional service and is covered by the exclusion.as support for this broad interpretation of the professional services exclusion,farmers primarily relies upon tradewinds,supra,th,d and a handful of additional cases considering the professional services exclusion.we find the cases factually distinguishable,and conclude that they do not support the broad interpretation of the professional services exclusion that farmers sets forth.
in tradewinds,the plaintiff in the underlying action alleged that the insured,an escrow company,wrongfully failed to close escrow on a home she sought to purchase,causing the transaction to fail.tradewinds,supra,th at,d.the escrow company insurer refused to defend,citing a professional services exclusion that extended to the services of escrow agents.id.at,d.in considering the applicability of the professional services exclusion,the tradewinds court noted that the unifying factor in cases upholding the exclusion is whether the injury occurred during the performance of professional services,not the instrumentality of the injury.tradewinds,at,d,citing antles aetna casualty surety d.antles and hollingsworth commercial union ins.d.hollingsworth.the court then found that the buyer claims against the escrow company fell within the exclusion because the alleged wrongful acts were committed during the performance of professional services,namely,the rendering of escrow services.tradewinds,at,d.
tradewinds is not controlling in the instant case.there,it was undisputed that escrow services were the professional services that the escrow company provided and to which the exclusion applied.see tradewinds,supra,th at,d.there was no negligence claim and the allegations of intentional misconduct related to the provision,or lack thereof,of escrow services to one of the parties to the real estate transaction.see id.at,d.in addition,the court alternatively found no coverage because intentional conduct was excluded under the policy.id.at,d.here,the pettigrew complaint does not allege misconduct relating to the adequacy of food pro performance of professional services to its client,mariani.accepting food pro facts regarding the extent of its site supervision and contractor direction,the underlying actions implicate only a separate act of ordinary negligence involving a third party.nevertheless,farmers seizes upon the tradewinds court general observation regarding the instrumentality of the injury to argue that the professional services exclusion requires only a temporal connection between the allegedly wrongful act and the performance of professional services if the injury occurred while the insured was performing professional services,it arises out of the rendering of professional services regardless of the connection,or lack thereof,between the allegedly wrongful acts and the professional services.
to apply properly the quoted statement in tradewinds,which purports only to summarize a common thread in professional services exclusion cases,and to place farmers argument in context,we examine the facts in tradewinds authorities and the related case relied upon by farmers.in hollingsworth,the court considered only whether the piercing of a customer ears by an employee of a cosmetics business was a professional service.hollingsworth,supra,d at.the piercing of the customer ears resulted in serious injury,and the court held that in the context of a cosmetics business,ear piercing clearly constitutes a professional service as distinguished from an activity incidentally related to its everyday operations.id.at.in antles,the insured was a chiropractor and the injured party a patient.antles,supra,d at.the injury occurred when a heat lamp fell and burned the patient during a chiropractic treatment.id.at.the heat lamp had been negligently installed by a third party,but the court found that because the lamp was being actively used in the chiropractic treatment,the professional service,the injury arose from the performance of a professional service and the exclusion applied.id.at.finally,in northern insurance superior court d.northern insurance,the insured was a doctor and the injured party a patient who was injured during a medical procedure.the doctor mistakenly performed an abortion on the patient,after his medical staff confused the plaintiff charts with those of another patient.id.at.the court found that a doctor has a professional duty to correctly identify the patient before undertaking a procedure,and concluded that the injury occurred during,and as a direct result of the performance of professional services.id.at.
with this background,we read tradewinds summation of the reach of the professional services exclusion as follows the act that precipitated the injury need not have been one of professional malpractice,as long as the plaintiff was injured in the performance of the professional service.in antles,the negligent installation of the lamp could be said to be the instrumentality of the injury,but the injury occurred during the chiropractic treatment and therefore arose from the performance of a professional service.likewise,in northern insurance,the negligent identification of the patient by medical staff might have been the instrumentality of the injury,but the injury occurred during the doctor performance of the incorrect medical procedure 
these cases are distinguishable from,and the proposition stated in tradewinds inapplicable to,the instant case.the injury in each arose from the performance of a professional service,not merely at the same time the insured was otherwise providing professional services to a third party.here,the only link between food pro rendering of engineering services and pettigrew injury is that the allegedly wrongful actions occurred while food pro was on site to provide professional services to mariani.as food pro evidence shows,it did not design or direct the removal of the extruder,nor did it direct pettigrew actions on march as part of its professional services.in other words,aamold involvement in the pettigrew incident arose from his presence at the site,but the injury did not aris e out of the rendering or failure to render any professional services.the pettigrew and explorer actions therefore raised the potential for coverage under the cgl policy,and farmers had a duty to defend.
our conclusion is consistent with the requirement that the court construe policy exclusions narrowly.farmers proposed interpretation of the provision,if accepted,would render the cgl policy inapplicable to any incident that occurs while food pro is
