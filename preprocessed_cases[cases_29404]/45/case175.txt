we have not previously addressed the issue raised in this erisa appeal,which comes to us from the district court entry of summary judgment concluding that a claims administrator denial of disability benefits was not arbitrary and capricious.the plaintiff appeals and asserts that his erisa rights were violated because the administrator relied on material mischaracterizations of the medical record.
the claims administrator,prudential insurance company of america,and getronics wang,llc,the employer,stated that they based their denial of disability benefits to former wang employee thomas buffonge on four pieces of evidence.the denial rested heavily,but not exclusively,on the opinion of jonathan rutchik,a consultant hired by prudential who did not examine buffonge but who reviewed buffonge medical history and concluded that there was a consensus that buffonge could perform sedentary duties,such as keyboard work.in fact,the medical records showed that no such consensus existed,and,in other ways,rutchik report materially mischaracterized buffonge medical history.prudential also rested its benefits denial on the report of another physician,but that report supported the grant,not the denial,of benefits.further,buffonge medical records,on which prudential also purportedly relied,demonstrated the two points made above.
we conclude that the process used was materially tainted,and the taint was sufficiently prejudicial,so as to render the process arbitrary.we remand to the district court to remand to the claims administrator for a new review of buffonge claim.we emphasize that we do not reach the issue of whether buffonge was disabled.
we recount the record which was before the claims administrator.see liston unum.officer severance plan,cir where review is under the arbitrariness standard,the ordinary question is whether the administrator action on the record before him was unreasonable.
buffonge medical history 
buffonge began working for wang in.at that time,he became a participant in wang employee benefits plan,which included a disability benefits program wang contracted with prudential to provide the program,and prudential serves as the program claims administrator.the plan provides that an employee is eligible for disability benefits after he or she has been totally disabled for weeks.total disability exists when the following conditions are met 
due to sickness or accidental injury,both of these are true 
a you are not able to perform,for wage or profit,the material and substantial duties of your occupation.
b after the initial duration of a period of total disability,you are not able to perform for wage or profit the material and substantial duties of any job for which you are reasonably fitted by your education,training or experience 
you are not working at any job for wage or profit.
you are under the regular care of a doctor.
in,buffonge was a field logistics coordinator at wang.the job involved helping track and ship computer parts to different offices across the country it required some lifting as well as computer and other desk work.in june,buffonge injured his neck and back while moving computer parts at the office.his discomfort worsened as the weeks passed,and,by july,buffonge was reporting severe pain in his chest,radiating into his left arm and elbow.on july,examining physician wendell pierce diagnosed cervical disc disease with left radiculitis and wrote that buffonge was in a great degree of discomfort.
buffonge took leave from work on temporary disability from august until april.he then returned to work for one week,but suffered pain while driving to and from the office,and so took leave again until early november.buffonge was treated repeatedly during this period for continuing pain in his neck,back,and chest.in august,stephen lipson examined buffonge on referral from james bayley,one of buffonge regular physicians.lipson diagnosed buffonge as suffering from at least one and possibly two herniated discs he described buffonge pain as worse with sitting,standing,and lifting,better with walking and better with bedrest.
buffonge also saw david duhme,a specialist in internal medicine at harvard university health services,who had served as buffonge main treating physician since soon after his initial injury.in a report dated july,duhme stated that he ha d been seeing buffonge frequently and had referred him for orthopedic evaluation.he stated that buffonge was frustrated at his repeated failures to return to work without aggravating the pain.
buffonge personnel records show that he had been placed on modified duty perhaps as early as the summer of thereafter,while he still had the mostly duties of a field logistics coordinator,those duties were altered to avoid regular lifting and other physical labor despite these accommodations,buffonge november return to wang lasted less than one month.on december,buffonge visited duhme for a examination.duhme report stated that buffonge tried to return to work but now is out of work again due to neck pain radiating to the left arm with numbness in the left fingers h e would stand all day at work because the pain was worse sitting.he diagnosed buffonge as suffering from both cervical and lumbar disc disease.
in january,buffonge attempted another return to work,but his attendance during the months that followed was sporadic at best he was unable to work a full week,and even when he was at work he reported an intermittent inability to concentrate due to episodes of severe pain.in september,buffonge was examined by john duff at the request of wang lawyers duff reported that buffonge has headaches and he says that he has trouble driving and by the end of the day,his low back gets sore and he moves from different positions but apparently continues to have the complaints.buffonge also told duff that he has chest pains when he sits too long and now gets low back pain.duff concluded that despite his pain,buffonge should have been able to perform a full day work so long as he shifted positions during the work day and avoided heavy lifting.
by october,when he saw duhme again,buffonge was reporting serious pain,especially late in the day and late in the week.duhme examined him that day in the diagnosis section of his report he again wrote cervical disc disease and lumbar disc disease,and this time added that the latter was becoming chronic pain.duhme concluded that buffonge needed to take some time off of work.later in october,buffonge tried to go to work once again,but he experienced such intense pain that he had to get down on his hands and knees to control it.he visited duhme office that afternoon duhme examined buffonge and observed in his report that w hen he straightens up from a position his whole right side of the back is bulging with muscle spasm.he diagnosed e xacerbation of lumbar intervertebral disc disease with objective signs of pain and spasm.
on november,buffonge again visited duhme,who reported that buffonge u sually goes into work,tries to work,and may have to stop and lie down.he does not think he can carry on.duhme assessed him as suffering from i ncreasing pain from cervical disc disease and gave him a letter authorizing a medical leave of absence for a few weeks.it is not clear precisely when buffonge leave began however,the record indicates that he missed work for five consecutive weeks in december and january while receiving treatment.
on january,a report by frederick spinal surgeon who examined buffonge on referral from that buffonge had developed worse pain in his head and neck two months earlier.mansfield report diagnosed buffonge with c ervical and lumbar disc degeneration and stated that a ny exercise or increased bending or twisting increases his pain.
buffonge returned to work yet again in late january.he had been attending physical therapy for some time as part of his treatment,and on february,he was discharged from the physical therapy program the therapist wrote in his discharge statement that he was and symptom free when last seen.on february,however,buffonge visited duhme again and reported that he had been suffering severe pain.duhme assessed buffonge as having chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease and reported that buffonge was undergoing acupuncture and would be in for evaluations.six days later,on february,buffonge left work because of the pain it would prove to be his last day on the job.
on june,buffonge applied to prudential for disability benefits.in the attending physician section of the application duhme reported his diagnosis that buffonge suffered from chronic neck,shoulder and chest pain aggravated by work,and that chronic intervertebral disc disease resulted in buffonge long term disability.he reported that buffonge had tried many times to return to work and failed because pain returns whenever he returns to work for more than wks.asked whether buffonge could work or in another type of job,duhme wrote,do know but probably not.asked what work duties buffonge could perform,he wrote,none.
thereafter,duhme saw buffonge several times during the spring and early summer.he reported each time that buffonge was in pain and was still disabled from working.
on june,another doctor examined buffonge at prudential request.william kermond found that buffonge suffered from disc herniation and that physical examination substantiated buffonge complaints of neck,arm,and chest pain.kermond also stated that buffonge injuries appeared causally related to his accident at work.however,he concluded that buffonge could perform a desk job with phone and computer duties,so long as he did not engage in heavy lifting or frequent overhead work.as the record shows,buffonge had been placed in exactly such a desk job as early as,and his medical history thereafter was described above.
b.the denial of benefits and subsequent appeals 
prudential examined buffonge medical records and denied his claim for disability benefits on september.it noted that the february physical therapy discharge summary had deemed buffonge,kermond had opined that buffonge could perform a desk job,and wang had made accommodations for buffonge,including placing him on light duty and permitting him to get up and walk around every hour.it therefore concluded that there was no objective medical evidence in our file to support total disability.
buffonge employment was terminated on october,a month later,he administratively appealed prudential benefits decision.prudential upheld its denial in a letter dated november.it stated that buffonge did not qualify for disability because according to kermond,he could perform a job involving desk work or light lifting as of june,and therefore he had not been totally disabled for weeks after he left work in february,as required under the plan definition of total disability.buffonge again appealed,and prudential affirmed its denial again,on the same grounds,in a letter dated june.
on july,buffonge filed his final administrative appeal.this time he submitted additional reports and letters from two primary physician,duhme,and another examining physician,emilio support of his claim.jacques,an orthopedist,examined buffonge on april,june,and july,and concluded each time that buffonge was fully disabled his report of june,submitted with buffonge final appeal,stated that buffonge had told him his pain is constant and he is only able to maintain activity for one to two hours.jacques concluded that buffonge was disabled and unable to resume his occupation and that the disability was causally related to his work accident.
a examination by jacques,conducted on august,produced a report that buffonge submitted as a supplement to the appeal.in the august report jacques detailed his findings on examination and then reiterated the conclusion he had reached in all his earlier reports,stating i n my opinion buffonge is disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.he also added 
in my opinion he is disabled from repetitive bending,lifting,pushing,pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds and he is disabled from any repetitive squatting and crawling positions.
the letter from duhme,dated july,stated the doctor conclusion,based on numerous examinations of buffonge that buffonge was completely disabled by chronic neck pain due to cervical disc disease and low back pain due to lumbar disc disease.he wrote that buffonge was unable to perform any job that i can think of,that e ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,and that buffonge was unable to devote his attentions to any work.
as part of its handling of buffonge appeal,prudential hired jonathan rutchik as a consultant.rutchik spent a total of three hours reviewing buffonge records and writing a report he did not examine buffonge personally.in his report,dated october,rutchik wrote that a consensus exists about the fact that boffonge sic can perform work tasks such as sedentary duties and keyboard work.he therefore concluded that buffonge could have performed the largely duties of his job as a field logistics coordinator at wang.
rutchik reached this conclusion by parsing and in part disregarding the findings of physicians who had examined buffonge.for example,he quoted jacques assessment that buffonge was disabled from repetitive bending,lifting,pushing,pulling and carrying over fifteen to twenty pounds and followed it with this comment jacques was specific about the tasks that buffonge could not do and thus inferred that there were jobs he could do.he thus ignored jacques statement in the same report that buffonge was disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.as to duhme conclusion,based on multiple physical examinations and years of handling buffonge case,that e ither sustained activity or sustained sitting will aggravate these pains,rutchik wrote t his letter provided no objective evidence that he has a condition where he could not do sustained sitting or sustained activity.he did not address duhme statements in the same letter that buffonge was unable to perform any job that i can think of and unable to devote his attentions to any work.
prudential subsequently denied buffonge appeal in a letter dated november.it stated 
b ased on a review of buffonge medical file,the restrictions provided by kermond on june,and by jacques on august,and the information provided by rutchik,we do not find that buffonge symptoms impaired him from performing the duties of his occupation for the period february,through august.therefore,we are upholding our decision to deny buffonge claim 
prudential thus identified four bases for its denial buffonge full medical file,the kermond report,the august jacques report,and the rutchik report.
buffonge filed suit on november,for review of prudential denial pursuant to the employee retirement income security act erisa,et.specifically,buffonge sought relief under section,erisa civil enforcement provision,which permits a participant in an benefit plan to sue to recover benefits due and to enforce rights under the plan.a b buffonge argued that wang and prudential violated the plan terms and wrongfully denied him disability coverage he sought a retroactive award of benefits 
the parties agreed that the wang benefits plan confers discretionary authority to the administrator to determine eligibility for benefits.as the district court noted,that meant prudential decision to deny buffonge benefits was subject to deference,to be reversed only if arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.gannon metro.life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under the arbitrary and capricious framework,as applied to erisa review,a decision will be upheld if it is reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.id.at.
on october,wang and prudential moved for summary judgment,arguing that their decision to deny benefits was supported by substantial evidence and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious.buffonge filed an opposition and for summary judgment,arguing that rutchik report was skewed,that prudential relied on it in denying him benefits,and that as a result prudential did not give adequate weight to the conclusions of his treating physicians.he did not argue that the conclusions of his treating physicians deserved special could he have,given the supreme court holding that courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician.black decker disability plan nord,d.
applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,the district court granted summary judgment for wang and prudential.the court began by finding that,contrary to buffonge contention,rutchik report did not ignore or intentionally misinterpret the conclusions of duhme and jacques.this was so for two reasons.first,the court noted,rutchik report contained multiple references to and repeated discussion of the other doctors reports.second,the court in essence agreed with rutchik parsing of the jacques report since the rutchik report was valid,the court reasoned,prudential had been faced with a situation,and the case therefore fit within the rule that the existence of medical evidence pointing in two directions does not render arbitrary or capricious a plan administrator decision to credit one viewpoint or the other.see,leahy raytheon,cir vlass raytheon employees disability trust,cir gannon,at.from this grant of summary judgment buffonge timely appealed.
our review of the district court grant of summary judgment on the administrative record is de novo.glista unum life ins.of,cir.we,like the district court,must defer to the claims administrator benefits decision,disturbing it only if it was arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.gannon,at 
buffonge argument focuses most heavily on the rutchik report.buffonge argues that rutchik distorted and misrepresented the medical record,discounted conclusions by duhme and jacques that buffonge was fully disabled,and falsely claimed a consensus that buffonge could perform sedentary work.he argues that prudential was intimately familiar with buffonge medical records,and it therefore had to know that rutchik was misreading the jacques and duhme reports.he says prudential heavy reliance on the rutchik report,combined with its citation of the jacques report as support for its decision when the report clearly cut the other way,renders the decision arbitrary and capricious.we agree.
a.the evidence 
as previously noted,prudential cited four pieces of evidence in support of its final decision buffonge medical file as a whole,the kermond report,the august jacques report,and the rutchik report.of these four,at least rutchik report and the jacques not provide reasoned support for prudential decision.we examine them in turn.
the rutchik report 
rutchik report suffers from fundamental flaws.as an initial matter,rutchik conclusion that a consensus exists that buffonge could perform a desk job is far from accurate.buffonge medical record as of october,the date of rutchik report,contained at least three recent reports from jacques concluding just the opposite.rutchik also had before him the reports of duhme,buffonge longtime treating physician,who had repeatedly examined buffonge and deemed him fully disabled,and who had stated that very summer that buffonge could not engage in sustained sitting or devote his attentions to any work.the duhme reports alone preclude rutchik finding of a consensus that buffonge could perform desk work.similarly,his conclusion that there was no objective evidence to support duhme conclusion is contradicted by duhme personal observations on examination of buffonge.
rutchik parsing of jacques august report is also,we think,not a fair reading.the jacques report explicit statement that buffonge was disabled from any gainful employment emphasis added does not lend itself to the inference that there were jobs that buffonge could do.this is especially true considering that jacques had filed at least three other reports concluding that buffonge was fully disabled.
the flaws in the rutchik report are crucial to our analysis for several reasons.the report mischaracterizations are material,and so it does not provide support for prudential decision.further,the fact that prudential relied on the rutchik report at all brings into question the integrity of prudential process in this case.prudential had before it all of buffonge records,and it had to be aware that the rutchik report misconstrued the conclusions of buffonge doctors.
the august jacques report 
prudential also relied in part on the restrictions provided by jacques on august.but jacques listing of physical activities buffonge could not perform did not create the inference that any activity not on the list was one buffonge could perform.jacques began the crucial passage by stating that buffonge was disabled from any gainful employment at the present time.in light of that unequivocal statement,the specifics that from bending,lifting,to us illustrative.it would make no sense for jacques to have stated that buffonge was disabled from any gainful employment and then in the very next sentence to have implied that there was in fact gainful employment he could perform.jacques had also deemed buffonge fully disabled in all of his other reports prudential reading of the exemplars as refuting jacques consistent conclusion that buffonge was fully disabled is simply unreasonable.the august report therefore does not support prudential conclusion that buffonge could perform sedentary work 
in sum,we find that two of prudential four cited pieces of evidence fail to provide reasoned support for its conclusion we also find that prudential willingness to rely on a report it knew or should have known to be misleading,and its mischaracterization of the conclusions of jacques,raises concerns about the fairness of its process.the question is whether these flaws render the decision arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.gannon,at.we find that they do.
an administrator decision must be reasoned to survive arbitrary and capricious review,gannon,at,and we can not say that a decision relying on multiple pieces of faulty evidence was reasoned.see id.at finding that a claims administrator reasonably relied on evidence only after confirming that the evidence was credible and reliable.further,in giving content to arbitrary and capricious review in this context,we find it useful to consider other erisa provisions.global naps,verizon new england,cir noting that statutory subsections must be read in light of structure and intent of the larger statute.section of erisa,for example,states in relevant part that every employee benefit plan shall afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.emphasis added.while this language refers to the benefit plan itself and to procedural safeguards,it also has some substantive content.one decision has held that the full and fair review verbiage must be construed to protect a plan participant from arbitrary or unprincipled.grossmuller int l union,uaw,local,cir.unprincipled of the sort forbidden by section is also arbitrary not reasoned within the meaning of our review under section.this does not mean that every perceived unfairness rises to the level of arbitrariness.
we address wang and prudential two main arguments to the contrary.first,they argue,the decision was based on substantial evidence,and must be upheld,because prudential considered not just the rutchik report,but buffonge entire medical record,some of which supports prudential decision.this argument ignores the requirement that the decision must not be arbitrary.given the flaws present here,prudential and wang argument must boil down to a claim that an administrator arbitrary analysis should be ignored if the end of nonetheless be saved by a single valid piece of evidence that supports it.the argument would be stronger if the evidence here compelled or virtually compelled a conclusion that buffonge was not disabled.that is not the case buffonge claim of disability is a serious one,and he has been prejudiced by the process.we do not know what the administrator would have determined if the process had been less flawed.
second,wang and prudential reiterate the district court analysis,citing vlass for the proposition that t he existence of contradictory evidence does not,in itself,make the administrator de
