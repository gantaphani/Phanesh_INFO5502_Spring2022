when a work platform under construction for the indianapolis airport authority iaa partially collapsed on may,the inevitable search for compensation began.united airlines,the facility manager for iaa,served notice of a claim to advanced ground systems engineering engineering,the principal contractor for the project,alleging that faulty welds caused the collapse.engineering in turn tendered its defense of the claim to rtw industries,the subcontractor responsible for the welding work.rtw rejected the tender,and this litigation followed.it was interrupted,however,by arbitration between engineering and united,as called for in the contract between engineering and iaa rtw was not a party to the arbitration.
the present appeal deals with matters remaining after the completion of the arbitration.the arbitrator ruled in favor of united,awarding it.rtw,still in the lawsuit,then added a complaint against ravi talwar,the founder and former president,ceo and sole shareholder of rtw.talwar had sold his rtw shares in to another entity,but rtw asserted that talwar had a duty to indemnify rtw under the stock purchase agreement.the district court resolved the claims as follows it confirmed the arbitral award in favor of united and against engineering it granted summary judgment for engineering in its claim against rtw,finding that rtw owed engineering a duty to defend and indemnify it it granted engineering motion for costs and attorneys fees and it granted talwar motion for summary judgment,finding that he had no duty to indemnify or defend rtw.rtw now appeals.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
engineering,a california corporation with its principal place of business in that state,and iaa concluded their original contract on december.under the contract,engineering undertook to fabricate and construct a horizontal tail section work platform,which was to be used in performing work on boeing aircraft at an iaa maintenance center.in,engineering entered into an agreement with rtw which was an indiana corporation doing business as indiana bridge division we refer to it as rtw,to avoid confusion with a later illinois corporation also named indiana bridge.in that agreement,rtw agreed to provide all material and labor to fabricate,blast clean,and shop paint the assemblies in accordance with engineering specifications.
as noted above,on may,there was a partial collapse of the work platform.united,iaa,and engineering alleged that rtw welding work was responsible for the accident,because the welds were of insufficient depth and bonding.after the notices of claim and tenders of defenses took place,engineering filed this case,requesting a declaration obliging rtw to defend and indemnify engineering with respect to any claims brought by iaa or united,standing in iaa shoes.engineering also sought a declaration of the rights and duties it and united had that arose out of the contract between engineering and iaa.the district court ruled in favor of engineering on the first claim the second no longer concerns us.the court stated that it understood engineering to be seeking a declaration that rtw had a duty both to defend and to indemnify it with respect to the united claims that went to arbitration and on which united recovered.applying california law,the court concluded that the clause in which rtw promised to indemnify engineering also included a duty to defend.on appeal,rtw claims that this was an error,as was the court related decision to award attorneys fees to engineering.in a later order,the district court also ruled that talwar had no duty to indemnify rtw pursuant to a stock purchase agreement,under which he sold all of his shares in rtw to indiana bridge,the illinois corporation,to which we refer as ibi,nor did he have a common law duty to indemnify rtw.this ruling is the target of the other part of rtw appeal.
we begin with the question whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of engineering on the question of rtw duty to defend and indemnify it.the logical starting point is the contractual language in the agreement between engineering and rtw on which this duty hinges,which we set forth here 
supplier warrants 
a that goods and services covered by this purchase order will conform to the specifications,design,drawing,samples and other descriptions referred to it in the purchase order,
b that such goods will be free from defects in material and workmanship,potent sic or latent,and such services will be of workmanlike quality,
c that such goods will be fit and sufficient for the ordinary purposes of such goods and services,and for such specific purposes which purchaser informs supplier the goods and services are intended.
these warranties shall run to purchaser,its customers and subpurchasers.
supplier shall also indemnify and hold harmless purchaser from and against any and all liabilities,judgments and damages suffered because of supplier with any of the warranties in paragraph hereinabove,which are paid or payable by purchaser upon claim or cause of action of any kind asserted by any part,including without limitation purchaser employees,purchaser customers,and subpurchasers therefrom,and supplier agents and employees,and supplier shall reimburse expenses of purchaser incidental to such claim or cause of action.
in paragraph of the agreement,the parties agreed that california law would apply to the contract.
it is clear that this contract imposed a duty on rtw to indemnify engineering the district court noted that rtw did not contest this point.the dispute here is whether it also imposes the separate duty to defend.as to this,rtw argues that the final sentence of clause plainly shows that no such duty existed.instead,the parties expected that rtw would have to reimburse engineering for expenses incidental to any covered claim.the district court acknowledged that this was a reasonable reading of that sentence,but it concluded that it was a reading at odds with california law.
the provision of california law that the district court had in mind was cal,which is titled rules for interpreting agreement of indemnity.it provides in relevant part as follows 
in the interpretation of a contract of indemnity,the following rules are to be applied,unless a contrary intention appears 
the person indemnifying is bound,on request of the person indemnified,to defend actions or proceedings brought against the latter in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity,but the person indemnified has the right to conduct such defenses,if he chooses to do so 
if,after request,the person indemnifying neglects to defend the person indemnified,a recovery against the latter suffered by him in good faith,is conclusive in his favor against the former 
cal.the district court read this that in to mean that a contract containing a duty to indemnify should be interpreted as including a duty to defend,unless the parties have expressly excluded such a duty in their agreement.it then found that the promise to pay incidental expenses in the agreement was not specific enough to negate a duty to defend.
there is a paucity of california law directly on point most of the cases construing this aspect of appear to come from the federal district courts in that state.perhaps this is a price of the apparent preference on the part of insurance companies for litigating in federal court,when diversity of citizenship is present.not surprisingly,california recognizes the distinction between the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend.see certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court,cal th,d.it describes the two duties as correlative,id.at,and like other courts,it considers the duty to defend as perforce broader than the duty to indemnify.id.at.but the question in the lloyd s case was quite different from the one now before us there,the court had to decide whether these duties were limited to civil actions in court,or if they extended to proceedings before environmental agencies.
one federal district court observed that a n insurer may assume a duty to reimburse for defense costs without assuming a duty to defend.save mart supermarkets underwriters at lloyd l
