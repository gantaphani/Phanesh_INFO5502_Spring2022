for more than years,the department of labor has considered claims adjusters exempt from the fair labor standard act overtime requirement.in,the dol promulgated,which it viewed as consistent with existing law.section exempts claims adjusters if they perform activities such as interviewing witnesses,making recommendations regarding coverage and value of claims,determining fault and negotiating settlements.
in this case,the plaintiffs are nearly former and current claims adjusters who handle,respectively,automobile damage claims,property damage claims,personal injury claims and various combinations of these.they assert that their employer improperly classified them as exempt from the flsa.the district court ruled that some of them are exempt,and some of them are not.in doing so,the district court promulgated a in claims paid per month rule,a rule that all parties to this appeal agree is neither workable nor supported by the evidence.
we hold today that all of the adjusters in this case are exempt.the district court factual findings establish that,regardless of the type personal injury property or size large small of the claims they handle,the adjusters are required to do virtually all of the very things that contemplates use discretion to determine whether the loss is covered,set reserves,decide who is to blame for the loss and negotiate with the insured or his lawyer.if the dol should choose to distinguish between adjusters based on the type or value of the claims they handle,it is free to amend the regulations and tell employers how to do that.unless and until that happens,we are obligated to follow.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
farmers business and the role of adjusters 
farmers insurance exchange fie is a reciprocal or exchange providing insurance throughout the country as a reciprocal exchange company,fie is owned by its policyholders,or subscribers,who exchange contracts with one another and,by pooling their resources,insure one another against certain losses.fie,whether on its own or through its related companies,performs all the functions of a typical insurance company,including selling policies,contracting with individual agents who sell and service policies,procuring reinsurance and adjusting claims made on its policies 
around percent of fie employees are claims adjusters.most claims adjusters work out of their homes,and fie provides them with company cars,phone lines,computer support,printers and fax machines.claims adjusters spend significant time on the road,driving to locations where a loss or accident occurred.branch managers in fie to branch offices nationwide supervise the claims adjusters.claims adjusters do not supervise other employees.
fie employs five types of claims adjusters in its personal lines business those who handle automobile property damage claims automobile damage adjusters,those who handle homeowners claims for property and contents damage property adjusters,those who handle personal injury claims liability adjusters,those who handle unique physical damage claims,rvs,mobile homes and personal injury claims foremost adjusters and another sort of hybrid claims adjuster who handles two or more types of claims adjusters.
fie puts significant emphasis on paying exactly what it owes under the policy,nothing more,nothing less.to that end,fie provides each adjuster with written guidelines and training materials to aid them in the claims handling process.some procedures are mandatory,while others are merely recommendations.adjusters are subject to quality assurance audits at any time,but most are performed after the claim is closed.the primary goal of the audits is to determine lost economic opportunity,a subjective assessment of the difference between what was paid and what could have been paid if the adjuster had correctly handled the claim.the audits ensure that adjusters are following fie best practices,which are any actions that can be implemented to prevent lost economic opportunity.fie goal is to limit overpayment to two percent for automobile damage and liability claims,and slightly more than two percent for other property losses.
claims adjusters use computer software to help them estimate the damage or loss indeed,fie expects its adjusters to use estimating software whenever possible or appropriate.estimating software acts as a price database,much like parts catalogs,vendor quotes,and jury verdicts,and its usefulness largely is dependent,in many cases,on the quality of the information the adjuster develops before turning to the estimating software.
fie claims adjusters are classified at one of three levels,depending on experience and performance claims adjuster,senior claims adjuster and special claims adjuster.within any particular line of insurance,the duties of all three are mostly the same.one difference,however,is their settlement authority.the branch manager has discretion to set each adjuster settlement authority,and generally,less experienced adjusters have lower authority levels.on any given claim,an adjuster settlement authority can be raised with supervisor approval.on average,each adjuster pays approximately million in claims per year,ranging from to per claim.
during all times relevant to this appeal,fie paid its claims adjusters on a salary basis,not an hourly basis many adjusters worked more than hours per week during the class period,but fie did not pay them overtime.
b.the lawsuits 
in late and early,a group of current and former claims adjusters filed a series of flsa actions against fie on behalf of themselves and adjusters,seeking overtime pay for the weeks in which they worked more than hours.in march,the panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the various actions to the district court below for consolidated pretrial proceedings.the district court certified a flsa collective action,which,under the act,required any unnamed former or current claims adjusters to formally if they wanted to participate.see b.of the notices sent to current and former claims adjusters,approximately opted in.
the parties later stipulated to certification of seven state law classes,comprised of individuals from colorado,illinois,michigan,minnesota,new mexico,oregon and washington.in addressing whether common questions predominate,as required by.b,the district court concluded that the administrative exemption test under the laws of the seven states at issue is substantially similar to if not identical to in some instances the federal test.
each of the state law classes was an class,that is,individuals were automatically included in the state law action unless they filed the appropriate notice with the district court.some adjusters sought relief under state law only they did not to the flsa collective action,nor did they of their respective state law class.
on the parties stipulation,the district court retained jurisdiction after class certification.the parties waived their right to a jury trial,and agreed to bifurcate the bench trial into a liability phase and,if necessary,a damages phase.the sole issue at the liability phase was whether fie properly classified its adjusters as exempt from federal and state overtime laws,and if not,whether fie could assert any defenses to liability or damages.
the district court conducted a bench trial,and then issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law.in its order,the district court concluded that i automobile damage adjusters are ii property adjusters are if more than percent of their in any one month are less than iii foremost adjusters are if they spend more than hours per week handling residential property claims on which the averages,on a monthly basis,less than iv adjusters are if they spend more than hours per week handling automobile damage claims in any amount residential property claims on which the averages,on a monthly basis,less than v all other adjusters,including liability adjusters,are exempt and vi michigan overtime law applied to fie the district court awarded nearly million to the former and current adjusters who filed the necessary claims paperwork.these appeals followed.
flsa claim 
under the flsa,certain employers must pay their employees time and a half for work in excess of hours per week 
except as otherwise provided in this section,no employer shall employ any of his employees who in any workweek is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce for a workweek longer than forty hours unless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of the hours above specified at a rate not less than one and times the regular rate at which he is employed.
a.some employees,however,are not covered by the act.at issue in this case is the exemption for persons employed in a bona fide administrative capacity.a.
the flsa delegates to the secretary of labor broad authority to define and delimit the scope of the administrative exemption.id.in accordance with that authority,the secretary has formulated a test,known as the short duties test,to determine whether employees who earn at least per week as the claims adjusters in this case for the administrative exemption.specifically,the employee primary duty must i consist of t he performance of office or nonmanual work directly related to management policies or general business operations of his employer,and ii include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.as to whether the duties test is satisfied,we must independently review the record,without deference to the district court conclusions.see bothell phase metrics,cir whether an employee activities exclude him from the benefits of the flsa is a question of law,and the district court decision is reviewed de novo.
there is no dispute that the claims adjusters in this case performed office or nonmanual work.the dispute centers around the remaining requirements of the duties test.
a.the dol regulation 
provides that 
insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption,whether they work for an insurance company or other type of company,if their duties include activities such as interviewing insureds,witnesses and physicians inspecting property damage reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates evaluating and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims determining liability and total value of a claim negotiating settlements and making recommendations regarding litigation.
a.the district court did not rely on this regulation,presumably because it was not in effect at the time the plaintiffs filed these actions.nevertheless,bears directly on our analysis.see bratt county of los angeles,cir flsa case w e must give due deference to the interpretation of statutes and regulations by the agency charged with their administration.internal quotations and ellipsis omitted.
for starters,does not represent a change in the law.when the dol promulgated,it said that the new regulation is consistent with existing section c,april.the former c provided that the test of directly related to management policies or general business operations is met by,among other persons,claim agents and adjusters.the parties agree that c reference to claim adjusters originated in a dol report that created the administrative exemption.plaintiffs argue,however,that the report was not referring to insurance claims adjusters generally,but only a claim agent who,unlike the adjusters in this case,was a employee with independent authority to settle all types of sizeable damage claims.the record shows otherwise.in a opinion letter addressing insurance claims adjusters,the dol specifically referenced that report in concluding that wage and hour has long recognized that claims adjusters typically perform work that is administrative in nature.dol wage hour div.op,at,emphasis added.
that same opinion letter concluded that,within their established authority,claims adjusters exercise the requisite discretion and independent judgment if they i make all decisions regarding coverage and liability,ii negotiate with full authority to attempt to achieve a settlement,iii make recommendations to their supervisors on the appropriate value of much larger claims,which are frequently accepted and iv work with counsel to represent the company in any litigation that ensues.id.at.essential to the dol opinion was the fact that the adjusters are not merely pursuing a standardized format for resolving claims,but rather are using their own judgment about what the facts show,who is liable,what a claim is worth,and how to handle the negotiations with either a policyholder or a.id.at.
plaintiffs dispute the relevancy of the opinion letter,arguing that it represents an on the issue of whether claims adjusters are exempt.but earlier guidance from the dol is consistent with the opinion letter.in,for example,the dol concluded that an insurer field service representative is exempt to the extent he investigates the claims,determines the extent of the damages,negotiates the settlements within the parameters of the established monetary limits,and makes recommendations with respect to larger case settlements.dol wage hour div.op,at.in a opinion letter,the dol distinguished appraisers from adjusters 
appraisers who merely inspect damaged vehicles to estimate the cost of labor and materials and to reach an agreed price for repairs with the repair shop have not been considered as the type of employees who customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment in making their estimates,they are guided primarily by their skill and experience and by written manuals of established labor and material costs 
dol wage hour div.op,at.in contrast,an adjuster investigates the validity and the extent of liability of a claim and negotiates settlement irrespective of whether the claim is one for property damage or for personal injury.id.at.and in,the dol opined that if adjusters are given reasonable latitude in carrying on negotiations with the insured,the results of which form the basis of their recommendations,they may be exempt.dol wage hour div.op,at.if those adjusters had authority to make settlements,that would be stronger evidence of their exercise of discretion and independent judgment.id.
we must give deference to the dol interpretation of its own regulations through,for example,opinion letters.webster pub.sch.employees of washington,cir citing auer robbins,d.the dol position on claims articulated in been consistent over the years,see alvarez ibp,cir an agency interpretation which conflicts with the agency earlier interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view internal quotations and alteration omitted,and we are persuaded by its reasoning,see christensen harris county,d interpretations such as opinion letters are entitled to respect to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade internal quotations and citation omitted see also auer,at.dol interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation internal quotations omitted.
b.the district court findings 
the district court found that all claims adjusters in this case i determine whether the policy covers the loss,ii recommend a reserve upon estimating fie exposure on the claim,in accordance with state law requirements,iii interview the insured and assess his or others credibility,iv advise fie regarding any fraud indicators or the potential for subrogation and underwriting risk,v negotiate settlements,vi seek additional authority from their supervisors,which is granted percent of the time,when the recommended settlement exceeds their established authority and vii communicate with opposing counsel and fie counsel.
as far as we are concerned,that says it all.the district court findings almost track word for word the language in,and thus establish that fie claims adjusters are exempt from the flsa.the lone exception appears to be that only liability adjusters make recommendations regarding litigation.the regulation,however,does not require the adjuster to perform each and every activity listed.see.at identifies the typical duties of an exempt claims adjuster emphasis added.and the fifth circuit has just held that claims adjusters for allstate insurance are exempt where they,like fie adjusters,exercised discretion in determining coverage,conducting investigations,determining liability and assigning percentages of fault to parties,negotiating a final settlement and setting and adjusting reserves based upon a preliminary evaluation of the case.cheatham allstate ins,wl cir,per curiam.lexis,at.
unlike the district court,we make no exceptions for those adjusters who handle smaller claims.even for claims on the lower end of his established settlement authority,the adjuster must first determine whether the claim is covered.once he determines that the loss is covered,the adjuster can settle it without supervisor approval.and while supervisor approval is necessary before fie denies a claim,in such cases the adjuster often prepares a draft denial letter with the recommendation to deny coverage.discretion and independent judgment do not necessarily imply that the decisions made by the employee have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of review.c.
moreover,an adjuster must estimate fie exposure on a claim before his investigation into the thus his initial settlement completed.generally,reserves are set without supervisor approval while automobile damage adjusters do not set the reserves,they do recommend an amount.see id.adjusters also conduct their own investigations,and often decide whether to obtain the assistance of experts in determining the cause of the loss.given the authority that fie adjusters have,this case is distinguishable from a recent dol opinion letter,cited by plaintiffs,in which the adjuster had to frequently seek approval before settling a claim,could not conduct additional investigation without supervisor approval and was so closely supervised that he d id not have the authority to make independent choices.dol wage hour div.op,at.
in separating out certain property adjusters,the district court went on to say that,in major losses,those resulting in settlements of over,erroneous coverage decisions can impact fie bottom line or result in bad faith claims.but the same is true of claims that cost fie less than the district court found that an erroneous denial of coverage,even on claims of relatively low value,may expose fie to legal action and damages in many jurisdictions.emphasis added.also,that coverage decisions can be more complicated because some residential losses are major is no basis to differentiate among fie property adjusters.again,the adjuster must decide if the loss is covered,which,according to the district court,requires him to make credibility determinations,evaluate the insured and possibly use outside experts.that fie ultimately denies the bulk of the coverage and pays only,based in no small part on the adjuster recommendations,should not render his otherwise qualifies for the.in any event,we see no reason nor did the district court provide one why the insured lifestyle could not be just as relevant for losses less than indeed,even small claims require scrutiny fie stated philosophy is we pay what we owe,nothing more,nothing less.
finally,the use of computer software to estimate claims does not eliminate the need for discretion and judgment any more than does resort to other reference works or to the opinions of appraisers and other experts.for instance,with respect to antique or speciality automobiles,an automobile damage adjuster can not use computer software instead,he must generate an estimate manually.also,while software exists for estimating the value of totaled vehicles,an automobile damage adjuster must use good judgment in deciding whether it is the best tool for a total loss,which accounts for to percent of his file.total loss claims that reach or exceed policy limits are often difficult to negotiate and settle,and require a very detailed evaluation.for those reasons,we disagree with the district court conclusion that automobile damage adjusters do not exercise sufficient discretion because the software limits their choices in adjusting a claim.see cheatham.lexis,at rejecting argument that adjusters are limited in their ability to negotiate by having to adhere to computer software that they must consult with manuals or guidelines does not preclude their exercise of discretion and independent judgment.
plaintiffs argue that,under fie policies,decisions delegated to claims adjusters are limited to the routine and unimportant,and that because they deliver fie product,insurance coverage to its customers,they are merely engaged in the carrying out of the business affairs rather than running the business itself.bratt,at concluding that court probation officers are.we disagree.the regulations require that the employee exercise of discretion and independent judgment be real and substantial,d,or as plaintiffs phrase it,comprise a substantial element of his primary duties.that is,the employee must exercise discretion and independent judgment in matters of significance.a.fie adjusters do precisely that.
in addition to finding that fie could be subject to state fines if reserves are set too low,the district court found that an adjuster coverage decisions are important to fie reputation with the public,and that an adjuster represent s fie to policyholders,claimants,and others involved in the claim resolution,witnesses,vendors,body shops,outside experts,police,fire personnel,attorneys,claims representatives from other companies,judges,arbitrators.see c an employee whose responsibility it is to execute or carry out policy may satisfy the directly related prong if his work is otherwise of substantial importance to the management or operation of the business see also b the administrative operations of the business include the work performed by employees engaged in servicing a business as,for example,negotiating and representing the company.in cheatham,the fifth circuit concluded that the duties of the adjusters were directly related to management policies and general business operations because they advised the management,represented allstate,and negotiated on allstate behalf.cheatham.lexis,at.
on a related point,the district court found that fie business is not limited to claims adjusting it also sells insurance products.thus,the decisions made by claims adjusters affect fie customer base,the policyholders in that,according to the district court,their eligibility for continued coverage may be affected and their premium level may be affected.this point was somehow overlooked in bell farmers ins,th,d decided under california law,in which the state court characterized fie business as perform ing a specialized function having delegated activities normally associated with an insurance business to other related companies.id.at.that fie adjusters represent the claims handling arm of the farmers insurance group of companies,id.internal quotations omitted,does not mean they fall on the production side of the worker dichotomy.to place them there would elevate form,to be substance.what matters is that fie bears the financial consequences of its adjusters coverage determinations,whether in the form of insufficient reserves or court judgments.see,dol wage hour div.op,at,adjusters perform work that is of substantial importance to general business operations i f an adjuster erroneously recommends that coverage should be denied,even on a claim of relatively low value,the insurance company may be liable for significant extra contractual damages for bad faith denial of the claim.
in summary,the district court factual findings confirm that fie liability,automobile damage and property adjusters satisfy both prongs of the duties test.they are therefore exempt from the flsa requirements.it necessarily follows,then,that foremost adjusters are,too.the district court found that foremost adjusters,to the extent they handle property damage to mobile homes,rvs,and the like,rely on specialized knowledge and discretion.in that respect,foremost adjusters are akin to property adjusters indeed,foremost adjusters use the same computer software as property adjusters,with additions tailored to the unique structures that foremost adjusters handle.and it naturally follows that adjuste
