code of civil procedure section provides in pertinent part where for money have existed between persons at any point in time when neither demand was barred by the statute of limitations,and an action is thereafter commenced by one such person,the other person may assert in the answer the defense of payment in that the two demands are compensated so far as they equal each other,notwithstanding that an independent action asserting the person claim would at the time of filing the answer be barred by the statute of limitations.if the would otherwise be barred by the statute of limitations,the relief accorded under this section shall not exceed the value of the relief granted to the other party.in other words,section permits a defendant in a civil action to assert a claim for relief in its answer and allege,in effect,that the defense claim constituted prior payment for the plaintiff claim and therefore should be set off against any award in the plaintiff favor.
in this case,the parties ask us to decide whether a comprehensive general liability insurance policy that obligates an insurer to defend and indemnify its insured against suits seeking damages thereby obligates the insurer to defend and indemnify the insured against a setoff claim asserted under section in an answer.included within this issue is the question of what exactly a setoff claim is and whether a setoff claim can result in affirmative relief against the plaintiff as can a or is limited to reducing the plaintiff recovery.we conclude that a section setoff claim can not result in affirmative relief.this conclusion is contrary to the conclusion of the court of appeal,and because the court of appeal relied on this point in finding a duty to defend and indemnify,we find it appropriate to permit the lower courts to reconsider the scope of the insurer obligations based on a correct understanding of section.as we shall explain,however,plaintiff has adequately stated a prima facie right to relief,and therefore the court of appeal was correct to reverse the trial court order sustaining a demurrer.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,without adopting that court reasoning.
factual and procedural background 
on review of an order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we take as true the factual allegations of the complaint.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d.
construction protective services,cps provides security at construction sites,and tig specialty insurance company tig insurance was,at relevant times,its general liability insurer.diversified shc was the general contractor for construction at the castlemont high school in oakland,and it hired cps to provide security at the construction site.on or about october,during the course of construction,a fire broke out at the construction site,causing damage to shc work.shc refused to pay cps,but the complaint does not make clear whether this refusal reflected dissatisfaction with cps services on account of the fire.on or about may,cps brought an action against shc to recover payment for services in the amount of.shc asserted as an affirmative defense under section that cps was legally responsible for the damage arising out of the fire and therefore that shc was entitled to set off fire damages against any amount it owed cps for security services.the complaint does not explain why shc asserted its claim by way of a section setoff rather than a.
cps tendered shc setoff claim to tig insurance,asking tig insurance to defend cps against the claim.tig insurance refused the tender and stated that it would not provide cps with a defense to the claim or indemnify cps for any setoff that was ultimately awarded.cps then employed its own counsel to oppose the setoff claim,and on or about april,it settled its dispute with shc,receiving the sum of.the complaint does not relate how cps and shc arrived at the settlement amount,or what value these litigants gave to the setoff claim.
on february,cps brought this action against tig insurance,alleging causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and asserting that tig insurance should have defended cps against shc setoff claim and indemnified cps for the setoff amount.on may,the trial court sustained tig insurance demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the complaint.the trial court concluded that under california law,an insurer does not have a duty to defend against affirmative defenses raised in response to an insured complaint against another party.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that a liability insurer duty to defend includes defense of setoff claims like the one at issue here.the court reasoned that the setoff claim constituted a suit under our definition of that term in,national union fire ins.cal th,d,and that the claim could possibly result in an award of damages against cps.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
cps argues that tig insurance should not be able to avoid its contractual obligation to defend and provide liability coverage by the fortuity that shc asserted its claim against cps as a setoff rather than as a or an independent suit.in other words,if payment for security services had not been at issue and shc had simply filed an action against cps for damages resulting from the fire,the insurance policy would unquestionably have obligated tig insurance to defend that action and indemnify cps.but because cps happened to have a claim against shc for unpaid services,shc was able to assert its fire damages claim by way of setoff rather than a separate complaint.cps asserts that this procedural nuance should not affect tig insurance obligation as a liability insurer.
tig insurance,on the other hand,relies on the plain language of the insurance policy.the policy is not appended to the complaint,but the complaint alleges,and tig insurance concedes,that it is a comprehensive general liability policy obligating tig insurance to defend suits seeking damages.tig insurance argues that a setoff claim asserted in an answer is not a suit seeking damages,and it relies on our literal interpretation of the word suit in,supra,cal th at page,d,where we stated that a suit is a court proceeding initiated by the filing of a complaint.italics added.tig insurance also points out that the insurance policy at issue here requires it to defend cps in a suit seeking damages.italics added.tig insurance argues that shc setoff claim is not a suit seeking damages,because,contrary to the court of appeal holding,it could not result in an award of affirmative relief against cps.rather,it could only reduce the amount of cps recovery.in this regard,tig insurance cites section,subdivision c,which provides affirmative relief may not be claimed in the answer.
because the court of appeal relied on its conclusion that a setoff under section can result in an award of affirmative relief against the plaintiff,we focus on this question.we agree with tig insurance that relief by way of a section setoff is limited to defeating the plaintiff claim.
one important function of the section setoff procedure is to provide partial relief from the statute of limitations.when two parties have opposing claims against one another,whether or not the two claims are related,one party might allow the statute of limitations to run on its claim,reasoning that the two claims have canceled one another out.if the second party then pursues its claim in a court action,the first party should be permitted to assert its expired claim defensively,arguing in effect that its earlier decision not to pursue the claim constituted a form of payment or compensation to the second party.but because the statute of limitations otherwise bars the first party claim,the use of that claim should be defensive only,and the first party recovery should be limited to offsetting any amount the second party might obtain on its opposing claim.the legislative history of section suggests the legislature intended the section to codify this principle.
