background 
on november,kessel applied for a term life insurance policy issued by stonebridge kessel designated his daughter,briale kessel,as the beneficiary.kessel wrote time social security in the section titled occupation on the application.the application also contained a number of specific questions.question a on the application asked 
to the best of your knowledge and belief have you 
sought or received treatment or medical advice or been hospitalized for cancer,stroke,diabetes,blood pressure,or for any disease of the heart,blood,liver,kidneys,digestive or respiratory system,or for any nervous,mental,neuromuscular,or connective tissue disorder during the past five years 
kessel answered no in response to question kessel answer was false.kessel had,in fact,s ought or received treatment or medical advice for a mental disorder within five years of the date of his application.a june,order from the iowa district court for keokuk county stated that kessel was seriously mentally impaired and in need of treatment,but can continue in outpatient treatment.on august,kessel reported to carol schmidt,a registered nurse with the richland family clinic,that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder since.kessel told schmidt that he had been receiving treatment from psychiatrist teresa rosales in ottumwa,iowa,for the past four or five years.kessel medical records indicate that he was treated at the psychiatry clinic of the university of iowa hospitals and clinics between and.adam concedes that kessel answer of no to question a was false.
if kessel had accurately answered yes to this question,his application would have been denied.stonebridge uses a simplified underwriting process to review applications for certificates of insurance.if the applicant answers yes to a health question such as question a,the application is declined.if the applicant answers no to the health questions,the application is approved.if stonebridge issues an applicant a policy and later learns from an applicant via a verification form that one of the questions should have been answered yes,then stonebridge rescinds the policy and refunds any premiums paid to stonebridge.
kessel application was not reviewed by a human underwriter,but rather keyed into a computer.because he answered all health questions no,a stonebridge clerk automatically issued a certificate of insurance.stonebridge records show the company never inquired further into kessel health during his lifetime or inquired why kessel,who was years old at the time of the application,received social security benefits.stonebridge issued kessel a certificate of insurance,effective november.kessel made three premium payments of,totaling.on march,kessel was killed in an automobile collision,and his estate sought death benefits under the policy.
regarding contestability of claims,the policy states 
the company can not contest the certificate after it has been in force during the insured lifetime for two years from the insured certificate effective date or the effective date of the reinstatement,except for accidental death benefits,if any,fraud,or for not paying premiums.
on march,stonebridge provided mike kennedy,attorney for the estate of richard kessel,with a contestable life claim form because kessel died within two years of the effective date of the policy.during a contestable review,a claims examiner reviews documentation and determines whether stonebridge would have issued a policy had stonebridge received truthful information.after receiving permission to access kessel medical records,a stonebridge claims examiner asked kennedy whether kessel received social security disability payments.additionally,the claims examiner wanted to know the condition for which kessel received social security benefits and the names and addresses of his treating physicians for that condition.
kelly foster,senior underwriter,reviewed medical records obtained during the review process and determined that stonebridge would not have issued the certificate of insurance because kessel had sought treatment and medical advice from schmidt,who had made an assessment on august,that kessel had bipolar disorder and that this constituted a mental disorder,which kessel should have disclosed on his application.on june,stonebridge sent a letter to kennedy stating that stonebridge was rescinding kessel insurance due to material omissions on his application regarding medical treatment.stonebridge refunded the premiums kessel paid for the policy.
adam,the administrator for kessel estate,acknowledged the decision to rescind in a letter that kennedy wrote to charles costa,vice president of claims at stonebridge,on january,and requested a replacement premium refund check.on january,stonebridge issued a second check in the amount of as a refund of the premiums kessel paid.the check was cashed.by january,adam retained a new attorney who initiated the instant lawsuit against stonebridge.
in relevant part,adam complaint alleged breach of contract and bad faith and sought punitive damages against stonebridge.stonebridge answered,asserting the affirmative defenses of equitable estoppel,lack of standing,waiver,and equitable rescission.the district court granted stonebridge motion for summary judgment on adam breach of contract claim.the court found that no genuine issues of material fact remained regarding any of the elements of equitable rescission.the court also found that stonebridge lawfully rescinded the insurance contract based on the misrepresentation kessel made on his application for life insurance.the district court also granted stonebridge motion for summary judgment on adam bad faith and punitive damages claims,finding that stonebridge had an objectively reasonable basis for denying adam claim.
ii.discussion 
adam argues that the district court erred in granting stonebridge motion for summary judgment on his breach of contract claim.first,he argues that kessel misrepresentation was not material and stonebridge reliance on kessel misrepresentation was unreasonable.second,adam argues that his claim had merit because stonebridge denial of his claim for payment on kessel life insurance certificate was unreasonable.finally,adam argues that stonebridge actions in denying coverage were willful and wanton and thus warrant punitive damages.

breach of contract
