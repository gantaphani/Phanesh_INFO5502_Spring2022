in this case,the district court,sitting in diversity,was faced with the task of interpreting the language of an insurance policy that allegedly covered damage to an aircraft engine caused by an unusual occurrence during.the insurer alleged that the policy exclusion for wear and tear foreclosed coverage.applying california law,the district court found that the term wear and tear was ambiguous,and resolved the ambiguity by requiring that damage from wear and tear result from the normal and ordinary operation of the engine.thus,the district court granted partial summary judgment for the insured and reserved for trial the question whether the damage resulted from the normal and ordinary operation of the engine.after hearing testimony,the district court resolved the question in the negative and awarded damages to the insured.the insurer now appeals the district court grant of partial summary judgment resulting from its interpretation of the policy language.we conclude that the parties did not intend the term wear and tear to carry a specialized meaning,that the parties intended the policy to cover damage resulting from accidental and fortuitous occurrences,and that the incident that caused the damage to the insured aircraft engine fell within the scope of coverage.we affirm.
this appeal presents an intriguing question of law in the guise of a deceptively simple fact pattern.meridian leasing,meridian,the appellee in this action,owned a piper meridian aircraft aircraft that it purchased new in march.on august,james robins,meridian owner and the aircraft authorized pilot,attempted to start the aircraft engine.as robins was performing this process,he observed flames emanating from both of the aircraft exhaust stacks.
robins immediately shut down the engine.when this failed to extinguish the flames,robins attempted to evacuate the aircraft.mechanic inspector david tesser,who witnessed these events,ran to the aircraft and directed robins to remain in the cockpit.tesser then instructed robins to the engine.this effort succeeded in extinguishing the flames.
for several seconds as the fire burned,the engine operated at a temperature beyond the range in which the engine was designed to operate safely.indeed,although not part of the district court factual findings,there is evidence in the record that the temperature reached degrees fahrenheit for a period of seconds,causing the compressor blade tips to melt and splatter molten metal onto the inside of the engine casing.the excessive internal temperature caused the engine to suffer extensive damage.meridian subsequently had the engine repaired at a cost of,plus for engine removal and replacement and for substitute transportation costs.
meridian insured the aircraft under a policy the policy issued by associated aviation underwriters,aau,the appellant in this matter.coverage f of the policy provided physical damage coverage on an all risk basis,joint appendix at,whereby aau would pay for any physical damage loss to the aircraft,including disappearance of the aircraft,at.meridian filed a claim with aau for the damage to the aircraft.aau denied the claim on the ground that the damage fell within the policy exclusion for wear and tear.
meridian brought this suit against aau in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,seeking a declaration that the damage to the aircraft was not wear and tear and that the policy therefore covered meridian claim.the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to.shortly thereafter,the case was assigned to magistrate judge ellen carmody,and the parties consented to the magistrate judge exercising full judicial authority pursuant to c and.meridian then moved for partial summary judgment on the proper interpretation of the policy wear and tear exclusion.
the district court found that the policy did not define the term wear and tear.applying california law the district court held that the term must be given its ordinary and popular meaning,which required that the wear and tear arise from ordinary or normal operation of the aircraft.meridian leasing,associated aviation underwriters,wl,slip op.at,hereinafter meridian leasing i.accordingly,the district court granted in part and denied in part meridian motion for summary judgment,reserving for trial the sole question whether the damage to the aircraft arose from ordinary or normal usage.
on september,the district court held a bench trial.an opinion and factual findings followed on january.see meridian leasing,associated aviation underwriters,d hereinafter meridian leasing ii.the district court concluded that the events that caused the damage to the aircraft were not normal or ordinary and awarded meridian in damages.aau timely appealed on february.the only issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in interpreting the wear and tear exclusion so as to require normal or ordinary operation of the aircraft.this court has jurisdiction over the present appeal pursuant to.

it is of course axiomatic that extrinsic evidence may be used to interpret a contract when the terms of the contract are in some respect ambiguous.see,morey vannucci,th,d,stating that california law requires admission of extrinsic evidence to resolve ambiguities.california leading case on the use of extrinsic evidence in contract interpretation is pacific gas and electric thomas drayage rigging,cal d.in that case,chief justice roger traynor set forth a very permissive standard for the use of extrinsic evidence the test of admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to the court to be plain and unambiguous on its face,but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.id.at,at.chief justice traynor continued a rule that would limit the determination of the meaning of a written instrument to its merely because it seems to the court to be clear and unambiguous,would either deny the relevance of the intention of the parties or presuppose a degree of verbal precision and stability our language has not attained.id.
the pacific gas court noted that many other courts have held that a contract may be unambiguous on its face.id.at,at citing examples from the second circuit and williston on contracts.however,the california supreme court explicitly chose to depart from that authority.
in this state,the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract is the source of contractual rights and duties.a court must ascertain and give effect to this intention by determining what the parties meant by the words they used.accordingly,the exclusion of relevant,extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument could be justified only if it were feasible to determine the meaning the parties gave to the words from the instrument alone.
id.at,at footnote omitted.
subsequent decisions of other courts have criticized the breadth of the pacific gas holding.for instance,the ninth circuit made the following observation 
california does not follow the traditional rule.two decades ago the california supreme court in pacific gas turned its back on the notion that a contract can ever have a plain meaning discernible by a court without resort to extrinsic evidence.the court reasoned that contractual obligations flow not from the words of the contract,but from the intention of the parties.
trident ctr.life ins,cir.the court continued 
under pacific gas,it matters not how clearly a contract is written,nor how completely it is integrated,nor how carefully it is negotiated,nor how squarely it addresses the issue before the court the contract can not be rendered impervious to attack by parol evidence.if one side is willing to claim that the parties intended one thing but the agreement provides for another,the court must consider extrinsic evidence of possible ambiguity.if that evidence raises the specter of ambiguity where there was none before,the contract language is displaced and the intention of the parties must be divined from testimony offered by partisan witnesses whose recollection is hazy from passage of time and colored by their conflicting interests.
id.at similarly,the southern district of new york recognized that pacific gas represented a departure from the law of new york.see hanson mccaw cellular communications,noting that the california approach differs from the law of new york and has been sharply criticized,but reluctantly applying the standard set forth in pacific gas in interpreting a license governed by california law see also bowers jefferson pilot fin.ins,noting the variation among states regarding use of extrinsic evidence in contract interpretation,and citing pacific gas.we think that these authorities illustrate that california has adopted a comparatively expansive approach to contract interpretation.
against this legal backdrop,we turn our inquiry to the specific language of the policy.like most insurance contracts,the policy contains exclusions as well as coverages.the section of the policy titled exclusions provides as follows 
this policy does not apply 
f under coverages f,g and h,to physical damage 
ii caused by and confined to a wear and tear,b deterioration or c mechanical or electrical breakdown or failure of equipment,components or accessories installed in the aircraft 
at bold type in original.two pages later,under the heading limit of the company liability,the policy states the following 
with respect to damage to aircraft engines and auxiliary power units insured under this policy 
b damage caused by heat which results from the operation,attempted operation or shutdown of the engine shall be considered to be wear and tear 
the district court concluded,in its february,opinion and again in its january,opinion,that the policy did not define the term wear and tear.meridian leasing i at meridian leasing ii,d at.in reaching this conclusion,the court expressed reluctance to give broad construction to the limitation language,which,the court posited,would result in exclusion of coverage for any damage caused by heat.had this been aau intention,the district court noted,it could have explicitly stated so in the policy.instead,the court found,the policy left the term wear and tear undefined,and the limitation had the effect of excluding coverage for damage caused by heat which results from or is properly characterized as wear and tear.meridian leasing i at.having identified an ambiguity,the district court then consulted various dictionaries for the ordinary and popular meaning of wear and tear.as a result of this exercise,the court held that wear and tear does not encompass all damage,but only damage that results from normal or ordinary usage.id.accordingly,the district court resolved the perceived ambiguity by interpreting the heat limitation as to require normal or ordinary operation or attempted operation of the engine.id.at.
we take issue with one aspect of the district court ruling.by declaring that the policy does not define wear and tear,and suggesting that the heat limitation excluded only heat damage that is properly characterized as wear and tear,we think that the district court effectively rendered the heat limitation superfluous.if the policy expressly excludes wear and tear,and the subsequent heat limitation applies only to damage that would otherwise be considered to be wear and tear,we fail to see what purpose the heat limitation would serve.the district court suggested reading of the heat limitation therefore runs afoul of the principle of california law requiring an interpreting court to give effect to every part of a contract if reasonably practicable to do so.see cal.we do not believe,however,that the district court reading of the heat limitation was necessary to its ultimate finding of ambiguity.
with respect to the district court broader holding that the policy was ambiguous,we are in agreement.our finding of ambiguity flows from the primary mandate of any court interpreting a contract under california law to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting.cal.to this end,a court must give terms their ordinary and popular meaning unless they are used in a technical sense or are given a special meaning by usage.id.an interpreting court may not focus on the perceived ambiguity of a term or expression in the abstract,but must interpret a policy holistically and in the context of the circumstances of the case.waller truck ins,cal th,d.the proper question is whether the word is ambiguous in the context of this policy and the circumstances of this case.the provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mut.ins,cal th,d,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
