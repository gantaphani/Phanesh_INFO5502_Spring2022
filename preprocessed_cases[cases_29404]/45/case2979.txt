ii.the underlying action 
penn fabrication,penn fabrication owns a patent for an automatically positioned latch assembly.on march,penn fabrication brought an action in federal court against appellants for misuse of this patented product,which it characterized more simply as a handle.the first cause of action,for patent infringement,alleged that appellants were wilfully infringing said patent by making,using,offering to sell,and selling,automatically positioned latch assemblies,embodying the patented invention 
the second cause of action alleged this is an action for unfair competition joined with substantial and related claims under the trademark laws,alleged in the third cause of action.
the second cause of action further alleged as a result of organization,and the expenditure of labor,skill,and money,penn fabrication has acquired the unique design,including the combination of shape,configuration,appearance,color,and distinctive meaning,hereafter called the unique design,of the latch handle appellants slavishly copied and appropriated the unique design of the handle,and are selling it in commerce as their own in competition with penn fabrication appellants acts are specifically oriented predatory business practices undertaken by appellants with the dominant purpose and effect of passing,and palming,off their handle as that of penn fabrication,and of confusing customers as to the source of their handle prior to appellants acts,penn fabrication unique design of its handle had a distinctive meaning in the minds of purchasers,indicating a handle originating with penn fabrication and appellants have passed,and palmed,off their handle as originating with,or being sponsored by,or affiliated with penn fabrication,and have confused customers as to the source of their handle.

iii.tender of defense 
on march,appellants,through their broker,tendered defense of the penn fabrication action to respondent.on may,respondent declined to defend the penn fabrication action because the tendered claim was not within the scope of coverage of the insurance policies.specifically,it concluded that the penn fabrication action did not arise out of appellants advertising activities.there is no causal connection between appellants advertising and the alleged injuries in the penn fabrication action.a claim for patent infringement does not involve or arise from appellants advertising activities.
on june appellants,through their attorney,asked respondent to reconsider its denial of coverage.they asserted that the factual allegations in the penn fabrication action contained a claim for trade dress infringement which fell within the policy coverage for advertising injuries from misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.
on august respondent,through its coverage counsel,affirmed its denial of a defense.it disputed that the alleged conduct in the penn fabrication action was a claim for trademark,or impliedly,trade dress,infringement,but even if it were,there is no allegation in the penn fabrication action that any such infringement was done in the course of appellants advertising activities.
appellants thereafter settled the penn fabrication action using their own funds.
iv.present action 
in january,appellants brought the instant action for breach of to defend and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing appellants moved for summary adjudication of their cause of action for breach of the contractual duty to defend them in the penn fabrication action.by stipulation,appellants motion was heard with respondent for summary judgment brought on the grounds respondent had no such duty to defend.
in their motion,appellants argued that the penn fabrication action contained,in substance,a claim of trade dress infringement by alleging that appellants misappropriated the unique design of the penn fabrication handles onto their own handles,falsely designated the origin of their handles,and were selling the handles as their own.therefore,because trade dress infringement is a species of trademark infringement,the policies provided coverage for advertising injury arising out of trademark infringement,and selling encompasses advertising,respondent had a duty to defend them in the penn fabrication action.
in support of appellants motion,appellant zamberg declared advertises its handles,including the model number handles that were the subject of the penn fabrication action,by direct mailings to customers,catalogs,and the internet.first offered the handles for sale on april.it did not then have a catalog featuring the handles and so used the handles themselves for its sales presentations.the handles appeared in catalog,which was printed on august,and distributed on september,they also appeared in its special brochure,distributed october,and in its catalog,printed on january,and distributed february.the handles first appeared on website in august.catalogs are provided to all customers,who use them to place orders with sales representatives.the sales representatives also use the catalogs in their efforts to sell the handles by showing potential customers the handles featured in the catalogs.exhibited the handles at the national association of music merchants trade shows held in july and july in nashville and in january in los angeles.
during the summary judgment proceedings respondent acknowledged that the penn fabrication complaint contained facts sufficient to constitute an allegation of infringement of trade dress.its motion for summary judgment was made on the grounds that penn fabrication damages from appellants alleged trade dress infringement did not arise from appellants advertising activities but from their copying and selling the allegedly infringing handle.therefore,it did not have a duty under the policies to defendant to defend appellants in the penn fabrication action.
the trial court concluded that respondent owed no duty to defend appellants in the penn fabrication action under the applicable policies and entered summary judgment in its favor.

ii.duty to defend 
an insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity,and must defend any action that potentially seeks damages within the policy coverage.the duty to defend is determined by comparing the allegations of the third party complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint known to the insurer at the inception of the third party lawsuit may also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility the policy may cover the claim.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.even if the face of the complaint does not suggest a potential for liability under the policy,the extrinsic facts known to the insurer can generate a duty to defend,because current pleading rules liberally allow amendment and the third party can not be the arbiter of coverage.id.at,d.
the duty to defend arises on tender of defense and continues until the underlying lawsuit is concluded or until the insurer establishes,by reference to undisputed facts,the absence of any potential for coverage.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.generally,when there is any doubt as to the existence of a duty to defend,the doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured.ringler associates maryland casualty th,d.
iii.general principles of trademark and trade dress 
the lanham act et defines trademark as any word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person,or which a person has a bona fide intention to use in commerce and applies to register on the principal register to identify and distinguish his or her goods,including a unique product,from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods,even if that source is unknown.
an infringement of a trademark is defined as an act committed by any person who,without the consent of the registrant,shall a use in commerce any reproduction,counterfeit,copy,or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale,offering for sale,distribution,or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive,commonly known as section of the lanham act.
a trademark serves three distinct and separate purposes it identifies a product origin,it guarantees the product unchanged quality,and it advertises the product.injury to the trademark in any of its offices as an identifying,guaranteeing or advertising device should suffice to constitute an infringement thereof.citation.a trademark is but a species of advertising,its purpose being to fix the identity of the article and the name of the producer in the minds of people who see the advertisement,so that they may afterwards use the knowledge themselves and carry it to others having like desires and needs for such article.citation a s the lanham act itself makes clear,the advertising of a good or service is one of the ways in which an act of infringement of a registered trademark can occur.lebas,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
the lanham act also protects the unregistered features of a product.any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.a,commonly known as section a of the lanham act.
the relationship between trademark and trade dress is discussed in restatement third of unfair competition.the law of trademarks deals primarily with designations consisting of words or other symbols used to indicate the source of goods or services.however,the manner in which the goods or services are presented to prospective purchasers,or the physical features of the product itself,may also serve as an indication of source.source significance may attach,for example,to the overall appearance of a product or to some specific element or aspect of that appearance.the appearance,the trade dress then functions as a trademark,distinguishing the goods of one seller from those of others.rest d unfair competition,com.a.
federal courts have held that,in the context of a claimed infringement,there is probably no substantive difference between trademark and trade dress.blau plumbing,cir,blau,cited with approval in aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,d aloha pacific.s ection a of the lanham act is not limited to trademark infringement.in fact it does not mention trademarks.it provides a remedy for trademark infringement only because that is a type of unfair competition,and it provides a remedy for other types as well.trade dress,a commonly used term in the law of unfair competition,denotes the form in which a producer presents his brand to the market if a seller adopts a trade dress confusingly similar to a competitor,this is unfair competition actionable under section a because the lanham act is not limited to trademark infringement and in any event protects unregistered common law trademarks as well as federally registered trademarks,courts have generally not thought it important whether trade dress is a form of trademark but it is blau,supra,at.
the united states supreme court echoed blau reasoning in two pesos,supra,at page.it held that if the trade dress for which an entity seeks protection under section a of the lanham act is inherently distinctive,it is capable of identifying products as coming from a specific source.this is the rule generally applicable to trademarks,and the protection of trademarks and trade dress under a serves the same statutory purpose of preventing deception and unfair competition.there is no persuasive reason to apply different analysis to the two.two pesos,supra,at.
iv.the potential for coverage of penn fabrication claimed injuries based on trade dress infringement.
advertising injury 
as noted,the instant polices provide coverage for advertising injury when the advertising injury was caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising appellants products.trademark infringement is among the policies predicate offenses defining advertising injury.respondent has conceded that the penn fabrication action alleged claims for infringement of the trade dress of the disputed handle and has impliedly recognized that trade dress infringement is a species of trademark infringement.therefore the first criterion for the policies potential coverage of the damages alleged in the penn fabrication is met an advertising injury as defined in the policies.
causal connection 
the crux of the parties dispute is whether the advertising injury,trade dress infringement,was caused in the course of appellants advertising.respondent argues that the undisputed facts demonstrate an absence of the second criterion for coverage because the evidence demonstrates only that an infringement occurred when appellants manufactured and sold the disputed handle,and that their advertising simply exposed the infringement it did not cause it.appellants
