the underlying lawsuit that gave rise to the dispute in this litigation was brought by ameriwood industries international corporation ameriwood against mill pride,and mill pride limited partnership in the united states district court for the western district of michigan.as alleged in its complaint,ameriwood was the owner of the trademark kids n kolor,a line of children furniture sold with a distinctive,trade dress.in late,ameriwood discovered that furniture identical in appearance to its kids n kolor line was being sold in michigan and illinois under the trademark kidz colorz.kidz colorz was manufactured by mill pride limited partnership and sold by mill pride,in a trade dress substantially identical to ameriwood distinctive trade dress.ameriwood sought damages from mill pride,and mill pride limited partnership for false designation of origin,trademark infringement,trade dress infringement,unfair competition,and dilution of trademark and trade dress.the parties ultimately settled the suit at an april,facilitative mediation scheduled by the michigan district court.

it became apparent during the course of this litigation in the district court that a decision as to which state law should be applied would be outcome determinative.as explained by counsel for mill pride,at a hearing before the district court 
t here is authority under ohio law that if you fail to make the notification,you just out.too bad,you get no claim.they treat it as a condition precedent to coverage the michigan law,on the other hand,says,well,we going to consider that as a factor,but really it going to be up to the insurance company to show that they were prejudiced by the lack of timely notice.
applying michigan choice of law rules and relying on international insurance stonewall insurance,cir,the district court ruled that the substantive law of michigan governed the parties dispute.the parties thereafter entered into a partial settlement agreement that resolved all factual and legal disputes except for the single legal issue regarding the appropriate choice of law.the district court soon after entered a stipulated final order preserving the choice of law issue for appeal and stating that the order constitutes a final order adjudicating the rights and obligations of the parties.at.plaintiffs timely appeal of the choice of law issue is now before this court.

the district court ruling on the choice of law issue is reviewed de novo.salve regina college russell,d charash oberlin college,cir.
iii.choice of law rules 
it is that,in a diversity case such as this one,a federal court must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits.erie tompkins.this rule extends to the forum state law regarding choice of laws.klaxon stentor.because this action was brought in federal court in michigan,michigan choice of law rules apply.
the michigan supreme court most recently addressed the state choice of law rules in contract disputes in chrysler corporation skyline industrial services.in that case,chrysler corporation,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in michigan,and skyline industrial services,skyline,a michigan corporation,entered into a contract for construction services to be performed by skyline in illinois.negotiated mainly in michigan,the contract provided that skyline would indemnify and hold chrysler harmless from chrysler negligence.such an indemnification provision in a construction contract was void under illinois law but was valid under michigan law unless the indemnitee was solely negligent.
after a skyline employee was injured while working at an illinois construction site,chrysler commenced an action in michigan seeking a declaratory judgment that skyline was liable under the indemnification clause.the trial court found that applying michigan law would best give effect to the parties intentions at the time of contracting.analyzing the choice of law issue under the restatement second of conflict of laws second restatement,an appellate court reversed,concluding that the law of illinois should apply because illinois was both the place of performance and the location of the subject matter of the contract.while rejecting the conclusion of the appellate court,finding instead that michigan law applied,the supreme court endorsed the appellate court reliance on the second restatement,stating 
the trend in this court has been to move away from traditional conceptions toward a more approach 
sections and of the second restatement,with their emphasis on examining the relevant contacts and policies of the interested states,provide a sound basis for moving beyond formalism to an approach more in line with contracting realities 
as the comments to of the second restatement state prime objectives of contract law are to protect the justified expectations of the parties and to make it possible for them to foretell with accuracy what will be their rights and liabilities under the contract.but,f ulfillment of the parties expectations is not the only value in contract law regard must also be had for state interests and for state regulation.
chrysler,at footnotes omitted.guided by the concerns for certainty and public policy expressed in the second restatement,the supreme court balanced the relevant interests,concluding 
this lawsuit concerns two michigan corporations,with a longstanding business relationship,who contracted in michigan and chose michigan law to govern their contractual relationship.both parties apparently acted as if michigan law would apply.we decline to void the parties express preference for michigan law in the absence of compelling evidence that illinois has a materially greater interest than michigan.
chrysler,at footnote omitted.
while adopting the second restatement approach to choice of law questions in chrysler,the supreme court of michigan explicitly stated that it declined to abandon what had long been the predominant view in michigan namely,the lex loci contractus rule that a contract is to be construed according to the law of the place where the contract was entered into.rather,the court said i t is important to clarify that that lex loci contractus rule may prove to be unworkable under certain factual situations,such as those presented here,which demand a more extensive review of the relative interests of the parties and the interested states.chrysler,at.
citing chrysler,the sixth circuit has said that michigan choice of law rules require a court to balance the expectations of the parties to a contract with the interests of the states involved to determine which state law to apply.equitable life assurance soc y of the united states poe,cir.such a balancing approach is consistent with the second restatement approach endorsed by the supreme court of michigan in chrysler.
section of the second restatement provides 
the rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to that issue,has the most significant relationship to the transaction and parties under the principles stated in s.
in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties,the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of s to determine the law applicable to an issue include 
a the place of contracting,
b the place of negotiation of the contract,
c the place of performance,
d the location of the subject matter of the contract,and 
e the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.
these contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.

underlying the factors set out in section are the general policy considerations found in section 
a court,subject to constitutional restrictions,will follow a statutory directive of its own state on choice of law.
when there is no such directive,the factors relevant to the choice of the applicable rule of law include 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems,
b the relevant policies of the forum,

iv.discussion 
relying on international insurance company stonewall insurance company,cir,the district court in this case determined that michigan law applied to the dispute between plaintiffs and continental.according to the district court,international insurance teaches that the law of the location of the occurrence governs the insurance contract with regard to that occurrence unless the parties have agreed otherwise by contract.at.because the parties did not include a choice of law provision in the cgl policy,and because the relevant occurrence allegedly took least in michigan,the district court concluded that continental understood and mill pride reasonably could have expected that the law of michigan would govern the contractual relationship between these parties.at.
contrary to the district court assertions,international insurance does not teach that the law of the location of the occurrence governs the insurance contract with regard to that occurrence unless the parties have agreed otherwise by contract.at.indeed,the court in international insurance espoused no such rule but,instead,warned that choice of law controversies are fact driven and each case has to be analyzed within its own factual context.int l,at.
international insurance arose out of a louisiana state court case filed by an individual injured by a defective forklift in louisiana,where interest is assessed as a matter of right and where parties responsible for payment of judgment are also responsible for payment of interest.the party causing the injury,crown equipment corporation crown,was an ohio corporation that did business in louisiana.a louisiana jury awarded the injured plaintiff.to the jury award,the state court added an award of interest,bringing the entire award to a total of over.crown insurer,international insurance company international,thereafter filed suit in federal court in ohio,seeking a declaration as to its obligation on the judgment in the underlying tort action.urging the application of ohio law,which provides that insurers are not liable for interest in excess of policy limits,international argued that,because the relevant insurance policy limited the company liability to per occurrence,its obligation on the judgment was limited to million.
relying on sections and of the restatement,the district court in ohio concluded that international declaratory judgment action was governed by louisiana law and not by ohio law as argued by international.because louisiana law makes insurers liable for interest in excess of any policy limit,the district court declared that international was obligated to pay both the damage award as well as the interest on that award.
on appeal,this court affirmed,stating 
the key to our analysis is that the choice of law principles found in the restatement need not be given equal weight in every circumstance,nor are they intended to be exclusive.they also are relatively elastic,and in some cases equivocal 
with these instructive comments in mind,we have concluded that the most significant factor to be considered under the facts presented here,is found in section d,the protection of justified expectations.crown is a large national company whose products are sold and used throughout the united states it is beyond peradventure that crown wanted complete liability protection within the policy limits of the insurance it purchased.
among other things,the appellate court found significant the fact that the insurance policy required international to pay on behalf of the insured,the ultimate net loss,which the insured may sustain by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law.int l,at.moreover,the court noted that the parties included a clause in the policy stating that,i n a jurisdiction where,by reason of law or statute,this policy is invalid as a pay on behalf of contract,international agrees to indemnify the insured for ultimate net loss in excess of their retained limits.int l,at.according to the court,these policy provisions revealed that the parties anticipated that the laws of various jurisdictions would affect international performance under the contract,strengthening the court conclusion that the parties expectations,given the particular facts presented,were best preserved through application of louisiana law.
stressing the nature of a choice of law question,the international insurance court concluded 
we are confident that the reasonable expectations of an insured,such as crown,would be that,whatever a state allowed by way of recovery to a tort plaintiff,it would be covered by its insurance.nor do we see this as a equation under facts such as are presented here,an insurance carrier can not reasonably expect that an insured would want some type of fluctuating coverage which would afford full protection in one locale,but not in another.
