factual and procedural background 
garlock is a company specializing in designing,manufacturing,testing and selling industrial sealing products,including oil seals.mao shun,located in taiwan,is a manufacturer of oil seals and has been in the business of selling oil seals for to years.sunrise trading is a california company engaged in the importation and sale of goods including oil seals manufactured by mao shun.garlock first placed a trial piece of business with mao shun through sunrise trading in the early.thereafter,garlock ordered radial oil seals from mao shun and resold them to rockwell for use in rockwell gear reducer boxes,which gearboxes were in turn used for conveyor belt systems in distribution warehouses 
in rockwell was having problems with oil seals that were made from nitrile rubber,which garlock was supplying to rockwell for use in rockwell gear reducer boxes the nitrile rubber was almost melting and cracking from excessive heat in the gearboxes,resulting in a five to six percent oil leakage rate for the gear reducers.at that time,rockwell also wanted to switch from a lubricant to a synthetic lubricant with which the nitrile material was not compatible.rockwell and garlock worked together to come up with a solution which would use a step case radial oil seal made from a fluoroelastomer polymer called viton instead of the nitrile rubber.the selection of a radial oil seal made from viton was an appropriate selection for the gearbox application of rockwell based on consideration of shaft speed,size compatibility,and heat tolerance.the operating conditions for rockwell use of the seals were not unusual or excessive for viton seals.the operating conditions involved a typical application,which a viton polymer properly formulated should be able to handle easily.
garlock did not normally make bonded oil seals and the proposed step case seals were both smaller in diameter and required higher volumes than garlock normally made.in may of garlock contacted mao shun through sunrise trading to see if mao shun could produce the proposed viton step case seals.garlock had experience with mao shun standard brown viton compound since perhaps as early as,although the volume of brown viton seals previously purchased by garlock was extremely small garlock provided mao shun with drawings and specifications for the new seals.the specifications,which would have been similar to the specification used for ordering the nitrile rubber seals except for the material being viton,covered the physical materials,properties and dimensions of the seals.garlock manager of engineering,james drago,did not know if garlock specified the color of the viton to be used by mao shun,but he testified it was common for viton products to be colored brown to distinguish them from other rubber compounds.drago understood garlock specification asked mao shun to use its standard brown viton compound.garlock did not tell mao shun how to compound its viton or specify any particular iron oxide as the brown pigment for the viton.garlock did not consider it necessary to provide its own internal specification for iron oxide for the brown viton to mao shun based on its previous experience with mao shun and mao shun reputation as a manufacturer of oil seals.
based on the specifications and information provided by garlock in,mao shun prepared the technical drawings for the seals.mao shun created a new mold for a step case radial oil seal based on garlock specifications and sent garlock samples of the newly configured step case seal,including a slab of the brown viton compound from which the seals were to be made.garlock maintains three testing facilities a chemical testing lab a physical testing lab and a functional testing lab.the functional testing lab can be used to duplicate the circumstances under which an oil seal is used in the field to check its performance.garlock tested the mao shun samples for purposes of ensuring they were the proper configuration,dimension,and otherwise met specification requirements.garlock did the normal tests designated by the american society for testing and materials astm to check the basic physical properties of the rubber brown viton compound.the seals met specifications and passed the standard astm tests.garlock did not do any functional testing of the samples.although garlock would normally do functional testing for a newly configured component with a new compound,garlock considered these seals to be a standard design configuration not made with a new compound.the seals were not something on which garlock felt compelled to do functional testing.garlock had no reason to suspect mao shun brown viton seals contained abrasives.
mao shun manufactured the new step case seals with its brown viton compound molded around a steel insert.the raw viton material used by mao shun for these seals was provided to mao shun by a taiwanese distributor for dupont.mao shun then combined the viton with several fillers,pigment,processing agents and livening agents to make the compound material for the seals according to its own formula.the pigment was a red oxidized iron powder supplied by a distributor for bayer corporation,a reputable supplier of pigment.mao shun ordered bayer grade iron oxide.in mao shun purchasing specifications for the pigment did not include anything regarding particle size.mao shun did not test for particle size or sift the pigment.however,bayer provided an inspection report and certification of its materials to mao shun,which mao shun verified by standard testing.
in the fall of garlock placed orders for the mao shun brown viton step case oil seals with sunrise trading.depending on the delivery time requirements,mao shun either shipped the manufactured brown viton oil seals to sunrise trading by sea,or air freighted them directly to garlock.oil seals were shipped throughout the fall,but the bulk of the seals appear to have been shipped in december and later.garlock supplied the mao shun oil seals to rockwell.
in late rockwell started using a brown viton oil seal manufactured by mao shun for one model of gear reducer that was having the most significant leak rate with the nitrile oil seals.subsequently,rockwell incorporated the brown viton seals into other models of its gear reducers.rockwell sold its gear reducers with the brown viton oil seals to at least seven or eight original equipment manufacturers oem who incorporated them into conveyance systems for large distribution centers operated by,for example,coke,pepsi,and.also,if a rockwell customer had a leaking nitrile seal,rockwell replaced those seals with a brown viton seal.garlock was rockwell sole supplier of brown viton seals.
vici bushey,rockwell warranty administrator,began noticing a trend of claims for gear reducers with brown viton seals that were leaking oil in late or early.rockwell referred the problem to its engineers and quality control people.eventually,rockwell experienced almost a percent leak rate for the brown viton sealed units.this was considered a catastrophic leakage rate.rockwell lost customers.when new business was bid,some companies specified rockwell would not be accepted as a supplier.
william pizzichil testified it was his principal duty when hired as rockwell gear engineering manager in november was to solve the leakage problem.he visited many customer facilities and observed considerable oil leakage on many gear reducers.the gear reducers were brought back to rockwell facilities where engineers disassembled them for examination.the primary characteristic found was excessive damage or grooving to the rotating shaft in the gearbox.grooving of the shaft can reduce the contact between the seal and the shaft resulting in oil leakage,possible oil carbonization,and eventual wear of the seal.if all of the oil in the gearbox is lost,the gearbox will burn up.it was a very unusual failure.some of the failures were occurring after only hours about six days of operation.
toward the end of rockwell brought the problem to the attention of garlock.garlock contacted sunrise trading in december into january regarding the problem.sunrise trading immediately referred the matter to mao shun and told garlock to speak directly with mao shun.
working with garlock,rockwell engineers looked at the temperature and kind of media the seals were being exposed to,the speed of the shafts,the frictional heat and adequacy of the lubrication.eventually a test was designed where a gear reducer with a brown viton seal was run completely submerged in oil to eliminate any question of inadequate lubrication.after several days of running,there were grooves in the hardened steel shaft of the gearbox.the engineers concluded the problem was in the brown viton seal.in his years of experience in the gear manufacturing industry rockwell manager pizzichil had never before seen this type of problem.garlock engineers were totally surprised this could happen.an analytical study of the seal material was determined to be necessary.
garlock took samples of mao shun brown viton,the brown viton oil seals,and samples of green and black viton to mccrone associates,for scanning electron microscopy and diffraction analysis.the laboratory analysis found the only material present in any of the samples that could cause the damaged steel shafts was large iron oxide particles with smooth faces and sharp edges found in mao shun brown viton sample and seals.the material was determined to be magnetite,a very hard and potentially abrasive substance.a test of magnetite by garlock showed it scratched glass.the presence of particles of abrasive magnetite at the lip edge of the oil seal would account for the grooving of the steel shaft in the gear reducer.the presence of abrasive material resulted in defective seals.garlock expert,leslie horve,stated one of the purposes of oil seals is to prevent premature oil leakage and when a seal experiences premature leakage it has not performed its intended purpose and has failed.
horve testified if mao shun had run a dispersion test on its batches of brown viton,mao shun may have been able to identify the problem particles in the compound.mao shun did not run dispersion tests on its compound in and.
garlock questioned mao shun as to whether the problem could be a bad batch of brown viton.when garlock did not get information from mao shun that it was a bad batch,garlock believed the only safe conclusion was that all of the brown viton seals were bad.
mao shun contended it followed strict quality control procedures for its processing of the brown viton.it had used the same manufacturing process and quality control procedures for its brown viton since.none of its other customers had reported problems with the brown viton an engineering expert for mao shun,stephen andrew,testified iron oxide pigment would be made from iron mixed with nitrobenzene to get magnetite,which would then be heated to form hematite for the correct brown color.in the process,some magnetite would naturally be left in the pigment.
garlock tests comparing mao shun brown viton to materials made with garlock iron oxide pigment,however,showed mao shun brown viton was more abrasive than garlock material.a chemical laboratory report found mao shun iron oxide to be coarser than the iron oxide purchased from garlock own supplier.
while these investigations were going on,rockwell continued to use garlock mao shun brown viton seals in their gear reducers because there was no other available material for the seals at that time and rockwell still needed to meet its customers needs.in the spring of garlock requested mao shun to manufacture the step case radial oil seals using green viton garlock supplied.rockwell got the green viton seals from garlock in april and proceeded to replace thousands of gear reducer units and all brown viton seals with green viton seals.the leakage rate immediately went down to one or two percent and there was no shaft grooving.
in january vincent tsai,the mao shun salesman responsible for selling to sunrise trading,sent an to drago at garlock stating that after long testing and discussion,mao shun confirmed that its brown viton was more abrasive to shafts than garlock material.according to tsai,all of mao shun engineers agreed with garlock testing results.scotch hang,an engineer with mao shun,denied telling tsai he agreed with garlock testing results.tsai did not discuss his with hang or his supervisor before sending it to garlock.
on august,rockwell filed a lawsuit against garlock in the federal district court for south carolina seeking damages for garlock breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty of merchantability,breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,and contractual indemnification.garlock filed a third party complaint in the action against mao shun,but dismissed it without prejudice when personal jurisdiction over mao shun could not be established in south carolina.garlock decided to settle the rockwell case after document discovery,depositions and the exchange of expert reports were completed.garlock concluded rockwell would win its case if it went to trial,exposing garlock to potential damages in excess of million.under the terms of the settlement agreement,garlock paid rockwell million in cash,gave rockwell in product refunds and discounts and extended further product discounts of up to,for a total settlement value of million.
on october,garlock filed this action against mao shun and sunrise trading for declaratory relief regarding implied equitable indemnity,breach of express warranties,breach of implied warranties,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.mao shun and sunrise trading each filed against each other.
after a court trial,the trial court concluded,among other things,that sunrise trading was acting as mao shun agent in consummating the brown viton sales transactions with garlock and that mao shun breached the implied warranty of merchantability.the court awarded garlock damages of in lost profits,consequential and incidental damages,plus interest and costs of suit against mao shun.it denied garlock claim of equitable indemnity against mao shun.the trial court ordered garlock take nothing by its complaint against sunrise trading and awarded sunrise trading its costs of suit against garlock.the trial court ordered mao shun take nothing by its against sunrise trading and awarded sunrise trading on its against mao shun its legal costs,expenses and fees incurred in defending garlock action.
discussion 
mao shun implied warranty of merchantability does apply to this case 
mao shun argues the implied warranty of merchantability is inapplicable to this case for two reasons.first,according to mao shun,such implied warranty is inconsistent with the trial court finding of fact and conclusion of law that mao shun manufactured the brown viton oil seals in compliance with the specifications garlock provided.second,mao shun claims the implied warranty is precluded by california uniform commercial code section,subdivision b exclusion or modification of warranties.we disagree with both claims.
a.the specifications 
mao shun contends application of the implied warranty of merchantability is precluded in this case as a matter of law because the trial court concluded was an express warranty relating to the brown viton oil seals and then found mao shun manufactured the seals in compliance with the specification.mao shun relies on the carpenter steel pellegrin d.pellegrin,pointing to its language that where a product is made according to plans and specifications,there is no implied assurance or warranty that it is adequate for the buyer purpose,or even for the general purpose for which such things are designed.if the article corresponds with the plans and specifications,the manufacturer can not be held liable.id.at.
the trial court found controlled mao shun manufacture of the oil seals based on the parties extensive course of dealings.however,contrary to mao shun representation in its opening brief,the trial court did not characterize as an express warranty.the only express warranty found by the trial court was the express warranty that the manufactured oil seals would conform to the sample oil seals and brown viton slabs provided by mao shun to garlock prior to the creation of the parties contract,subd.c.
even assuming was an express warranty that the oil seals would conform to the specifications,an implied warranty of merchantability is not precluded.
section,subdivision implied warranty mechantability usage of trade provides a warranty of merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of goods if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind,unless it is excluded or modified as provided in section.mao shun is a merchant with respect to oil seals of this kind.a warranty of merchantability will normally be included in its sale of oil seals.we will consider mao shun argument that the implied warranty is excluded by section in the next portion of our discussion.section cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied requires express and implied warranties to be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative unless such construction is unreasonable,in which case the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant.in ascertaining that intention,express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose,subd.c,italics added.the trial court determined the express warranty created by sample was not inconsistent with the implied warranty of merchantability and the same is true for any express warranty in the specification.
the implied warranty of merchantability and the express warranty of the specification can be reasonably construed as consistent and cumulative.the specification covered the physical materials,properties and dimensions of the seals.the specification may have requested mao shun standard brown viton compound,but garlock did not tell mao shun how to compound its viton or specify any particular iron oxide as the brown pigment for the viton.garlock did not provide its own internal specification for iron oxide to mao shun,but relied on its previous experience with mao shun and mao shun reputation as a manufacturer of oil seals.there is no evidence garlock knew mao shun formula for its standard brown viton and specifically requested it based on that knowledge.brown was simply the standard color used for viton for identification purposes.
contrary to mao shun claim that garlock specified mao shun standard brown viton with full knowledge of the problems that rockwell was experiencing,the evidence,which mao shun does not fully or adequately summarize,shows the leakages reported to garlock in the second quarter of,for the very small number of brown viton seals that were in use at that time,were not chronic or widespread.there is no evidence garlock or anyone else had knowledge that such leakages related to the iron oxide pigment used by mao shun in its standard brown viton.indeed,even when catastrophic leakage rates were subsequently experienced,it took multiple engineers at rockwell and garlock,plus specialized laboratory tests,to isolate the pigment as the source of the problem.garlock did not rely on its own skill,knowledge,and expertise to specify a particular pigment regardless of its fitness for a radial oil seal purpose thus,the specification is not inconsistent with an implied warranty of merchantability.
pellegrin,supra,d,is inapposite.in pellegrin the purchaser gave the manufacturer a written order for wire that specified a particular chemical analysis for the wire.id.at.in that context,the court reasoned there was no implied warranty that the wire was adequate for the buyer purpose,or even for the general purpose for which such things are designed.id.at.the situation is different in this case where garlock did not specify the particular chemical composition of the viton or the specific iron oxide to be used as pigment 
did not supplant the implied warranty of merchantability.
section,subdivision b,the exclusion or modification of warranties,does not preclude the warranty 
a warranty of merchantability is implied in every contract for the sale of goods if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind,unless it is excluded or modified as provided in section,subd.mao shun argues section,subdivision b,excluded the warranty of merchantability in this case.such section provides when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him.
the trial court concluded the implied warranty of merchantability was not excluded under section,subdivision b because it found the latent abrasive characteristics of the oil seals was not a defect that was,or ought to have been,revealed to garlock under the circumstances or prevailing testing methodologies.capitalization omitted.
mao shun takes issue with this finding,contending garlock was a professional buyer who should have performed functional testing on the sample seals provided by mao shun,which functional testing would have revealed the abrasive lip problem.although mao shun presents its argument as being one of preclusion as a matter of law,its claim is essentially a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court finding that the abrasiveness of the oil seal lips was not a defect that garlock ought to have discovered.wickham southland d.contention that evidence establishes a particular fact as a matter of law when the fact finder has determined the fact to the contrary is but another way of asserting insufficiency of the evidence to support the finding.
where the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence,the reviewing court starts with the presumption that the record contains evidence sufficient to support the judgment it is the appellant affirmative burden to demonstrate otherwise.foreman clark fallon cal d,foreman clark baxter healthcare denton th,d.the appellant brief must set forth all of the material evidence bearing on the issue,not merely the evidence favorable to the appellant,and must show how the evidence does not sustain the challenged finding.foreman clark,supra,at,baxter healthcare denton,supra,at,d.if the appellant fails to set forth all of the material evidence,its claim of insufficiency of the evidence is forfeited.foreman clark,supra,at,road sprinkler fitters local union g g fire sprinklers,th,d.
furthermore,i n reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we must consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,accept as true all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom that tend to establish the correctness of the trial court findings and decision,and resolve every conflict in favor of the judgment.howard owens corning th,d.it is not our task to weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence that is the province of the trier of fact.our authority begins and ends with a determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is any substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,in support of the judgment.ibid.baxter healthcare denton,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.
mao shun fails to set forth all of the material evidence relevant to the question of whether garlock should have discovered the latent problem with the abrasiveness of the oil seal lips.indeed,mao shun not only cites just the evidence in its favor,it takes much of such evidence out of context,thereby misrepresenting the actual substance of the testimony.for example,mao shun claims rockwell gear engineering manager pizzichil testified,functional testing should always be done when determining the applicability of an oil seal in a particular application.in fact,at the portion of his testimony to which mao shun cites,pizzichil was testifying regarding testing rockwell did for a subsequent generation of gear reducer oil seals and an article he wrote after rockwell experience with the brown viton oil seals at issue in this case.the fact rockwell learned from their experience with the mao shun brown viton seals is not the same as testimony that functional testing should have been done by garlock back in.similarly,mao shun represents that garlock manager of engineering,james drago,testified garlock normally did functional testing and maintained a functional testing lab for precisely this reason.in fact,drago testified garlock would do functional testing only for a newly configured component with a new compound.as garlock considered the radial seals proposed in the summer of to be a standard design configuration not made with a new compound,garlock did not feel functional testing was required 
mao shun failure to fully and accurately summarize the material evidence on this issue forfeits the claim on appeal,which in any event,is meritless.
substantial evidence established garlock tested the mao shun sample seals for purposes of ensuring they were the proper configuration,dimension,and otherwise met specification requirements and that garlock did the normal astm tests to check the basic physical properties of the rubber compound.the seals met specifications and passed the standard astm tests.garlock gave a reasonable explanation of why it did not do any functional testing of the samples.drago specifically testified garlock had no reason to suspect mao shun brown viton seals contained abrasives,which testimony is circumstantially supported by the extraordinary testing later required to isolate the pigment problem.garlock notice in the second quarter of of some unexplained leakage problems with the small number of brown viton seals then in use does not require a finding to the contrary.
substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the abrasiveness of the oil seal lips was not a defect that garlock ought to have discovered.section,subdivision b,therefore,did not exclude the implied warranty of merchantability.
substantial evidence supports the trial court finding mao shun breached section,the implied warranty of merchantability 
mao shun contends that,even if the implied warranty of merchantability were not precluded as a matter of law,the trial court finding that mao shun breached the implied warranty is erroneous as a matter of law based upon the trial court findings of fact.capitalization omitted.mao shun argues the trial court findings of fact preclude a conclusion of law that the oil seals at issue were not fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.mao shun contends the seals were not used in their ordinary course.in its reply brief,mao shun argues there is not substantial evidence to support the finding of breach of the implied warranty because garlock has failed to identify the evidence supporting the trial court conclusion of breach and,going back to its original theme,there is evidence that shows the seals did not fail in ordinary use,but in rockwell particular use.
although mao shun initially frames this issue as one of inconsistency of the trial court findings with its conclusion of law,at its heart,this issue is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence of breach.as such,it is mao shun obligation as appellant,not garlock,to demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support the challenged findings.citations.a recitation of only appellant evidence is not the demonstration contemplated under the above rule.citation.foreman clark,supra,cal d at,italics added by foreman.
mao shun does not set forth all the material evidence and totally ignores the trial court specific findings that rockwell application of mao shun brown viton seals was not unusual or extraordinary.the application presented no exceptional factors in terms of size of the seal,speed of the shaft,shaft material or hardness,temperature,lubricant type,environment or operational durability requirements.to the contrary,the seals at issue were employed in an ordinary manner,within ordinary parameters,and for their ordinary purpose.according to the trial court,d ue to the extraordinary abrasiveness of the mao shun oil seals resulting in damage to the gear reducer shafts and accelerated exhaustion of the seals effectiveness,the seals were not fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used as required under section,subdivision c.capitalization omitted.mao shun has not shown these findings are not supported by substantial evidence mao shun argues only its interpretation of portions of the evidence and picks out isolated phrases of the statement of decision favorable to its position.
we are required,however,to start with the presumption that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.citations.foreman clark,supra,cal d at.and indeed,in this case it does.as the trial court noted,i f goods contain an impurity of such a nature as to render them unusable,and therefore unsaleable,for the general uses and purposes of goods of the kind described,the goods are not merchantable.burr sherwin williams cal d.the goods must be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used,subd.c.evidence was submitted at trial that the selection of a radial oil seal made from viton was an appropriate selection for the gearbox application of rockwell based on consideration of shaft speed,size compatibility,and heat tolerance.the operating conditions for rockwell use of the seals were not unusual or excessive for viton seals.it was a typical application,even if specially designed for rockwell.a viton polymer properly formulated should have been able to handle the application easily.however,almost percent of the mao shun brown viton radial oil seals leaked.this was considered a catastrophic leakage rate in the industry.garlock expert,leslie horve,stated that one of the purposes of oil seals is to prevent premature oil leakage and when a seal experiences premature leakage it has not performed its intended purpose and has failed.when rockwell replaced all brown viton seals with green viton seals,the leakage rate immediately went down to one or two percent and there was no shaft grooving.
the trial court conclusion that mao shun breached the implied warranty of merchantability was supported by both substantial evidence and its express findings of fact.
the trial court award of damages for the breach of the implied warranty of merchantability 
the trial court awarded consequential damages to garlock,concluding t he type of damage caused to rockwell products by mao shun seals,and rockwell necessary response to its customer directly resulting complaints and demands,was a reasonably foreseeable and probable result of mao shun breach of the warranty of merchantability.capitalization omitted.
mao shun attacks the trial court award to garlock of consequential damages and contends garlock obtained the standard remedy for breach of a warranty when prior to any litigation mao shun provided replacement seals at no charge.mao shun also contends the award of additional consequential damages under section,subdivision,was not proper as the damages were not reasonably foreseeable,were not supported by substantial evidence,and included damages related to oil seals purchased outside the statute of limitations period and used after garlock had actual notice of the alleged defect.we consider each of these claims in turn.
reasonable foreseeability of consequential damages 
section,subdivision buyer damages for breach in regard to accepted goods,provides the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted,unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.italics added.consequential damages resulting from a seller breach,include a any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise and b injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty,subdivision b,buyer incidental and consequential damages.
mao shun contends garlock received the value of the goods as warranted when it provided replacements for the brown viton seals without charge,subd.and that any further consequential damages for the cost to replace complete gear reducers were not reasonably foreseeable by mao shun,subd.a.
garlock contends,however,substantial evidence supports the award of consequential damages under section,subdivision b,for damages from injury to property proximately resulting from mao shun breach of warranty and suggests mao shun foreseeability arguments should be considered under the rubric of whether mao shun has shown these other alleged superseding causes eliminate its liability as a matter of law.brewer teano th,d considering the interplay of the rules of intervening and superseding causes in the concept of foreseeability of tort damages mosley arden farms cal d,intervening agency not a superseding cause in tort action.
mao shun does not provide any legal analysis in its briefs of section,subdivision b,does not address garlock claim that the evidence established mao shun brown viton oil seals were a substantial factor in damaging,proximately causing the damage to,rockwell gear reducer shafts,and does not address garlock analysis of its foreseeability arguments as superseding causes.
mao shun complains garlock had knowledge of leakage problems as early as and that it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would fail to disclose this information to sunrise trading or mao shun and would continue to sell brown viton oil seals to rockwell when it knew they were failing.mao shun contends it was not reasonably foreseeable it would be responsible for an alleged defect when it manufactured the seals in compliance with the specification it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would fail to do appropriate testing of the seals it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would continue to use the seals when it knew they were not working in the rockwell applications it was not reasonably foreseeable the failure of a oil seal would lead to replacement of a gear reducer given the lack of any prior complaints or concerns about the abrasiveness of mao shun seals and,it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would include broad express warranties in its contract with rockwell and then try to attempt to hold mao shun responsible for damages stemming from those obligations.
we need not consider garlock claim that damages were properly awarded under section,subdivision b,nor whether superseding cause analysis is applicable in this contractual breach of warranty setting because we conclude mao shun has not met its burden to show substantial evidence does not support the trial court finding of reasonable foreseeability.mao shun has not shown the award of consequential damages under section,subdivision a,was improper.
under section,subdivision a,consequential damages include any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.italics added.
it is often said that damages must be foreseeable to be recoverable for breach of contract.the seminal case announcing this doctrine,still generally accepted as a limitation on damages recoverable for breach of contract,is hadley baxendale.resort video,laser video,th,d,quoting brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy d.the reason to know language of section,subdivision a incorporates the hadley baxendale limitation.raisin growers victor packing d.the code,however,has imposed an objective rather than a subjective standard in determining whether the seller should have anticipated the buyer needs.thus,actual knowledge by the seller of the buyer requirements is not required.the only requirement under section,subdivision a,is that the seller reasonably should have been expected to know of the buyer exposure to loss.ibid.this issue,unless it can be ruled on as a matter of law,is one of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.citation.if supported by the evidence,the decision can not be overturned on appeal.id.at.
again we note,although the issue raised by mao shun involves an application of the substantial evidence standard,mao shun has failed to summarize all the material evidence and argue how it fails to support the trial court decision.mao shun does not show it should not have been expected to know garlock would be exposed to loss,through rockwell complaints and demands for replacement costs of the damaged gearboxes,if the brown viton seals sold by mao shun were unmerchantable because of the abrasiveness of the pigment.mao shun does not show how it was unreasonable to expect it to know of garlock exposure to simply argues its view of the evidence.
thus,mao shun complains garlock had knowledge of leakage problems as early as and that it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would fail to disclose this information to sunrise trading or mao shun and would continue to sell brown viton oil seals to rockwell when it knew they were failing.actually,the evidence shows garlock had knowledge of the nitrile oil seals leaking in and may have had some knowledge of a small number of gear reducer units with brown viton oil seals leaking by the second quarter of,but there is no evidence garlock knew the cause of the leakage problems or that it continued to sell the seals to rockwell after it knew the cause of the leakage problem and had an available alternative.in fact,mao shun argument really goes to whether garlock could have prevented or limited the loss,but,as we have already discussed,substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the abrasiveness of the oil seal lips was not a defect that garlock ought to have discovered in or.there was evidence that garlock continued to sell rockwell the brown viton seals once it was known they were defective only because there was no other available material for the seals and rockwell still needed to meet its customers needs.and the evidence showed that garlock did so only until the green viton seal replacements were available.
mao shun arguments that it was not reasonably foreseeable it would be responsible for an alleged defect when it manufactured the seals in compliance with the specification and that it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would fail to do appropriate testing are a reprise of its claims that it should not be responsible for an implied warranty of merchantability in this case.these arguments do not establish mao shun could not have reasonably foreseen garlock loss if it breached the warranty of merchantability.
mao shun claims it was not reasonably foreseeable the failure of a oil seal would lead to replacement of a gear reducer given the lack of any prior complaints or concerns about the abrasiveness of mao shun seals.on the contrary,as a longtime manufacturer of oil seals,mao shun should have known a radial oil seal is intended to ride on a rotating shaft so as to seal lubrication in and contaminants out.thus,it would have understood the seal could not be used without being incorporated into other machinery,which could be damaged and require replacement if the seal abraded the shaft on which it was set.the lack of prior complaints or concerns about the abrasiveness of its seals is evidence mao shun did not have prior actual knowledge of the abrasiveness of its brown viton seals.however,the lack of prior complaints and the lack of prior actual knowledge of the abrasiveness of the brown viton seal does not establish mao shun did not have reason to know at the time of contracting that its oil seals should not include abrasive materials and that if they did,substantial property damage to the equipment in which they were installed could follow.
finally,mao shun argues it was not reasonably foreseeable garlock would include broad express warranties in its contract with rockwell and then try to attempt to hold mao shun responsible for damages stemming from those obligations.it is true rockwell purchase order to garlock contained express,as well as implied,seller warranties,but the existence of warranties in the contract beyond the implied warranty of merchantability did not make the mao shun brown viton oil seals any less defective and more merchantable.based solely on the abrasiveness of the brown viton oil seal mao shun manufactured which garlock supplied to rockwell,garlock breached the implied warranty of merchantability it gave to rockwell and no resort to any further or additional warranties would have been necessary for garlock to have been liable to rockwell in the federal lawsuit for the damages caused by its breach.
substantial evidence to support the award of consequential damages 
the trial court concluded garlock had proved recoverable consequential damages in the amount of.the statement of decision explains how the court arrived at this figure as follows garlock demonstrated that there existed a high probability that rockwell would recover in damages against garlock for the mao shun seal failure.this figure is composed of costs of replacement not including rockwell airfare,travel,other labor,lost profits,or attorney fees,and interest upon that amount at for a period of months in the amount of.this figure constitutes of the total figure of which was characterized by garlock as the high probability rockwell damage risk,a figure used by garlock to calculate its ultimate settlement with rockwell.garlock paid rockwell to settle the parties dispute the court values the product discounts,incurred or anticipated,at.the sum of represents the percentage of garlock actual settlement payment that corresponds to the portion of rockwell damages,the recovery of which was highly probable and sufficiently established by the evidence at trial.capitalization omitted.
the trial court figures are drawn directly from exhibit h to the damages summary prepared by james skorheim,garlock accounting expert,who testified at trial regarding garlock economic losses from its dispute with rockwell regarding the defects in the brown viton seals produced by mao shun.the figures are fully supported by skorheim testimony and supporting documentation to his summary.
nevertheless,mao shun claims on appeal the award of damages is not supported by substantial evidence.mao shun contends the trial court calculation of damages erroneously focuses on the reasonableness of garlock settlement with rockwell in light of the testimony of its expert skorheim regarding the probability of incurring an adverse judgment at various monetary levels.capitalization omitted.mao shun claims this was legal error because the proper analysis is whether garlock proved the damages were proximately caused by mao shun purported breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.mao shun claims garlock did not meet this burden and there is not substantial evidence to support the award.mao shun claims the trial evidence is clear garlock liability to rockwell stemmed from the broad express warranty and separate indemnification provision in its contract with rockwell.
mao shun argument is based on the flawed premise that garlock liability to rockwell was not based on garlock mao shun breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.in fact,the evidence shows skorheim calculated his estimates of garlock probability of loss from the deficiencies and defects in the brown viton oil seal produced by mao shun.john mayo,legal counsel for garlock at the time of its settlement with rockwell,testified he negotiated and recommended garlock settlement of the lawsuit for a total of million,which was below the low end of his estimation of garlock liability.mayo admitted part of his analysis in recommending settlement was the applicability of the terms and conditions in garlock contract with rockwell,but such terms and conditions specifically contained a warranty that all goods covered by this order are merchantable,free from defects in design,material and workmanship.mayo was concerned rockwell would win the case against garlock if it went to trial.and,as we have already noted,given the conclusion the mao shun oil seals were not merchantable,garlock would have been liable to rockwell for the breach of such implied warranty regardless of whether additional warranties existed.
the trial court damage award is supported by substantial evidence.
damages for oil seals purchased outside the statute of limitations period 
mao shun claims the consequential damages awarded by the trial court improperly included replacement costs related to oil seals purchased outside the statute of limitations period mao shun points to testimony by bushey,rockwell warranty administrator,regarding rockwell purchase of brown viton oil seals starting in and her knowledge of warranty claims for leaking gear reducers in.what mao shun fails to do,however,is to connect such testimony to the trial court award of consequential damages.
the trial court did not award consequential damages for all the costs of replacement incurred by rockwell.the trial court awarded as damages a percentage of garlock settlement payment that corresponds to the portion of rockwell damages,the recovery of which was highly probable and sufficiently established by the evidence at trial.italics added.the damage figures from which such percentage was derived were taken from skorheim calculation of garlock economic losses from the dispute with rockwell.such damage figures were themselves a product of a percentage of probability that a jury would have awarded rockwell those damages against garlock if the case had gone to trial.that is,the damage figures were a portion of rockwell damages,but we do not know which portion.
in these circumstances,we can not say the award of consequential damages as calculated by the trial court contained any damages for replacement costs related to oil seals purchased more than four years before the filing of this action.mao shun has not established any error 
damages for oil seals used after garlock and rockwell had notice of the alleged defect 
mao shun claims the consequential damages awarded by the trial court improperly included replacement costs related to oil seals used after garlock and rockwell had actual knowledge of problems with the brown viton oil seals.mao shun argues such use of its seals after notice of the problem was a failure to mitigate if not an outright assumption of the risk.accordingly,such replacement costs should not be included in any damages award.we disagree.
we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,accept as true all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom that tend to establish the correctness of the trial court findings and decision,and resolve every conflict in favor of the judgment.citation.baxter healthcare denton,supra,th at,d.the record here contains evidence that garlock and rockwell had no choice other than to use the defective seals until the precise cause of the leakage problem was identified and an alternative material was found.rockwell could not just stop supplying its customer needs.it would be responsible for the customer losses and would lose customers.in such circumstances,there was no failure to mitigate or assumption of the risk.the trial court was not required to exclude from its damages calculation replacement costs attributable to seals used after notice of the problem.
e.the effect of the number of gear reducers examined on the award of damages 
in its reply brief mao shun raises for the first time a claim garlock and rockwell examined a statistically insignificant number of gear reducers to support the replacement costs on which the trial court relied for its award of consequential damages.
we will not consider points raised for the first time in an appellant reply brief,unless good reason is shown for the failure to present them earlier.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d,fn.mao shun has made no such showing.
sunrise trading was mao shun agenta.factual background 
mao started sunrise trading as an business in.initially he thought he would import gift items.he bought and imported wind chimes,but as he did not have any contacts for the sale of the chimes,he ended up trying to get rid of the chimes at denio sunday market,a flea market in roseville.it took him years to sell all of the chimes.after that experience,mao gave up on purchasing and importing items to sell in the united states.he decided it would be better to provide service as an american agent for an asian company.
in,after mao gave a speech for the sacramento chamber of commerce regarding trade with taiwan,he was contacted by mao shun.mao met with joseph shek,the president of mao shun,and jensen chen,the general manager of mao shun.shek and chen told mao they wanted to sell mao shun products in the united states and they needed an agent to find buyers and take care of the language problem.when mao told them he had no knowledge of their products and could not buy their products,shek and chen assured him he did not need to worry.mao shun would be responsible for explaining their merchandise and would take care of all quality issues.mao emphasized he had no knowledge of oil seals.he could only act as an agent,as a facilitator.shek and chen told mao that mao shun would be percent responsible for quality and liability.they just needed mao to be their agent.mao,shek and chen signed an agreement that day,written in chinese,to set up their relationship.the agreement stated in part mao,of sunrise trading company,will be the representative of mao shun in the united states.the responsibility for sunrise trading company is to help promote the merchandise produced by mao shun company and help to secure the orders and ship and merchandise will be directly shipped out from mao shun.the same word is used in chinese for agent or representative.the agreement provided for mao shun to pay sunrise trading a base five percent commission for its sales.
after signing the agreement,sunrise trading sent out promotional fliers for mao shun products.garlock subsequently contacted sunrise trading regarding purchasing mao shun oil seals.a garlock representative came to sacramento to meet with mao and mao assistant,april chi.following that meeting,mao set up a meeting between shek and chen of mao shun and garlock representatives at garlock offices in new york state.at that meeting in new york,mao explained sunrise trading was the agent for mao shun.
james cook,an employee of garlock,then went to taiwan to see the mao shun facilities.garlock placed a trial piece of business with mao shun and then started placing further orders for oil seals.cook testified he was told mao shun would do business through sunrise trading.sunrise trading was essentially a sales office of mao shun.sunrise trading was mao shun agent.
cook was the person from garlock having personal contact with sunrise trading and mao shun until,when he changed positions.cook testified the only written contracts between garlock and mao shun were the purchase orders.each purchase order would govern the material in that order.
sunrise trading and mao shun operated under their original agreement without any amendment between and.in,cook talked to chi about garlock increasing its volume of orders from mao shun.garlock wanted to stop using expensive air freight and use ocean shipping.cook asked sunrise trading if they would be able to assist.chi discussed the proposed change in shipping with either shek or chen.to use ocean shipping,sunrise trading had to pick up the products from oakland,pay the customs charges,and arrange for a freight forwarder.mao shun authorized sunrise trading to add an additional percentage to the product price to cover sunrise trading additional costs.the total standard markup became percent.it was agreed sunrise trading could start taking shipments into the united states for garlock.
mao shun never told chi the change in procedure made sunrise trading the seller of the oil seals.there was no new agreement written between sunrise trading and mao shun.mao testified sunrise trading and mao shun were still operating under the agreement except for an oral understanding that there was a change in sunrise trading compensation.mao understood sunrise trading was still acting as the representative of mao shun.there was simply a change in the process to save garlock costs made at the request of both garlock and mao shun.mao shun would ship to sunrise trading,who would receive the product,clear customs and then ship it to garlock.according to chi,the purpose of the change was administrative efficiency.
darin thibideau was in charge of operations for sunrise trading in,and.he was told when he was hired that the nature of sunrise trading work was managing the flow of communications and products between mao shun and its customers in the united states.thibideau understood sunrise trading was acting as an agent for mao shun.no one with mao shun ever told him mao shun considered garlock to be sunrise trading customer.
thibideau described the procedure for processing a garlock order.garlock would fax a purchase order to sunrise trading.on the basis of the fax,thibideau would generate a sunrise trading purchase order that he would fax to mao shun.mao shun would confirm sunrise trading purchase order by hand notation on the purchase order form,which would be faxed back to sunrise trading.sunrise trading would then transmit an order confirmation form to garlock.at a later date garlock would send sunrise trading a hard copy of its faxed purchase order.the underlying agreement between sunrise trading and mao shun was that sunrise trading would make payment to mao shun only upon receipt of payment from garlock.thibideau could not remember a time when garlock was late in its payment and mao shun nevertheless demanded payment from sunrise trading.
thibideau testified sunrise trading never offered warranties or limitations on mao shun products because mao shun,not sunrise trading,was the warrantor.when a common warranty question arose,he would communicate it to mao shun and await their instructions.
joseph shek,president of mao shun,testified mao shun agreement with sunrise trading changed in or.before such change,sunrise trading was compensated on a commission basis.after the change,the parties dealt on a quoting basis,mao shun would give a quote and sunrise trading would place an order.sunrise trading would ship the products and mao shun would receive payment from sunrise trading.after the change in the agreement,mao shun always sold directly to sunrise trading.after the change mao shun did not have an agreement with sunrise trading that limited who sunrise trading could buy seals from or whom they could sell them to in the united states.mao shun did not know the price sunrise trading charged for the seals.shek had never authorized anyone at sunrise trading to enter into an agreement on behalf of mao shun.
actual agency 
the essential characteristics of an agency relationship as laid out in the restatement are as follows an agent or apparent agent holds a power to alter the legal relations between the principal and third persons and between the principal and himself an agent is a fiduciary with respect to matters within the scope of the agency and a principal has the right to control the conduct of the agent with respect to matters entrusted to him.citation.alvarez felker d.see also,an agent is one who represents another,called the principal,in dealings with third persons.lewis superior court th,d.
in the situation where goods pass from a manufacturer to another party for resale to a third person,the restatement adds the following one who receives goods from another for resale to a third person is not thereby the other agent in the transaction whether he is an agent for this purpose or is himself a buyer depends upon whether the parties agree that his duty is to act primarily for the benefit of the one delivering the goods to him or is to act primarily for his own benefit.rest d agency,j see d agency.
after noting this law,the trial court considered eight factors relevant to determining whether a company that receives goods for resale is an agent or buyer of the manufacturer.the eight factors were whether the company obtains legal title and possession of the goods deals with the purchaser of the goods in its own name and does not disclose that the goods are those of another bears the risk of accident or casualty to the goods can fix the price at which it sells the goods without accounting to the manufacturer for the difference between what it obtains and the price it pays has the right to purchase goods of another manufacturer must pay for the goods regardless of whether it can resell them receives a commission for its services in reselling the goods and is obligated to complete preparation or manufacture of the goods.after considering the evidence in light of these factors,the trial court came to the conclusion the relationship between mao shun and sunrise trading was one of agency.according to the trial court,the essential facts of the parties relationship demonstrate that sunrise trading duty was primarily to act for the benefit of mao shun,not itself,in its transactions with garlock.capitalization omitted.
the existence of an agency relationship is a factual question for the trier of fact whose determination must be affirmed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.violette shoup th,d inglewood teachers public employment relations bd.d.wickham southland,supra,d at.only when the essential facts are not in conflict will an agency determination be made as a matter of law.wickham southland,supra,at.see violette shoup,supra,at,d.
mao shun contends the trial court incorrectly applied the law to the facts in concluding sunrise trading was entitled to indemnity because it was mao shun agent.mao shun claims the trial court gave undue weight to conduct that occurred prior to the modifications to the agreement.mao shun then the eight factors considered by the trial court in the light of evidence favorable to it and argues the factors mandate a finding there was no agency relationship between mao shun and sunrise trading 
mao shun argument ignores the rules regarding appellate review for sufficiency of the evidence,which we have already summarized.mao shun complaint that the trial court gave undue weight to some of the evidence asks this court to reweigh the evidence,which we may not do.scott pacific gas electric cal th,d.even more fundamentally,it is mao shun burden as appellant to set forth all of the material evidence,not merely the evidence favorable to it,and to show how the evidence is insufficient to support the challenged finding.foreman clark,supra,cal d at,baxter healthcare denton,supra,th at,d.this is not what mao shun has done.mao shun has,therefore,forfeited its sufficiency of the evidence challenge to the trial court agency finding.foreman clark,supra,at,road sprinkler fitters local union g g fire sprinklers,supra,th at,d.
mao shun argument is also meritless.our summary of the evidence amply demonstrates substantial evidence to support the trial court finding of agency.there was considerable evidence the parties agreed to an express agency relationship in that was not changed by the amendments in,which were made to accommodate garlock interest in having mao shun product shipped by a less expensive method.a consideration of the evidence,in the light most favorable to the judgment as required on appeal,establishes sunrise trading duty was to act primarily for the benefit of mao shun,rather than itself,in its transactions with garlock.rest d agency,
ostensible agency 
an agency is ostensible when the principal intentionally,or by want of ordinary care,causes a third person to believe another to be his agent who is not really employed by him.ostensible authority is such as a principal,intentionally or by want of ordinary care,causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess.
the trial court found that even if the relationship between mao shun and sunrise trading was not one of actual agency,there was an ostensible agency as to the transactions with garlock.given our conclusion that substantial evidence supports the trial court finding of actual agency,we do not need to decide mao shun claim on appeal that the trial court finding of ostensible agency was error.
summary of our conclusions on mao shun appeal 
we conclude mao shun sale of the brown viton radial oil seals in this case included an implied warranty of merchantability.the trial court conclusion that mao shun breached the implied warranty of merchantability is supported by both substantial evidence and the trial court express findings of fact.we reject each of mao shun claims regarding the trial court award of consequential damages.we conclude substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that sunrise trading was the actual agent of mao shun in the transactions with garlock.
based on these conclusions,we affirm the trial court judgment awarding garlock damages for mao shun breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and ordering mao shun to indemnify sunrise trading for its costs of defending the garlock action.we turn to garlock appeal.
garlock appeal 
trial court erred in limiting implied contractual indemnity to cases involving a negligent breach of contract 
indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d.it arises from two sources first,it may arise by virtue of express contractual language establishing a duty in one party to save another harmless upon the occurrence of specified circumstances.second,it may find its source in equitable considerations brought into play either by contractual language not specifically dealing with indemnification or by the equities of the particular case.citations.white,city of huntington beach cal d,bay development,superior court cal d,bay development see rossmoor sanitation,pylon,supra,at.both the latter doctrines of implied indemnity rest on the equities of the circumstances,tortfeasors sharing loss in proportion to their culpability,contracting parties sharing loss relative to their breach.murray,mills concrete construction d.murray see sehulster traylor brothers,obayashi th,d.implied contractual indemnity is a type of equitable indemnity bay development,supra,at,predicated on the indemnitor breach of contract with the indemnitee.west superior court th,d cahill,clementina d,disapproved on another point in bay development,supra,at.

it is important to understand some of the historical context of california recognition of implied contractual indemnity.
the doctrine first clear recognition in california came in the case of san francisco unified school dist.california.maintenance d,unified school dist.montgomery ward kpix westinghouse broadcasting d.in unified school,the defendant maintenance company had a contract to wash the windows of plaintiff district high schools.the contract required that,in all schools that have hauser window sashes,stepladders must be used from inside and the contractor is held responsible for payment of any and all damages resulting from his operations.d at.an employee of the maintenance company was injured while washing a hauser type window while not using a stepladder.id.at.the injured employee sued the school district on the ground it had failed to provide a safe place to work and recovered a judgment.after satisfying the judgment,the school district sued the maintenance company for indemnity.the appellate court found the evidence showed the maintenance company breached its contract with the school district when it failed to furnish stepladders to its window washers and failed to require the washers to use ladders while washing hauser type windows.id.at,in reviewing the language of the contract between the maintenance company and the school district the court stated,even if this did not amount to an express contract to indemnify the school district for damages caused to it by a breach of the contract by the maintenance company,such a warranty or agreement to indemnify would necessarily be implied.id.at.
the court in unified school,supra,d,found persuasive authority for its conclusion in two united states supreme court cases,ryan stevedoring,steamship.ryan and weyerhaeuser nacirema operating,d weyerhaeuser.in both ryan and weyerhaeuser the united states supreme court held a shipowner could claim implied contractual indemnity against a stevedoring company whose employees had recovered a judgment against the shipowner for injuries sustained while unloading a ship.the cases held the stevedoring company could be liable for reimbursement to the shipowner where the injuries to the longshoreman resulted from the unsafe stowage of cargo in ryan and an unsafe winch shelter erected by the stevedoring company in weyerhaeuser.ryan,supra,at.at.at weyerhaeuser,supra,at.at,d at.citing to ryan the supreme court in weyerhaeuser stated that w hile the stevedoring contract contained no express indemnity clause,it obligated respondent to faithfully furnish such stevedoring services as may be required,and to provide all necessary labor and supervision for the proper and efficient conduct of the work.as this court said in ryan stevedoring,supra,such language constitutes a contractual undertaking to perform with reasonable safety,at,at,and to discharge foreseeable damages resulting to the shipowner from the contractor improper performance,at,footnote,at,footnote.weyerhaeuser,supra,at.at,d at,fn.omitted.
following unified school,supra,d,the first district court of appeal,in alisal sanitary dist.kennedy d,concluded plaintiff had stated a cause of action for indemnity where the complaint alleged in substance the plaintiff engaged defendants to do engineering work for which the defendants represented themselves to be skilled specialists,that the work was negligently done,and such negligence caused personal injuries for which the plaintiff was obliged to pay damages.id.at.the court stated,the gist of the complaint is the defendants breach of its obligation to perform the engineering work in the skillful,expert,and careful manner they had represented they were capable of doing and the plaintiff reliance on defendants judgment and knowledge in matters in which the latter were experts.such an obligation carries with it an implied agreement to indemnify and to discharge foreseeable damages resulting to the plaintiff from the defendants negligent performance.ibid.

this brings us to bear creek,supra,d,the case on which the trial court here placed its reliance for a negligence requirement for implied contractual indemnity.in bear creek plaintiff homeowner association sought and obtained indemnification from defendant title insurer for damages it sustained in a slander of title suit due to defendant failure to record covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc rs on all lots in the subdivision.id.at.the trial court concluded the title insurer had breached its contractual obligation to timely record the cc rs and awarded indemnity.id.at.although this court reversed a portion of the judgment dealing with the award of interest and attorney fees,we otherwise affirmed the trial court judgment.id.at.
distinguishing the equitable indemnity doctrine applicable between joint tortfeasors from implied contractual indemnity,this court referred to the language of great western quoted ante and then stated the language relied on the trial court here in short,implied contractual indemnity is based upon the premise that a contractual obligation to perform carries with it an implied agreement to indemnify and to discharge foreseeable sic damages resulting to the plaintiff indemnitee from the defendants indemnitor negligent performance.bear creek,supra,d at,quoting alisal sanitary dist.kennedy,supra,d.with italics added in bear creek.as additional authority this court cited a number of the cases we have just reviewed here.bear creek,supra,at.citing ryan,supra,weyerhaeuser nacirema,supra,d,unified school,supra,d,montgomery ward kpix westinghouse broadcasting,supra,d.however,the opinion goes on to later emphasize,an action for implied contractual indemnity is not a claim for contribution from a joint tortfeasor it is not founded upon a tort or upon any duty which the indemnitor o
