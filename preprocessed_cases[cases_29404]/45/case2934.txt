introduction 
in this insurance coverage action,defendants prudential insurance company of america and prudential health care plan of california,petition for extraordinary relief from the order of respondent court denying their motion for summary judgment.to determine whether extraordinary relief is warranted,we consider an issue of first impression in california insurance law concerning the interpretation of the phrase enrolled as a student in a school in a group health policy that provides medical coverage to employees dependents aged to who meet that description.the courts of other jurisdictions have determined that the plain meaning of the word enrolled is that the dependent is registered at an academic institution,and that the phrase student plainly means that the dependent spends a substantial amount of time attending classes.we find these decisions persuasive.therefore,because it is undisputed that at the time of her catastrophic accident in november plaintiff michelle dunniway was not registered at an academic institution and was not attending any classes,as a matter of law she did not qualify for dependents medical coverage under defendants group health policy.defendants therefore have no obligation to provide her with lifetime medical coverage for her medical expenses.accordingly,we will grant extraordinary relief as requested and issue a writ of mandate directing respondent court to grant defendants motion for summary judgment.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the prudential group health policy 
michelle father william dunniway william was an employee of the hermon association from september,to september,the employees of the hermon association had medical coverage under a prudential health care group contract the plan.the plan provides medical coverage for qualified dependents,who include employees unmarried children under the age of.additionally,the plan provides qualified dependents coverage to children aged to if certain eligibility requirements are met the age limit does not apply to a child who a is wholly dependent on you the employee for support and maintenance and b is enrolled as a student in a school and c is less than the student age limit.student age limit.
the plan requires the employee to notify the employer promptly when a qualified dependent becomes ineligible.additionally,the plan states,your dependents coverage for a qualified dependent will end when that person moves his or her permanent address outside the service area or ceases to be a qualified dependent.the plan also includes options for the continuation of medical coverage when coverage under the plan ends,including group health care continuation under cobra,extension of group health care protection for disabled persons,and a conversion privilege for an individual health care coverage contract.
to obtain qualified dependents coverage for michelle,william submitted to prudential an overage dependent student verification form stating that michelle was a student at the university of california,santa barbara ucsb as of august.michelle qualified dependents coverage became effective on september.
michelle student status at ucsb 
the following facts appear to be undisputed.michelle attended ucsb as a freshman during the school year.for a variety of personal reasons,her freshman year did not go well and her average fell below ucsb required minimum.in a letter dated june,the acting dean of undergraduate studies advised michelle that she was subject to academic disqualification and was not eligible to continue at ucsb unless she was reinstated to the college.the acting dean further advised michelle that she could not be reinstated unless she submitted a written appeal.michelle did so.in a letter dated august,ucsb advised michelle that her appeal had been reviewed and that she had been reinstated on probation for the fall quarter.the letter also states,if you prefer to delay your return to ucsb for one or more quarters,you should file a notice of intent to cancel registration with the office of the registrar and you should not pay your fees for fall.when you feel ready to resume your studies here,you must file an application for readmission and reinstatement after absence with the office of the registrar several months before your planned return.we will examine your record and your new appeal at that time and,in the absence of any negative factors,we will reinstate you on probation.
in response to the letter of august,michelle filed a notice of intent to cancel registration.the notice stated,i am notifying the office of the registrar that i will not be returning for fall quarter.in an accompanying letter michelle wrote,i need to take a quarter break to tend to personal problems and work full time for money for tuition.in another letter to ucsb,dated september,michelle stated,i am requesting that my records and status here at ucsb be put on hold and that i will be able to return and appeal for reinstatement.i also would like the proper application for readmission at winter of.according to michelle mother,crystal dunniway,michelle made the decision to take fall quarter off on the advice of her college counselor.
on october,ucsb entered michelle cancellation of registration into its official records.michelle did not attend any classes during fall quarter.unfortunately,michelle never returned to college.on november,she sustained catastrophic injuries in an automobile accident.michelle is now a totally disabled quadriplegic with brain damage and a claim for ongoing medical expenses in excess of per year for the rest of her life.
prudential termination of michelle qualified dependents coverage 
on october,prior to michelle accident,prudential terminated michelle coverage as a qualified dependent effective october.according to prudential,michelle coverage was terminated because william failed to return the overage student verification form which prudential had sent to him in august.william and crystal deny ever receiving the august over age student verification form.they assert that they did not know that michelle coverage had been terminated until after her accident in november.
to obtain medical coverage for michelle after her catastrophic accident,william elected continuation coverage under cobra.cobra is federal legislation mandating that certain employees and their dependents be offered the option of paying premiums to continue medical coverage for a limited time period after the termination of coverage under a group health plan,through.prudential provided cobra continuation coverage to michelle retroactive to november.when william employer switched its group health coverage from prudential to lifeguard in august,prudential obligation to provide cobra coverage ceased.however,prudential provided michelle with an additional months of medical coverage pursuant to the plan provision for extension of group health care protection to disabled persons.michelle has not received any medical coverage benefits from prudential since the extended coverage ended on august.
d.the action against prudential 
through her mother and guardian ad litem crystal,michelle filed an insurance coverage action against defendants prudential,lifeguard insurance company and lifeguard,collectively,lifeguard the currently operative pleading is the first amended complaint.in the complaint,michelle alleges that all premiums owed to prudential for her medical coverage have been paid and that she was covered as a dependent insured on the date of her accident.michelle also alleges that prudential has refused to pay any of her ongoing medical expenses.further,michelle asserts that prudential has failed to properly investigate or process her claim and has refused to respond to her parents inquiries.
the complaint includes causes of action for breach of contract,declaratory relief,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.as remedies,the complaint seeks unpaid benefits,a declaration that defendants have an obligation to pay michelle ongoing medical expenses,attorney fees,general damages for emotional distress,and punitive damages.
prudential motion for summary judgment 
prudential filed a motion for summary judgment,or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on grounds that each cause of action in the complaint lacked merit as a matter of law.first,prudential argued that it has not breached the insurance contract because the undisputed facts showed that michelle has received all medical benefits under the plan to which she was entitled after her eligibility for qualified dependents coverage ended,including cobra continuation coverage and months of extended coverage.prudential further contended that it had no obligation to provide michelle with lifetime coverage for her medical expenses,because the plan did not provide coverage for medical services received after the plan ended.alternatively,prudential argued that michelle was not covered as a qualified dependent on the date of her accident because she was not a student enrolled in a school,and therefore her right to coverage had not vested such that prudential had an obligation to provide her with lifetime coverage for medical expenses related to her accident injuries.prudential contention that michelle was not a student enrolled in a school was based on ucsb records which showed that as of the date of the accident,november,michelle had canceled her registration,was not attending classes at ucsb,and could not return to ucsb without reapplying for admission and having her application accepted by ucsb.
second,prudential asserted that because it had not breached the insurance contract,as a matter of law it could not be held liable for either the derivative claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing or an award of punitive damages.alternatively,prudential argued that it had no liability because it was not a party to the insurance contract.prudential asserted that an entity not named as a defendant,prudential healthcare,actually had issued the plan.
plaintiff opposition to the motion for summary judgment 
in her opposition to prudential motion for summary judgment,michelle argued that triable questions of fact precluded summary adjudication of any cause of action.regarding the first cause of action for breach of contract,michelle contended that prudential had a contractual obligation to provide her with continuous lifetime care because she was covered under the plan as a qualified dependent on the date of her accident.since prudential had denied medical benefits to michelle as of september,michelle asserted that prudential had breached the contract.
in making this argument,michelle disputed prudential factual assertion that at the time of the accident she was not a student who was eligible for qualified dependents coverage.according to plaintiff separate statement of facts,a t the time of her accident,michelle was on approved leave and remained in good standing with the university.she had followed the necessary procedures to take time off from her classes and still preserve a spot in the upcoming winter quarter,and could return to her classes in the winter quarter without reapplying for admission to ucsb.as evidentiary support for this fact,michelle cited the declaration of virginia johns,ucsb associate registrar.moreover,michelle also asserted that ucsb policies and procedures established that a student could take approved leave or withdraw for a quarter while remaining in good standing,and could resume classes the following quarter without reapplying for admission.
michelle further argued that prudential had denied her claim for lifetime medical benefits due to the size of her claim,based on prudential provision of medical benefits to other dependents who were not attending classes.according to michelle,prudential internal documents and the testimony of a prudential representative showed that prudential customarily provided qualified dependents coverage to those dependents who were considered to be in good standing by their academic institutions,without regard to whether the dependent was enrolled or attending classes.
additionally,michelle argued that triable questions of fact existed with regard to whether prudential properly canceled her coverage prior to her accident.she asserted that prudential had failed to provide michelle parents with written notice of cancellation and had also failed to follow its own policy of not canceling an unqualified dependent coverage until the dependent birthday.also,michelle noted that prudential had accepted a premium payment for her qualified dependent coverage in november and did not reimburse the premium until after her accident.
as to the second cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,michelle argued that triable questions of fact existed as to whether prudential demonstrated bad faith by unreasonably denying benefits,using inadequate notification policies,failing to investigate her claim,and failing to follow its internal procedures with respect to covering dependents who are college students.these triable questions of fact also preclude a summary adjudication of her claim for punitive damages,michelle argued.
finally,michelle asserted that defendant prudential insurance company of america,was a proper party defendant because it had authority to negotiate and approve contract amendments to the plan.
g.the trial court order 
the trial court denied prudential motion for summary judgment.the court reasoned as follows as to whether plaintiff was a qualified dependent,the court finds that there is a triable issue of material fact see code of civ,subd.g as to whether plaintiff was enrolled as a full time student,as that term is used to determine if a dependent is insured under the health insurance policy at issue in this case.there is a triable issue whether plaintiff had a reasonable expectation of continued coverage.see the johns sic declaration and plaintiff separate statement,paragraphs.the court further finds that the prudential defendants have failed to sustain their burden that they have paid all benefits to which plaintiff is entitled the full payment theory under fields blue shield of california d,plaintiff has vested lifetime benefits if she is found to be a qualified dependent.
the trial court denied the motion for summary adjudication of the first cause of action for breach of contract and the second cause of action for declaratory relief for the same reasons.as to the third cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the court denied summary adjudication on the ground that moving parties separate statement does not show that they acted reasonably as a matter of law thus the defendants failed to carry their burden on this motion.
iii.discussion 
after the trial court denied its motion for summary judgment,prudential filed a petition for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order and enter a new order granting the motion.we issued an alternative writ and a temporary stay of all trial court proceedings while the writ petition was pending.
availability of writ relief and the standard of review 
an order denying a motion for summary judgment may be reviewed by way of a petition for a writ of mandate,subd.l.where the trial court denial of a motion for summary judgment will result in a trial on claims,a writ of mandate will issue.lompoc unified school dist.superior court th,d.since a motion for summary judgment involves pure matters of law,we review a ruling on the motion independently.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.summary judgment is proper when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,subd.c.a defendant making the motion has the initial burden of showing that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action,subd.o aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.if the defendant fails to make this initial showing,it is unnecessary to examine the plaintiff opposing evidence and the motion must be denied.however,if the moving papers establish a prima facie showing that justifies a judgment in the defendant favor,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable material factual issue.in meeting this obligation,the plaintiff may not rely on the mere allegations of its pleadings,but must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action,subd.o aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
with regard to the interpretation of insurance policies,the reviewing court makes an independent determination of the policy meaning unless such interpretation turned upon the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,cooper companies transcontinental ins.th,d.applying the independent standard of review,we review the moving and opposing papers and supporting evidence to determine whether prudential is entitled to summary judgment because the material undisputed facts show that prudential has met its contractual obligation to provide all medical benefits that michelle is entitled to receive under the plan,and therefore all causes of action in michelle complaint lack merit as a matter of law.
prudential is entitled to summary judgment 
the crux of michelle complaint is her claim that prudential is obligated under the plan to provide coverage for her medical expenses for the rest of her life.because prudential ceased payment of michelle medical expenses after august,and has denied her claim for lifetime benefits,michelle contends that prudential has breached both the insurance contract set forth in the plan and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,in a manner sufficiently egregious to justify an award of punitive damages.michelle claim for lifetime benefits is based upon the concept of insurance coverage vesting,as discussed in fields blue shield of california,supra,d.
the concept of insurance coverage vesting 
fields blue shield of california,supra,d,is one of the few california decisions to address the concept of insurance coverage vesting in the context of a group health policy.the facts in fields blue shield of california involve a claim of lifetime coverage for psychoanalysis.plaintiff fields sued blue shield after blue shield refused to pay for fields psychoanalysis,which fields had undergone as part of his training to become a psychoanalyst.fields argued that blue shield group health insurance plan provided him with lifetime maximum benefits of for psychoanalysis,as the plan had originally stated at the time of his enrollment.although blue shield later modified the plan to eliminate coverage for psychoanalysis obtained in furtherance of training,fields asserted that the modification did not eliminate his coverage because his right to coverage had vested.the appellate court agreed with fields,ruling,once liability has attached under a group is,after the happening of the event insured or modification of the master policy is ineffective to preclude recovery by the employee,or his beneficiary as provided by the original policy.fields blue shield of california,supra,d at,quoting,cancellation or modification of master policy as termination of coverage under group policy,italics omitted.because blue shield had provided fields with coverage for psychoanalysis in furtherance of training prior to modifying the policy to eliminate such coverage,the court concluded that fields had a vested right to coverage from blue shield until the lifetime maximum benefits of were exhausted.fields blue shield of california,supra,d at.
michelle contends that,like fields,her right to lifetime medical benefits has vested.she argues that the plan is ambiguous as to the insured right,after the policy terminates,to receive benefits for posttermination expenses incurred for pretermination injuries,and that such ambiguity must be construed against the insurer to allow vesting.for that reason,michelle contends that the trial court correctly determined that her right to lifetime medical coverage became vested at the time of her accident if she is found to be qualified dependent.since,in michelle view,her evidence shows that she was a qualified dependent,she asserts that prudential has an obligation to provide coverage for her medical expenses for the rest of her life.at a minimum,michelle argues,her evidence creates triable questions of fact as to whether she was a qualified dependent which preclude the granting of prudential motion for summary judgment.
prudential rejects michelle claim to vesting on the ground that the plan does not contain any express provisions for lifetime medical benefits.to the contrary,prudential insists that the plan language expressly provides that dependents coverage ends when the group contract ends or when the dependent ceases to be a qualified dependent.benefits,according to prudential,are limited to those benefits provided by the plan provisions for cobra continuation coverage,extension of group health care protection,and the conversion privilege for individual health care contracts.prudential relies upon the decision in fraker sentry life ins.th,d,in which the court ruled that a claim for posttermination benefits,coverage for medical expenses incurred after termination of a group health policy was resolved by reference to the policy language.we look first at what event was insured according to the language of the instant policy.if the relevant event was the inception of a disease or condition by the claimant during the life of the policy,this may give rise to the insurer liability.if the claimant incurrence of medical expenses during the policy period was the relevant event,then this creates only pretermination liability for the insurer.id.at,d.thus,if the subject policy expressly provides for termination of coverage or for posttermination benefits under strictly limited conditions,no vesting of benefits has been found.see also williams california physicians service th,d.prudential contends that the plan falls into this category,since the policy language provides that posttermination benefits are limited to cobra continuation coverage,extended benefits coverage for disability,and the conversion privilege for individual health care contracts.
however,we need not determine whether the language of the plan may be interpreted to provide for the vesting of a right to lifetime medical benefits,or,indeed,whether the concept of vesting should apply at all to health insurance contracts.fraker sentry life ins,supra,th at,d.a single threshold issue is determinative of michelle claim.as the trial court correctly reasoned,michelle right to vesting depends upon an initial finding that she was insured under the plan as a qualified dependent on the date of her accident.regardless of the policy language,vesting can not occur unless the claimant was insured under the policy at the time of illness or injury.see fields blue shield of california,supra,d at.oklahoma state educ.emp.fullerton,rights of student dependent under group health plan vested when accident occurred during policy period.
therefore,to determine whether prudential motion for summary judgment should be granted,we must consider the threshold issue of whether the undisputed facts show that michelle was not insured under the plan as a qualified dependent on the date of her accident.this determination requires interpretation of the plan provision for qualified dependents coverage.
the principles of insurance policy interpretation 
the plan provision for qualified dependents coverage states,the age limit does not apply to a child who a is wholly dependent on you the employee for support and maintenance and b is enrolled as a student in a school and c is less than the student age limit.student age limit.since it is undisputed that michelle met the eligibility requirements of falling within the to age group and being wholly dependent upon william for support and maintenance,the question is whether michelle was also enrolled as a student in a school at the time of her accident.the phrase enrolled as a student in a school is not defined in the plan.therefore,we must determine the meaning of the phrase in the context of a group health policy.our analysis is governed by the principles of policy interpretation.
to resolve a question of policy interpretation,the court performs an independent review,looking first to the language of the insurance policy in order to ascertain its plain meaning as a layperson would understand it.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the court is guided by the principle that the provisions of an insurance policy must be construed within the context of the policy as a whole.aydin first state ins.cal th,d.the plain meaning of a policy provision governs,and an insured reasonable expectations are not considered except where the policy provisions are ambiguous,national union fire ins.cal th,d.the opinions of claims adjusters or other agents or employees of the insurer are also inadmissible to interpret an insurance contract.chatton national union fire ins.th,d.

the plain meaning of enrolled as a student in a school 
while no california case has interpreted the phrase enrolled as a student in a school in the context of a group health policy provision for dependents coverage,the issue has arisen in other jurisdictions.a leading case is margie bridals,mutual benefit life dist d,margie bridals,in which the illinois state appellate court reviewed a group health policy that provided dependents coverage to e ach unmarried child of the person insured who has reached his nineteenth birthday but has not reached his birthday who is a student in an accredited school.id.at.the court in margie bridals determined that w hile the term student is not defined by the policy,the term must be given its usual interpretation.such term envisions a person enrollment in an academic institution and attendance at classes on a substantial basis.ordinarily signifies the normal or standard period of time spent in a named activity.id.at.applying this interpretation,the court in margie bridals concluded that because a dependent withdrawal from classes and leave of absence from the university can not be considered in keeping with the activities of a student,the defendant group health insurer had no obligation to provide medical coverage to that dependent.ibid.
numerous decisions agree with the ruling in margie bridals that the ordinary,unambiguous meaning of the phrase student in a group health policy is attendance at classes on a substantial basis.see,miller universal bearings,dependent not a student because fall semester had ended and she had not registered for spring semester imerson district school bd.of pasco county,dependent not a student where dependent admitted but not yet registered to attend classes blue cross blue shield of cassady.dist so d,same klotz anthem life ins.dist so d,student on medical leave is not a student klein empire blue cross blue shield,reasonable meaning of attendance at college is attending classes.a question of fact may arise as to whether the dependent course load is sufficiently substantial to be considered.see,baker united olympic life ins.dist so d,question of fact where de facto attendance exceeded hours of enrollment.also,some courts have found ambiguity on that basis.see,collier practice,is ambiguous as to the course load required massey board of trustees.cir so d,ambiguity as to whether policy incorporated college definition of as hour course load.
the meaning of the terms enrollment or enrolled in the context of dependents coverage in a group health policy also has been addressed by the courts of other jurisdictions.applying webster ninth new collegiate dictionary definition,one court has determined that we read enrollment to mean to register.nerness christian fidelity life ins.cir so d,see also imerson district school bd.of pasco county,supra.at.
michelle was not a qualified dependent at the time of her accident 
we find persuasive those decisions that have determined that the plain meaning of enrolled is to register and that the plain meaning of student is attending classes on a substantial basis.because these decisions rely upon the plain meaning of the words in the insurance policy,they are consistent with the teaching of our supreme court in waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,that a court looks first to the language of the policy in order to ascertain its plain meaning as a layperson would understand it.we therefore find that the plain and unambiguous meaning of the phrase enrolled as a student in a school,in the context of the plan qualified dependents coverage,is that the dependent is registered in a school and attending classes on a substantial basis.since it is undisputed that michelle was not registered at ucsb and was not attending any classes at the time of her accident,as a matter of law michelle did not meet the definition of student enrolled in a school and did not satisfy that requirement for qualified dependents coverage under the plan.
michelle argues,contrary to our conclusion,that the phrase enrolled as a student in a school is ambiguous because it is capable of more than one construction.michelle finds an additional construction in prudential internal documents,which she asserts contain an definition for enrolled as a student in a school of pursuing a program of study as a principal activity.michelle argues that this ambiguity creates a reasonable expectation that a dependent will be covered under the qualified dependents provision of the plan as long as the student,like michelle,is on a de facto approved leave and intends to return to college during the next quarter.
based on the principles of insurance contract interpretation and the persuasive decisions of other courts,we can not agree that the phrase enrolled as a student in a school is ambiguous.as we have discussed,to be enrolled as a student in a school plainly means that the dependent is registered in a school and attending classes on a substantial basis.the phrase is not subject to another construction without engaging in strained or tortured interpretation of the terms of an insurance contract in order to fabricate an ambiguity.lunardi life assurance,supra,th at,d.further,in the present case no question of fact can arise as to whether michelle was a student with respect to her course load,because michelle was not taking any classes at the time of her accident.
michelle contends that her stated intent to return to ucsb after a quarter break is sufficient to satisfy the definition of enrolled as a student in the context of the plan.we disagree.a mere intent to return to school is insufficient to qualify a dependent as a student.collier practice,supra,at dependent children can not be students if they have withdrawn from the institution,are not attending classes,have not taken examinations,and are not enrolled for upcoming classes,even if there is evidence of an intent to blue cross blue shield of cassady,supra,so d at dependent who had paid college application fee with intention of enrolling did not qualify as student colonial life ins.hazelton,intent to enroll again after quitting midsemester is not sufficient evidence that dependent is a student.
the trial court found that triable questions of fact existed as to whether michelle was a student at the time of her accident,based on plaintiff additional fact through and through.fact through state the following.michelle completed her freshman year at ucsb in the spring of.during the summer before the fall of,michelle was planning on attending fall quarter classes.shortly before the fall quarter classes were to begin,michelle decided not to attend classes during the fall of.michelle decided not to attend fall quarter classes determining that she needed to better to sic earn money to better fund her college education and to
