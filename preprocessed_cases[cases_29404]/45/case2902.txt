in this case,we are asked to address the question of the proper meaning and construction to be given to the language of causation utilized in a policy of liability insurance and in a related contract of indemnity.we are asked to determine and apply the meaning of the phrases resulting from,arising from and arising out of in the context of a limitation to the acts or omissions of the indemnitor and the liability exposure of the indemnitee.upon that determination depends the liability of the appellant subcontractor under a contract of indemnity given to a general contractor for an injury sustained by one of the subcontractor employees.in the subcontract,the subcontractor promised to indemnify the general contractor from any liability for damages attributable to bodily injury including for attorney fees that arose from,in whole or in part,any act or omission of the subcontractor.in addition,the subcontractor promised to add the general contractor to its liability policy as an additional insured,but such coverage would only extend to liability arising out of the subcontractor ongoing operations for the general contractor.
sasco electric sasco,the defendant and appellant,seeks reversal of a judgment for,entered jointly and severally against it and its liability insurer,american dynasty surplus lines insurance company american dynasty,as well as the trial court order requiring sasco to pay attorney fees and costs.the plaintiffs and respondents are arb,arb,the general contractor,and paul fire and marine insurance company,arb liability insurer that had provided it with defense and indemnity coverage for a claim that allegedly came within sasco promise of indemnity.
the undisputed facts demonstrate that no act or omission of sasco caused the injury to its employee,but rather such injury resulted entirely from activities of arb that were unrelated to the work called for in the subcontract executed between sasco and arb.the mere presence on the jobsite of a sasco employee is not sufficient to constitute an act or omission on sasco part.in such circumstances,the liability of arb,covered by the additional insured endorsement in the policy issued by american dynasty,did not arise from sasco ongoing operations.as a result,we conclude that sasco promise of contractual indemnity did not embrace the liability claim for which arb and paul sought indemnity,and there was no potential for coverage under the american dynasty policy for the injured employee claim against arb.we therefore reverse both the judgment and the order.
factual and procedural 
given that the parties executed and submitted to the court,prior to trial,a written stipulation as to the relevant facts,we recite those facts as reflected in the stipulation with but minor editorial modification for purposes of simplicity and clarity.
arb is a licensed contractor that entered into a construction contract with the atchison,topeka santa fe railroad company atsf to perform construction work at the santa fe locomotive service rail maintenance yard in the city of commerce maintenance yard.atsf owned the physical premises where the construction work was to be performed.
in december of,arb and sasco entered into a subcontract subcontract under which sasco was to perform certain electrical work at the maintenance yard.that agreement,in article,required sasco to add arb as an additional insured to sasco liability policy with american dynasty effective may,defendant american dynasty provided a policy of general liability insurance to sasco.sasco caused arb to be added to that policy as an additional insured,but,according to the endorsement issued by american dynasty,the policy provided coverage to arb only with respect to liability arising out of sasco ongoing operations performed for arb.italics added.prior to the accident that led to this litigation,sasco provided to arb a certificate of insurance,together with a copy of the additional insured endorsement.arb did not object to the language of the additional insured endorsement 
the subcontract also provided in article to the fullest extent permitted by law,subcontractor sasco agrees to indemnify and hold contractor arb and contractor atsf,their agents,members,directors,officers and employees,harmless from any and all demands,liability,judgments,liens,claims,damages including direct,liquidated,consequential,incidental,economic or other damages,awards,losses including economic losses,penalties,fines,assessments,liabilities,interest,costs and expenses,including attorneys fees hereinafter collectively referred to as claim or claims arising out of or resulting from the performance of the work,either directly or indirectly,provided that any such claim a is attributable to bodily injury,sickness,disease or death to persons specifically including subcontractor employees,or to injury or destruction of property including the loss of use therefrom,and b arises from or is alleged to have arisen in whole or in part by any act or omission of subcontractor or any subcontractor under him,or their servants,agents or employees specifically including the acts or omissions of the injured party ies,even in the event that it is contributed to by the active or passive negligence or misconduct of a party indemnified by this agreement.italics added.
arb was a named insured under its own general liability policy issued by paul.that policy carried a deductible.atsf was an additional insured under the paul policy.atsf merged with burlington northern railroad company and became the burlington northern santa fe railroad company bnsf.the coverage provided by paul to atsf also applied to bnsf.
on august,leo casados casados,an employee of sasco,was working on feeding electrical lines through a conduit pursuant to the subcontract.while casados was working,arb was pressure testing a pipe connected to a fuel tank.neither sasco nor casados was ever involved in pressure testing the pipe,nor did the subcontract call for it.arb work and casados work went on independently of each other,and neither was aware of the other presence at the time the pipe was pressurized.during arb pressure testing,a portion of the pipe exploded causing metallic fragments to strike casados resulting in his injury.prior to the explosion,casados heard a hissing noise,which frightened him and caused him to begin to run from his work site to a point where he was struck by a fragment in his leg.the explosion occurred within seconds from when casados first heard the hissing noise.neither sasco nor casados conduct caused,or in any way contributed to,the bursting of the pipe.
on june,casados filed a lawsuit in the superior court in los angeles county,case number,entitled leo casados arb,et.casados lawsuit.casados named arb,bnsf,and certain other parties as defendants,alleging negligence and strict liability 
arb and bnsf tendered defense of the casados lawsuit to paul,claiming coverage under the paul policy.paul in turn tendered defense of the casados claim to american dynasty,contending that arb and bnsf were covered for the casados claim under the additional insured endorsement issued by american dynasty.
american dynasty denied coverage and refused a defense to arb and bnsf,contending that the additional insured endorsement on the american dynasty policy did not provide coverage to arb or bnsf for the casados claim.american dynasty was aware of all the facts recited above at the time it denied coverage.
paul went ahead and provided a defense to both arb and bnsf in the casados lawsuit.in providing that defense,paul incurred in costs and legal fees before it settled the case for in august of.thus,paul total expense to resolve the casados claim was.because of the deductible provision in the paul policy,arb later reimbursed paul for the sum of.
on july,paul and arb filed this action for breach of contract and declaratory relief,seeking to recover the that had been expended to defend and settle the casados litigation.basing their claim on the provisions of the subcontract and the additional insured endorsement to the american dynasty policy,they alleged that these expenses were properly payable by sasco and american dynasty.
the case was tried to the court,sitting without a jury,on the stipulated facts set out above.the trial commenced and concluded on february,and the court orally announced its decision from the bench,finding in favor of arb and paul and granting them all of the relief they had requested in its statement of decision,issued contemporaneously with its judgment on april,the trial court essentially recited the facts as to which the parties had already stipulated.judgment was awarded in favor of arb and paul in the total sum of,plus prejudgment interest from july.this award was made jointly and severally against sasco and american dynasty.in addition,the trial court ordered that sasco pay to arb and paul their reasonable attorney fees and costs to be determined by a motion under rule of the california rules of court incurred in prosecuting this action.following such motion,sasco was ordered to pay the additional sum of in costs and attorney fees.
sasco has filed this timely appeal from both the judgment and the order american dynasty has satisfied the judgment awarded by the trial court,plus interest and has not filed an appeal.sasco appeal is directed at the entire judgment,including the award of attorney fees.
contention of the parties 
sasco contends that it had no obligation to either defend or indemnify arb or bnsf in the casados lawsuit.sasco argues that the language of article of the subcontract clearly limits its obligation to arb and therefore to bnsf to liability imposed on arb by reason of some act or omission of sasco.since,under the stipulated facts,the injuries to casados did not result or arise from any act or omission of sasco,then,as a matter of law,it was entitled to judgment.whatever the merits of the claimed breach of the subcontract by reason of sasco failure to provide arb with a liability policy which did not contain a retention,arb can not claim any damage,in any event,as there was no potential for coverage of the casados lawsuit under the american dynasty policy.
arb and paul vigorously dispute these arguments and contend that the phrases arising out of and resulting from,as used in the subcontract,have received the broadest possible construction in the decided cases and are uniformly held to be broader than the term caused by.the phrases used in the subcontract and in the policy of insurance issued by american dynasty require only a minimal causal nexus with the event causing injury on which the casados claim was based.arb and paul argue that sasco mere presence at the job site while performing the agreed work is a sufficient nexus.
after a careful analysis of the stipulated facts and the relevant contractual language,we have concluded that arb and paul,as well as the trial court,have misconstrued and misapplied the causation language contained in the subcontract and the american dynasty policy.for the reasons discussed below,we will reverse the judgment and the subsequent order awarding attorney fees.
discussion 
standard of review 
as the facts relevant to the resolution of this matter have been agreed to by the parties,and therefore are undisputed,the issue before us as to the proper meaning and interpretation of contractual and liability policy terms is one of law that we decide de novo.continental heller amtech mechanical services,th,d continental heller.
as a review of the trial court affirmative answers to each of the parties joint list of issues demonstrates,it decided only legal issues,not factual ones.moreover,its legal conclusions as to the meaning to be given to provisions of the subcontract and the american dynasty policy were entirely based on undisputed and agreed facts with no extrinsic evidence received.as a result,we are not bound by the trial court conclusions and are free to make our interpretation and construction of those instruments and decide the issues anew.parsons bristol development cal d,diamond benefits life ins.troll th,d.
indemnity agreements and policies of insurance are construed under the same rules that govern the interpretation of other contracts.myers building industries,interface technology,th,d.accordingly,both the subcontract and the relevant language of the american dynasty policy must be interpreted so as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.such intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the clear and explicit language of the contract.and,unless given some special meaning by the parties,the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.in interpreting an express indemnity agreement,the courts look first to the words of the contract to determine the intended scope of the agreement.murray,mills concrete construction d.in addition,as we explain below,the additional insured endorsement in the american dynasty policy was subject to two or more reasonable interpretations.therefore,the rules applicable to resolving ambiguity in insurance policy provisions will control 
the subcontract did not require sasco to provide a defense to arb 
t he question whether an indemnity agreement covers a given case turns primarily on contractual interpretation,and it is the intent of the parties as expressed in the agreement that should control.when the parties knowingly bargain for the protection at issue,the protection should be afforded.this requires an inquiry into the circumstances of the damage or injury and the language of the contract of necessity,each case will turn on its own facts.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d.
in the subcontract,sasco indemnification obligation is both explicit and clear.sasco promised to hold arb harmless from any and all liability attributable to bodily injury arising out of or resulting from the performance of the work that was the subject of the subcontract,either directly or indirectly,provided that such liability arises from or is alleged to have arisen in whole or in part by any act or omission of subcontractor or any subcontractor under him,or their servants,agents or employees specifically including the acts or omissions of the injured party ies,even in the event that it is contributed to by the active or passive negligence or misconduct of a party indemnified by this agreement.italics added.
although acknowledging the existence of this conditional contractual language,arb,throughout its brief,fails to give it any legal significance.neither,for that matter,did the trial court.arb argues that this language should be read as entitling it to indemnification even if the injury arose solely from its own active negligence so long as the injury has some connection to work performed under the contract.italics added.this argument effectively rewrites the subcontract by placing all of the emphasis on sasco commitment to indemnify arb for all liability arising out of or resulting from the work to be performed.it thus totally ignores the express unambiguous condition quoted above.this appears to us to be disingenuous in light of arb stipulation that the injury to casados did not arise from any act or omission by sasco.
arb contention seems to be that sasco act of showing up on the bnsf premises and performing work under the subcontract,even though such work admittedly had nothing to do with the events that led to the injury to casados,is in and of itself sufficient to trigger the promise of indemnification.in other words,arb argues that the mere presence of sasco employees on the job site,while engaged in performance of the work called for under the subcontract,is a sufficient act or omission by sasco to trigger the indemnity clause of article.this,in our view,goes too far.see,hartford state of california th,d.this argument not only defies common sense and a fair reading of the indemnification commitment,it is not supported by the case authority relied upon.
arb cites fireman fund ins.atlantic richfield th,d fireman fund and acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d syufy as supportive of its argument.those cases each provide a clear illustration of the consistently broad interpretation given by california courts to phrases such as arising out of or arising from and resulting from.both fireman fund and syufy,however,did so in the context of significantly different contractual language.
in fireman fund,an employee of a construction company was injured in the course of work he was doing for an oil company at the oil company plant.the injury arose from the collapse of a step owned and maintained by the oil company.when the employee sued the oil company,it sought a defense under the contractor liability policy to which the oil company had been added as an additional insured.the endorsement provided that the oil company entitlement to coverage under the policy was limited to liability arising out of the contractor work for the oil company italics added.following resolution of the employee claim,the insurer sued the oil company to recover its defense and settlement costs.the trial court granted the oil company motion for summary judgment.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.
in affirming that judgment,the fireman fund court held that the fact that the employee had been injured while performing work called for by the general contractor agreement with the oil company was a sufficient causal connection to trigger coverage under the contractor policy.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.the court rationalized its conclusion as follows.california courts have consistently given a broad interpretation to the terms arising out of or arising from in various kinds of insurance provisions.it is settled that this language does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.rather,it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability,and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.citations.id.at,d,quoting syufy,supra,th at,d.
in syufy,there was a similar fact situation.a contractor was performing work for syufy,a building owner.the contractor employee,who had been working on the building roof,was injured while descending through a hatch that provided the only roof access.the employee sued syufy,which sought and received a defense from the contractor liability insurer pursuant to an additional insured endorsement added to the policy in accordance with the terms of the contractor written agreement with syufy.that endorsement provided that syufy would be covered under the policy,but only with respect to liability arising out of the contractor work for syufy performed by or on behalf of the contractor.italics added.after the insurer settled the employee suit,it sought contribution from syufy because the defective hatch had caused the employee injury.the trial court granted syufy motion for summary judgment and the court of appeal affirmed.syufy,supra,th at,d.
the syufy court reviewed a number of california and authorities and concluded that the broad construction of the phrases arising out of or arising from adopted by those authorities clearly reflects the law in this state and nearly everywhere else.applying this principle,the court stated,under this approach,the employee injury clearly arose out of the work he was performing on the roof of syufy building.the relationship between the defective hatch and the job was more than incidental,in that the employee could not have done the job without passing through the hatch.the fact that the defect was attributable to syufy negligence is irrelevant,since the policy language does not purport to allocate coverage according to fault.syufy,supra,th at,d italics added.
relying on these authorities arb argues that,since casados was injured while performing work called for in the subcontract,a sufficient causal relationship was thereby established triggering both sasco promise of indemnity as well as the additional insured endorsement in american dynasty policy.arb concludes its argument by contending that under these authorities,the indemnity provision covers any claim against arb that is in some way connected with the performance of work by sasco under the subcontract,regardless of the specific theory of liability or causation.it does not matter whether sasco was at fault.the fact that leo casados was injured while he was performing work for sasco under the subcontract is sufficient to trigger the indemnity obligation.in fact,casados injury is more closely linked to the work than was the claim in the syufy case,since casados was actually performing work under the subcontract at the time he was injured,whereas the employee in syufy was leaving the job site after completing his work.italics added.we reject this argument.
there are at least two reasons why neither fireman fund nor syufy are helpful to arb argument.first,there is a significant factual distinction.in both of these cases,the subcontractor employee was injured while performing some act directly related to the work called for by the subcontract.in other words,the employee was engaged in the activity called for under the subcontract or necessarily related thereto and it was the performance of that activity that led to the injury.more was involved than the employee mere incidental presence in a zone of danger that had been created entirely by the actions of the general contractor and had nothing to do with the work called for in the subcontract.in fireman fund,the employee was injured because of the failure of a step utilized by the employee while actually engaged in the work called for by the subcontract.in syufy,the employee sustained his injury while exiting the jobsite through the only exit available to him.
second,arb argument fails to come to terms with the stipulated fact that the language of the subcontract contains an express proviso not contained in the additional insured endorsements in either fireman fund or syufy or,for that matter,any of the other cases cited by arb.sasco expressly undertook no duty to indemnify arb except for a liability that arose from an act or omission by sasco during the performance of the work called for by the subcontract such language can have no other meaning or purpose than to limit the scope of sasco indemnity to injuries occurring in circumstances over which it has at least some control and where it is engaged in activity that is causally related in some manner to the injury for which indemnity is claimed.as we have already emphasized,that precondition clearly did not occur here.
the case of continental heller,supra,th,d,is cited and relied upon by both parties.as we read that decision,however,it supports the conclusion that we reach.in that case,an explosion damaged a building owned by oscar meyer.continental had been hired as the general contractor to work on the building and had subcontracted some of the work to amtech.the explosion was caused by the failure of a valve previously installed by amtech,but it was later determined that amtech which had not manufactured the valve was not negligent or otherwise at fault.it simply had installed the faulty valve without knowing of its defect.continental,after defending and settling the claims of the several oscar meyer employees who had been injured in the explosion,sued its subcontractor,amtech,under the indemnity clause contained in the subcontract.that indemnity clause provided that amtech would indemnify continental for any loss which arises out of or is in any way connected with amtech acts or omissions in the performance of its work under the subcontract.
the continental heller court rejected amtech argument that such language required continental to prove that the loss or liability arose due to some legal fault on the part of amtech.continental heller,supra,th at,d.since the explosion and the resulting liability most certainly arose out of or was connected with an act of amtech,the installation of the faulty valve,amtech duty to indemnify was triggered.id.at,d.it was not necessary,given such contractual language,for continental to prove that amtech was legally at fault for the explosion.in language fully supportive of our own conclusion,the court stated,continental entitlement to indemnity does not depend on a showing amtech was at fault in performing its work on the refrigeration system.rather,amtech duty to indemnify continental applies to any acts or omissions on the part of amtech not just to its willful misconduct or negligent conduct.the language of the agreement leaves no doubt the parties intended amtech should indemnify continental irrespective of whether continental loss arose by reason of amtech negligence or for any other reason except for the sole negligence or willful misconduct of continental.see.continental heller,supra,th at,d italics added.
the reason that continental heller does not help arb is that it clearly underscores two critical points relevant to our decision.first,the language of the indemnification contract will control the outcome.second,where an indemnification promise is limited to acts or omissions of the promisor,there must be some evidence of such an act or omission,and there can be no indemnification obligation if the liability arose solely from the negligence of the promisee or its agents,see also fn,ante.
on the record before us,not only is there no basis for finding sasco at fault for casados injury,but also sasco did not do any act that was in any way connected to such injury.there was no act or omission by sasco the injury to casados resulted from an explosion in a pipe being by arb and its employees or agents.whatever negligence or legal responsibility there was for that explosion,it rests solely with arb.to construe the promise of indemnity made by sasco as applying merely because its employee was present within the zone of danger created solely by the negligence of arb would offend not only the clearly expressed intent of the parties in article of the subcontract,but also the express prohibition set out in civil code section.see fns.and,ante.
therefore,sasco duty to indemnify arb under the subcontract was never triggered with respect to the claim made by casados.
there was no potential for coverage under the american dynasty policy 
while it is true that american dynasty has not appealed from the trial court judgment that concluded there was coverage for arb under the american dynasty policy,the issue of the existence of such coverage is still before us by virtue of sasco appeal.sasco has standing to raise that issue as it is relevant to arb claim that sasco breached the subcontract by not providing primary and liability insurance to arb as promised in article of the subcontract.code civ,county of alameda carleson cal d.
in addition to its promise to indemnify arb,sasco also promised,in article of the subcontract,to obtain and maintain a policy of liability insurance that was primary and with arb liability policy,and which provided coverage to arb as an additional insured for all claims which may arise out of or result from sasco operations under the subcontract,whether such operations be by sasco or by any lower tier subcontractor or by anyone directly or indirectly employed by any of them,or by anyone for whose acts any of them may be liable 
in accordance with this provision,sasco caused arb to be added as an additional insured by an endorsement to the american dynasty policy.as already noted,however,that coverage was limited to liability to arb arising out of sasco ongoing operations performed for arb.the question that we must now address is whether this language actually provided any basis for coverage to arb for the claim made by sasco employee,casados.the answer to that question depends on the policy language and whether it is clear and unambiguous or subject to some ambiguity that must be resolved under settled principles.
an insurance policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.the uncertainty may relate to the extent or existence of coverage,the peril insured against,the amount of liability or the party or parties protected.see continental cas.phoenix constr.cal d,and cases cited there.such provision must be construed in the context of the policy as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.the proper question is whether the particular phrase is ambiguous in the context of this policy and the circumstance of this case.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins,supra,cal th,d,italics in original.this question must be answered through the eyes of a reasonable person in the position of the insured.montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d.words used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning which a layman would ordinarily attach to them.courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.
there seems little question that,applying these principles,the language of the additional insured endorsement in the american dynasty policy is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation as to the scope of coverage actually provided to arb.see,syufy,supra,th at,d where the court accepted,arguendo,the ambiguity of such policy language.without any doubt,a reasonable layperson could interpret the language arising out of sasco ongoing operations as embracing either any liability arising while sasco was on the bnsf premises doing work under the subcontract or liability restricted to that arising,at least in part,from sasco actual performance of such work.
in order to resolve any ambiguity in the meaning of the additional insured endorsement,it would appear to be necessary to read its provisions together with,and in the context of,the subcontract.the endorsement provides arb coverage under sasco policy with american dynasty because arb is the person or organization which the written contract here,the subcontract requires to be covered but only with respect to liability arising out of sasco ongoing operations performed for arb.those ongoing operations are defined in the subcontract itself,that is,the work to be performed for arb under the subcontract.thus,the language of the endorsement refers expressly to the subcontract.contrary to arb argument,it is irrelevant whether or not american dynasty knew that arb was the party covered under its endorsement.it was obviously aware that its named insured,sasco was adding to its policy a party to whom it had undertaken to provide such coverage under a written subcontract calling for performance of certain work on behalf of such other party.clearly,the additional insured endorsement was issued in express contemplation of the obligations undertaken by sasco under the subcontract.
in addition to describing the work required to be performed,the subcontract,under the provisions of article,required sasco to obtain insurance to protect arb from claims set forth below which may arise out of or result from subcontractor operations under this agreement arb argues that because article does not include the additional limiting language of the acts or omissions of sasco found in article,the insurance requirement is intended to be broader than the indemnity provision.however,we do not believe this argument has any merit.these two provisions are not exclusive of one another.article requires sasco to indemnify arb and sets forth the extent of that protection or coverage for all claims arising out of or resulting from the performance of the work.article provides the means of doing so,that is,by purchasing insurance for that purpose.thus,article necessarily encompasses the more specific and narrower language of article.as a result,to properly construe the meaning of the additional insured endorsement,it is necessary to read it together with the relevant provisions of the subcontract.this conclusion,in our view,is fully supported by now settled principles of policy construction.
in aiu ins.superior court cal d,the supreme court set forth the basic rules which must guide the interpretation of any policy of insurance.those rules are based upon statutes dealing with the interpretation of contracts generally id.at,and are substantially identical to the rules already discussed that are applicable to all contracts.the supreme court amplified on these principles two years later in its decision in bank of the west,supra,cal th,d.there,the court noted that w hile insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer.in summary,a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in so doing,the court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.this is because language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.id.at,d,italics in original,citations omitted.
the bank of the west court made it clear that in order to conclude that an ambiguity exists which will be construed against an insurer,it is necessary first to determine whether the coverage under the policy,which would result from such a construction,is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in order to do this,the disputed policy language must be examined in context with regard to its intended function in the policy.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d,see also cooper companies transcontinental ins.th,d.this requires a consideration of the policy as a whole,the circumstances of the case in which the claim arises and common sense.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.
as we have concluded that an ambiguity is present,we must proceed to the second step of the analytical process outlined in bank of the west.this requires us to consider not only the policy language,but also the circumstances of the case and apply a little common sense to determine which of the two reasonable interpretations of the additional insured endorsement meets the objectively reasonable expectations of arb,the party claiming coverage under the endorsement.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.
the circumstances that clearly are significant are the stipulated facts as to how casados sustained his injury the explosion that caused the injury had nothing to do with sasco performance of the subcontract but rather resulted entirely from activities in which arb was separately and independently presence nearby was entirely incidental to arb pressure testing activity and the terms of the subcontract relating to sasco indemnification promise and obligation to provide arb with liability insurance a article expressly limited sasco promise of indemnity to liability arising from its acts or omissions and,as we have explained see fn,ante necessarily excluded indemnification for claims arising solely from the acts or negligent misconduct of arb,and b article required liability coverage for arb that covered claims arising only from claims that arose out of sasco operations under the subcontract.
when we examine these circumstances together,it is difficult to conclude that the endorsement promise of coverage for arb,made in accordance with the provisions of the subcontract,was for anything other than such liability as might arise,at least in part,from the actual activities of sasco in its performance of the work called for in the subcontract.this conclusion is also compelled by simple common sense.the restriction to ongoing operations,contained in both article of the subcontract and in the additional insured endorsement,when read in light of the limitations and qualifications on sasco own indemnity promise,compels the conclusion that the language of the additional insured endorsement could not reasonably be read as broader than sasco promise to indemnify.
reading article and article together,along with the language of the additional insured endorsement which,by its own terms,depended upon the existence of a written subcontract between sasco and arb,whether or not american dynasty ever actually read such subcontract,arb objectively reasonable expectation of coverage under the american dynasty policy could only be for claims against arb that arose from some act or omission on the part of sasco,even if some activity on the part of arb contributed to the employee injury.put another way,the act must somehow be related or connected to sasco performance of the work under the subcontract beyond its mere presence on the job site.it is not reasonable for arb to expect that sasco would indemnify arb for any and all injuries that might result from any cause just because the injury occurred incidentally while sasco was performing its duties under the contract.
we can not conceive of how arb could have had,objectively or reasonably,a contrary expectation.the liability coverage to be provided by sasco could not reasonably be expected to be more expansive than sasco individual promise of indemnity.such a common sense reading of the endorsement language is also consistent with the general comment made in a recent decision the well established meaning of additional insured provisions is that t hey are intended to protect parties who are not named insureds from exposure to vicarious liability for acts of the named insured.citation.maryland casualty nationwide ins.th,d italics added.
we therefore conclude that the additional insured endorsement in the american dynasty policy must be interpreted as providing coverage to arb only for liability arising,at least in part,from sasco activities in its performance of the subcontract,in other words,an act or omission by sasco.as the stipulated and undisputed facts demonstrate that no act or omission of sasco in the performance of the subcontract played any part in any claim of liability arising from casados injury,there never was any potential for coverage under the american dynasty policy.
that american dynasty,for its own reasons,decided not to contest the trial court contrary conclusion is of no consequence.our determination as to the absence of coverage under the american dynasty policy nonetheless has significance with respect to arb claim,also adopted by the trial court,that sasco had breached the subcontract by providing less than the promised insurance.we now turn to that issue.
as arb had no viable claim to coverage under the american dynasty policy,it sustained no damage by reason of sasco alleged breach of the subcontract 
we assume,arguendo,that the inclusion of a retention sir provision in the american dynasty policy constituted a breach of sasco promise in the subcontract to provide a liability policy given our conclusion that there was no coverage under the american dynasty policy for the casados claim,however,we do not see how arb can establish any damages for such breach.
an essential element of a claim for breach of contract are damages resulting from the breach.vu california commerce club,th,d.causation of damages in contract cases requires that the damages be proximately caused by the defendant breach.ibid.
under contract principles,the party is entitled to recover only those damages,including lost future profits,which are proximately caused by the specific breach.see,metzenbaum associates d.brandon tibbs george kevorkian accountancy d.lost profits must be the natural and direct consequence of the breach witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,it is essential to establish a causal connection between the breach and the damages sought.or,to put it another way,the breaching party is only liable to place the party in the same position as if the specific breach had not occurred.or,to phrase it still a third way,the breaching party is only responsible to give the party the benefi
