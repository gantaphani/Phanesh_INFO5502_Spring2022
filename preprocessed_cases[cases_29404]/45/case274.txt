this case requires us to revisit the world of advertising injury insurance coverage.charter oak fire insurance company charter appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge,holding it liable to cgs industries,cgs for its expenses in defending and settling a trademark infringement suit.cgs,charter oak fire ins,d.we conclude that the relevant insurance policy did not cover the liability alleged in the trademark action,and that charter is therefore not liable for the settlement amount.we also conclude,however,that at the time cgs asked charter to defend the trademark lawsuit,there was sufficient legal uncertainty about the coverage issue to oblige charter to defend the action.we therefore affirm the district court ruling insofar as it holds charter liable for defense costs,but reverse insofar as it holds charter liable for the settlement.we accordingly vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on december,five four clothing,five four sued wal mart stores,walmart for trademark infringement based on cgs use of five four distinctive rear pocket stitching design the ff stitching on jeans that cgs supplied to walmart,which walmart then sold cgs was later added as a named defendant.cgs asked charter to defend it pursuant to its liability insurance policy the policy.charter refused,claiming that the underlying action was not covered by the policy.eventually,cgs settled the underlying action by agreeing to pay to five four on behalf of both cgs and walmart 
the policy,effective from august,to august,provides,in relevant part,that charter 
will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of advertising injury to which this insurance applies.charter will have the right and the duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages,even if the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent.however,charter will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages to which this insurance does not apply.
joint app x.the policy covers a dvertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods,products or services.id.it defines advertising injury as injury arising out of one or more specifically listed offenses,including i nfringement of copyright,title or slogan.id.at.the policy excludes coverage for advertising injury caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict advertising injury or arising out of oral,written or electronic publication of material,if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.id.at.it also excludes advertising injury for which the insured has assumed liability in a contract or agreement.id.at.that exclusion,however,does not apply to advertising injury liability that the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement.id.
ii.procedural history 
on july,cgs sued charter for breach of its duty to defend.the parties for summary judgment on november,the district court granted cgs motion for partial summary judgment and denied charter,finding that charter had breached its duty to defend cgs in the underlying action.cgs,charter oak fire ins,d.after further discovery,charter moved for partial summary judgment,seeking a declaration that cgs was not entitled to indemnification for walmart defense costs or for the portion of the settlement that resolved walmart liability.on april,the district court granted the motion in part and denied it in part,holding that charter was not obliged to reimburse cgs for walmart defense costs,but was obliged to indemnify cgs for damages.cgs,d at.
on june,rather than go to trial to determine the amount of damages,the parties stipulated that damages were,calculated as the settlement plus cgs defense costs in the underlying action.in the stipulation,charter reserved its rights to appeal all issues except the reasonableness of the defense costs and settlement amount.the district court entered judgment for cgs in the amount of on june.
charter now appeals the judgment and seeks review of the district court rulings on the various motions for summary judgment,arguing that it did not have a duty to defend cgs under the policy because cgs copying of the ff stitching did not constitute an infringement of slogan or title within the meaning of the policy the underlying action did not allege that cgs committed a covered offense in the course of advertising and the policy knowledge of falsity and knowing violation exclusions precluded coverage for the underlying action.in the alternative,charter argues that it is not liable for the underlying settlement amount as damages for its purported breach of its duty to defend,as it did not have a duty to indemnify.last,charter argues that the policy exclusion of liability assumed in contract barred coverage for the portion of the underlying settlement that cgs paid to settle walmart liability.
discussion 
the parties do not dispute the material facts underlying the claim,but instead contest only the district court interpretation of the policy.because interpretation of an insurance agreement is a question of law,we review the district court construction of the policy de novo.vam check cashing fed.ins,cir.
the parties agree that new york law governs this action.as we explained in hugo boss fashions,federal insurance,new york law distinguishes between the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend,applying very different presumptions to each,cir.in deciding whether an insurance policy requires an insurer to indemnify an insured loss,we must first examine whether there is a reasonable basis for a difference of opinion as to the meaning of the policy.fed.ins.int l bus.machs,internal quotation marks omitted.if there is,the language at issue would be deemed to be ambiguous and thus interpreted in favor of the insured.id.this is because new york follows the maxim of contra proferentem in insurance cases where the plain language of a policy permits more than one reasonable reading,a court must adopt the reading upholding coverage.vam check cashing,at.
the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify and an even stronger presumption in favor of coverage applies.hugo boss,at see also hanover ins.cowan,dep t.even where the insurer ultimately has no duty to indemnify due to policy exclusions,it may still be obligated to defend the insured until the applicability of the exclusions is determined.hugo boss,at.to avoid the duty to defend,an insurer must demonstrate that the allegations of an underlying complaint place that pleading solely and entirely within the exclusions of the policy and that the allegations are subject to no other interpretation,quoting hanover ins,at.
in keeping with these principles,we now turn to charter various arguments.
infringement of title or slogan 
charter argues that it had no duty to defend,still less to indemnify,cgs because the ff stitching is neither a title nor a slogan used in advertising,and that therefore the underlying action did not allege a covered i nfringement of title or slogan.
infringement of slogan 
we first consider whether the ff stitching could be considered a slogan.our decision in hugo boss provides the framework for analysis,and indeed gives authoritative guidance as to the meaning of the term.
w e begin with the terms of the policy itself to see if the intent of the parties can be gleaned without resort to extrinsic evidence.hugo boss,at.here,as in hugo boss,the policy fails to define slogan or to provide criteria for distinguishing slogans from.thus,the language of the policy itself is of no aid to us in deciding whether the ff stitching qualifies as a slogan within the meaning of the contract of insurance.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
next,we ask whether a body of law or an established custom fills in the gaps left by the drafters.we concluded in hugo boss that new york state law did not provide significant insight into the meaning of slogan,or any clear way to distinguish between slogans and.that is still the case the parties cite,and we have found,no new york case law subsequent to hugo boss that provides further guidance on this issue.nor is there an established industry usage that gives meaning to the term slogan.id.at.
as we did in hugo boss,however,we may still find a policy term unambiguous where we can determine that it has a clear meaning in federal law.c ontracting parties operate against the backdrop not only of state law,but of federal law as well.id.emphasis in original.thus,where contracting parties use terms and concepts that are firmly rooted in federal law,and where there are no explicit signals to the contrary,we can presume that the prevailing federal definition controls.id.in assessing whether there is such a prevailing federal definition,we consider not whether there is complete unanimity among the courts that have addressed the question,but rather whether there is an overwhelming current of judicial opinion,that is,a meaning used by the vast majority of federal courts.id.at n.in,hugo boss found that the vast majority of federal courts had defined slogans as phrases used to promote or advertise a house mark or product mark,in contradistinction to the house or product mark itself.id.at emphases altered this was still true in,when cgs purchased the policy.see citizens ins.of am.uncommon,llc,d,adopting hugo boss definition of slogan,and holding that slogan had acquired an unambiguous meaning by.we therefore conclude that the hugo boss definition of slogan remains controlling today.
to hold that the stitching design on a jeans pocket is a slogan would stretch that definition beyond recognition,as the design is clearly not a phrase.in hugo boss we rejected the notion that the trademarked name of a brand,product,or company constituted a trademarked slogan,and found it clear that a slogan must be something other than the house mark or product mark itself.at emphases omitted.it follows that the ff stitching,which is also not a phrase and which in effect is a house mark or product mark,is not a slogan either.in light of this federal authority confirming this definition and given the presumption that,unless they expressly indicate otherwise,contracting parties will be deemed to have incorporated into their agreements usages of key terms that are in the case law or industry,we find no ambiguity sufficient to give rise to contra proferentem in this contract.id.at.
although we found the mark at issue in hugo boss so unambiguously not a slogan to defeat the duty to indemnify,in that case we also concluded that,because under new york law,the insurer duty to furnish a defense is broader than its obligation to indemnify,id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,sufficient uncertainty still remained about whether the meaning of the term trademarked slogan was clear enough to avoid contra proferentem,id.at,to impose on the insurer a duty to defend the action here,however,there is no such residual ambiguity.hugo boss effectively settled the meaning of slogan in advertising injury policies in this circuit,and as we have noted above,the parties have not cited any developments in case law or commercial understanding that would call that definition into question.the ff stitching is clearly and unambiguously not a slogan as that term is understood in law and used in insurance policies.accordingly,insofar as the complaint in the underlying action rests on a claim of infringement of slogan,charter had no duty to indemnify or defend.
infringement of title 
we next consider whether the ff stitching could be considered a title.although hugo boss did not involve the definition of that term,its analysis remains instructive,and we follow its framework,laid out above,in addressing this issue.title is not defined in the policy,and neither new york state law nor industry usage provides significant insight into the meaning of title,so we must again look to federal case law.
the vast majority of federal cases are clear that in this context that is,in a list that includes copyright and slogan,but conspicuously does not include coverage of infringement of trademarks title means the name or appellation of a product,and does not cover design elements such as pocket stitching that may serve as a trademark designating the origin of the product.see,houbigant,fed.ins,cir defining trademarked title as any name,appellation,epithet,or word used to identify and distinguish the trademark holder goods from those manufactured or sold by others a touch of class imports,aetna cas.sur,noting that title is a name or appellation such as big mac,chap stick,and cheerios,and does not include trademarks such as the design of a package or location of a patch on a pair of jeans while a title need not contain words we have no difficulty in concluding that the stitching on the back pocket of a pair of jeans can not fairly be called the name or appellation of that pair of jeans 
while the definition of title is clear enough to bar charter duty to indemnify cgs,our inquiry does not end there.if there was any residual uncertainty as to whether a court would find title unambiguous,then charter still had a duty to defend,independent of the duty to indemnify.see hugo boss,at.the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,and insurers may refuse to defend only cases in which the policy is so clear that there is no uncertainty in fact or law.id.at.
as noted above,in hugo boss,we held that even though a prior district court decision advancing a competing interpretation of slogan did not render the term ambiguous in the face of overwhelming consensus among courts,it did render uncertain the question of whether the courts would deem the term to be unambiguous.id.at emphasis omitted.we face a similar situation here while the vast majority of federal cases unambiguously define title to mean a word or phrase,a handful define title in a way that could arguably include a design or symbol similar to the pocket stitching at issue here.for example,one court defined title as names and related trademarks,then noted that trademark is defined as a word,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof used by a person to identify and distinguish his or her goods.priceless clothing travelers cas.ins,civ,wl,at.may,quoting see also zurich ins.amcor sunclipse,cir title refers to names and related trademarks.another court held that infringement of a stylized d logo fell under infringement of title.am.econ.ins.reboans,these cases reason that because a trademark can be a title,and a symbol is a trademark,infringement of the symbol must qualify as infringement of title.
while the reasoning of these cases is faulty,as title and trademark are not coextensive,under the hugo boss framework these cases created enough legal uncertainty around the meaning of title to give rise to an at least temporary duty to defend until the uncertainty surrounding the term was resolved.hugo boss,at.although in our view there is not sufficient ambiguity to invoke the contra proferentem presumption that would trigger a duty to indemnify,there was nonetheless,at the time of the filing of the underlying action,sufficient uncertainty about the scope of coverage to trigger charter duty to defend.its failure to defend therefore breached the policy.to the extent charter believed that the underlying action did not allege an infringement of title and was therefore not covered by the policy,its remedy was to begin to defend cgs and immediately seek a declaratory judgment as to the meaning of title.see hugo boss,at.
ii.advertising injury 
wholly apart from the issue regarding infringement of slogan or title,the policy covers only a dvertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising.joint app x.charter next argues that the underlying action was not covered by the policy because five four did not allege that its injury stemmed from cgs advertising the jeans.
in determining whether an insurer is obliged to defend a lawsuit against the insured,we examine the allegations in the complaint filed in that lawsuit.if,liberally construed,the claim is withi
