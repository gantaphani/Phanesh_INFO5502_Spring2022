capital assurance company petition for rehearing,which the united states has supported as amicus curiae,is granted.we agree with the united states that the opinion published at misinterpreted parts of the federal emergency management agency financial arrangement,pt,app.a,and that we arrived at the wrong result.that opinion is accordingly vacated and the following opinion issued in its stead 
capital assurance company,appeals the award of prejudgment interest in an insurance contract action based on a federally subsidized standard flood insurance policy it issued under part b of the national flood insurance act of,supp.ii nfia.we address,for the first time in this circuit,whether a district court violates sovereign immunity principles by awarding prejudgment interest against a company empowered to issue flood insurance by the federal emergency management agency.we hold that it does.
background 
alex newton owns a vacation house on the gulf of mexico that is constructed on an artificially point extending into the water and protected only by bulkheads.capital assurance company,capital sold newton a federally subsidized standard flood insurance policy sfip covering the property.the federal emergency management agency fema uses wyo companies like capital to aid it in its statutory duty to administer the national flood insurance program nfip.see a permitting fema director to enter into arrangements with private insurance companies in order to make use of their facilities and services a d establishing the wyo program to permit private insurers to sell and administer sfips.in newton house and lot suffered predictable extensive flood damage from hurricane opal,and newton filed a claim.
after capital denied a portion of newton claim,newton sued in an alabama state court.the defendants removed the case,asserting original jurisdiction under and.following a bench trial,the court awarded newton compensatory damages,prejudgment interest,and costs.capital appeals only the award of prejudgment interest 
ii.jurisdiction 
although neither party has challenged the jurisdiction of the federal courts over this suit,we are compelled to address the question sua sponte,see,of am.tobacco,cir,because both the record and answers we received to questions posed at oral argument betray some confusion on the issue.in the district court,newton at first filed a motion to remand for lack of jurisdiction.capital opposed the motion,again asserting jurisdiction under and.for reasons unclear from the record,newton later conceded jurisdiction.we now clarify that the district court had jurisdiction under.there are three statutes that potentially affect jurisdiction in this case the general arising under jurisdiction provision of and two provisions of the nfia,and.we begin by dispensing with capital reliance on that section was misplaced.under,the director of fema may implement the nfip using one of two different institutional structures,each of which specifies a different role for private insurance companies.the first scheme,described in,includes a provision for suing private insurers.the nfip is,however,not currently implemented under that scheme.it is instead implemented under the alternative structure set forth in.see van holt liberty mut.fire ins,cir.it is thus clear from the statute and the current implementation of the program that does not apply to this suit.we next turn to.under that section,federal courts have jurisdiction over suits in which a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d.the federal cause of action or question of federal law must be apparent from the face of the complaint and not from a defense or anticipated defense.see id.at.at.but the federal question need not be statutory federal common law will suffice.see farmers union ins.crow tribe,d.here,the complaint alleged,among other things,breach of an sfip contract.sfip contracts are interpreted using principles of federal common law rather than state contract law.see,carneiro da cunha standard fire ins.aetna flood ins.program,cir as contracts,the standard policies issued under the program are governed by federal law,applying standard insurance law principles.quoting wright director,fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.thus,a complaint alleging breach of an sfip satisfies by raising a substantial federal question on its face.
this leaves us only to question whether,the provision for suits against fema under the nfip as currently implemented,affects our jurisdiction.on its face,provides only for suits against fema.it does not discuss the wyo program,and we therefore do not read it as addressing suits against wyo companies.it does not,therefore,abrogate jurisdiction.see carneiro da cunha,at implicitly recognizing federal jurisdiction over a suit against a wyo company after the implementation of.we need not consider the opposite question whether it provides an additional basis for jurisdiction against wyo companies,see van holt,at finding wyo companies subject to jurisdiction under as well as because a suit against a wyo company is the functional equivalent of a suit against fema,because our conclusion regarding jurisdiction under is sufficient to answer the jurisdictional question we raise.
iii.the rule 
the issue capital presents in this appeal is whether prejudgment interest awards in suits against wyo companies selling federally sponsored sfip contracts violate the rule,the sovereign immunity principle that i n the absence of express congressional consent to the award of interest separate from a general waiver of immunity to suit,the united states is immune from an interest award.library of congress shaw,d.although suits against wyo companies are not suits against the federal government,capital nevertheless contends that prejudgment interest awards against wyo companies always violate the rule because such awards a legal conclusion derived from the nfia and its implementing regulations direct charge s on the public treasury.in re estate of lee,cir.newton,on the other hand,argues that the controlling laws give the government no more than a financial stake in the payment of prejudgment interest by wyo companies,which is,as the district court held,insufficient by itself to invoke the rule in a given case.west harris,cir we review the question de novo,see powers united states,cir,and hold that the rule prohibits awards of prejudgment interest against wyo companies.
we start our analysis by recognizing that those circuits considering the question have,for important reasons,found the rule to bar awards of interest in suits directly against fema.see sandia oil beckton,cir holding,on reasoning equally applicable to awards of prejudgment interest,that postjudgment interest may not be awarded in suits directly against fema lee,at.to begin with,the cases note that nothing in the nfia indicates a congressional waiver of immunity from interest awards.see lee,at see also sandia oil,at citing lee.nor,as one court has further concluded,does the nfip produce a profit for the federal government against which interest awards may sometimes be appropriate because the government role resembles that of a,private entity.the nfip is a subsidy program the holdings of our sister circuits are consistent with the supreme court articulation of the rule.see shaw,at.at.moreover,newton concedes that both lee and sandia oil were correctly decided.we use their conclusions as a starting point and examine the relationship between fema and wyo companies to determine whether the rule bars prejudgment interest awards against wyo companies as well.
capital urges us to accept a dictum from the fifth circuit that any award of prejudgment interest against a flood insurer is a direct charge on the public treasury indistinguishable from identical awards in suits against fema itself and is thus precluded by the rule.lee,at making the statement in the context of a suit directly against fema.gowland aetna,cir referring to lee direct charge language and prohibiting app
