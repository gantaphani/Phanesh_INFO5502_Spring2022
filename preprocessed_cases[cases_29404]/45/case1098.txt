this appeal involves an interpleader action filed by a pension plan seeking a declaration of which of two claimants is decedent,douglas durden surviving spouse.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rita lorraine,finding that rita is douglas durden surviving spouse and is entitled to surviving spouse benefits.on appeal,the other claimant,ann durden,contends that the district court erred in applying michigan substantive law to determine which claimant is the surviving spouse.she argues that ohio law applies and that under ohio law she is entitled to the benefits as the surviving spouse.for the following reasons,we conclude that ohio law should have been applied and that under ohio law ann is the surviving spouse.consequently,we reverse the decision of the district court.
background 
on september,douglas durden married ann linzy in toledo,ohio.according to ann,she and douglas lived together in toledo from to,but because douglas was abusive,she moved to memphis,tennessee,in april.douglas and ann had two children together,douglas durden,born february,and freeman richard durden,born april.
in,rita lorraine marshall started a romantic relationship with douglas.ann says that she and douglas were still living together at the time,and that they continued to live together until april of.douglas and rita had a son who was born in.on november,douglas and rita were married in las vegas,nevada.on the marriage certificate,douglas swore that his previous marriage was legally terminated in in memphis,tennessee.the divorce records from shelby county,tennessee where memphis is located do not contain any indication of such a divorce.moreover,rita testified that when she began dating douglas in she was aware he was still married to ann.however,rita also stated that before they were married in douglas told rita that ann had divorced him.after their wedding in,rita and douglas lived together as purported husband and wife in toledo until douglas death in.they adopted a son,nikita oliver,in.
ann avers that she never divorced douglas,nor was she ever made aware of any divorce proceeding that he initiated.ann filed for divorce on february,but that case was dismissed on november.ann search of the divorce records of the counties in which she or douglas have lived supports her statement.the following searches failed to turn up any evidence of a divorce between ann and douglas a search of the divorce records from lucas county,ohio where toledo is located from to and a search of the divorce records from shelby county,tennessee where memphis is located.
the degree of knowledge that each woman had of the other marriage to douglas is not entirely clear.ann states that she had no knowledge of douglas marriage to rita until after douglas death.rita asserts that ann did know rita and douglas were married because ann children visited their father at rita and douglas home in toledo.the extent of rita knowledge of douglas marriage to ann is similarly unclear.rita states that she believed that douglas marriage to ann had been legally terminated and that she was never informed by ann,douglas,or any other person that ann and douglas were still married.
as an employee of daimlerchrysler,douglas durden participated in the daimlerchrysler pension plan the plan subject to the employee retirement income security act erisa of,et.the plan provides,among other benefits,a widow widower benefit to his surviving spouse calculated pursuant to the terms of the plan.in documents pertaining to the plan,douglas listed rita as his dependant spouse.douglas was also covered by the daimlerchrysler corporation life and disability programs,which covered douglas in the amount of of life insurance and provided transition and bridge benefits to his surviving spouse.douglas did not designate a beneficiary for the life insurance,and when no beneficiary is named,the surviving spouse is first in line of succession to receive the proceeds.the plan provides a choice of law provision which provides that the plan shall be construed,governed and administered in accordance with the laws of the state of michigan except where otherwise required by federal law.
upon douglas death in october of,the claim administrator for the daimlerchrysler corporation life and disability programs,based upon the documents provided by douglas,paid rita of life insurance proceeds.from the time of douglas death until may,rita was also provided healthcare benefits as douglas surviving spouse.the widow widower benefit has not been paid by the plan following douglas death.because these benefits are being claimed by both rita and ann,health care benefits and transition and bridge benefits to rita were suspended.
on june,daimlerchrysler filed an interpleader complaint seeking a declaration as to which of the two claimants is douglas surviving spouse and,therefore,entitled to receive the health care benefits,transition and bridge benefits,life insurance proceeds,and the widow widower benefit.both rita and ann moved for summary judgment,each seeking a declaration that she is douglas durden lawful spouse and therefore entitled to benefits.the district court held that the choice of law provision in the plan controlled and applied michigan law.based on its application of michigan law,the district court found that rita was the surviving spouse and granted summary judgment in her favor.ann timely appealed.

preemption 
when ann and rita argued their for summary judgment at the district court level,the dispute centered on the question of which state law should be applied to determine which woman was douglas surviving spouse.on appeal rita introduced a new issue into this case by arguing that erisa preempts all state law.rita points out that the plan documents named her as douglas dependent spouse and argues that such a designation in an erisa plan preempts any state law which would lead to a contrary conclusion.
a review of rita motion for summary judgment and the transcript of the hearing on that motion reveals that the preemption argument was never raised in the district court.in general,this court will not review issues raised for the first time on appeal.barner pilkington,cir lepard nbd bank,cir.our function is to review the case presented to the district court,rather than a better case fashioned after a district court unfavorable order.barner,at.the court will consider an issue not raised below only when the proper resolution is beyond doubt or a plain miscarriage of justice might otherwise result.lepard,at united states firearms,cir.this exception does not apply in this case 
choice of law 
the primary basis of ann appeal is her argument that the district court erred when it applied michigan law to determine which claimant was douglas surviving spouse.according to ann,ohio law should have been applied instead.in determining which state law applies in an erisa case,this court analysis is governed by the choice of law principles derived from federal common law.med.mutual of ohio desoto,cir.in the absence of any established body of federal choice of law rules,we begin with the restatement second of conflicts of law id.
ann argues that reference to the restatement is unnecessary because there is a body of federal common law dictating that the law of the state of the decedent domicile is applied to determine which of two conflicting marriages was valid.metropolitan life ins.manning,cir brinson brinson,cir grove metropolitan life ins,cir spearman spearman,cir.rita claims that these cases are inapposite because they are not erisa cases.this argument is unpersuasive.the cases are part of the body of federal common law although not binding on this court because they are from other circuits.there is not a different set of federal common law choice of law rules for every distinct underlying federal issue.nevertheless,the cases ann cites are unhelpful for a different reason.none of them addresses the issue faced here of whether a choice of law provision is enforceable in this type of case.consequently,we turn to the restatement for direction.
the restatement second of conflict of laws,section provides the framework for determining whether a choice of law provision in a contract is given effect 
law of the state chosen by the parties 
the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue.
the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied,even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue,unless either 
a the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice,or 
b application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which,under the rule of,would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.
in the absence of a contrary indication of intention,the reference is to the local law of the state of the chosen law.
rest d conflict of laws.ann argues that this section does not apply because there is no issue about the rights and duties under a contract,but only an issue of which claimant is douglas surviving spouse.the fact that all parties agree that the benefits in question go to the surviving spouse does not mean that there is no issue regarding rights or duties under the plan.on the contrary,the crux of this litigation is whether the plan administrators are obligated under the plan to pay benefits to ann or rita and whether ann or rita has the right under the plan to receive survivor benefits.the law applied to determine which claimant is the surviving spouse is applied for the specific purpose of determining rights and duties under the plan.since the plan contains a statement of the parties choice of law to govern the contractual rights and duties created by the plan,we must look to section to determine whether that choice is effective.
the first step of analysis under section is to determine whether the contractual parties could have resolved the particular issue being litigated by an explicit provision in the contract.if they could have,then the choice of law provision is enforceable.rest d conflict of laws.under such circumstances,there are no exceptions.in this case,we must evaluate whether the plan could have contained an express provision addressing the determination of which of two claimants is a surviving spouse and,therefore,entitled to survivor benefits.erisa provides that the terms of a plan alone can not prevent survivor benefits from being paid to the surviving spouse.a,c boggs boggs,d.while plan documents may designate someone other than the surviving spouse to receive such benefits if the spouse has signed a written,notarized consent form,the parties to the plan alone do not have the power to grant survivor benefits to anyone who is not the surviving spouse under applicable law.therefore,the parties to the plan could not have resolved the issue of which claimant is entitled to douglas survivor benefits by explicit provision in the contract.
a choice of law provision is usually still given effect even to determine issues which the parties could not have explicitly resolved in their contract.the only difference is that there are two exceptions where such a choice of law provision will not be given effect.the first is where the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice.rest d conflict of laws a.this exception clearly does not apply in this case.among other things,the plan is administered in michigan and daimlerchrysler has headquarters in michigan.there was a reasonable basis to choose to apply michigan law 
the second exception set forth in section requires a more complex analysis.under section b,a choice of law provision will not be enforced where it would be would be contrary to a fundamental policy of the state whose law would otherwise be applied and the state whose law would otherwise be applied has a materially greater interest in the particular issue under consideration than the state named in the choice of law provision.the first step is to identify the state whose law would apply in the absence of the choice of law provision.the second step is to identify whether the application of michigan law would be contrary to any fundamental policy of the otherwise applicable state law.this determination requires examining how each of the two states would resolve the dispute and the underlying policy reasons for each approach.the third step is to evaluate whether the state whose law would otherwise be applied has a materially greater interest in the determination than michigan.
if the plan did not contain a choice of law provision,this court would look to section of the restatement which governs the law applicable to determining the validity of a marriage.rita argues that section would be the appropriate section because it governs the choice of law applicable to resolve issues regarding contractual rights and duties.she points out that in the past,this circuit has applied section to determine an issue arising from an erisa group health insurance plan.med.mut.of ohio desoto,cir.however,the desoto case did not involve an issue of the validity of a marriage or any other status issue.the restatement second of conflict of laws contains chapters describing the appropriate choice of law analysis for major classes of claims including contract claims,tort claims,and property claims.usually,as in the desoto case,reference to the analysis for the particular type of claim is all that is required.however,the resolution of some legal issues is dependent upon the underlying status of the individuals involved.three familial relationships which create such legally significant status are separately addressed in the restatement marriage,legitimacy,and adoption.there is a distinct choice of law analysis for determining each type of status.where a legal issue turns on a person status,the choice of law issue is evaluated under the specific section related to that status regardless of the nature of the underlying legal issue.rest d conflict of laws cmt.a the rule of this section validity of marriage is concerned with what law governs the validity of a marriage as such,namely what law determines,without regard to any incident involving the marriage,whether a man and a woman are husband and wife.consequently,although the underlying legal issue is this case is a contractual issue about rights and duties under the plan,we must look to section to analyze which state law governs the determination of which claimant was legally married to douglas at the time of his death.
section provides,in pertinent part,that t he validity of a marriage will be determined by the local law of the state which,wit
