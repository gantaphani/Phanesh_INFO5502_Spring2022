dastar corporation,entertainment distributing,and marathon music video collectively dastar appeal the district court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of american states insurance company and american economy insurance company collectively american on the sole issue of whether american owed dastar a duty to defend in a separate action.because the parties have engaged in manipulation to manufacture appellate jurisdiction after the district court grant of partial summary judgment,we dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
background 
dastar was sued by twentieth century fox film corp,sfm entertainment and new line home video,collectively claimants for copyright infringement,violation of the lanham act,and for violations of california business and professions code section.on may,dastar tendered the claim to american as advertising injuries covered by insurance policies issued by american.on june,american denied dastar tender because it concluded that the claimants first amended complaint did not allege advertising injuries covered by the policies.
on march,american filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of oregon,seeking a declaration on the duties to defend and to indemnify.dastar answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging breach of the duties to defend and to indemnify.on may,dastar moved for partial summary judgment solely on the duty to defend.on june,american filed a on the same issue.neither summary judgment motion addressed the duty to indemnify.on july,the district court granted partial summary judgment in american favor.
after the district court order,the parties lodged a stipulation permitting dastar to file an amended counterclaim,which the district court approved.on march,dastar filed its amended answer and counterclaim,eliminating its on the duty to indemnify.on march,the parties lodged a stipulation to dismiss without prejudice american declaratory relief claim on the duty to indemnify.on march,the district court approved the stipulation dismissing american indemnity claim,and issued a declaratory judgment.on april,dastar filed its notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
parties may only appeal final decisions of the district courts.final decisions end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.dannenberg software toolworks,cir quoting coopers lybrand livesay,d.the final judgment rule promotes judicial efficiency,avoids multiplicity of litigation and minimizes delay by forbid ding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for practical purposes is a single controversy.dannenberg,at quoting cobbledick united states.
an order granting partial summary judgment is usually not an appealable final order under because it does not dispose of all of the claims.cheng comm r,cir.however,under a pragmatic approach,we consider events subsequent to orders to determine whether they create sufficient finality.dannenberg,at j udgments whose finality would normally depend upon a rule b certificate may be treated as final and appealable under if remaining claims subsequently have been finalized.as we recently explained,
when a party that has suffered an adverse partial judgment subsequently dismisses remaining claims without prejudice with the approval of the district court,and the record reveals no evidence of intent to manipulate our appellate jurisdiction,the judgment entered after the district court grants the motion to dismiss is final and appealable under.
james price stern sloan,cir.
a significant concern in assessing finality is whether the parties have attempted to manipulate our appellate jurisdiction.see james,at we have always regarded evidence of such manipulation as the necessary condition for disallowing an appeal where a party dismissed its claims without prejudice.see also dannenberg,at.a party may not engage in manipulation either to create appellate jurisdiction or prevent it.compare cheng comm r,cir rejecting parties attempt to create appellate jurisdiction by manipulation with local motion niescher,cir rejecting prevailing party attempt to avoid appellate jurisdiction by dismissing remaining claims without prejudice to create appearance of.
manipulation of jurisdiction has arisen in several different contexts.in huey teledyne,cir,and ash cvetkov,cir,the parties attempted to create appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory orders by provoking the district court to dismiss their actions for failure to prosecute.see at,at.the parties acts were objectionable because they resulted in piecemeal litigation,rewarded dilatory practices,and undermined the district court ability to dispose of cases in an orderly and expeditious manner.id.
agreements to dismiss claims without prejudice also suggest manipulation.in cheng,the parties stipulated that the plaintiff,who lost a partial summary judgment motion,would dismiss his remaining claims.the stipulation permitted the plaintiff to present additional evidence and arguments to the district court on the dismissed issues if the decision were reversed on appeal.cheng,at.we held that the stipulation demonstrated manipulation because the plaintiff ability to resurrect the claims if he prevailed on appeal meant that the district court had not truly disposed of all the claims deciding the appeal in stages could result in unnecessary decisions that might become moot upon further litigation in the district court and a party with several separate claims could conceivably appeal as many times as he has claims if he is willing to stipulate to the dismissal of the claims the court has not yet considered.id.at.
manipulation is also apparent when the parties agree to waive the statute of limitations for dismissed claims.see dannenberg software toolworks,cir.an agreement to waive the statute of limitations and remove potential barriers from refiling the claims is manipulative because litigants should not be able to avoid the final judgment rule without fully relinquishing the ability to further litigate unresolved claims.id.at.
in this case,both parties have attempted to create appellate jurisdiction through manipulation.first,the record shows that the parties discussed their attempts to create appellate jurisdiction.a joint status report stated that they agreed to allow judgment to be entered based on the summary judgment rulings by the court so the duty to defend issue could be appealed.additionally,correspondence between the parties indicates that they attempted to structure their stipulations to create jurisdiction 
second,the fact that the parties dismissed the remaining claims in two steps also reveals intent to manipulate jurisdiction.some cases before james used language that could be read to suggest that a losing party,but not a winning one,is prohibited from dismissing remaining claims without prejudice to create finality.see,local motion,at a losing party may not manufacture finality by dismissing his or her remaining claims without prejudice.emphasis in original united ins.r d latex,cir here,aetna,a prevailing party,dismissed its remaining claim in an effort to facilitate an appeal by mydrin.this is not manipulation of the appellate process.but we do not read case law before james to create such a distinction.those cases focused on whether there was manipulation to manufacture jurisdiction,not whether the prevailing or the losing party dismissed the remaining claims.indeed,in local motion,we specifically declined to permit a winning party to thwart jurisdiction by dismissing the remaining claims without prejudice.see at.
the language in cases prior to james reveals the parties attempt to manipulate jurisdiction in light of what they apparently thought was the law before james.seizing upon the distinction between dismissal by a prevailing versus a losing party,dastar and american attempted to avoid the appearance that the losing party dismissed the remaining claim without prejudice by dismissing the indemnity claim and counterclaim in two steps first,the parties stipulated to allow dastar to file an amended counterclaim,which eliminated all references to the breach of the duty to indemnify and effectively dismissed that claim without prejudice.second,the parties stipulated to permit american,the prevailing party,to dismiss its claims on the duty to indemnify without prejudice.therefore,through this process,the parties were able to create the appearance that dastar,the losing party,had not dismissed any remaining claims,but that only american,the prevailing party,had done so.
while the stipulations in this case are not as patently manipulative as those in cheng and dannenberg because dastar and american did not explicitly agree to revive the claims or waive the statute of limitations,the absence of these terms does not preclude the conclusion that the parties attempted to manipulate jurisdiction.in cheng and dannenberg,the stipulations to dismiss without prejudice were manipulative because they permitted the of claims if the district courts were reversed on appeal.see cheng,at dannenberg,at.thus,i n essence,the claims remained in the district court pending a decision by this court.dannenberg,at see also james,at noting that the stipulations in cheng and dannenberg kept the dismissed claims on ice while appeal was taken from a partial judgment,circumventing the final judgment rule and arrogating to the parties the role of the district court.however,when the parties do not toll the limitations period,a plaintiff assumes the risk that by the time the case returns to district court,the claim will be barred by the statute of limitations or laches.james,at.such weighs against a finding of manipulation.
here there was little need to stipulate to waive the statute of limitations because the limitations period is unlikely to expire during this appeal.under oregon law,the statute of limitations for breach of contract is six years.see also vega farmers ins,or.a breach of contract in the insurance context does not accrue until the denial of a claim.see vega,or.at,at.as dastar tendered the claim in,oregon law minimized the need for the parties to waive the statute of limitations,as it could not run before.as a result,the lack of a stipulation including a waiver of the statute of limitations in this case does not negate the other indicia of manipulation because dastar is not taking any real risk that the indemnity claim would be barred prior to the resolution of this appeal.
finally,the parties statements during oral argument support our view that they engaged in manipulation.both parties conceded that they manipulated jurisdiction,even though each party claimed it only acted at the urging of the other party thus,we find the parties have attempted to manufacture appellate jurisdiction.
the presence of manipulation is one important factor distinguishing the present case from james price stern sloan,cir.in james,the plaintiff sought and obtained permission to dismiss her remaining claims after the district court granted a motion to dismiss.there was sufficient finality because there did not appear to be any evidence of manipulation in the record,the reason for dismissal appeared legitimate and the parties did not stipulate to waive the statute of limitations based on the outcome of the appeal id.at.as previously explained,in the present case there is clear evidence of the parties attempt to manipulate appellate jurisdiction,and the parties did not need a specific stipulation to revive their indemnity claims.
moreover,the district court involvement in the plaintiff rule motion also distinguishes james from the present case.we explained in james that the district court participation in the dismissal indicated that it considered the appropriateness of the dismissal without prejudice.id.at.because the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss,the district court had to specifically decide the merits and legitimacy of plaintiff assertions.therefore,in that situation it may be more likely that the district court would consider the implications of rule b,especially as it possessed the authority to deny the relief if it did not intend the order to be immediately appealable.
unlike james,the district court in this action did not meaningfully participate in the dismissal of all of the remaining claims after granting partial summary judgment.under rule a,except in circumstances not applicable here,a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party as dastar obtained american consent to amend the counterclaim and eliminate indemnification issues,dastar could amend its counterclaim without the district court considered participation.similarly,the parties did not need the district court consent to stipulate to dismiss american claim concerning the duty to indemnify.see.a although the district court approved the stipulations to amend and dismiss,such approval can not be said to involve meaningful consideration or participation by the district court inasmuch as the parties were entitled to do so without leave of the court see infra,at id.
additionally,james should not be read to imply that any entry of an order by a district court after a partial summary judgment is always tantamount to a rule b certification.rather,james represents an exception to the general rule that i n the absence of a rule determination and direction from the court of an entry of a final judgment,any order or other form of decision,however designated,which adjudicates fewer than all the claims shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims.b.any other interpretation of james would undermine rule b and add uncertainty to the final judgment rule.interpreting a judgment as a rule b determination without the required findings would effectively read out those requirements from rule b.in turn,this practice would create the same concerns raised in fletcher gagosian,cir,that permitting jurisdiction without a clear indication of finality would confuse the parties and the public,possibly leading to premature or untimely appeals,as the case may be.
while the district court here issued the declaratory judgment knowing that the parties stipulated to amend the counterclaim and to dismiss american remaining claims,thereby eliminating the remaining indemnity claims,the district court entry of declaratory judgment did not imply its intent to final appealable judgment.james,at stating that the district court must have issued the rule a dismissal after being persuaded of the legitimacy of plaintiff reasons because it granted the dismissal of the remaining claims subject to the conditions offered by the defendant.once the parties eliminated the indemnity claims,without the participation of the district court and the need for the district court rule b judgment,the district judge had no ability or justification to refuse to issue a judgment on the duty to defend.
in fact,the active involvement of the district court,such as through the parties request for a rule b judgment,would have empowered the district court to manage the development of this action,thereby facilitating efficiency,avoiding this premature appeal,and eliminating many of the concerns raised by the dissent.the dissent is concerned that because the duty to defend is completely independent of the duty to indemnify,the duty to defend should be resolved without awaiting the resolution of indemnification issue because prompt resolution of the duty to defend is important to an insured rights,and an appeal on the indemnification issue may never arise.this is precisely a decision that should be made by the district court and is contemplated by rule b.see adonican city of,cir the parties wanted a ruling on some,but not all,of the appellant claims before proceeding with the rest of the case.federal rule of civil procedure b states that the trial court must determine whether a judgment that disposes of less than all claims and all parties should be considered final.the parties here have attempted to usurp the trial court role.franklin fox,nn.cir finding appellate jurisdiction even though the district court did not grant summary judgment on all of defendant claims because the court entered judgment pursuant to rule b.
moreover,while the dissent does raise certain practical concerns,those concerns do not create finality in this case.see,discussion infra,at.other procedural mechanisms,such as rule b,already exist to ensure that an appeal of a judgment may be obtained in appropriate circumstances.in the present case,if the parties had sought a rule b judgment and the district court had concluded that a prompt resolution of the duty to defend issue was essential and efficient,it could have issued a judgment pursuant to rule b.thus,a rule b determination eliminates improper appeals of judgments while permitting prompt appeals when necessary.by circumventing the district court involvement,even for practical considerations,parties do not make judgments final.they merely eliminate the district court role and unnecessarily increase our own tasks.
in urging us to find appellate jurisdiction,american relies upon horn berdon,cir,in support of the position that the dismissal of the indemnity claim creates sufficient finality for appellate jurisdiction.horn is inapposite under our facts but exemplifies a pragmatic evaluation of finality.in horn,the plaintiffs brought suit alleging violations of erisa.the defendant counterclaimed for indemnification.the court granted summary judgment in the defendant favor,which disposed of plaintiffs claims,but not the counterclaim.although the defendant dismissed the counterclaim for indemnification with the understanding that it could revive it if unsuccessful,the indemnification claim was entirely dependant upon the plaintiffs claim.id.once the district court granted summary judgment in defendant favor,there were no claims for the district court to hear id.at see also dannenberg,at distinguishing horn because the claims in that case were solely for indemnification and entirely dependent upon plaintiff success in the underlying action regula delta disability survivorship plan,cir 
in contrast,under oregon insurance law the duty to indemnity is not completely dependant upon the duty to defend.see ledford gutoski,or.the duty to indemnify is independent of the duty to defend.liability for indemnity,unlike liability under the duty to defend,derives from factual determinations separate from the allegations in the complaint.as a result,american could still have a duty to indemnify even if it did not have a duty to defend.
american argues that the indemnity claim can not be determined until the underlying litigation is completed,asserting that in a practical sense there are no claims for the district court to adjudicate at this time.in support of this argument,american relies upon north pacific insurance company wilson distributing service,claiming that it prevents the adjudication of the indemnification claims until the underlying lawsuit has been finalized.the court in north pacific held that a trial court should stay a determination of the duty to indemnify prior to the resolution of the underlying case when an insurer attempts to place the insured in the conflictive position of being required to abandon its denial of liability in order to obtain coverage.at,at explaining that the insurer actions would force the insured to argue that it caused the pollution in order to come within the exception to the policy exclusion,which conflicted with its denial of liability in the underlying action.
however,north pacific does not preclude the adjudication of the indemnity claims under the circumstances in this case.the issue of whether the publishing exclusion precludes indemnity does not relate to the controverted issues in the underlying litigation.therefore,american is not putting dastar in the untenable position of having to prove its liability in the declaratory relief action,while taking the opposite position in the underlying case.although the district court held that the publishing exclusion did not apply to relieve american from a duty to defend based on the facts alleged in the underlying complaint,that conclusion is not necessarily determinative of the indemnity claim.upon discovery of facts different from those alleged in the underlying complaint,the exclusion may apply.the district court,if it so chose,could decide that issue without awaiting the resolution of the underlying case therefore,under oregon law,american was not precluded from litigating the indemnity issue prior to the resolution of the underlying action.
additionally,despite the fact that the parties might have been able to bring the claims for the duty to defend separate from their indemnity claims,the parties chose to bring the claims together.consequently,the indemnity claims were part of the action,we can not rely upon the fiction that they might have been brought separately,and we can not ignore their impact on appellate jurisdiction.
therefore,even though the duty to defend and the duty to indemnity are independent of one another,because american can litigate the indemnity issue without awaiting the resolution of the underlying action,hearing this appeal at this time would undermine the final judgment rule.see dannenberg,at.in this case,there is a greater risk of litigation than in previous cases.unlike cheng,dannenberg and horn,where the dismissed claims would only be revived if the district court was reversed,the indemnity claim in this action will survive regardless of the outcome of this appeal.it is likely that the parties will appeal any subsequent decision on the duty to indemnify claim.any appeal concerning indemnity will involve the same insurance policies and will likely require similar contract interpretation,even though the facts may be different.hearing the appeal on the duty to defend at this time will defeat judicial efficiency by requiring a future panel to reacquire familiarity with this case in order to resolve the duty to indemnify claim.
overall,the parties appear to have colluded to manufacture appellate jurisdiction by dismissing their indemnity claims after the district court grant of partial summary judgment.moreover,the parties appear ready to pursue those claims gardless of the outcome of this appeal,undermining the policies upholding the final judgment rule.as noted in cheng and dannenberg,and adonican city of los angeles,cir,the parties can cure this jurisdictional defect on appeal by dismissing with prejudice the claims on which the district court had not ruled,or obtaining a rule b judgment from the district court.alternatively,the parties can petition the district court to the judgment and amend their pleadings to include their indemnity claims.see cheng,at dannenberg,at adonican,at.after the district court has ruled on those claims,there will be an appealable final judgment.
therefore,this appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
i respectfully dissent.in holding that the parties engaged in manipulation of our jurisdiction,the majority fails to recognize the difference in litigating the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.it also fashions a new rule of law which requires that before a voluntary dismissal of independent claims can be approved,district courts must certify the appealability of remaining claims pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in the process,the majority implies that trial judges who approve the dismissal of a claim without prejudice in order to permit the litigants to proceed on an independent claim actually facilitate manipulation.this is simply not true.when lawyers and trial judges agree to dismiss independent,unripe claims,they are faithful to the administration of justice,preserving the resources of the courts as well as clients.by focusing on manipulation as opposed to the intent underlying the final judgment rule,the majority misses the forest for the trees.as a result,they compel an outcome that is neither efficient nor just.
as the majority correctly observes,the purpose of the final judgment rule is to prevent the debilitating effect on judicial administration caused by piecemeal appellate disposition of what is,in practical consequence,but a single controversy.eisen carlisle,d.what the majority ignores is that the inquiry into whether a decision is final requires evaluation of the competing considerations underlying all questions of
