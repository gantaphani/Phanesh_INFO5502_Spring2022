introduction 
leroy and terrie brown appeal the trial court judgment in favor of defendant and respondent mid century insurance company on the browns claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the trial court concluded that the browns claim for water damage caused by a broken pipe in their house was not covered under their mid century policy and that mid century was entitled to summary judgment.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a.the water 
on or about february,the browns began observing condensation on the windows of their,home and on the drywall around the windows.there was moisture from the windowsills running down the walls and mildew on some of the windows and walls.when they cleaned the condensation off the windows,it returned the next day.about a week later,the browns began noticing mold forming around the inside of their windows and on the walls in the living room and kitchen,developing everywhere simultaneously.every room that had a window had mold or mildew.
on march or march,leroy brown brother,robert brown,crawled under the house and observed moisture.robert brown testified at his deposition that he shined a flashlight into the crawl space and observed damp soil.leroy brown testified that he was not able to see the source of the water,nor did he hear anything like water spraying.after his brother came out of the crawl space,leroy brown shut off the water to the house,told his wife about the problem,and then either he or his wife called the insurance agent.
on march,the browns hired a plumber,michael lewis,to find and fix the leak.leroy brown took lewis to the laundry room,where there was moisture on the walls.lewis testified in his deposition that when brown took him to a hallway and the laundry area,he could see condensation and moisture on the walls.lewis told brown that from experience,it seemed like he had a hot water leak.and because his home was on slab,it probably was underneath the cement.lewis did a couple of tests and determined that it was hot water.lewis testified that he told brown that the leak was on the hot water side.and in that situation,i told him that when you have a slab house,that sometimes you ca you ca find the leak because water has a way of traveling.the leak could have been anywhere in the bottom floor of the house,and because it already had made a path,the water was just trickling,you know,wherever it was coming out at.and i told him,pretty much because we had the most damage in the laundry room,that nine times out of ten,it was going to be in the laundry room.
lewis also went into the crawl space under the house where he encountered mud and discovered a pool of water that appeared pretty deep.while lewis was in the crawl space,brown turned on the water very low so lewis could determine where the water was coming from.lewis observed that water was coming into the crawl space from the backside of a vertical pressurized copper hot water line attached to the hot water manifold.
lewis then went into the laundry room and began drilling with a jackhammer and searching for the hot and cold water manifolds,with the water system still off.when he located the hot water manifold,he got the pipe exposed and saw the leak.with the water turned on very low,brown went back into the house and observed water coming from an open hole in the pipe,which was just a drip out at that point,just enough to show me where the water was coming out the back side of the pipe.the water was coming out at a slow pace,because leroy brown did not turn it on full blast.
the browns notified mid century of the problem.
b.the policy 
mid century had issued the browns a farmers next generation homeowners policy providing them with first party property damage coverage for structural damage in the amount of,with a deductible.the policy insured some,but not all,of the browns property and stated c overage is dependent upon both the cause of the loss or damage and type of loss or damage.the policy listed certain types of loss or damage that were not covered under the policy,however caused,including loss or damage consisting of,composed of or which is water damage.the policy included an extension of coverage that provided limited water damage coverage for direct physical loss or damage to covered property from direct contact with water,but only if the water results from a sudden and accidental discharge,eruption,overflow or release of water i from within any portion of a a plumbing system.the policy described what was not included in the limited water damage coverage a sudden and accidental discharge,eruption,overflow or release of water does not include a constant or repeating gradual,intermittent or slow release of water,or the infiltration or presence of water over a period of time.we do not cover any water,or the presence of water,over a period of time from any constant or repeating gradual,intermittent or slow discharge,seepage,leakage,trickle,collecting infiltration,or overflow of water from any source whether known or unknown to any insured.
for mold,the policy stated we do not insure loss or damage consisting of,composed of,or which is fungi.further,we do not insure any remediation.the policy also contained the following exclusion we do not insure loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by,arising out of or resulting from fungi or the discharge,dispersal,migration,release or escape of any fungi.further,we do not insure any remediation the policy defined fungi as any part or form of fungus,fungi or mold 
c.the investigation 
on march,mid century claim representative seann clifford inspected the browns home and took photographs of the laundry room and the adjacent crawlspace.clifford observed pervasive,visible mold and moisture on the interior walls of each level of the browns home.clifford stated in his declaration that brown took him to the laundry room and showed him the horizontal section of the piping which had been leaking.the section,which was part of a pressurized hot water line attached to the hot water manifold,was heavily corroded near a degree angle bend.the horizontal section of the pipe below the bend had been embedded in the room concrete slab foundation.clifford inspected the pipe and observed and photographed a hole in the pipe approximately inch in diameter in the section of pipe that had been embedded in the room concrete foundation,and saw that the hole was facing down.
mid century then assigned the browns claim to another claims representative,rosie acevedo,who inspected the home the next day,march.acevedo observed mold on the walls in the laundry room,the office,the second floor living room,the kitchen,and the third floor bathrooms,and on clothing in a room next to one of the bathrooms.the browns told acevedo,in recorded statements,that they began noticing evidence of a water leak,condensation on the windows,and mold,approximately one month earlier.the browns also told acevedo that the condensation stopped forming on the windows when they turned off the hot water on march.
on march,mid century retained american leak detection to inspect the house and determine whether there were any more leaks in the plumbing system.american leak determined that the interior plumbing system was sound and that there were no other leaks.
on march,mid century denied the browns claim.acevedo wrote the browns and stated that mid century investigation revealed that the pipe in the wall of the laundry room that runs into your crawl space has been leaking water into your crawl space over a period of time causing condensation and mold growth through out sic your home.unfortunately,this loss is uninsured or excluded from coverage under your policy.acevedo determined that the cause of loss was wear and tear which caused a hole in the pipe,allowing water to leak into the crawl space over a period of time.acevedo then quoted at length various provisions in the policy,including the extension of limited water coverage for sudden and accidental discharge,eruption,overflow or release of water from a plumbing system or household appliance.
d.the action 
the browns filed this action on march,alleging causes of action for breach of written contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,negligence,fraud,unfair competition,and declaratory relief.the browns allege that their home was damaged when a plumbing pipe burst causing plaintiffs substantial loss.on may,the browns dismissed their causes of action for negligence,fraud,unfair competition,and declaratory relief,leaving only their causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant.mid century answered on june.
e.the motion for summary judgment 
on august,mid century filed a motion for summary judgment or in the alternative for summary adjudication on the browns claims for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and for punitive damages.mid century argued that it did not breach the policy or act in bad faith because the water damage in the browns home was caused by a,gradual,incremental discharge or release of water,and not by a sudden and accidental discharge or release of water.mid century also argued that its interpretation of the policy was reasonable and that it did not engage in any conduct that could justify a claim for punitive damages.
in support of its motion mid century submitted the declarations of clifford and acevedo,as well as an expert declaration by claude leblanc.leblanc is a licensed plumbing contractor with years of experience investigating,diagnosing,repairing,and replacing more than broken pressurized hot water lines in residential plumbing systems,with expertise in leak detection,duration,and causation and plumbing repair and design.leblanc stated that on june,he inspected the inch section of pipe that had been removed from the browns house and found a jagged hole which measured approximately inch in diameter surrounded by corrosion.leblanc also reviewed color photographs taken by clifford depicting the failed section of pipe before the section was cut out and preserved,which showed that the failed section was encased in the concrete slab floor of the home laundry room which was adjacent to a crawl space that had a dirt floor under the home second floor.
leblanc noted from the photographs that the portion of the pipe embedded in concrete was not wrapped with a plastic protective sleeve,in violation of the california plumbing code,california code of regulations,title,part,sections and according to leblanc,these regulations require copper pipes embedded in concrete to be wrapped with a plastic sleeve which serves to protect the pipe from coming into direct contact with the corrosive metallic elements present in concrete,because otherwise t hese corrosive elements will gradually cause corrosion damage to the exterior wall of a copper pipe.leblanc gave his opinion that the hole in the section of copper pipe he inspected had formed as a result of ordinary wear and tear to the pipe which corroded because it had been defectively embedded into concrete without the required protective sleeve based on the heavy corrosion evident on the exterior of the pipe during my inspection and the photographs i reviewed depicting the pipe before it was removed,it was obvious the section which failed had not been sleeved at the time it was installed.leblanc stated that the pipe direct contact with these corrosive metallic elements caused a slow,gradual and incremental deterioration of the pipe outer wall near the pipe bend,which in turn caused a opening in the pipe to form through which hot water slowly dripped out.leblanc added that the deterioration process then accelerated because hot water has higher levels of corrosive minerals than cold water because it is heated in a metal heater,hot water escapes under to of water pressure,and the water pressure striking the concrete creates friction.
leblanc opined that the hot water which first escaped from the pipe was in the form of drips into the concrete which surrounded the pipe.as the size of the hole slowly increased,this dripping gradually turned into leakage.eventually,the escaping water migrated to the adjacent dirt floor of the nearby crawlspace and slowly pooled there.this unabated continuous dripping and leaking lasted at least five months until the leak was discovered and the water turned off on march.leblanc also reviewed water bill and service records for the home,compared them to the previous year,and concluded that the browns monthly water consumption increased during the period water was escaping from the pipe and then decreased to normal levels after the repair.
the browns opposed the motion and submitted an expert declaration by harvey kreitenberg,a licensed journeyman plumber whose primary occupation is a forensic consultant plumber.kreitenberg also examined and photographed the pipe section and found two holes,one approximately inch by inch and one approximately inch.kreitenberg agreed that the pipe failed due to a yet to be identified form of corrosion.kreitenberg concluded that what had occurred can be best described as a sudden breach of the pipe.this type of corrosion failure mechanism usually produces a sudden breach in the wall of the pipe,creating a non water tight condition.as the corrosion process continues,the size of the breach increases,ultimately producing a mist,stream and spray of water through the breach.it would have taken a mere fraction of a second a nano second sic between the water tight and non water tight condition of the pipe in the brown residence,which is the breach in the pipe.kreitenberg concluded that the pipe failed suddenly,and ultimately a spray or stream not drips of hot water shot through the holes in the pipe out into the area of the house where the pipe was located,and that h ot water would have continued to spray and stream not drip out the holes until the water line was shut off.
f.the ruling 
the trial court granted mid century motion for summary judgment,finding that none of the evidence submitted by the browns creates a dispute of fact as to the cause of the leak as set forth by mid century expert.the court found that kreitenberg opinion that the pipe breach only took a faction of a second does not mean that release of water was sudden.the court also noted that the browns do not dispute that the pipe leaked over a period of one to two months,and that the leak was caused by corrosion which wore away at the pipe,and that the evidence presented by kreitenberg shows that the release of water was a gradual release of water over a period of time,and not a sudden discharge,eruption,overflow or release of water.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of mid century on november.mid century gave notice of the entry of judgment on november,and the browns filed a timely notice of appeal on january.

breach of contract 
the browns concede that they had the burden of proving their water damage is covered under their policy with mid century,and to present facts showing a sudden release of water,causing damage to their home.see aydin first state ins.cal th.the browns do not argue that mid century failed to meet its initial burden on summary judgment to show that the damage was not caused by a sudden discharge of water.they do not dispute that the evidence mid century presented regarding the gradual deterioration of the pipe,the small size of the hole,and the existence of the effects of the water for at least a month or two,satisfied mid century initial burden on summary judgment.the browns contend that in response to mid century showing they presented admissible evidence supporting the finding of a triable issue on this fact.we disagree.
there was not a sudden and accidental discharge,eruption,overflow or release of water 
the browns primary argument on appeal is that kreitenberg created a triable issue of fact by stating in his declaration in opposition to mid century motion for summary judgment that the pipe burst suddenly in a,spraying water in the crawlspace.this testimony,however,does not change the fact that the release of water,even if it commenced with a nanosecond breach in the wall of the pipe and resulted in a mist,stream and spray,was constant or intermittent,and occurred over a period of a month or two according to the browns or five months according to mid century.even if,as kreitenberg testified,the pipe failed suddenly,the water damage according to kreitenberg resulted from hot water continu ing to spray and stream not drip out the holes until the water line was shut off.the browns policy with mid century did not cover such a constant or repeating intermittent or slow release of water,whether the release was a drip,spray,or stream as the trial court recognized,everybody agrees,even kreitenberg,that this was something that occurred over a period of time.thus,whether the water leaked or sprayed or streamed out of the hole s in the pipe,the water leaked,sprayed,or streamed out constantly and gradually over time.such a water discharge does not qualify as sudden under the plain meaning of the terms of the browns policy.
nor does it qualify as sudden under california law.sudden has a temporal element and does not mean a gradual or continuous discharge.standun,fireman fund ins.th,see travelers casualty surety superior court th,the interpretation of sudden must include a temporal component otherwise,the word is rendered mere surplusage shell oil winterthur swiss ins.th,w e can not reasonably call sudden a process that occurs slowly and incrementally over a relatively long time,no matter how unexpected or unintended the process.in the context of the phrase sudden and accidental,the word sudden must,if it is to be anything more than a hiccup in front of the word accidental,convey a temporal meaning of immediacy,quickness,or abruptness.acl technologies,northbrook property casualty ins.th.thus,whatever sudden means,it does not mean gradual.the ordinary person would never think that something which happened gradually also happened suddenly.id.at.
the nature of the gradual water discharge from the browns pipe even if initiated by a nanosecond breach in the wall of the pipe and of the incremental effects of the water on the browns house precludes any finding that the discharge was sudden.see freedman state farm ins.th,g iven the small size of the hole s through which the water leaked,and given the extensive amount of water damage,the leak must have lasted a sufficiently long time,or stopped and started sufficiently many times,to count as continuous or repeated under any reasonable construction of those terms truck ins.exchange pozzuoli th,a ny continuous event,whether it be of years or months duration,is simply not sudden.a dishwater hose breaking in,a water heater giving out and flooding a room,or an overflowing toilet,is a sudden discharge of water.see,de bruyn superior court th overflowing toilets sudden and accidental but see cardio diagnostic imaging,farmers ins.exchange th,malfunctioning toilet that failed to shut off water intake and overflowed because of blockage in the sewer line was not covered because of exclusion for loss or damages caused by water that backs up or overflows from a sewer.a of water over several months is not.
kreitenberg opinion that the nanosecond breach in the pipe converted the pipe from a condition to a condition in an instant did not create a factual issue regarding whether the release of the water was sudden.those courts that have considered the theory espoused by kreitenberg have rejected it.for example,in saint paul surplus lines ins.geo pipe,the court stated according to the insured,the fact that the leak was not discovered for a lengthy period of time does not negate the temporal suddenness with which the breach occurred.this argument has been described as the metaphysical moment theory.under the logic of this theory,every event or condition not existing from the dawn of time would be considered sudden because at one moment it did not exist and the next moment it did.id.at.the court held that while the time of discovery does not control whether the discharge was sudden,a discharge that continues over a lengthy period of time can not be considered sudden as a matter of law.ibid.
similarly,in american ins.fairchild industries,affd.cir,the court rejected the insured argument that the pipe failure was sudden despite the fact that the process leading to the crack was a gradual one.it is apparently the insured position that there was some metaphysical moment before which the leak was not present.and thus,when the leak finally manifested itself,it was an abrupt event.id.at,fn.the court noted that u nder this type of reasoning,no event whatsoever could conceivably not be sudden.see federated mutual ins.botkin grain cir,rejecting the insured argument that the temporal quality ascribed to the word sudden should be applied to the inception rather than the duration of the pollution snydergeneral century indem,the metaphysical moment principle,which suggests that every leak occurs suddenly because there will always be an instant in time when a once nonexistent leak suddenly develops,would read the temporal component of the term sudden out of the policy,affd.in part and vacated in part on other grounds,cir.and in mesa operating california union ins,the court rejected the insured argument that salt water contamination from an underground well occurred suddenly because at one point in time the well was whole and,an instant later,salt water breached the well and began escaping into the aquifer.id.at.
a gradual process,viewed through an electron microscope that can show physical changes occurring in nanoseconds,can appear sudden at certain points in time.given a small enough time interval,even a slow gradual leak is sudden.there is always a time,before the first water molecule breaches the surface of a corroding pipe,and a time,after the first water breaches the surface,such that the breach can appear sudden if is small enough.such a calculus,however,does not make a gradual release of water sudden.as the trial court stated,i t was not a sudden burst unless you used sudden to just explain at one point in time there was no water,then there was water.in concluding that kreitenberg declaration did not create a triable issue of material fact,the trial court properly concluded that the fact that the pipe breach only took a fraction of a second does not mean the release of water was sudden.
the efficient proximate cause doctrine does not apply to the browns mold claim 
the browns recognize that the policy did not include coverage for mold.the policy listed mold as one of uninsured types of loss or damage we do not insure loss or damage consisting of,composed of or which is fungi.the policy also listed mold as one of excluded causes of loss or damage we do not insure loss or damage directly or indirectly caused by,arising out of or resulting fr
