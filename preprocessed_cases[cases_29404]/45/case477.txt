this appeal concerns a challenge to the patient protection and affordable care act referred to as the health care act or the act.the plaintiffs object primarily to the act minimum essential coverage provision,more commonly referred to as the individual mandate.the mandate,when it becomes effective in,will require all applicable individuals either to maintain a certain minimum level of health insurance or pay a monetary penalty.the plaintiffs complaint asserts,generally,that the entire health care act is unconstitutional because the individual mandate exceeds congress authority to pass laws.
the district court dismissed the complaint without reaching the merits of this challenge.rather,the district court held that the plaintiffs failed to plead adequately injury in fact and,therefore,did not meet their burden to demonstrate standing.the plaintiffs now appeal that determination.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
the plaintiffs are mario criscito,a licensed new jersey physician,patient roe,a patient of criscito,and new jersey physicians,a corporation that has as a primary purpose the protection and advancement of patient access to affordable,quality healthcare.appendix app.criscito is the only member of new jersey physicians,identified by the plaintiffs in their pleadings.the defendants are four governmental officials sued in their official capacities president barack obama timothy geithner,the united states secretary of the treasury eric holder,the united states attorney general and kathleen sebelius,the secretary of health and human services.
the complaint contains minimal allegations pertaining to the plaintiffs provision or receipt of health care.the complaint alleges that criscito treats patients in the course of his individual practice of medicine,and that s ome of those patients pay him for his care and do not rely on a payor to do so on their behalf.app.the complaint also alleges that roe is a patient of criscito who pays himself for his care and that he is a citizen of the state of new jersey who chooses who and how to pay for the medical care he receives from criscito and others.app.regarding new jersey physicians,the complaint asserts only that the organization members and their patients will be directly affected by the legislation at issue,the health care act should the legislation become effective.app.
only two sections of the health care are relevant to this appeal.
the first is the previously mentioned individual mandate.when it takes effect in,the mandate will require all applicable individual s to either obtain a level of health insurance that qualifies as minimum essential coverage or pay a penalty.a,b,c.the act defines an applicable individual to be any united states citizen,national,or lawfully present alien unless that individual has a valid religious exemption or is presently incarcerated.d.not all applicable individuals are subject to the individual mandate,however.the act exempts certain applicable individual s,including those whose household income is insufficient to require them to file a federal income tax return,those whose premium payments exceed eight percent of their household income,and those who establish that the individual mandate imposes a hardship.e.all applicable individuals must comply with the individual mandate requirement and acquire minimum essential coverage.this minimum essential health insurance coverage may be obtained in various ways,such as by enrolling in insurance plans,individual market plans,or certain programs such as medicare or medicaid.f.
the second relevant provision is the employer responsibility provision.this provision only applies to applicable large employer s,which are defined as employers that employ fifty or more employees on average over a calendar year.c a.the employer responsibility provision penalizes such employers if they fail to offer their employees the opportunity to enroll in an insurance plan that satisfies the individual mandate minimum essential coverage requirement.a like the individual mandate,the employer responsibility provision will take effect in.d.
the plaintiffs initiated this action by filing a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey on march.on march,the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint referred to primarily as the complaint throughout.the defendants challenged the plaintiffs invocation of the district court jurisdiction pursuant to,and in an opinion dated december,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.specifically,the district court held that all three of the plaintiffs failed to allege the requisite injury in fact and thus did not meet their burden to demonstrate standing.the district court opinion did not address the defendants alternative jurisdictional arguments or the merits of the plaintiffs constitutional challenge.this timely appeal followed.
article iii of the united states constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to the resolution of c ases and c ontroversies.const.art.iii.this language restricts the federal judicial power to the traditional role of the anglo american courts and thereby prevents courts from taking possession of almost every subject proper for legislative discussion and decision.christian sch.tuition org.winn,d citations and quotation marks omitted.no principle is more fundamental to the judiciary proper role in our system of government than the constitutional limitation of jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.simon.welfare rights,d.

the three irreducible constitutional elements of standing are an injury in fact a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court and a showing that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.lujan defenders of wildlife,d alterations,citations,and quotation marks omitted.the only constitutional element at issue on this appeal is the first one injury in fact.
to establish injury in fact,a plaintiff must allege an injury that is both concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.id.quotations omitted.each of these definitional strands imposes unique constitutional requirements.an injury is concrete if it is real,city of lyons,d,or distinct and palpable,as opposed to merely abstract,whitmore arkansas,d quotation marks and citations omitted,while an injury is sufficiently particularized if it affect s the plaintiff in a personal and individual way,lujan,at.the second requirement actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical makes plain that if a harm is not presently or actual ly occurring,the alleged future injury must be sufficiently imminent.imminence is somewhat elastic,lujan,at,but requires,at the very least,that the plaintiffs demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury,babbitt united farm workers union,d emphasis added see also lujan,at requiring that an imminent injury be certainly impending quotation marks omitted.in other words,there must be a realistic chance or a genuine probability that a future injury will occur in order for that injury to be sufficiently imminent
