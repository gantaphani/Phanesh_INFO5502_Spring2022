the question in this insurance coverage dispute is whether a nurse employed by a staffing agency and assigned to work at a hospital qualifies as an employee of the hospital under the hospital insurance policy.the district court answered that question in the negative and granted summary judgment to the hospital insurer.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court order and remand for further proceedings.
favorite healthcare staffing the agency is an employment agency that provides nurses and other health care professionals to laurel regional hospital the hospital.the contract between the agency and the hospital the staffing agreement states that the practitioners assigned to the hospital are the employees of the agency,not the hospital.
under the staffing agreement,the hospital is responsible for orient ing agency practitioners to their job description responsibilities and all policies and procedures necessary to meet hospital performance standards.the hospital has the right under the agreement to float agency practitioners to areas to which they were not originally assigned and to immediately terminate any practitioner who refuses to float.the agreement also gives the hospital the right to dismiss any practitioner at any time if the hospital determines that a practitioner is unsatisfactory.
as established through discovery,no agency staff supervises the practitioners on site at the hospital or provides instructions to the practitioners.the hospital dictates the type of care to be provided to patients by agency practitioners whether agency practitioners or employees are involved,the hospital expects the same level of care to be provided to patients.if an agency practitioner refuses to comply with hospital directions,the hospital may immediately terminate the practitioner.
appellant interstate fire and casualty company issued a professional liability insurance policy to the agency that covered doctors and nurses who were employed by the agency and placed by the agency to work at various medical facilities.appellee dimensions assurance,an insurance company wholly owned by the company that owns the hospital,issued the hospital the liability insurance policy the policy at issue in this case.
the policy provides coverage to the hospital and to other persons or entities who meet its definitions of protected person.the policy consists of three main parts,one providing coverage for general liability,another providing coverage for hospital professional liability,and another providing coverage for group physicians professional liability.
the section of the policy includes multiple categories of persons and entities in its definition of protected person,including certain administrators and committee and board members.in a provision titled worker protection,this section of the policy provides that 
the hospital present and former employees,students and authorized volunteer workers are protected persons while working or when they did work for you within the scope of their duties.unless added by amendment to this agreement,interns,externs,residents,or dental,osteopathic or medical doctors are not named protected persons for professional injury,even if they are your employees,students or authorized volunteer workers.
emphasis added.
under the portion of the policy,the worker protection clause extends protected person status to certain hospital workers 
the hospital present and former employees,students and authorized volunteer workers are protected persons while working,or when they did work for you within the scope of their duties.persons working for you on a per diem,agency or contract basis are not protected persons.
emphasis added.the policy does not define employee,nor does it incorporate or otherwise refer to the staffing agreement between the agency and the hospital.
in,a former patient brought a medical malpractice action the underlying action against the hospital and several of its doctors and nurses.one of the defendants was nurse cryer,who had been placed by the agency at the hospital.claiming that she was not an employee of the hospital,dimensions refused to defend cryer.interstate thereafter undertook to defend cryer,ultimately settling the case against her for million and incurring nearly in defense costs.
interstate subsequently filed this equitable contribution action against dimensions in federal district court.interstate alleged that,under the terms of the policy,nurse cryer qualified as an employee of the hospital and thus a protected person entitled to coverage under the policy.because the coverage provided by the dimensions policy was primary and the coverage provided by the interstate policy was excess in cases where there was other valid insurance coverage,interstate alleged that dimensions was responsible for the entire amount it paid to defend and settle the claims against nurse cryer.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of dimensions.relying on the terms of the staffing agreement between the hospital and the agency,the district court held that workers were not employees within the meaning of the policy.interstate appeals,arguing that nurse cryer qualifies as an employee under the plain terms of the policy and that the district court erred by looking to a separate contract between different parties to determine the meaning of the policy.
this insurance dispute,which falls within our diversity jurisdiction,is governed by the law of maryland,where the action was filed and the insurance policy delivered.see klaxon stentor,explaining that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law principles of the forum state joint venture ace am.ins,cir.in insurance contract disputes,maryland follows the principle of lex loci contractus,which applies the law of the jurisdiction where the contract was made.for choice of law purposes,a contract is made where the last act is performed which makes the agreement a binding contract.typically,this is where the policy is delivered and the premiums paid.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.

there is no dispute that,if the other requirements of the policy are satisfied,the claims asserted against nurse cryer in the underlying action fall within the scope of the section of the policy.the question,then,is whether cryer qualifies as a protected person under that section of the policy.
interstate argues on appeal that nurse cryer qualifies as a hospital employee and therefore a protected person under the unambiguous provisions of the section of the policy.as interstate points out,the policy clearly excludes practitioners from its definition of employee in the portion of the policy,but it does not exclude practitioners from the definition in the section of the policy,which is the section applicable to the claims at issue in this case.in interstate view,the fact that the definition excludes practitioners while the definition does not exclude them demonstrates that the policy provides coverage for nurse cryer.the presence of this language in the section shows that dimensions knew the hospital was staffed by and practitioners and that the word employee as used in the policy includes employees and practitioners.after all,if employee did not include practitioners,then there would have been no need to specifically exclude them from the definition of protected person.see rigby allstate indem.spec.app.noting the basic principle of contract interpretation that courts should give effect to each clause of an insurance policy,and avoid treating either term as surplusage internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also gates,hudson,fed.ins,cir.federal careful delineations of specific types of injuries at other points in the policy suggest that the insurer knew how to limit the term when it desired to do so.
we agree.dimensions decision to use different language in different sections of the policy when addressing the coverage available to employees must be understood as an intentional decision.nish cohen,cir.the omission by congress of language in one section of a statute that is included in another section of the same statute generally reflects congress intentional and purposeful exclusion in the former section.under maryland law,we must respect this decision and apply the policy in a way that gives effect to the full worker protection clause in the section and to the full worker protection clause in the section.the only way to do that is,as interstate argues,to conclude that the term employee as used in the policy includes hospital workers as well as hospital workers.accordingly,because the section of the policy extends protected person status to hospital workers without excluding workers,we conclude that nurse cryer is a protected person under the section of the policy.
dimensions,however,insists that the policy itself prevents us from considering the language of the section as a guide to the meaning of the section of the policy.the general rules portion of the policy states that each agreement the three sections of the policy separately addressing coverage for general liability,hospital professional liability,and group physicians professional liability must be read and interpreted separately and independently of the other and no terms,conditions or exceptions from one agreement shall be construed to apply to any other agreement or provide a basis for interpretation of any other agreement.emphasis added.relying on this provision,dimensions contends that this court may not look to the terms of the section to determine the scope of coverage provided under the section.
we need not decide whether the policy provision operates in the manner urged by dimensions.even if we examine the section of the policy in isolation,without consideration of the terms of the other sections of the policy,we still conclude that the policy provides coverage for the claims asserted against nurse cryer.
if we examine the portion of the policy alone,we are presented with an insurance policy that provides coverage to hospital employees but does not define the term.in the absence of a definition or other indication that the parties intended to use words in the policy in a technical sense,lloyd mitchell,maryland cas,unambiguous policy language must be given its customary,ordinary,and accepted meaning,as determined by the fictional reasonably prudent lay person,connors at internal quotation marks omitted.
a policy term is not ambiguous simply because it is general in nature or undefined by the policy.walker fireman fund ins.spec.app.instead,a term is considered ambiguous if,to a reasonably prudent person,the term is susceptible to more than one meaning.connors,at internal quotation marks omitted.to determine whether a policy term is ambiguous,we look only to the policy itself we may not look to extrinsic sources to create an ambiguity.see of balt.iz.spec.app.schneider continental cas,cir.a court may not,where the contractual language is clear,invite or accept the submission of extrinsic evidence,find ambiguity in the contractual text based upon that evidence,and resolve the found ambiguity by resort to that extrinsic evidence.
interstate contends that employee is an unambiguous term whose ordinary,customary meaning tracks the test used to determine the existence of a relationship.see whitehead safway steel,this court has traditionally considered five criteria in determining whether or not an relationship exists between two parties.these criteria include the power to select and hire the employee,the payment of wages,the power to discharge,the power to control the employee conduct,and whether the work is part of the regular business of the employer.interstate also contends that the ordinary meaning of employee encompasses borrowed employees like nurse cryer,who are paid by one employer but work under the direct control of another.see,temp.staffing,haines.
we agree with interstate that the undefined term employee is unambiguous.see c h plumbing heating,employers mut.cas,finding no ambiguity in clause excluding coverage for dishonest or criminal act of employee of the insured accord interstate fire cas.washington hosp.ctr,cir.policy providing coverage to all employees of hospital was unambiguous nationwide mut.fire ins.guman.farm,ohio t he term employee is not defined,but does have a plain and ordinary meaning.and we likewise agree with interstate that the common and ordinary meaning of employee incorporates the test.see interstate fire,at applying test to define employee for purposes of insurance policy issued to hospital utilizing nurses provided by staffing agency see also black law dictionary ed.defining employee as s omeone who works in the service of another person the employer under an express or implied contract of hire,under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance emphasis added mutual fire ins.ackerman.spec.app.looking to black to determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined term.
there can be no question that nurse cryer qualifies as an employee of the hospital under the test.in whitehead safway steel products,the maryland court of appeals applied the test to conclude that safway was the employer of whitehead,a worker who had been assigned to safway by a temporary staffing agency safway instructed whitehead on the task to be performed,supervised his work,and was free to reassign him to any other duties that warranted attention.if whitehead work was unsatisfactory,safway was free to dismiss him and request an additional worker.at.the hospital control over cryer,as established by the undisputed evidence in the record,mirrors that of the staffing agency customer in whitehead,and nurse cryer therefore is an employee of the hospital as a matter of law.see id.t emporar y workers who work in employment circumstances similar to the one here present,are as a matter of law,employees of the customer see also interstate fire cas,at concluding that nurse paid by staffing agency and assigned to work at hospital was employee of hospital under insurance policy covering hospital employees.
accordingly,we conclude that the provision in the section of the policy extending protected person status to employees of the hospital is unambiguous.the plain and ordinary meaning of employee includes those who qualify as employees under the test,and the evidence in the record establishes that nurse cryer qualifies as an employee of the hospital under that test.
dimensions makes two arguments in support of its contrary reading of the policy.it first argues that the term employee must be interpreted in light of the staffing agreement between the hospital and the agency.it also argues that nurse cryer qualifies as an affiliated healthcare provider under the terms of the policy but fails to meet the requirements for coverage to extend to her in that capacity.we find neither of these arguments persuasive.
dimensions first contends that we should define employee as used in the dimensions policy by reference to the staffing agreement between the agency and the hospital.because the staffing agreement provides that agency practitioners will be treated as the employees of the agency,not the hospital,dimensions contends that nurse cryer does not qualify as an employee under the policy.
dimensions argument in this regard centers on nurse cryer status as a borrowed employee.borrowed employees have two employers a general employer,who essentially loans the employee to a borrowing or special employer.see lovelace anderson,noting the settled principle of maryland law that a worker may simultaneously be the employee of two employers internal quotation marks and alteration omitted temp.staffing,at a general employer is an employer who transfers an employee to another employer for a limited period.a special employer is an employer who has borrowed an employee for a limited period and has temporary responsibility and control over the employee work.in this case,the agency is nurse cryer general employer,and the hospital is her special employer.see id.a temporary employment company is a general employer and the company to which an employee is assigned is a special employer.
as between the general and special employee,liability for the employee act or for the employee worker compensation claim turns on whose work is being done and who can control that work 
w here the work to be done is the borrower work,and a part of his business,and he has the power and authority to direct when and where and how it shall be done,and where the work is not within the scope of the general employment of the servant,it may fairly be said that so far as that work is concerned he is under the control of the borrower and that the latter will be responsible for his negligent acts.
dippel juliano,see standard oil anderson,one may be in the general service of another,and,nevertheless,with respect to particular work,may be transferred to the service of a third person,so that he becomes the servant of that person,with all the legal consequences of the new relation.however,if the general employer and special employer have entered into a contract assigning liability to one of the parties,courts will give effect to that contract.see temp.staffing,at directing workers compensation commission to consider contract between when assigning liability for benefits for injured employee hercules powder harry campbell sons,reversing jury verdict in favor of special employer where contract between general and special employer assigned liability for employee negligence to special employer see also sea land,ship repair,supp,u nder maryland law,whatever the status of an employee under the borrowed servant doctrine,the parties may allocate between themselves the risk of any loss resulting from the employee negligent acts.
it is on the latter point that dimensions pegs its argument.in dimensions view,a contract between a special employer and general employer assigning liability for the borrowed employee is determinative of the who is an employee question,wherever that question might arise.see brief of appellee at stating that the staffing agreement should apply to any borrowed servant analysis whether it is made in the context of a lawsuit between the borrowing and lending employer or any other entities.pointing to cases such as nvr,just temps.cir.per curiam unpublished,dimensions argues that the staffing agreement controls the employee status,brief of appellee at,which makes the or analysis irrelevant,id.at.and because the staffing agreement provides that nurse cryer is the agency employee and that the agency will be liable for her negligent acts,dimensions contends that nurse cryer is not a hospital employee under the policy.we disagree.
the cases on which dimensions relies establish simply that the existence of a contract makes it unnecessary to apply the test in a dispute between the parties to that contract.see nvr.at under maryland law,in cases like this one between a general employer and a borrowing employer,the parties may allocate between themselves the risk of any loss resulting from the employee negligent acts.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added sea land,supp.at w hatever the status of an employee under the borrowed servant doctrine,the parties may allocate between themselves the risk of any loss resulting from the employee negligent acts.emphasis added.nothing in these cases supports dimensions assertion that the terms of the staffing agreement,a contract to which neither dimensions,interstate,nor nurse cryer were parties,determine the scope of the entirely separate insurance contract issued by dimensions to the hospital or diminish the protection provided to cryer by the policy.see mayor of baltimore ex rel.lehigh structural steel maryland cas,it seems axiomatic that persons are only bound by the contracts they make,and are not bound by contracts they do not make.
accepting dimensions argument that the staffing agreement controls the meaning of the policy would be inconsistent with maryland principles of contract interpretation.as we have concluded,the policy is not ambiguous,despite its failure to define employee.maryland law therefore requires us to look only to the policy itself and to interpret it as written.see inv.columbia town ctr.title,o ur search to determine the meaning of the contract is focused on the four corners of the agreement.when the clear language of a contract is unambiguous,the court will give effect to its plain,ordinary,and usual meaning,taking into account the context in which it is used internal quotation marks,citation,and internal alteration omitted ray state,wl,at.spec.app,e xtrinsic sources of evidence that may be helpful in resolving an ambiguity,when it actually exists,may not be used to create an ambiguity in the first instance.dimensions,however,contends we should look beyond the policy and define its unambiguous terms not in accordance with their ordinary meaning,but in accordance with the terms of a wholly separate and independent contract.because that argument is inconsistent with maryland law,we are obliged to reject it.
the common,ordinary meaning of employee incorporates the test that is,one who works in the service of another who has the right to control the details of the work is the employee of the entity with the right to control.by arguing that the staffing agreement controls the employee question,dimensions is,in effect,arguing that the common,ordinary meaning of employee includes a footnote that carves out those workers who would otherwise qualify as employees but are the subject of a contract placing liability for them on someone other than the entity with the right to control.we disagree.as maryland courts have made clear,the words of insurance contracts must be given their customary,ordinary,and accepted meaning,as determined by the fictional reasonably prudent lay person.connors,at emphasis added.lay persons do not generally footnote their words,and we decline to append dimension proposed footnote to the common meaning of employee.whether or not liability for the employee has been assigned by contract between,the common,ordinary meaning of employee is one who works in the service of and subject to the direction and control of another.
in addition to being inconsistent with maryland principles of contract interpretation,dimensions claim that the staffing agreement controls is also largely foreclosed by this court decision in travelers property and casualty liberty mutual insurance,cir.in travelers,state street bank hired ryland mortgage company to service and manage mortgage loans held by state street and to manage any properties state street took over through foreclosure.by contract,ryland was obligated to indemnify state street for any claims arising from ryland management of the loans and property.a visitor to a foreclosed property was injured and sued state street and ryland.ryland was insured by travelers,and state street was insured by liberty mutual.travelers provided a defense to ryland and subsequently sought contribution from liberty mutual,arguing that ryland was an additional insured under the policy issued to state street.
on appeal,we agreed with travelers that ryland was covered by the liberty mutual policy.the liberty mutual policy included state street real estate managers as additional insureds,and ryland contractual duties qualified it as a real estate manager.see id.at.liberty mutual,therefore,had an independent contractual obligation to provide coverage to ryland.id.at.and because liberty mutual had an independent duty to provide coverage to ryland,the indemnification agreement between ryland and state street was irrelevant 
the issue here is coverage for only ryland liability.travelers concededly insured ryland,and because of liberty mutual insuring language
