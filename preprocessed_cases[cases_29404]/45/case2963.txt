plaintiffs john mackinnon,christel mackinnon,and john and christel mackinnon family trust collectively mackinnon appeal summary judgment entered in favor of defendant truck insurance exchange truck insurance.
we consider whether a commercial comprehensive general liability cgl insurance policy exclusion,commonly referred to as a pollution exclusion,excludes coverage for a third party personal injury claim arising from spraying an apartment building with insecticide to exterminate yellow jackets.
mackinnon contends the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that there was no coverage under the pollution exclusion.the trial court concluded that since a pesticide is a chemical,it was a pollutant within the policy definition of pollutant,and thus the pollution exclusion applied and excluded coverage.mackinnon argues that the exclusion is ambiguous and the exclusion does not apply because there was no environmental pollution.
mackinnon also argues that there are factual issues as to whether truck insurance waived reliance on the pollution exclusion and whether it was estopped from asserting the exclusion after initially defending mackinnon in the matter.
we conclude the pollution exclusion is clear and unambiguous as applied in this case,the exclusion applies as a matter of law,and coverage for injuries arising from the pesticide spraying incident is thus excluded under the pollution exclusion.we further conclude there are no material triable issues of fact and therefore affirm summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the following facts are undisputed.truck insurance issued a cgl insurance policy to mackinnon,for the period of april to april.the policy provided coverage for damages mackinnon incurred as a result of personal injuries arising out of mackinnon business operations conducted at an apartment building owned and operated by mackinnon.under the business liability section of the insurance policy,the policy contained an exclusion commonly referred to in the insurance industry and by the courts as a pollution exclusion.
jennifer denzin was a tenant in mackinnon apartment building.she requested mackinnon to spray to eradicate yellow jackets at the apartment building.mackinnon hired a pest control company,antimite associates,to exterminate the yellow jackets.antimite treated the apartment building for yellow jackets on several occasions in and.on may,denzin died in mackinnon apartment building.
denzin parents filed a wrongful death lawsuit against mackinnon,antimite,and other defendants,alleging that denzin died as a result of exposure to dangerous chemicals sprayed at mackinnon apartment building.mackinnon tendered his defense to truck insurance under the cgl insurance policy.
on november,truck insurance retained counsel and filed a responsive pleading to the complaint on behalf of mackinnon.on december,truck insurance sent mackinnon a letter advising him that,because an immediate response was necessary,truck insurance had referred the denzin action to defense counsel in order to protect mackinnon interests.truck insurance added that it was still investigating the matter to determine if coverage existed.truck insurance added that it did not intend to waive any provisions of the insurance policy,and truck reserves all of its rights under the terms,exclusions,and conditions of any policies issued to you.
on june,truck insurance sent mackinnon a letter advising that truck insurance had concluded that the pollution exclusion precluded coverage for the denzin action and therefore truck insurance would be withdrawing its defense within days.truck insurance extended the withdrawal date to july.
in june,mackinnon retained counsel to represent him in the denzin action.mackinnon,through his counsel,settled the denzin action for and then filed the instant insurance coverage action,claiming truck insurance owed mackinnon a duty to defend and indemnify him in the denzin action.mackinnon action asserted causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of contract,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
truck insurance moved for summary judgment on mackinnon coverage claims on the ground the pollution exclusion,contained in the insurance policy issued by truck insurance to mackinnon,precluded coverage for the denzin suit.mackinnon opposed the motion.the trial court granted summary judgment based on the following findings the denzin action alleged the decedent died as a result of exposure to a pesticide used to eradicate yellow jackets at her apartment building the pollution exclusion in the truck insurance policy was clear and unambiguous there was no potential for coverage for the denzin action because the allegations in the denzin complaint are excluded from coverage by the pollution exclusion and because there was no potential for coverage,mackinnon breach of the good faith covenant cause of action also fails.
summary judgment standard of review 
on appeal from a summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant,we review the trial court decision de novo,applying the rule that a defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the record establishes as a matter of law that either none of the plaintiff asserted causes of action can prevail or the plaintiff can not establish one or more elements 
the first step of the review begins with an analysis of the pleadings,because t he pleadings define the issues to be considered on a motion for summary judgment.citation.we next evaluate the moving defendant effort to meet its burden of showing that plaintiff cause of action has no merit or that there is a complete defense to it.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to its complaint.if the filings in opposition raise triable issues of material fact the motion must be denied if they do not,the motion must be granted citations.
the pollution exclusion 
mackinnon contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the pollution exclusion is ambiguous and inapplicable to nonenvironmental pollution,such as the spraying of a pesticide.
principles of insurance policy interpretation 
an insurance policy is interpreted to effectuate the mutual intent of the parties if possible,we look solely to the terms of the policy,and the clear and explicit meaning of the policy terms will govern our interpretation if the policy is ambiguous,that is,susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,we construe the ambiguity in favor of coverage but if a policy clearly excludes coverage,we will not indulge in tortured constructions to divine some theoretical ambiguity in order to find coverage.citation.an insurer is entitled to limit its coverage to defined risks,and if it does so in clear language,we will not impose coverage where none was intended.citation.
however,e xclusionary clauses are subjected to heightened scrutiny.they must be conspicuous,clear and plain if they do not meet this test,such clauses will be strictly construed against the insurer.citations.the policy should be read as a layman would read it and not as it might be analyzed by an attorney or an insurance expert.citation.
where there are no disputed material facts,interpretation of an insurance policy presents solely a question of law an appellate court is not bound by the trial court interpretation and instead conducts its own independent review whether a policy is ambiguous is also a question of law subject to our independent review 
b.the pollution exclusion 
mackinnon contends that,at a minimum,truck insurance owes him a duty to defend him in denzin wrongful death lawsuit.he claims the pollution exclusion does not apply.
the pollution exclusion contained in the truck insurance policy states in relevant part we do not cover bodily injury or property damage.resulting from the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants d at or from any site or location on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations if the pollutants are brought on or to the site or location by you or for you.
at the beginning of the policy,the policy states that words printed in bold type in the text of the policy are defined in the definitions section.the term pollutants is defined in the policy as follows pollution or any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste materials 
california state courts have concluded pollution exclusions unambiguously exclude coverage for environmental pollution,such as groundwater and soil contamination mackinnon argues that,even though the exclusion may be clear as applied to environmental pollution,the exclusion is ambiguous as to whether it applies to the instant case,which does not involve environmental pollution.
we are unaware of any california state case law addressing the issue of whether the pollution exclusion excludes coverage of claims arising from nonenvironmental pollution,such as residential pesticide extermination.but there is divergent case law in other states,as well as in the federal courts,addressing this issue while such case law is not binding on this court and differs among the various jurisdictions,we consider it as reflective of the varying viewpoints on the issue.
the kansas federal district court in its decision,westchester fire ins.city of pittsburg,noted that the author of a law review commentary reported that a majority of courts find the standard pollution exclusion clause contained in commercial general liability policies to be ambiguous.but the florida supreme court stated in its more recent decision,deni associates state farm,that a substantial majority of courts throughout the country have concluded that the pollution exclusion is clear and unambiguous so as to preclude coverage for all pollution related liability.the deni court added that state farm and farm bureau together with their amici have cited more than cases from other states which have applied the plain language of the pollution exclusion clause to deny coverage.
we recognize that these decisions include cases involving environmental pollution and pollution exclusions which contain differing language,such as the sudden and accidental exception.nevertheless,the current general consensus appears to be that the exclusion is clear on its face,and in numerous instances the exclusion has been determined to be clear and applicable to nonenvironmental pollution such as pesticide exposure 
for instance,in deni associates state farm,the florida supreme court found in two consolidated cases that the pollution exclusion was unambiguous and precluded coverage for injuries caused by an ammonia spill from a blueprint machine and for bodily injuries from accidentally spraying bystanders with insecticide.the pollution exclusions in both cases were the same,and are almost identical to the exclusion in the instant case.the deni court noted that we can not accept the conclusion reached by certain courts that because of its ambiguity the pollution exclusion clause only excludes environmental or industrial pollution.
in reaching these conclusions,the deni court quoted language from american states insurance,stating asks that this court,in essence,ignore the policy definition of pollutants or,perhaps more accurately,limit the term so that it is defined in the manner employed by environmental engineers,and thereby create coverage not provided by the policy.the court reiterates that it is not free to rewrite the terms of the insurance contract where that contract is not ambiguous.in this case,regardless of what is or might be a preferable definition from standpoint,or what would be the definition of choice from an environmental engineer expert perspective,or the perspective of the scientific community,the policy definition of pollutant,and the pollution exclusion construed as a whole is clear and unambiguous.moreover,the claims that have been asserted against fall well within the exclusion.this is equally true in the instant case.the exclusion language is clear and this court is thus not free to add limiting terms and language to the exclusion.
the deni court further relied on the following reasoning from west american insurance band in refuting the insured contention that the pollution exclusion should apply only to environmental pollution band again relies on cases interpreting older versions of the pollution exclusion for this argument.in those cases,the courts first looked to the historical purpose of the pollution exclusion and held that the drafters intended the exclusion to limit coverage for costs imposed by epa legislation.the courts then looked at the language requiring the discharge to be onto land,into the atmosphere,or into water and interpreted that to mean that the exclusion was applicable only when the pollutants were discharged into the outside environment.however,as with band first argument,this pollution exclusion does not have the language interpreted by the other courts.thus,the reasoning of those cases is inapplicable to the case at hand.additionally,this court can not examine the history of the exclusion because the language is clear and unambiguous and to resort to history would,therefore,be contrary to florida law.
here,mackinnon relies heavily on the pollution exclusion history in advocating limiting the exclusion to environmental pollution.as explained above,reliance on such history is inappropriate since the exclusion language has changed significantly and differs from the language construed by the courts limiting the exclusion to environmental pollution.in the insurance industry eliminated from the pollution exclusion the language requiring the discharge to be on land,the atmosphere or any water course or body of water.such language is not in the instant policy.furthermore,consideration of such history is improper since we conclude the exclusion language is clear and unambiguous.
the michigan supreme court in protective also concluded the pollution exclusion clearly applied to spraying insecticide and was not limited to environmental pollution.in protective national,a third party sued the city for damages sustained as a result of exposure to chemical pesticide sprayed by the city.the city sought coverage under a cgl policy and the insurer initially defended the city under a reservation of rights.the insurer filed a declaratory relief action and summary judgment motion claiming there was no coverage under the pollution exclusion.the trial court agreed and granted summary judgment.the court of appeal reversed,and the michigan supreme court held the pollution exclusion applied and thus summary judgment was appropriately granted 
the protective national court concluded the exclusion language was clear and unambiguous and the pesticide was a substance to which the pollution exclusion clearly applied as a matter of law the court further stated that it is almost beyond comprehension how anyone would seriously argue that such a pesticide is not an irritant,contaminant or pollutant.similarly,on the basis of such evidence,we do not understand how anyone can seriously argue that the trial court improperly determined,for the purpose of granting protective national motion for summary disposition,that the pesticide was an irritant,contaminant or pollutant as required by the language of exclusion i in the policy.we believe the trial court was correct,under the circumstances,in finding that the pesticide was a substance to which the pollution exclusion applied.
in response to the dissent argument that the very title of the clause,pollution exclusion,created ambiguity and indicated the exclusion only applied to environmental pollution,the protective national court explained that the policy does not refer to or designate the exclusion as the pollution exclusion.rather,the designation has been created by litigants,the judiciary,and attorneys to describe the otherwise unnamed,untitled clause the court noted the plain language of exclusion i clearly applies to smoke,vapors,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,toxic chemicals,liquids,or gases,waste material or other irritants,contaminants,or pollutants.to hold,as the dissent would
