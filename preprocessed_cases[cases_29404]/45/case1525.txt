in these two consolidated appeals we consider whether a plaintiff who has alleged no injury to himself has standing to bring suit under the medicare secondary payer statute,b a.because we conclude that the suit authorized by the statute is a private cause of action,which requires the plaintiff to have standing in his own right,rather than a qui tam statute,which allows the plaintiff to assert injury to the united states,we affirm the district courts dismissal of these cases.
both of these cases were filed by the same plaintiff,douglas stalley,who has also filed many similar cases around the country stalley alleges that the defendants catholic health initiatives and triad hospitals,are medical care providers participating in the medicare program,who partly for malpractice.he alleges that the insurance company defendants were subsidiaries or sister companies to the provider defendants and wrote malpractice insurance for the provider defendants.
stalley substantive allegations are substantially the same in the two suits before us 
on numerous occasions,the provider defendants by and through their employees and agents,caused harm to medicare recipients who were patients in the defendants hospitals,thereby triggering legal obligation on the part of the hospital defendants and the other primary payer defendants herein to pay for any consequential medical service,treatment,or medication.nevertheless,the provider defendants provided medical services,treatment,and medication to such medicare recipients who were harmed by the provider defendants own conduct,and thereafter received reimbursement from medicare for treating those injured medicare recipients.
the complaints allege that the insurer defendants knew that the provider defendants had injured the medicare beneficiaries and that the insurer defendants were liable as primary payers,yet the insurer defendants did not reimburse medicare for the costs of treatment.the complaint does not allege that stalley was either a medicare beneficiary or a patient of the defendants or that he was injured by the defendants in any way.for that matter,the complaint does not identify any particular person who was injured by the defendants at any particular time.
the defendants in both cases moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.both district courts granted the motion.the district court in the catholic health initiatives case ruled first,holding that stalley lacked constitutional standing to bring the suit because he had not alleged any injury to himself.stalley catholic health initiatives,d.stalley contended that he had standing because he asserted injury to the united states and the medicare secondary payer statute was a qui tam statute that authorized him to bring suit as relator for the united states.the district court examined the medicare secondary payer statute and found no support for the notion that it was a qui tam statute.id.at.accordingly,the court dismissed stalley suit under.b for lack of standing.alternatively,the court held that stalley had not alleged a cause of action under b a because he had not alleged that the provider defendants liability had been demonstrated,and the duty of the primary insurer to pay or to reimburse medicare did not arise until the tortfeasor liability has been demonstrated by judgment or other comparable means.id.at relying on glover liggett group,cir.the district court in triad relied on judge howard conclusion in catholic health initiatives that b a is not a qui tam statute and that stalley therefore lacked standing to sue 
the standard of review of a district court decision under.b depends on whether the district court resolved a facial attack or a factual attack on subject matter jurisdiction.osborn united states,cir.if,as here,the district court addressed a deficiency in the pleadings,our standard of review is the same standard we apply in rule b cases.mattes abc plastics,cir.we accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint,giving no effect to conclusory allegations of law.id.at.the plaintiff must assert facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that the pleader has the right he claims here,the right to jurisdiction,rather than facts that are merely consistent with such a right.see bell atl.twombly,d.
the party invoking federal jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that he has standing to assert the claim.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.standing consists of three elements the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact there must be a causal connection between that injury and the conduct complained of and it must be likely that the injury would be redressed by a remedy the court could order.id.at.at the pleading stage,general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant conduct may suffice,for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
stalley does not contend that he himself has sustained any injury in fact.instead,he contends that the medicare secondary payer statute is a qui tam statute.a qui tam statute effectively assigns part of the government interest to a relator so that the relator has standing to assert an injury suffered by the government.see.agency of nat.res.united states ex rel.stevens,d.the false claims act can reasonably be regarded as effecting a partial assignment of the government damages claim we conclude,therefore,that the united states injury in fact suffices to confer standing on respondent stevens.qui tam actions developed around the end of the thirteenth century as a way for individuals who had suffered harm to avail themselves of the royal courts by pleading a harm to the king as well as to themselves.id.at.well before american independence,the action evolved into the modern form in which informers who had not suffered harm personally,but who knew of harm done to the government,were authorized by statute to sue the wrongdoer on the government behalf and to retain a portion of the damages awarded the government as a bounty or reward for bringing the wrongdoing to light.id.at.there presently is no right to bring a qui tam action,which is strictly a creature of statute.united seniors ass philip morris usa,cir accord united states ex rel.burnette driving hawk,cir.the best known qui tam statute today is the false claims act,which conferred standing on the plaintiff in vermont agency of natural resources,at.
the plain language of b a says,there is established a private cause of action for damages emphasis added.a private right is different from a public right,see black law dictionary,right ed private right is defined as a personal right,as opposed to a right of the public or the state,and qui tam cases exist to vindicate public rights.thus,the medicare secondary payer statute purports to give a substantive right to individuals qua individuals,not as private attorneys general or assignees of a public right.in contrast,the false claims act qui tam provision authorizes a private person to bring a civil action for the person and for the united states government.the action shall be brought in the name of the government.b.moreover,the medicare secondary payer statute lacks any provisions giving the government the right to control the action,such as the right to dismiss the action,the right to veto a dismissal or settlement,and the right to review the complaint in camera before the relator serves the complaint on the defendant.again,in contrast,the false claims act has extensive provisions giving the government these rights and more.see.the absence of procedural safeguards giving the executive branch control over the prosecution of the action and the proceeds is powerful evidence that congress did not mean b a to function as a qui tam statute.see united seniors ass n,at affirming dismissal for lack of standing of medicare secondary payer private action by plaintiff who had no personal injury in re guidant.implantable defibrillators prods.liability,d,dismissing medicare secondary payer private action for lack of standing,reconsidered on different grounds,wl.may.
stalley relies on a statement in mason american tobacco,d,aff,cir,that the private right of action provided by b a is similar to a qui tam action where anyone can bring a claim on behalf of the united states government and receive a bounty.see also manning utils.mut.ins,cir referring to the medicare secondary payer statute as creating private attorneys general.the aspects of the medicare secondary payer statute that are similar to a qui tam provision are that it is based on the informer principle,in which the government relies on private persons with superior knowledge to discover the government claim it increases the damages payable in order to motivate a private party to take action and the government expects to recoup part of the private party recovery.in manning,the second circuit relied on these kinds of similarities to conclude that the false claims act provided the most analogous statute of limitations to apply to b a claims.at.
even though the private right of action under b a shares these characteristics of a qui tam statute,it may not be a qui tam statute if congress intended the plaintiff to act as a private plaintiff,asserting his own injury,rather than as a relator,asserting the government injury.despite language in some decisions indicating that the private plaintiff can assert the government rights under b a,glover liggett group,cir the msp also creates a private right of action with double recovery to encourage private parties who are aware of by primary plans to bring actions to enforce medicare rights.emphasis added manning,at stating that medicare secondary payer statute allows individual citizens to sue in order to right an economic wrong done to the government,we conclude that the statute actually allows a private plaintiff to assert his own rights,not those of the government.see frazer cna ins,d,t he mspa does not create a cause of action which would permit a eligible worker compensation claimant to bring such an action.
stalley argues that the statute can not be read to contemplate that only a private party who was actually injured can assert the private right of action.stalley argues that such a reading is impossible because no private plaintiff would ever have an injury which would both be a cognizable injury for which the plaintiff could recover and lead to a recovery which the government could recoup.thus,stalley says that the only way the private right of action can help the government recoup money from primary payers is if it functions as a qui tam statute empowering a private person to assert the government rights,rather than his own rights.therefore,according to stalley,a volunteer like himself,who has no relationship with the primary payer and has suffered no injury,can sue under the private right of action and recover double damages for the injury to the government.catholic health initiatives brief declines to identify a case in which the private right of action would be enforceable by an individual and lead to recoupment of medicare expenses by the government catholic health initiatives tells us that we need not even delve into this sort of speculation about the msp statute possible uses,but if there were truly no way that the private right of action would ever have any effect under catholic health initiatives interpretation,that would be a powerful argument that such an interpretation was wrong.to understand whether stalley argument is correct,we have to determine how the medicare secondary payer statute as a whole was meant to work and how the private right of action fits within that framework.
medicare is a federal program that provides health insurance for the elderly,the disabled,and renal patients.blue cross blue shield of,shalala,cir.in order to control the cost of medicare,in congress passed the medicare secondary payer statute,b,which provides generally that medicare insurance is secondary to group health insurance covering medicare beneficiaries and that medicare will not be liable for expenses which the private insurer ought to pay.see b.the statute provides that the private insurers can not draw their policies to make an end run around the statute by excluding expenses that would be covered by medicare if the person did not have group health insurance.b.in addition to expenses covered by group health insurance,the statute also disclaims liability for expenses that should be paid under a workmen compensation plan or under an automobile,liability,or no fault insurance policy,including a plan.b a.see generally harvey mccormick,medicare and medicaid claims and procedures.even though medicare is not ultimately liable for these excluded expenses,the statute permits medicare to pay those expenses up front,conditionally,and to require the liable insurer or other primary payer to reimburse medicare for the moneys advanced.b b i.the statute authorizes the government to sue any primary payer that has failed to reimburse medicare for such conditional payments,and to collect double damages in such a suit.b b iii.the government can also sue anyone that received payment from the primary payer with respect to expenses covered under medicare,including the beneficiary himself,should he collect the payment but fail to reimburse the government.g government has right of action against beneficiary that has received primary payment united states sosnowski,granting government recovery from beneficiary from settlement with primary payer.the statute provides that the united states is subrogated to the rights of the medicare beneficiaries against their insurer,to the extent of medicare payments the government has made for the beneficiaries expenses.b b iv.
congress added a private right of action to the medicare secondary payer statute in,stat.codified as amended at b a.section b a grants the medicare beneficiary a private right of action for double damages against an insurer or other primary payer that fails to pay the amounts it owes on the insured behalf.the parties do not point us to any legislative history explaining the purpose of the private right of action,nor have we found any legislative history directly explaining how the private right was meant to work.see conf.rpt,at,reprinted in,merely stating that the private right of action is to enforce the provision for the aged rpt,at stating that obligation of primary payers would be enforceable by private action or by the federal government.courts considering the provision have generally agreed that the apparent purpose of the statute is to help the government recover conditional payments from insurers or other primary payers.see,united seniors,at to facilitate recovery of these conditional payments,the msp iii creates a private cause of action with double recovery to encourage private parties to bring actions to enforce medicare rights.citation omitted manning,at the history of the msp legislation is consistent with our view that the private right of action was created to save money for the medicare system.frazer,d at the legislation incentive to bring a private lawsuit is clearly based in turn upon the subrogation right of the government to obtain a portion of the recovery.the recovery of costs by medicare is the primary purpose of the msp.see also harris humana health ins,cir per curiam a private cause of action for double damages serves congress interest in the fiscal integrity of the medicare program by deterring private insurers primary to medicare under the statute from attempting to lay medical costs at the government doorstep.this is consistent with inclusion of the provision in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,which was intended to reduce government spending.see statement by president of the united states,weekly compilation of presidential documents,reprinted in.additionally,as the second circuit pointed out in manning,at,when senator david durenburger introduced the president medicare proposals for,which included the private right of action,he referred to the proposals as health care cost reduction proposals.cong.rec.
