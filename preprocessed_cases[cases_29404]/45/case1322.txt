charlene harper,acting in the capacity of administrator of jane doe jane estate,appeals an order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of the vigilant insurance company vigilant.the district court found that jane,as an assignee of john doe john rights to sue vigilant for bad faith failure to defend and indemnify,could not prevail because john was not a resident of his father household under the terms of his father homeowner insurance policy.the trial court also concluded,in the alternative,that even if john was an insured under the policy,harper had failed to establish that jane injury occurred during the effective insurance policy coverage period.we affirm.
background 
john and jane met in louis,missouri,in the spring or summer of.not long after meeting they began dating,and became sexually active somewhere in september or october of that year.while dating jane,john lived with his mother at wilson avenue in louis,missouri,but occasionally visited his estranged father lake house in lake of the ozarks,missouri.he and jane stayed at his father lake house maybe six times a year and he went there pretty consistently without jane 
prior to,and throughout his relationship with jane,john engaged in sexual behavior.among other things,john admitted to having sexual encounters with numerous men as well as other women while contemporaneously having relations with jane.in,john treating physician advised him to get tested for hiv,as the doctor suspected he was suffering from aids.however,throughout the period of time that he was dating jane,john failed to seek or obtain a hiv test.in addition,john neglected to inform jane of either his sexual behavior or his doctor suspicion that he was suffering from aids.in john and jane broke up,and in january of,john tested positive for hiv.just a few months later,in april of,jane discovered that she too was infected with the hiv virus.
in march of,jane filed suit against john in clair county,illinois,the clair lawsuit seeking recovery for bodily injury,pain and suffering,emotional distress,loss of income and medical expense based on john alleged negligence,battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress in infecting her with the hiv virus.specifically,jane alleged inter alia that john transmitted hiv to her when he knew or should have known he was infected with the communicable disease and john had failed to take adequate precautions to prevent himself from contracting hiv after he had engaged in sexual behavior while simultaneously sleeping with jane.
after the clair lawsuit was filed,john made numerous demands upon his father defend and indemnify him in the clair lawsuit,relying on four different homeowner insurance policies issued to his father.the four vigilant policies included policy number to john mother and father for property located at south street in louis,missouri,effective from january,through january,policy number to john father for property located at via giudici drive in louis,missouri,effective from september,through september,policy number to john father for lot,horseshoe bend,lake ozark,missouri,effective from october,through october,the lake house policy and policy number to john father for the via giudici drive address,effective from september,through september.after investigating and reviewing each of the claims,vigilant denied each request for coverage 
during their investigation,vigilant proceeded to conduct a number of depositions as well as serve informal interrogatories on john through his counsel.for example,on november,john participated in a deposition dealing with the clair lawsuit and stated that his residence was wilson avenue,louis,missouri and added that he had lived at that location all of his life.john also testified that he had never claimed any other residence as his own and that he owned no real estate and had not lived anywhere else for an extended period of time.in addition,in response to a letter requesting more information,dated june,john,through his counsel,stated that a he never maintained a bedroom at his father lake house and that he resided at his mother home all of his life b he did not keep personal belongings at the lake house and c he listed his mother address on his tax returns and other legal documents.after concluding their investigation,vigilant made a final determination on august,and advised john that vigilant was not obligated,under any of the policies,to defend him,stating that they would neither defend n or indemnify him in the clair lawsuit or participate in any settlement.
on march,jane and john entered into a confidential settlement and mutual release the settlement agreement,thus terminating the clair lawsuit in the settlement agreement,in addition to consenting to the entry of judgment against him in the amount of,john also assigned to jane the right to pursue any bad faith or vexatious refusal to pay claims he accrued against vigilant for refusal to defend him in the clair lawsuit.john died on november.
pursuant to john assignment of the right to sue,jane filed a complaint against vigilant on july,in clair county,illinois alleging bad faith refusal to defend bad faith refusal to settle and violation of section of the illinois insurance code,ilcs.in response,vigilant filed a motion with the circuit court seeking permission to remove the case to federal court pursuant to.vigilant motion was granted and the case was removed to the united states district court for the southern district of illinois.jane subsequently died on october,while the case was pending.in february,harper,jane sister and estate administrator,was substituted for jane as the plaintiff in the pending suit.
following discovery,vigilant filed a motion for summary judgment against harper,claiming that it had no duty to defend john in the clair lawsuit because he was not an insured under the terms of any of his father policies.also,vigilant argued that,even if john was an insured under any of the policies,there was no evidence in the record which would establish that john infected jane during the effective time limits of the lake house policy.the district court agreed with vigilant arguments and entered summary judgment in the insurance company favor on november,finding that john was not insured under the terms of any of vigilant policies issued to john father and that,even if he were,there was no evidence establishing that jane had been infected during the coverage periods of the policies at issue.harper appeals the judgment only with respect to policy number,the lake house policy.
on appeal,harper argues that the district court erred in granting vigilant motion for summary judgment.specifically,harper claims that summary judgment was improper because a vigilant failed to establish beyond dispute that john was not an insured person under the lake house policy because he never resided at the vacation property and b whether or not john infected jane with the hiv virus at the vacation property was a disputed question of material fact.
iii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and in doing so view the record in the light most favorable to harper,the nonmoving party.see hottenroth village of slinger,cir.summary judgment is warranted only where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.an issue of fact is material if it is outcome determinative h owever,bare allegations not supported by specific facts are not sufficient in opposing a motion for summary judgment.hottenroth,at quoting hildebrandt.of natural,cir.
as a federal court sitting in diversity by virtue of jurisdiction pursuant to,we apply state law to resolve substantive questions and federal law to resolve procedural and evidentiary issues.colip clare,cir citing mercado ahmed,cir.in the district court proceedings,both parties agree d that the substantive law of the state of missouri would govern interpretation of the insurance contract at issue.harper vigilant ins,at.also,because the trial court proceeded to conduct an independent analysis and determined that missouri law should apply to the interpretation of the insurance contract and because neither party has challenged that determination,they are barred from doing so now.see id.at muslin frelinghuysen livestock managers,cir.thus,under the familiar rule of erie tompkins,we apply missouri substantive law to the issues raised in this appeal.
where the missouri supreme court has not confronted a particular issue,whether the term household as used in an insurance contract is ambiguous,we are called upon to predict how that court would decide if presented with the same question.see smith equitable life assurance soc y of the united states,cir.in the absence of a missouri supreme court ruling on an issue,the decisions of the missouri court of appeals will control unless there is persuasive evidence that the missouri supreme court would rule differently.see clarin.life ins,cir.
john possible coverage as a member of his father household 
harper initially argues that summary judgment in favor of vigilant was inappropriate because whether john should be considered a resident of his father household for purposes of the lake house policy constituted a genuine issue of material fact pursuant to fed.civ.c.we disagree.
under missouri law,i n general,the meaning of an insurance contract and,in particular,coverage is a question of law.liberty mut.ins.havner.however,where a provision in an insurance policy is ambiguous or susceptible to two or more meanings,the court must adopt the meaning that is most advantageous to the insured position.id.the rationale underpinning this rule of law is that,i n drafting insurance policies,the insurer has the opportunity to clearly word exclusions and limits of liability.jam nautilus ins,quoting southern general ins.web.
the missouri supreme court,to date,has not specifically addressed the question of whether the term household when left undefined in an insurance contract is considered ambiguous however,in a en banc decision,the missouri supreme court noted that h ousehold is a chameleon like word t he definition depends on the facts of each case i t is difficult to deduce any general principles.cobb state sec.ins,en banc.nonetheless,despite the missouri supreme court admonition in cobb,the missouri court of appeals for the western district of missouri undertook the near impossible task of actually defining the term household,and having done so,declared the term unambiguous within and for the purposes of homeowners insurance policies.watt mittelstadt,defining household as a collection of persons,whether related by consanguinity or affinity or not related at all but who live or reside together as a single group or unit which is of a permanent and domestic character,with one head,under one roof or within a single curtilage who have a common subsistence and who direct their attention toward a common goal consisting of their mutual interest and happiness.however,in the missouri court of appeals for the western district overruled its own decision in watt,finding the definition unworkable and concluded that b ecause the meaning of the court definition is indistinct,the term houshold as a matter of law is ambiguous.liberty mut.ins,at citing martin fid.guar,en banc.thus,due to the fact that the watt court reversed itself,and because the missouri supreme court has expressly described the term household when incorporated into a homeowner insurance policy as chamaeleon like and dependant on the facts of each case,see cobb,at,we conclude that,if the missouri supreme court were to consider the issue,the court would conclude that the term household is indeed ambiguous.see dumas infinity broad,cir.
accordingly,because the term household as incorporated into the lake house policy is ambiguous,we interpret that term against the drafter,vigilant,and in favor of coverage for the insured.see krombach mayflower ins,en banc nevertheless,where there is no coverage under any reasonable interpretation of the policy summary judgment in favor of the insurer,here vigilant,is a proper remedy.see liberty mut.ins,at citing greer zurich ins.
this is such a case.under any reasonable interpretation of the language in the insurance contract,john can not be considered a resident of his father household.the term household,as determined by the missouri supreme court,generally refers to a close relationship,varying in detail,where people live together as a family in a group,usually because of a close relationship by blood,marriage or adoption and who deal with each other informally and not at arms length.cobb,at elder metro.prop.cas.in addition,the missouri courts of appeals have expanded on this precedent holding that,in order to be a resident of an insured household,an individual must establish that his stay in the insured home was intended to be something of permanence or continuity at least for an indefinite period of time,to the exclusion of another contemporaneous residence.pruitt farmers ins,quoting clarkson mfa mut.ins,
during the time frame at issue,john neither lived with his father in a group nor did he fulfill the requirement of maintaining a permanent continuity of existence at his father lake house to the exclusion of another contemporaneous residence.indeed,there is no evidence which would lead us to believe that john visits to his father lake house were of a permanent nature or that john at any point intended to establish a residence at the lake house or remain as a member of his father the exclusion of his mother residence in louis.for example,in a deposition taken in conjunction with the clair lawsuit john stated that his residence was wilson avenue in louis and that he had resided there all of his life.in addition,john designated the louis address on a number of legal documents,such as tax returns and all other applications.although john admits visiting his father lake house with jane maybe six times a year,and pretty consistently at other times throughout his life,there is no evidence in the record which would demonstrate that john living arrangements consisted of more than intermittent social visits to the lake house,while his permanent home remained in louis with his mother.further,in responding to a questionnaire provided to him by vigilant,john stated that he did not maintain a bedroom at the lake home,nor did he keep any of his personal possessions at the lake home.thus,although the question of whether a person is a resident of an insured household under the language of an insurance policy is a question of fact,liberty mutual insurance havner,the evidence in the record fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether john was an insured and,as such,the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of vigilant,see cameron mutual insurance marler,et.
john potential coverage as a an officer or employee of his father company 
in a related,but poorly developed argument,harper also argues that john was an insured under the lake house policy by virtue of his employment with crescent parts equipment crescent,his father company.the record establishes that harper failed to properly present this argument to the district court,aside from her brief challenging summary t he lake house policy was issued to doe father and crescent parts equipment company.plaintiff brief in opposition to defendant motion for summary judgment.accordingly,because harper failed to properly present the issue to the district court in response to vigilant motion for summary judgment,that issue is waived.see republic tobacco atl.trading,cir quoting arendt vetta sports,cir.
in addition to waiving the argument in the district court,harper also failed to address the issue on appeal aside from stating that t he coverage provided to john employer under the policy would be rendered illusory if it extended only to those meeting the definition now proposed by vigilant insurance company.the argument is more developed in harper reply brief,but this is too little,too late,for a rguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are also waived.james sheah
