in this insurance coverage dispute,westchester fire insurance company westchester filed a declaratory judgment action against douglas wallerich,patrick lowther,and sharon collectively insureds,seeking a determination whether it must provide coverage to the insureds in defending an underlying lawsuit.additionally,westchester sought reimbursement of its expenses paid thus far in defending the underlying lawsuit.in response,the insureds counterclaimed for coverage fees for westchester initial denial of coverage and for attorneys fees in defending the declaratory judgment action.westchester moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted the motion in part,holding that westchester had no duty to defend the insureds in the underlying lawsuit but that westchester was not entitled to reimbursement of its defense costs in the underlying litigation.additionally,the district court sua sponte granted summary judgment to the insureds in the amount of for coverage fees resulting from westchester initial denial of coverage both parties appeal from the district court judgment.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
the insureds formed the partnership jewel of the mississippi,llp jewel partnership with mark fayette,mark wife,shayna fayette,and others,for the purpose of acquiring and developing the jewel nursery property in lake city,minnesota.
the jewel partnership and hale irwin golf properties,llc formed the residences at the jewel,llc the residences to develop the property for commercial and residential use.mark fayette and the insureds,in addition to being investors in the residences,also held various officer and director positions within the residences until its dissolution.shayna fayette was never an officer,director,or employee of the residences.
in his capacity as chief manager of the residences,wallerich filed an application with westchester for a business and management indemnity insurance policy.westchester subsequently issued the policy to the residences.two sections of the policy are relevant to the issues in the instant case the general terms and conditions section and the directors,officers,and company indemnity coverage d o coverage section.
according to the policy,the general terms and conditions apply to each and every coverage section of the policy.the terms and conditions of each coverage section apply only to that coverage section and shall not be construed to apply to any other coverage section.boldface in original.the definitions section of the general terms and conditions explains as follows 
whenever used in this policy,the terms that appear below in boldface type shall have the meanings set forth in this definitions subsection of the general terms and conditions.however,if a term also appears in boldface type in a particular coverage section and is defined in that coverage section,that definition shall apply for purposes of that particular coverage section.terms that appear in boldface in the general terms and conditions but are not defined in this definitions subsection and are defined in other coverage sections of the policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those coverage sections.
boldface in original.the general terms and conditions section also contains a clause dealing with spouses,which provides,in relevant part 
the spouses of natural persons who are insureds shall be considered insureds under this policy provided,however,coverage is afforded to such spouses only for a claim arising solely out of their status as such and,in the case of a spouse where the claim seeks damages from marital community property,jointly held property or property transferred from the natural person who is an insured to the spouse

the insuring clause of the d o coverage section provides 
insurer shall pay the loss of the directors and officers for which the directors and officers are not indemnified by the company and which the directors and officers have become legally obligated to pay by reason of a claim for any wrongful act taking place prior to the end of the policy period.
loss means damages,judgments,settlements,or interest awarded by a court,and costs,charges and expenses incurred by the directors and officers under the insuring clause boldface in original.cost,charges,and expenses means reasonable and necessary legal costs,charges,fees and expenses incurred by any of the insureds in defending claims boldface in original.claim means a civil proceeding against any insured seeking monetary damages,or or injunctive relief,commenced by the service of a complaint or similar pleading boldface in original.wrongful act means any actual or alleged error,omission,misleading statement,misstatement,neglect,breach of duty or act allegedly committed or attempted by any of the directors or officers while acting in their capacity as such boldface in original.the d o section defines insureds as the company and the directors and officers.boldface in original.
the d o coverage section contains an insured insured exclusion,which states that 
insurer shall not be liable for loss under this coverage section on account of any claim 
e brought or maintained by,on behalf of,in the right of,or at the direction of any insured in any capacity,any outside entity or any person or entity that is an owner of or joint venture participant in any subsidiary in any respect and whether or not collusive,unless such claim 
i is brought derivatively by a securities holder of the parent company and is instigated and continued totally independent of,and totally without the solicitation,assistance,active participation of,or intervention of,any insured.

mark and shayna fayette,individually and on behalf of the residences,filed a lawsuit fayette lawsuit in minnesota state court against the insureds,alleging breach of various fiduciary duties in connection with the management and auction of certain residential and commercial properties held by the residences.the insureds timely notified westchester of the lawsuit and sought coverage for their defense.westchester denied coverage and refused to defend the insureds.the insureds then hired counsel,who urged westchester to reconsider its position.thereafter,westchester changed its position,agreeing to defend the insureds against the fayette lawsuit,subject to a full reservation of rights,including the right to withdraw from the insureds defense the right to deny insurance coverage the right to file a declaratory judgment action challenging its obligation to defend the insureds in the fayette lawsuit the right to seek reimbursement of defense expenses in the event that a court found that westchester had no duty to defend the insureds and the right to deny any indemnity obligation.westchester stated in the letter that its offer to advance defense expenses was not an admission of any obligation under the policy.the insureds objected to westchester reservations but accepted its offer to advance defense expenses to them.
westchester then filed a declaratory judgment action in federal district court,seeking a determination that it owed no coverage to the insureds.it also asserted that it was entitled to reimbursement for the fees and costs that it incurred in defending the underlying fayette lawsuit.the insureds counterclaimed for coverage fees incurred as a result of westchester initial denial of coverage and for attorneys fees in defending this declaratory judgment action.westchester then moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the insured insured exclusion in the insurance policy precludes coverage.
the district court granted in part westchester motion for summary judgment.despite finding that shayna fayette was not an insured within the meaning of the policy,the district court ultimately concluded that westchester had no duty to defend or indemnify the insureds in the fayette lawsuit.the court determined that the insured insured exclusion applied because mark a party to the underlying lawsuit.but the court denied westchester motion for summary judgment with respect to its reimbursement claim for defense costs expended in the underlying litigation,finding no agreement to reimbursement in the insurance policy.the district court also sua sponte granted summary judgment to the insureds on their counterclaim for coverage fees,awarding them coverage fees in the amount of.
both westchester and the insureds appeal from the district court judgment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,westchester challenges the district court determinations that shayna fayette is not an insured under the policy westchester is not entitled to reimbursement of defense costs and the insureds are entitled to fees.
the insureds the district court judgment,arguing that the insured insured exclusion does not apply and,as a result,westchester has a duty to defend the insureds in the fayette lawsuit.
whether shayna fayette is an insured 
westchester first argument is that,although the district court correctly held that westchester had no duty to defend the insureds against any portion of the fayette lawsuit,it erroneously found that shayna fayette was not an insured under the policy.westchester maintains that this finding creates the potential for mark and shayna fayette to dismiss their complaint and refile in shayna fayette name alone.
looking to the language of the policy,the district court determined that shayna fayette was not an insured.according to the district court,the d o coverage section defines the term insureds to mean the company and the directors and officers.boldface in original.but the general terms and conditions section states that a spouse is an insured under the policy.as a result,the district court concluded that an ambiguity existed in the policy because the definition of insured is subject to two different meanings.the court noted that the general terms and conditions section states that terms that appear in boldface in the general terms and conditions but are not defined in this definitions subsection and are defined in other coverage sections of the policy shall have the meanings ascribed to them in those coverage sections.boldface in original.the court observed that the term insureds is not defined in the general terms and conditions section instead,it is only defined in the d o coverage section to mean the company and the directors and officers.boldface in original.this definition does not include spouses.as a result,the district court held that because the term insureds is defined in the d o coverage section,meaning that such definition is the only definition applicable to the d o coverage section and its exclusions,shayna fayette is not an insured under the d o policy.
under minnesota law,t he insured bears the burden of demonstrating coverage under an insurance policy.secura supreme ins.if the insured meets this burden,then the insurer must establish the applicability of exclusions.id.a ll exclusions are construed strictly against the insurer.id.internal quotations and citation omitted.
general principles of contract interpretation apply to insurance policies.when the language in an insurance policy is unambiguous,the language must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.id.internal quotations and citations omitted.but if the court finds that the policy language is ambiguous,such ambiguity must be resolved in the insured favor.id.this is done by interpreting the ambiguity in accordance with the reasonable expectations of the insured.id.in deciding whether an ambiguity truly exists in an insurance policy,the court must read the policy as a whole.mutual serv.cas.ins.wilson.the language must be considered within its context,and with common sense.id.if the court concludes that a phrase is subject to two interpretations,one reasonable and the other unreasonable in the context of the policy,the reasonable construction will control and no ambiguity exists.id.
likewise,provisions in an insurance contract must be read and studied independently and in context with all other relevant provisions and the language of the policy as a whole.west bend mut.ins.armstrong.construction of an insurance policy which entirely neutralizes one provision should not be adopted if the contract is susceptible of another construction which gives effect to all of its provisions and is consistent with the general intent.id.
viewing the relevant policy language in context,giving effect to all of the policy provisions,and applying a commonsense construction to such language,we hold that no ambiguity exists in the policy language and that shayna fayette is an insured under the policy.the term insured does appear in boldface type in the general terms and conditions section.the term is not defined in the definitions subsection of the general terms and conditions section.likewise,the estates,legal representatives,and spouses provision appearing in the general terms and conditions section does not define insured but instead advises that t he spouses of natural persons who are insureds shall be considered insureds under this policy boldface in original.thus,this provision does not purport to define the term insured instead,it only explains that spouses are considered insureds under the that term is defined in the relevant coverage section.therefore,as directed by the policy,because the term insured is not defined in the definitions subsection of the general terms and conditions section,the relevant coverage section definition of insured governs.the relevant coverage section is the d o coverage section,which defines an insured as the company and the directors and officers.boldface in original.
applying the d o coverage section definition of insured to the estates,legal representatives,and spouses provision in the general terms and conditions section yields the following result 
the spouses of natural persons who are insureds defined as the company and the directors and officers shall be considered insureds defined as the company and the directors and officers under this policy 
boldface in original.because mark fayette is a director and officer of the residences,he is an insured under the d o policy.in turn,applying the estates,legal representatives,and spouses provision,because shayna fayette is the spouse of mark director and officer who meets the definition of insured under the d o coverage is also considered an insured.this plain language,commonsense interpretation of the policy gives effect to all sections and provisions in the policy.
because both mark fayette and shayna fayette are insureds under the policy,the insured insured exclusion applies because the policy excludes coverage for any claim brought or maintained by,on behalf of,in the right of,or at the direction of any insured in any capacity whether or not collusive boldface in original therefore,westchester has no duty to defend the insureds.as a result,we need not address the question whether the insured insured exclusion applies when the lawsuit involves the presence of both an insured plaintiff and a plaintiff.
whether westchester is entitled to reimbursement of defense costs 
because we conclude that westchester has no duty to defend the insureds,we must necessarily determine whether westchester is entitled to reimbursement of defense costs expended in the fayette lawsuit.
the question whether insurers have a right to obtain reimbursement from insureds for funds advanced toward defense of uncovered claims has not been addressed by minnesota state appellate courts.westchester marshals four arguments urging us to conclude that minnesota courts,like most state courts,would allow reimbursement.westchester first asserts that,under minnesota law,an insurer duty to defend is less broad than in some states.insurers in minnesota are not obligated to defend whenever coverage is merely arguable based upon a policy interpretation dispute.second,westchester maintains that insurers reimbursement rights stem from equitable legal principles and not contract terms.reimbursement,by definition,is only available for the defense of uncovered claims.third,westchester states that minnesota federal courts have reached conflicting results with respect to insurers reimbursement rights under minnesota law and that the decisions recognize a right of reimbursement because it is most consistent with minnesota law.finally,westchester argues that minnesota general contract and insurance law is most compatible with the equitable theories that underpin insurers unilateral reimbursement rights,particularly in cases such as this one in which the insurer did not owe anything under the policy.
nationally,courts are split as to whether an insurer may bring a cause of action against an insured for attorneys fees and costs expended defending the insured in a different matter.star indem.port,d,citing perdue farms,travelers cas.sur.of,cir acknowledging that jurisdictions differ on the soundness of an insurer right to reimbursement of defense costs.
n umerous courts recognize an insurer right to reimbursement of defense fees paid where it is determined that the insurer had no duty to defend.indeed,many cases refer to this holding as the majority position.westport ins.ong,dak,wl,at,slip op.citing paul fire marine ins.compaq,cir applying texas law united ins.sst fitness,cir applying ohio law envirotech,united capitol,cir unpublished resure,chem,applying new mexico law paul mercury ins.med.lab.network,jim black transcon.ins,so d,travelers cas.sur.ribi immunochem,sec.ins.of hartford lumbermens mut.cas,buss superior court,cal th,d,cal.
courts that recognize such claims for reimbursement of defense costs generally do so under a theory,allowing recovery to prevent unjust enrichment.star indem,d at.the seminal case allowing reimbursement is buss in that case,the california supreme court affirmed a ruling that an insurer that issued a standard commercial general liability insurance policy has a right of reimbursement of defense costs for claims not even potentially covered under its policy,explaining that 
under the policy,the insurer does not have a duty to defend the insured as to the claims that are not even potentially covered.with regard to defense costs for these claims,the insurer has not been paid premiums by the insured.it did not bargain to bear these costs.to attempt to shift them would not upset the arrangement.the insurer therefore has a right of reimbursement that is implied in law as,whether or not it has one that is implied in fact in the policy as contractual.as stated,under the law of restitution such a right runs against the person who benefits from unjust enrichment and in favor of the person who suffers loss thereby.the enrichment of the insured by the insurer through the insurer bearing of defense costs is inconsistent with the insurer freedom under the policy and therefore must be deemed unjust.it is like the case of a and b.a has a contractual duty to pay b.he has only a bill.he may be held to have a prophylactic duty to tender the note.but he surely has a right,implied in law if not in fact,to get back.even if the policy language were unclear,the hypothetical insured could not have an objectively reasonable expectation that it was entitled to what would in fact be a windfall.
d,at internal citation omitted.in a related footnote,the court further explained 
that the insurer does not have a right of reimbursement express in the policy does not mean that it does not have one implied in law.rather,that it has an right helps explain why it does not have an one.the former renders the latter unnecessary.this is proved by the fact that,with an right and without an one,insurers have sought,and obtained,have done so,on the evidence of reported decisions,for much more than a decade.to be sure,an express right could have been introduced into the policy.but that it was not is not dispositive.
id.at internal citations omitted.
according to the buss court,in order to obtain a reimbursement of defense costs,an insurer must reserve its rights on this basis.it is not necessary that the insured agree with the insurer reservation of rights to obtain a reimbursement of defense costs for it to be valid b ecause the right is the insurer alone,it may be reserved by it unilaterally.id.at.
in contrast to buss and the courts relying on its rationale,the most recent decisions reflect the minority position.westport,wl,at.these courts have refused to recognize claims by insurers for reimbursement of defense costs expended under a unilateral reservation of rights,absent a provision for such reimbursement in the insurance policy.star indem,d at citing terra nova ins,bar,cir w e believe,the pennsylvania supreme court would preclude an insurer who provides a defense under reservation of rights from recovering the cost of that defense from its insured if it is later determined that there is no coverage.perdue farms,at holding that,under maryland law,the insurer had no right to reimbursement for defense costs attributable to claims liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,cir holding that an insurer was not entitled to reimbursement of defense costs expended prior to the court determination that there was no duty to defend la weight loss,lexington ins,wl,at,holding that an insurer could not sustain a claim for restitution of costs defending uncovered claims based on an unjust enrichment theory agents ins.of,midwest sporting goods,we refuse to permit an insurer to recover defense costs pursuant to a reservation of rights absent an express provision to that effect in the insurance contract between the parties.shoshone first bank pac.employers ins,wy there is no indication in the policy of any distinction to be made between covered and claims so far as the defense of those claims is concerned,and we will not permit the policy to be modified by subsequent letters from the insurer to the insured.courts disallowing such claims for reimbursement generally reason that an insured is not unjustly enriched when an insurer agrees to defend against uncovered claims under a reservation of rights.id.at.
the third circuit explained its reasoning for rejecting a right of reimbursement,stating 
a rule permitting such recovery would be inconsistent with the legal principles that induce an insurer offer to defend under reservation of rights.faced with uncertainty as to its duty to indemnify,an insurer offers a defense under reservation of rights to avoid the risks that an inept or lackadaisical defense of the underlying action may expose it to if it turns out there is a duty to indemnify.at the same time,the insurer wishes to preserve its right to contest the duty to indemnify if the defense is unsuccessful.thus,such an offer is made at least as much for the insurer own benefit as for the insured.if the insurer could recover defense costs,the insured would be required to pay for the insurer action in protecting itself against the estoppel to deny coverage that would be implied if it undertook the defense without reservation.
terra nova,at predicting that pennsylvania law would preclude an insurer that tenders a defense under a reservation of rights and is later deemed to owe no duty to defend from recovering such defense costs from the insured.
more recently,the illinois supreme court also rejected a right of reimbursement,explaining 
w e can not say that an insured is unjustly enriched when its insurer tenders a defense in order to protect its own interests,even if it is later determined that the insurer did not owe a defense.certainly,if an insurer wishes to retain its right to seek reimbursement of defense costs in the event it later is determined that the underlying claim is not covered by the policy,the insurer is free to include such a term in its insurance contract.absent such a provision in the policy,however,an insurer can not later attempt to amend the policy by including the right to reimbursement in its reservation of rights letter.
conflicting decisions exist within this circuit district courts as to whether a right to reimbursement for insurers exists under minnesota law.compare knapp commonwealth,with employers mut.cas.indus.rubber,no.civ,wl.
in knapp,a diversity case governed by minnesota law,an insurer sought reimbursement of attorneys fees and costs for defense under a reservation of rights where there was no coverage or duty to defend.at.the district court acknowledged that minnesota has not before determined whether or not an insurer may be reimbursed for attorney fees and costs,when it has been determined that no coverage exists and the insurer undertook the defense under a reservation of rights letter.id.in granting summary judgment to the insurer on its right to reimbursement,the district court held 
the insured offers little to dissuade this court from following those courts that have recognized the rights of insurers to seek reimbursement for its attorney fees and costs under certain circumstances.california law is persuasive and consistent with earlier minnesota cases addressing the responsibility of an insurer to meet its duty to defend first and challenge policy coverage questions later.the courts should be consistent in encouraging insurance companies to properly meet their duty to defend its insured against third party claims and minimize unnecessary claims to enforce policy coverage.however,where an insurer has properly met its duty and subsequently successfully challenges policy coverage,it should be entitled to the full benefit of such a challenge and be reimbursed for the benefits it bestowed,in good faith,to its insured.
id.at internal citation omitted.the court also addressed the insured argument that insurance companies are not allowed to require their insured to pay defense costs by unilaterally sending reservation of rights letters unless there is an agreement or understanding with the insured.id.the court rejected this argument,finding that the language contained in the letter sufficiently and specifically reserved the right to seek reimbursement of litigation expenses,finding that the insurer clearly indicated its desire to reserve its right to later seek reimbursement for attorney fees and costs.id.according to the court,the insured silence in response to the insurer reservations of rights letter,and subsequent acceptance of the defense provided by the insurer,constitutes an implied agreement to the reservation of rights.id.
in contrast,in employers mutual,the same district court,sitting in diversity and applying minnesota law,held that no right of reimbursement exists.wl,at.relying on a decision from this court issued after knapp,the district court stated 
in liberty mutual,the court determined that the absolute pollution exclusion barred coverage.at.in light of the court finding of no coverage,the insurer argued it was entitled to reimbursement of all defense costs paid.applying missouri law,the court noted 
although the parties disputed whether the claims were excluded from coverage by operation of the pollution exclusion clause,any uncertainty as to such coverage should be resolved in the insured favor.therefore the insurer remained obligated to defend the insured so long as there remained any question as to whether the underlying claims were covered by the policies.upon such determination that the claims were excluded from coverage,the district court properly concluded that the insurer duty to defend the insured in this action expired.because we conclude that the insurer had a duty to defend the insured until such determination was made,we reject the insurer argument that it is entitled to reimbursement of defense costs.id.at.
see also agents,at court held it would follow the minority rule which refuses to permit an insurer to recover defense costs pursuant to a reservation of rights absent an express provision to that effect in the insurance contract.
while the eighth circuit decision in liberty mutual was made pursuant to the law of missouri as to the scope of the duty to defend,this court recognizes that minnesota law has interpreted the duty to defend consistent with missouri interpretation.see brown state auto.casualty underwriters,duty to defend triggered when any part of the claim arguably falls within coverage of policy.this court will therefore follow the reasoning of the eighth circuit in liberty mutual and find an insurer is not entitled to the reimbursement of defense costs expended prior to the determination of coverage,unless specifically provided for in the insurance policy.
in this case,employers did include in its reservation of rights letter a right to seek reimbursement of defense costs.however,irp did not explicitly respond to this reservation,and the cgl policy is silent as to employers right to seek reimbursement.accordingly,the court will deny employers request for reimbursement of defense costs expended prior to the date of this order.
as noted supra,the district court in employers mutual relied on this court holding in liberty mutual in reversing its prior position in knapp.in liberty mutual,the district court had determined that although the insurer had an initial duty to defend the insured,such a duty expired upon the determination that the claims against the insured were excluded from coverage by operation of an exclusion clause in the underlying policies.at.before this court,the insurer argued that it had no initial duty to defend the insured and that it was entitled to reimbursement of all defense costs paid.id.this court rejected that argument,holding that,under missouri law,the liability insurer remained obligated to defend insured so long as there remained any question as to whether the underlying claims were covered by the policies.id.
in contrast,this court,applying texas law,has held that an insured entered into a binding agreement that allowed the insurer to reserve the right to recoup defense costs in exchange for the insurer agreement to forgo its right to veto the insured choice of defense counsel.paul fire marine,at.in paul,the insurer provided liability insurance to the insured.id.at.after the insured was sued,the insurer sent a letter to the insured,agreeing to defend the insured pursuant to the policy but reserving its right to deny liability under the policy upon any subsequent determination that the underlying lawsuit was not covered.id.the letter also expressed concern that the insured was retaining defense counsel without the insurer approval in violation of the terms of the policy.id.thereafter,the insurer sent a letter to the insured,recognizing that the insured had continued to retain three law firms of its choice to defend the suit without the insurer approval.id.after reiterating its rights under the policy to veto the insured choice of defense counsel and to pay no defense costs which were unreasonable,the insurer stated its desire to cooperate with the insured to allow the insured to retain its choice of defense counsel.id.the insurer repeated its earlier reservation of rights to deny all coverage and,in addition,specifically reserved a right to recover any defense costs paid to the insured in the event that the insurer later determined that the claim was not covered.id.the letter concluded by asking the insured for confirmation that it accepted the offered defense of the underlying claim.id.no official acceptance occurred,but the insured continued to employ its chosen counsel and began accepting payments from the insurer.id.
on appeal,we found that the insurer conduct was not unilateral and that texas law failed to address the situation where the insurer agrees to relinquish another right it has under the policy in return for the reservation of the right to recover.id.at.the insurer letter contained an offer to forgo its right under the policy to veto the insured choice of counsel if the insured would agree to reduced coverage of defense costs and to the insurer reservation of the right to reimbursement of those defense costs upon a subsequent determination that the policy did not cover the claim.id.according to this court,the insured 
could have dismissed the three firms it had hired and chosen a firm acceptable to the insurer,as required by the policy which would have entitled the insured to coverage of percent of its reasonable defense costs.in that case,any attempt by the insurer to assert a reservation of rights would have lacked the element of mutual promises necessary to create a bilateral agreement.
id.internal quotations and citation omitted.but the insured,by continuing to employ its chosen counsel while accepting the insurer partial defense,accepted the insurer offer and created a supplement
