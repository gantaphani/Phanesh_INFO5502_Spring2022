when a primary insurer against tort liability refuses to settle and then loses at trial for amounts greater than its coverage limits,what recourse does an excess insurer have against the primary insurer this case involves the issue of whether,under kentucky law,an excess insurer can recover against a primary insurer pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation,either for the primary insurer failure in good faith to settle a claim or for the primary insurer failure to investigate whether an insured has other insurance.
the excess insurer in this case,national surety corporation,argues that the primary insurer,hartford casualty insurance company,acted in bad faith by failing to settle a tort claim against their mutual insured,sufix,and thereby exposed sufix to excess liability national surety seeks to step into sufix shoes,pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation,to assert this claim.national surety also seeks to assert a claim against hartford for hartford failure to discover that sufix was insured by national surety.the district court held that national surety did not have a cause of action under kentucky law,and accordingly granted hartford motion to dismiss.
we reverse the district court order because the supreme court of kentucky would likely recognize a cause of action in this case.kentucky law already permits an insured to sue a primary insurer for bad faith failure to settle a claim.kentucky law also recognizes the doctrine of equitable subrogation,which permits an insurance company to step into the shoes of the insured and recover what the insured would have been able to recover against a tortfeasor.combining these two principles to allow an excess insurer to recover from a primary insurer is a logical extension of these principles and furthers kentucky policy goals of encouraging fair and reasonable settlements and preventing third parties from profiting from an insured insurance coverage.however,the district court order properly dismissed national surety claim because an insured does not have a cause of action under kentucky law against its insurer for failing to discover an insured other sources of insurance.
national surety complaint alleges the following facts,which this court must accept as true,evans pearson,cir.hartford and national surety both issued insurance policies to sufix hartford policy provided million in primary liability coverage and national surety policy provided million in excess liability coverage.on or about may,a weed trimmer manufactured by sufix injured tommy cook when the trimmer broke apart while cook was using it.
in may of,cook filed suit against sufix in jefferson circuit court,alleging that the weed trimmer was defectively designed and that sufix was grossly negligent in failing to discover the defect.hartford assumed the defense of sufix pursuant to its insurance contract.hartford,through its attorneys,engaged in settlement negotiations with cook,and ultimately rejected cook offer to settle for the limits of hartford policy,million.
national surety did not receive notice of cook action against sufix from sufix or hartford until approximately two weeks before trial.national surety alleges that because of the lack of timely notice,it was unable to evaluate effectively its exposure to cook under the excess policy,unable to evaluate cook settlement demand,not given the opportunity to participate in or direct the preparations for the trial,and unable to engage in informed settlement negotiations with cook.
on may,a jury found sufix liable to cook and awarded cook.after the trial,national surety assumed the defense of sufix and brought an unsuccessful appeal to the court of appeals of kentucky.
on february,national surety filed suit against hartford in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky.national surety sued hartford for breach of contract and for violation of the duty of good faith.national surety asserted in its complaint that hartford failed t o perform an adequate investigation of the allegations that form the basis of the civil action,failed t o provide sufix with an adequate and competent defense of the allegations contained in the civil action,and failed t o settle claims against sufix within its policy limits so as not to expose sufix and its assets to an excess judgment.national surety claimed that it is subrogated to sufix pursuant to the terms of the excess policy and the doctrine of equitable subrogation.hartford filed a motion to dismiss,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,on the grounds that kentucky does not recognize the right of excess insurers to sue primary insurers in a situation like this one.
the district court granted hartford motion to dismiss.sur.hartford cas.ins,d.the district court predicted that the kentucky supreme court would not recognize a cause of action by an excess insurer against a primary insurer pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation,even though such a rule had been adopted by the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions to have considered the issue.id.at.first,the district court observed that the kentucky court of appeals refused to recognize the theory of equitable subrogation in a similar situation,where an excess insurer sought to sue an insured defense counsel for malpractice.id.at referring to am.cont l ins.weber rose.the court noted that weber rose is the strongest indicator of how the kentucky courts would rule in the case at bar.id.the court reasoned that,as in weber rose,allowing recovery against the primary insurer would threaten the integrity of the settlement process by allowing the excess carriers,who were not involved in those underlying negotiations,to the judgment of the primary insurer representatives.id.at.
second,the district court concluded that kentucky would not follow the jurisdictions that have adopted the rule advocated by national surety because excess insurers do not suffer an injury when a primary insurer,in bad faith,fails to settle a claim within its policy limits.id.at.the district court reasoned that the excess insurer,national surety,has received a premium in exchange for assuming the risk of an excess judgment and therefore suffered no wrong,while the insured,sufix,who has been fully indemnified,has suffered no loss.id.at.the district court supported this reasoning with several hypotheticals.id.at.finally,the district court refuted the argument that failing to adopt the majority rule would raise excess insurance premium costs by raising the countervailing likelihood that adopting the majority rule would raise primary insurance premiums,thereby ultimately distributing costs unfairly.id.at.
in resolving an issue of state law in a diversity case,this court must make the best prediction,even in the absence of direct state court precedent,of what the kentucky supreme court would do if it were confronted with the same question of law.managed health care,kethan,cir quoting welsh united states,cir.because kentucky law and policy support the majority rule that an excess insurer may recover against a primary insurer under the doctrine of equitable subrogation,and arguments to the contrary are not persuasive,the kentucky supreme court would likely recognize the rule asserted by national surety in this case.
the kentucky supreme court would likely adopt the majority rule because that rule naturally follows from two other kentucky insurance rules that an insured may sue an insurer who,in bad faith,fails to settle a claim within policy limits,and that an insurer may step into the shoes of the insured,pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation.in addition,the majority rule furthers kentucky policies of encouraging fair and reasonable settlements and preventing wrongdoers from piggybacking on an insured insurance.
kentucky law permits an insured to sue a primary insurer that,in bad faith,fails to settle a claim.under kentucky law,the insurance contract between an insured and insurer contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.manchester ins.indem.grundy.the insured has a cause of action against the insurer if the insurer,in bad faith,fails to settle a claim within the policy limits.id.at.kentucky follows the general rule that damages recoverable for a wrong are not diminished by the fact that the injured party has been wholly or partly indemnified for his loss by insurance to whose procurement the wrongdoer did not contribute.taylor jennison.in the instant case,even though sufix had excess insurance,and thus was compensated for the entire verdict against it,sufix still had a cause of action against hartford.
kentucky also recognizes the doctrine of equitable subrogation.although kentucky courts note that equitable subrogation should be strictly limited in its application,united pac.ins.first bank of prestonsburg,the courts recognize that equitable subrogation has a long and rich tradition of benevolence and fairness,and is irrevocably anchored in principles of natural justice.wine globe am.cas,citations omitted.equitable subrogation is designed to prevent unjust enrichment by requiring those who benefited from another paying their debt to ultimately pay it themselves.id.the rule,as applied in the insurance context,allows an insurer to sue a third party for injuries that the third party caused to the insured,when the insurer compensated the insured for those injuries.see,employers mut.liability ins.griffin constr,ohio cas.ins.vermeer,d.for example,if a negligently runs over b with his car,b insurer can sue a if b insurer compensated b for her injuries.
considering these two principles together leads to the conclusion that an excess insurer is permitted to step into the shoes of the insured and sue a primary insurer pursuant to the doctrine of equitable subrogation to enforce the primary insurer duty to avoid excessive judgments against an insured.the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions that have considered the issue in this case have adopted such a rule only alabama and idaho adhere to the minority position.see fed.ins.travelers cas.sur,so d,stonewall surplus lines ins.farmers ins.of idaho,idaho.
the majority rule encourages the fair and reasonable settlement of lawsuits.see,am.centennial ins.canal ins.absent a rule permitting excess insurers to recover against primary insurers,primary insurers could,in bad faith,fail to accept settlement offers at or near policy limits with impunity.the supreme court of michigan,for instance,reasoned that the majority rule discourag es primary carriers from gambling with the excess carrier money when potential judgments approach the primary insurer policy limits.commercial union ins.medical protective.for example,suppose in this case that hartford estimated that,if cook case against sufix went to trial,there was a chance that cook would lose,and a chance that cook would win a jury verdict of million.the weighted expectation of liability for going to trial would have been million x million x and cook settlement offer of million would have been a great bargain.however,hartford would have had to pay only million if cook won and if cook lost,for a weighted expectation of liability on hartford part of x million x.thus,it would have been in hartford best interest to go to trial because the economic risk of going to trial did not fall completely on hartford therefore,in the absence of the majority rule,there is a potential that a primary insurer will forgo fair and reasonable settlements and roll the dice with,what is in essence,the excess insurer money.
such hypotheticals can not be disposed of with the observation that they fail to take into account the litigation costs incurred by the insurer when the case goes to trial.although the presence of litigation costs diminishes the incentive an insurer has to go to trial,the underlying problem still remains.for example,in the above hypothetical,suppose that if the case went to trial,hartford would have incurred in litigation costs.then the total weighted expected cost of going to trial would have been million.but hartford would have had to pay million if cook won and if cook lost,for a weighted expected cost of.thus,it still would have been in hartford interest to go to trial.
similarly,kentucky law values the fair and reasonable settlement of lawsuits.the kentucky courts have repeatedly stated that t he law always looks with favor upon an agreement between two or more persons who,to avoid a lawsuit,amicably settle their differences on such terms as to them seem fair and reasonable.dexter duncan,accord childs hamilton.this principle also applies in the insurance context.for example,kentucky unfair claims settlement practices act prohibits persons in the business of entering into insurance contracts from n ot attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt,fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonable clear.ann.lexisnexis.
in addition,the majority rule goal of preventing a primary insurer from,in bad faith,failing to settle a claim comports with kentucky insurance policy goals.as discussed above,a primary insurer has an incentive to fail to settle a claim within its policy limits even though the settlement offer is objectively fair and reasonable.although the insured has a cause of action against a primary insurer who fails to settle in good faith,when the insured has excess insurance,the insured has little incentive to sue because the harm of the primary insurer refusal to settle falls completely on the excess insurer.see,twin city fire ins,at.the reason why kentucky law permits an insured to sue a wrongdoer despite the fact that the insured is indemnified for his loss is because there is no logical or legal reason why a wrongdoer should receive the benefit of insurance obtained by the injured party for his own protection.taylor,at.this policy applies as strongly when an insured has excess insurance and favors adoption of the majority rule because otherwise a wrongdoer the primary insurer who fails to settle in good faith would receive the benefit of the insured excess insurance.
adopting the rule that excess insurers can sue primary insurers in cases like this does not,as argued,conflict with the kentucky court of appeals decision in american continental insurance weber rose.in weber rose,the kentucky court of appeals held that an excess insurer can not sue an insured defense counsel for malpractice under the theory of equitable subordination,relying on the kentucky courts duty to protect,encourage,and preserve the traditional relationship.at.permitting such suits would be inimical to the preservation of traditional and longstanding concepts associated with relationship,as recognized by kentucky law.id.at.assuming that the kentucky supreme court would agree with the court of appeals,that holding does not foreclose the possibility that the kentucky supreme court would permit excess insurers to sue primary insurers for breach of their good faith obligation to insureds.the latter obligation is one that is outside of the relationship,which was the central basis for the court of appeals holding in weber rose.also,other jurisdictions have permitted these two rules to coexist.see paul ins.afia worldwide ins,cir holding that although louisiana law permitted an excess insurer to sue a primary insurer under a subrogation theory,louisiana law did not permit the excess insurer to sue the insured counsel am.employers ins.med.protective,holding that an excess insurer could not sue an insured defense attorney for legal malpractice under the doctrine of equitable subrogation,notwithstanding the fact that michigan permitted excess insurers to bring claims against primary insurers,abrogated by atlanta int l ins.bell,permitting excess insurer to sue defense attorney.there is no reason why the kentucky supreme court would fail to impose a duty upon primary insurers in this case in light of the kentucky policy reasons in favor of such a duty.
other concerns with adoption of the majority rule do not,in the end,provide persuasive reasons for kentucky to reject it.it is not enough to say,for instance,that an excess insurer premiums reflect the possibility that a primary insurer would,in bad faith,fail to settle a claim.such an argument proves too much it would do away with equitable subrogation altoget
