the issue presented by this case is whether,under hawaii law,a company which contracted to build a house is covered under its commercial general liability policy against claims brought against the company by the dissatisfied homeowners.the district court granted summary judgment to the insurer on the ground that claims for breach of contract and breach of tort duties did not give rise to coverage within the scope of the policy.we affirm.
background 
oceanic design construction,a hawaii corporation,contracted to build a residence in honolulu,hawaii for homeowners jeanette chae,susan woo,and diana han diana chong collectively the homeowners.construction was completed,but not to the satisfaction of the homeowners,and they refused to pay.oceanic filed suit against the homeowners in hawaii state court in april,alleging the homeowners had breached the contract by failing to pay the balance due.see oceanic design,jeanette chae,et,civil,circuit court of the first circuit,state of hawaii the underlying lawsuit.
the homeowners asserted a counterclaim against oceanic in that lawsuit,alleging five causes of action breach of contract breach of express and implied warranties deceptive trade practices negligent intentional infliction of emotional distress upon homeowner han and punitive damages.the gravamen of the homeowners allegations was that oceanic improperly designed constructed the foundation of the residence causing earth movement and resulting in physical and structural damage to both the residence and the retaining walls on the property.
at the time the counterclaim was filed,oceanic was the named insured under a commercial general liability cgl insurance policy issued by burlington insurance company coverage a of the policy,titled bodily injury and property damage liability,provided that burlington will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.the policy further provided that burlington has the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages,but no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages to which this insurance does not apply.coverage was limited to bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.the policy defined o ccurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,but did not define accident.coverage was excluded for bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
oceanic timely tendered defense of the counterclaim to burlington.burlington agreed to defend under a reservation of rights.burlington then filed this action in the district court seeking a declaration that the cgl policy did not provide coverage against the homeowners counterclaim.
burlington moved for summary judgment,arguing that none of the allegations in the counterclaim were covered under the policy.oceanic filed a for summary judgment,asserting that it was entitled to a defense from burlington because there was a possibility that one or more of the allegations in the counterclaim were covered under the policy.the district court concluded that the claims alleged in the counterclaim were contract or tort claims not within the scope of coverage of the cgl policy accordingly,the district court granted burlington motion for summary judgment and denied oceanic for summary judgment.
oceanic timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo a district court decision to grant summary judgment and apply the same summary judgment standard employed by the district court.united states city of tacoma,cir.therefore,we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to oceanic,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.id.the district court interpretation of state law is reviewed under the same de novo standard that is used to review questions of federal law.conestoga servs.executive risk,cir.
to the extent this case raises issues of first impression,our court,sitting in diversity,must use its best judgment to predict how the hawaii supreme court would decide the issue.helfand gerson,cir.in so doing,a federal court may be aided by looking to decisions from other jurisdictions.takahashi loomis armored car,cir.
hawaii insurance law provides for a broad duty to defend arising whenever the pleadings raise a potential for indemnification liability of the insurer to the insured.hawaiian holiday macadamia nut indus.indem,haw.the duty to defend exists irrespective of whether the insurer is ultimately found not liable to the insured and is based on the possibility for coverage,even if remote,determined at the time suit is filed.see commerce indus.ins.bank of hawaii,haw.furthermore,where a suit raises a potential for indemnification liability of the insurer to the insured,the insurer has a duty to accept the defense of the entire suit even though other claims of the complaint fall outside the policy coverage.hawaiian holiday,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
hawaii adheres to the complaint allegation rule.pancakes of hawaii,pomare props,app.the focus is on the alleged claims and facts.the duty to defend is limited to situations where the pleadings have alleged claims for relief which fall within the terms for coverage of the insurance contract.where pleadings fail to allege any basis for recovery within the coverage clause,the insurer has no obligation to defend.hawaiian holiday,at citation omitted.in hawaii,the terms of an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to their plain,ordinary,and accepted sense in common speech.dairy road partners island ins.each policy is to be interpreted according to the entirety of its terms and conditions.see aig hawaii ins.estate of caraang,haw.all doubts as to whether a duty to defend exists are resolved against the insurer and in favor of the insured.dairy road partners,at citation and quotation marks omitted.
both parties have acknowledged that there are no genuine issues of material fact.we are therefore asked to decide whether any of the claims asserted against oceanic by the homeowners in the underlying lawsuit are covered under the policy to trigger burlington duty to defend.
the policy covers claims for liability for bodily injury or property damage if caused by an occurrence.because burlington has conceded for purposes of appeal that the counterclaim has alleged both bodily injury and property damage,we must decide whether,under hawaii law,any of the homeowners allegations present the possibility that their damages were caused by an occurrence,for which there is coverage under the policy.
homeowners negligent breach of contract allegation 
oceanic argues that the policy potentially covers the other acts claim asserted in paragraph l of the homeowners counterclaim.that claim reads in context 
first cause of action 
breach of contract 
homeowners contracted with oceanic on or about december,for the construction and supervision of the poola street residence.
in consideration of the services described above,oceanic was paid certain sums of money.
oceanic breached its contractual obligations in at least the following respects 
failure to properly plan,supervise,inspect,and construct the poola street residence,including but not limited to the retaining walls and the preparation of the soils foundation of the residence 
failure to ensure that said poola street residence was free from faults and defects 
planned,designed,engineered,and constructed a structure which was unable to support foreseeable loads 
planned,designed,engineered,and constructed a structure which was susceptible to water and earth movement damage 
violated applicable state of hawaii,county of honolulu uniform building codes,ordinances,laws and regulations 
planned,designed,engineered,and constructed a residence and sic substantially inferior to the standard of care and quality which had been agreed 
identified for use or allowed to be used,improper construction materials,techniques and methods 
failure to use reasonable care in performing contractual obligations appropriate for this type of construction in this particular location 
failure to provide services in accordance with the standard of care appropriate for the plan,design,engineering,supervision,inspection and construction of this type of residence in this particular location 
breached the implied warranty of merchantability for services rendered 
proposed inadequate,improper and negligent plans,designs,specifications and related revisions thereto 
committed other acts and omissions amounting to misfeasance,malfeasance and nonfeasance.
as a direct,proximate and foreseeable result of oceanic breaches of contract,homeowners have suffered substantial damage 
as a direct and further result of the breaches of contract by the oceanic.homeowners have sustained consequential damages 
emphasis added.
relying on a line of cases from the district of hawaii,the district court held that burlington did not owe oceanic a duty to defend the homeowners other acts allegation.those cases hold that contract and tort claims are not within the scope of cgl policies.see cim ins.midpac auto,d,cim ins.masamitsu,d,wdc venture hartford accident and indem.
oceanic asserts that the district court erred because allegations of negligence,even alongside allegations of a breach of contract,are sufficient to raise a duty to defend.
we note at the outset that the hawaii supreme court has not resolved whether a claim for a negligent breach of contract can constitute an occurrence under a cgl policy.the hawaii supreme court has held,however,that where an underlying complaint alleges an intentional breach of contract,there is no occurrence that triggers an insurer duty to defend under a standard cgl policy.see hawaiian holiday,at.in that case,prompted by a failed business venture,plaintiffs filed suit alleging that the insured had purposely planted fewer trees than that had been agreed upon in the contract and had planted trees and seedlings which did not meet contract requirements.as here,the issue was whether the alleged damage was caused by an occurrence under the policy the hawaii supreme court noted that it had previously addressed what constitutes an accident i n order for the insurer to owe a duty to defend or indemnify,the injury can not be the expected or reasonably foreseeable result of the insured own intentional acts or omissions.id.at citing aig hawaii ins,at.
in holding that the insurer had no duty to defend,the court recognized that the plaintiffs complaint alleged breach of contract and fraud claims based on intentional acts performed by hawaiian holiday and sought contractual relief.id.at.the court held that because the conduct alleged was not accidental and did not sound in negligence,it did not constitute an occurrence within the meaning of the cgl policy.id.at.the court did not discuss whether facts alleging a negligent breach of contract claim could trigger the duty to defend.
language from a recent hawaii supreme court case indicates,however,that hawaii would not recognize a claim for a negligent breach of contract.in francis lee,an employee filed suit in hawaii state court for tortious breach of an employment contract after he had been terminated.after the case was removed to the federal district court,the district court certified the following question to the hawaii supreme court does hawaii law recognize a tortious breach of contract cause of action in the employment context 
to answer that question,the court first turned to its prior decisions.it recognized that in dold outrigger hotel,haw,it had established the rule that where a contract is breached in a wanton or reckless manner so as to result in a tortious injury,the aggrieved person is entitled to recover in tort.francis,at quoting dold,at quotation marks omitted.the court also noted it had reaffirmed and extended the dold rule to the commercial contract setting in chung kaonohi center,haw.francis,at.we do not think that the dispositive factor in allowing damages for emotional distress is the nature of the contract.the dispositive factor is,rather,the wanton or reckless nature of the breach.quoting chung,at quotation marks omitted 
nonetheless,the court concluded that the rule should not apply in the employment context,and abolished the rule altogether.id.at.the court reasoned,the rule unnecessarily blurs the distinction undermines the discrete theories of recovery relevant and contract law.id.the court noted that t he distinction between tort and contract law is well established in common law,and distinct objectives underlie the remedies created in each area.id.it recognized that the court objective in contract law is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the parties,whereas tort law is primarily designed to vindicate social policy.id.the court thus concluded that because contract damages are normally limited to those within the contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into or at least reasonably foreseeable by the parties at the time,damages for emotional distress are generally not recoverable in contract.id.at,citation and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.
as to the certified question,the court accordingly answered it in the negative.it stated we now hold that hawaii law will not allow tort recovery in the absence of conduct that violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law and transcends the breach of the contract.id.at.
the hawaii supreme court has also cautioned of the need to examine carefully a complaint to ensure that plaintiffs could not,through artful pleading,bootstrap the availability of insurance coverage under an insured defendant policy by purporting to state a claim for negligence based on facts that,in reality,reflected manifestly intentional,rather than negligent conduct.dairy road partners,at see also bayudan tradewind ins.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that the homeowners other acts allegation can not be read to constitute an occurrence under hawaii law.as the district court explained,t he allegations of other acts and omissions is clearly and unambiguously included as one of several sub allegations of the homeowners breach of contract claim.as a result,the court can not fairly construe this language to state a separate independent cause of action for negligence.in hawaii,it is well established that a cause of action founded on negligence requires an assertion that a defendant has breached a duty or obligation,recognized by the law,requiring the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct,for the protection of others against unreasonable risks.dairy road partners,at citations omitted.
though certain allegations in the homeowners counterclaim are couched in terms of negligence,it is undisputed that oceanic had entered into a contract to construct a home for the homeowners.the counterclaim then alleges that oceanic breached its contractual duty by constructing a residence substantially inferior to the standard of care and quality which had been agreed.other than a breach of that contractual duty,the facts in this case do not reflect a breach of an independent duty that would otherwise support a negligence claim.in hawaii,an occurrence can not be the expected or reasonably foreseeable result of the insured own intentional acts or omissions.hawaiian holiday macadamia nut,at citing aig hawaii ins,at.if oceanic breached its contractual duty by constructing a substandard home,then facing a lawsuit for that breach is a reasonably foreseeable result.our reading comports with the rationale underlying a cgl policy 
general liability policies are not designed to provide contractors and developers with coverage against claims their work is inferior or defective.the risk of replacing and repairing defective materials or poor workmanship has generally been considered a commercial risk which is not passed on to the liability insurer.rather liability coverage comes into play when the insured defective materials or work cause injury to property other than the insured own work or products.
anthem,pac.employers ins,cir.allowing recovery for disputes between parties in a contractual relationship over the quality of work performed would convert this cgl policy into a professional liability policy or a performance bond.
likewise,our holding is consistent with the line of cases from the district of hawaii that hold that contract and tort claims are not within the scope of cgl policies under hawaii law.in wdc venture hartford accident and indem,the district court considered whether,under hawaii law,claims for breach of contract and tortious breach of contract were within the scope of coverage under a cgl.noting that there are no cases in hawaii that are directly on point regarding the issue of insurance recovery for claims,the court looked to case law from other jurisdictions.id.at.the court first looked to california law,which at the time held that a cgl policy did not cover contractual claims or tort claims arising from contractual relationships.the court then concluded,i t is clear from the record that all of the claims in the underlying actions have a contractual basis since the insured seeks recovery here for tort and contract claims that arise from the contractual relationship,the court finds that the underlying lawsuits are outside the scope of policy coverage in this case.id.at citing stanford ranch,maryland cas.emphasis in original.
as a second basis for its holding,the court explained 
p olicy coverage of such allegations would be contrary to public policy.there is simply no reason to expect that such liability would be covered under a comprehensive liability policy which has,as its genesis,the purpose of protecting an individual or entity from liability for essentially accidental injury to another individual,or property damage to another possessions,even if,perhaps,coverage of the policy has been expanded to cover other injuries that sound in tort.
id.at quoting toombs nj aetna cas.sur.
in a subsequent case from the district of hawaii,cim ins.masamitsu,d,the district court,citing wdc venture,held that claims of fraud,misrepresentation,promissory estoppel,and breach of contract did not trigger a duty to defend as they were contract or claims and not within the scope of coverage.id.at.then,in cim ins.midpac auto center,d,the district court was again presented with the question of whether an insurer was required to defend allegations including breach of contract,tortious breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and mental anguish.id.at.analyzing each count separately,the district court held that the insurer had no duty to defend these claims because they were either based on the contract or premised on the existence of the contractual relationship between the parties.id.at.
oceanic contends that wdc venture no longer accurately represents hawaii law because the california case upon which wdc venture relied,stanford ranch,maryland cas,has been implicitly overruled by vandenberg superior court,cal th,d.in vandenberg,the supreme court of california overruled international surplus lines ins.devonshire coverage,d,the case which stanford ranch relied upon.vandenberg,d,at.
oceanic further argues that because vandenberg was the basis of our holding in anthem,pac.employers ins,cir,burlington owes a duty to defend.we disagree.
oceanic reads too deeply into vandenberg.vandenberg involved damage to a parcel of land that the insured had leased under an agreement to operate an automobile sales and service facility.vandenberg,d,at.when the property reverted back to the landowners after the business was discontinued,the owners discovered that the soil and groundwater underlying the property had been contaminated.id.at.the owners filed suit alleging breach of contract and negligence.the insured tendered defense of that claim to its insurers under its cgl policies.id.at.those policies provided coverage to the insured for sums the insured was legally obligated to pay as damages.the issue before the california supreme court was whether this policy language precluded coverage for losses pleaded as contractual damages.id.at.the insurers argued that the phrase,legally obligated to pay as damages,referred only to tort liability and not contractual liability,citing international surplus and a line of cases holding that any liability arising ex contractu from a contract as opposed to ex delicto from a tort,was not covered under a cgl policy.id.at.the reasoning behind those cases was that the phrase was intended to describe liability based on a breach of a duty imposed by law,tort,rather than by contract.id.
the california supreme court disagreed and reject ed the ex delicto distinction,explaining that the international surplus rationale,distinguishing contract from tort liability for purposes of the cgl insurance coverage phrase legally obligated to pay as damages,is incorrect.id.at.it held that the insurers can not avoid coverage for damages awarded against the insured solely on the grounds the damages were assessed on a contractual theory.id.at.
the basis for the california supreme court holding,however,was not that a breach of contract could constitute an occurrence under a cgl policy.instead,the court focus was on the policy phrase,legally obligated to pay as damages.while the phrase was broad enough to include damages for breach of contract or tort,the court stressed that its interpretation of the phrase did not extend to limitations imposed by other terms of the coverage agreement bodily injury and property damage caused by an occurrence.id.at citation omitted emphasis added.the court rationale was that 
the arbitrariness of the distinction between contract and tort in the international surplus line of cases is evident when we consider the same act may constitute both a breach of contract and a tort.predicating coverage upon an injured party choice of remedy or the form of action sought is not the law of this state instead courts must focus on the nature of the risk and the injury,in light of policy provisions,to make that determination.
id.at citations omitted.but that is already the standard under hawaii insurance law.see dairy road partners,at cautioning hawaii courts to carefully examine a complaint to ensure that plaintiffs could not,through artful pleading,bootstrap the availability of insurance coverage under an insured defendant policy by purporting to state a claim for negligence based on facts that,in reality,reflected manifestly intentional,rather than negligent conduct.see also bayudan,at.
oceanic reliance on anthem electronics is also misplaced.that case involved a contract where anthem electronics had agreed to supply kla instruments with circuit boards to be incorporated into scanners that kla then sold.anthem,at.when some of these scanners failed once in use by kla customers,it was discovered that the circuit boards that anthem had supplied had latent defects due to manufacturing flaws.kla was forced to replace the defective scanners and incurred other costs related to the loss of use of the scanners.id.kla filed suit in california state court to recoup these costs alleging causes of action against anthem for breach of contract and negligence.anthem tendered the complaint to its two cgl insurers and requested defense of the suit.id.at.we were thus faced with the issue of whether,under california law,the anthem complaint established the possibility of a covered occurrence.in holding that the complaint raised a possibility of coverage and therefore triggered a duty to defend,we stated 
the insurers argue against an occurrence where,as here,a supplier simply breaches a contract and supplies defective goods.but this argument seeks to revive a wooden distinction recently rejected by the california supreme court between contractual claims and insurance claims.see vandenberg,at so long as the insured can show that the circuit boards failed unexpectedly and caused property damages,it is well on its way to a prima facie case even though a breach of contract may be involved.
unlike california however,hawaii has not rejected the distinction between contract and claims,and oceanic fails to cite authority that would suggest otherwise.to the contrary,the hawaii supreme court has stated that allowing tort recovery based on a breach of contract unnecessarily blurs the distinction undermines the discrete theories of recovery relevant and contract law.francis,at.we therefore conclude that changes in california law do not affect our application of hawaii law.
oceanic also argues that because the issue of whether a claim for a negligent breach of contract can constitute an occurrence is one of first impression in hawaii,sentinel ins.first ins,applies to trigger coverage.in sentinel,the insured,a corporation which had developed an apartment complex,faced claims of liability after water had infiltrated and damaged the property of unit owners.id.at.the corporation had been insured under two policies issued by different insurers covering separate periods of time,and a dispute arose between the insurers as to when the property damage first occurred.id.at.one insurer,first insurance company of hawaii,refused to defend while the other,sentinel insurance company,undertook defense of the underlying claim under a reservation of rights.after the parties in the underlying suit settled,sentinel filed an action for declaratory relief,seeking to recover sums paid for defense and settlement from first insurance on the theory that first insurance had breached its duty to defend its insured.id.at.the two insurance companies disputed when property damage occurred for purposes of coverage under a cgl insurance coverage was triggered when damage actually manifested itself,or whether it was continuously triggered while the property was exposed to the damage causing agent,even if the damage did not become apparent until later.noting that there was significant conflict among jurisdictions and n o reported hawaii appellate court decision as to which rule should apply,the court explained,t he mere fact that the answers to those questions in this jurisdiction were not then and are not presently conclusively answered demonstrates that,based on the allegations in the underlying action,it was possible that the insured would be entitled to indemnification.id.at emphasis in original.as a result,the court held that first insurance had a duty to defend its insured,which it breached.id.at.
oceanic contends sentinel stands for the proposition that where a case presents a legal uncertainty in hawaii law,such that there is at least a possibility that the insurance company would have a duty to indemnify under the policy,that uncertainty itself triggers coverage under the policy and liability on the part of the insurer.oceanic thus argues that because hawaii has not rejected a negligent breach of contract theory,it was possible at the time the underlying suit was tendered that oceanic would be insured for such a claim.
sentinel is not so broad.the relevant portion of sentinel concerned only the insurer duty to defend.it was that duty which first insurance was held to have breached in that case.the court clearly noted elsewhere in the sentinel decision that the duty to provide coverage and the duty to defend on the part of an insurer are separate and distinct.id.at.even a breach by an insurer of the duty to defend does not necessarily mean that the insurer is liable for indemnification.the court in sentinel remanded that case for further proceedings to determine whether first insurance was liable for indemnification,based upon its breach of the duty to defend.see id.at.
the insurance company in the current case did not breach any duty to defend,even if it is assumed that there was such a duty.unlike the insurer in sentinel,burlington provided a defense to the underlying lawsuit,under a reservation of rights.then,while providing that defense,burlington proceeded with this declaratory relief action to adjudicate its actual obligations under the cgl insurance policy.nothing in sentinel says that an insurance company is not permitted to provide a defense under a reservation of rights and simultaneously seek a declaration that under the given circumstances there is no coverage under the policy.a declaratory judgment is a binding adjudication that establishes the rights and other legal relations of the parties where those rights are in doubt.black law dictionary ed.actions for declaratory relief are authorized under federal law,see,et the declaratory judgment act fed.civ,and under hawaii law,see haw stat.if the insurer obtains a declaratory judgment that there is no coverage,then there is no longer legal uncertainty,and thus no basis to impose a continuing obligation on the insurer under sentinel,even under oceanic reading of that decision.
there is,in addition,reason to doubt that the hawaii supreme court intended that any degree of legal uncertainty or legal ambiguity that is,any quantum of a possibility that the insured would be held entitled to coverage under hawaii itself establish coverage.oceanic argues that because there was not a specific hawaii supreme court case on point regarding issues raised here,there was legal uncertainty such that,under sentinel,the district court should have held that there was coverage on that basis alone.noting the lack of any subsequent ruling by the hawaii supreme court applying sentinel in the manner suggested by oceanic,the district court concluded that the hawaii supreme court did not intend such a result.as the district court explained in masamitsu 
a fundamental principle that should underlie any statement of hawaii insurance law is that a plaintiff is the master of its claim.the underlying complaint against an insured defines the scope of the action,and,at least initially,of the insurer investigation.a plaintiff for any number of plausible reasons may choose purposely not to assert certain facts or causes of action.the insured interpretation of sentinel legal ambiguity theory would mean that novel and claims claims not addressed in hawaii law would trigger coverage over an otherwise action.an insurer would be defending against phantom claims.given a constantly evolving common law,this court in applying hawaii law is unwilling to read as much into sentinel.
masamitsu,d at.we agree that sentinel does not stand for the proposition that the absence of controlling hawaii caselaw does not by itself establish sufficient legal uncertainty to trigger coverage.the observation by the court in sentinel that it was possible that the insured would be entitled to indemnification under the insurance policy referred to more than a theoretical possibility.the court specifically pointed to a notable dispute nationwide and significant conflict among jurisdictions regarding the coverage question at issue there.sentinel,at.the level of uncertainty here is not the same.
accordingly,we conclude that under hawaii law,the homeowners other acts allegation is not a covered occurrence under the policy.
negligent infliction of emotional distress 
oceanic argues that the policy potentially covers the homeowners claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.that claim reads in part 
fourth cause of action 
emotional distress 
homeowners reallege paragraphs above as though fully set forth herein.
at all times material to this counterclaim,han was acting as an agent on behalf of homeowners and had direct meetings with oceanic and or entities as yet unnamed unidentified whom oceanic had a duty to supervise.
oceanic through its principal,jensen wong,through the conduct of entities under the supervision of oceanic,intentionally or negligently inflicted emotional distress upon han.
as a direct and proximate result of the intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress,han has suffered bodily injury,pain and suffering,severe emotional distress 
the district court concluded that the emotional distress claim did not trigger the duty to defend because it was a tort claim which arose only out of the contractual relationship between oceanic and the homeowners.
oceanic argues that the district court erred because homeowner han emotional distress could have been inflicted in the absence of a contractual relationship and should therefore trigger burlington duty to defend.burlington concedes that in the absence of a contractual relations
