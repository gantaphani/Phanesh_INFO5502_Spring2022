at issue on this appeal is the duty of liberty mutual insurance company and liberty mutual fire insurance company together,liberty mutual to defend international business machines ibm in toxic tort suits commenced by ibm employees who allege that they contracted cancer by working in ibm california cleanroom facilities.after the california court dismissed some of the claims and liberty mutual disclaimed coverage for intentional torts,liberty mutual terminated its ongoing defense of ibm on the ground that all the claims remaining were the subject of a stipulation compelled by a wrinkle in california workers compensation law that limited any potential recovery to personal injury suffered prior to january,policy year which no longer provided coverage for such claims.
in a nutshell,liberty mutual disclaimed on the grounds that the trigger of coverage in the relevant policy years was a claimant last day of last exposure to cleanroom conditions at ibm that by virtue of the stipulation,the insurance contract is the one that was in force on the last day of last exposure for which damages are now being claimed and is therefore the only contract triggered that the contract excludes claims for bodily injury by disease unless the resultant claim or suit was brought within three years after the end of the policy period and that none of the underlying suits were commenced within that time.
in response,ibm argues that liberty mutual owes a duty to defend each claim under the policy in force on each claimant last day of exposure to a cleanroom that absent evidence to the contrary,the last day of exposure is a plaintiff last day of employment with ibm that the stipulation does not allege or set the plaintiffs last day of exposure to the california cleanrooms and that the last date of employment specified by plaintiffs in interrogatories ranging from to arguably implicates coverage under subsequent insurance policies that contain no exclusion.
the united states district court for the southern district of new york brieant,ruled that new york law governs this insurance question rather than the law of california and that the last day of last exposure or employment is a question of fact that is not controlled by the stipulation.the court therefore declared that liberty mutual had a continuing duty to defend the claims for negligence and strict liability.
on appeal,liberty mutual challenges the district court choice of law and its declaration.we conclude that new york law and california law present a false conflict,and we affirm the declaratory judgment.we therefore necessarily affirm the district court holding that the liberty mutual policies require liberty mutual to defend ibm against claims of minor plaintiffs in the same toxic tort litigations.
background 
the facts recounted in this opinion are those that bear upon the issues decided in this appeal,and those that supply necessary context.
annually from the through at least,liberty mutual wrote employers liability and workers compensation coverage for ibm california manufacturing facilities 
the form and wording of the insurance contracts has changed three times since,though with a couple of exceptions the substantive policy provisions have been unchanged.
beginning in april,dozens of current and former ibm employees brought six toxic tort actions against the company alleging,inter alia,injuries caused by exposure to chemicals in ibm san jose cleanrooms.a cleanroom is a room in which the concentration of airborne particles is controlled.federal standard institute of environmental sciences,appv by general services administration.ibm uses cleanrooms for the manufacture of hard drives and other sensitive computer components.
the california actions alleged eight common claims for i negligence,ii strict liability,iii strict liability,iv fraud,v intentional and vi negligent breach of california labor code b the california labor code,vii negligent failure to warn and viii intentional concealment of hazards.two california actions,barron ibm barron and gomez ibm gomez,include claims asserted by and on behalf of minor plaintiffs david hecksel and malissa garcia collectively,the minor plaintiffs.
ibm first gave notice of the claims in may eventually,liberty mutual shouldered the defense.in its several reservation of rights letters,liberty mutual disclaimed coverage for several of the eight claims for various reasons and disclaimed as to all claims brought on behalf of the minor plaintiffs.eventually,liberty mutual disclaimed altogether its duty to continue the ongoing defense,on the ground that no claim could result in a covered loss.
from the outset,liberty mutual disclaimed coverage for the three claims pleading intentional wrongs fraud,intentional breach of and intentional concealment of hazards on the ground that coverage is defeated by,inter alia,an intentional act exclusion and california insurance code.that disclaimer is not at issue on this appeal.
in rulings issued in september and december,the california superior court dismissed three of the eight claims strict liability,negligent breach of the california labor code,and negligent failure to warn.ibm does not predicate its claim for defense upon the dismissed claims.
ibm claim to a defense rests upon the two remaining claims negligence and strict liability.liberty mutual argues that those two claims do not support a duty to defend because a stipulation between ibm and the california plaintiffs,dated november,operated as described below to preclude insurance coverage by liberty mutual for the negligence and strict liability claims asserted by the underlying plaintiffs.among other things,the stipulation limited the scope of plaintiffs claims for negligence and strict liability to injury suffered as a result of cleanroom exposure prior to january.
in april,liberty mutual therefore advised ibm that its duty to defend ended on december.
on july,ibm filed a complaint against liberty mutual and zurich seeking,inter alia,damages incurred by the insurers refusals to defend the california actions,and a declaratory judgment requiring liberty mutual zurich to continue to pay the cost of defense.following discovery,liberty mutual moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that,as a matter of law,it had no duty to continue its defense of the california actions after december.essentially,liberty mutual argued that i by that date because of the stipulation and dismissals of certain claims,the only coverage that could be triggered by the remaining claims for negligence and strict liability was the contract ii the contract did not apply to claims filed after december,and iii none of the california actions was filed by that date.liberty mutual additionally disclaimed a duty to defend against the minor plaintiffs claims in the barron and gomez position it has maintained since announcing its initial coverage positions in july.
ibm opposed the motion and for summary judgment on the ground that,as a matter of law,liberty mutual had a continuing duty to defend against the california actions.ibm argued that liberty mutual policies are triggered on an last day of last exposure to a san jose cleanroom that the dismissals left standing the underlying claims of negligence and strict liability that the stipulation between ibm and the california plaintiffs had no bearing on the trigger of coverage for those claims and that liberty mutual duty to defend against the california actions including the claims of minor plaintiffs therefore continued after december.zurich moved for an order requiring liberty mutual to defend ibm against minor plaintiffs claims in the barron and gomez actions.
the district court granted ibm motion,and declared that liberty mutual duty to defend the california actions continued after december.before reaching the merits,the district court grouping of contacts new york law governed this dispute.the court then rejected liberty mutual contention that the stipulation terminated its defense obligations with respect to the california actions and held that,based on clear,unambiguous policy language,liberty mutual policies are in all instances triggered by the last day of last exposure to the conditions allegedly causing or aggravating bodily injury 
the district court made no finding as to the last day of last exposure for each california plaintiff,but noted that setting the particular day was a factual determination which,in the absence of other evidence is the last day of employment of each plaintiff.the court noted that each plaintiff last day of last exposure might ultimately be resolved between the parties or by a trier of fact but it is clear that,in the district court view,the stipulation did not affect the policies trigger mechanism,or the factual determination upon which its operation is predicated.finally,as to zurich motion for an order requiring liberty mutual to defend ibm against the minor plaintiffs claims,the district court ruled that the issue was subsumed by its determinations that i new york law governed this dispute and ii that liberty mutual had a duty to defend the california actions beyond december.
discussion 
on appeal,liberty mutual challenges the district court rulings i that new york law governs this dispute ii that liberty mutual duty to defend ibm against the california actions continued after december,and iii that liberty mutual owed a duty to defend ibm against the claims of minor plaintiffs in the barron and gomez actions.we conclude i that there is no conflict between new york and california law with respect to the scope of liberty mutual duty to defend ibm ii that the trigger of liability coverage is the last date of each tort plaintiff exposure to the cause of injury while employed by ibm notwithstanding the stipulation in the underlying litigation that withdrew any claim for damages and any claim of wrongdoing after december,date after which many tort plaintiffs exposure appears to have long continued and iii that liberty mutual has an ongoing duty to defend ibm against minor plaintiffs claims in the barron and gomez actions.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.vernon fire ins.belize ny.cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.liberty mutual and ibm both moved for summary judgment.
federal courts sitting in diversity look to the rules of the forum state.curley amr,cir.on appeal,liberty mutual challenges the district court conclusion that a new york court would apply new york law to this dispute.a district court choice of law determination is reviewed de novo.id.at.if the law of more than one jurisdiction is potentially applicable to a contract dispute,new york courts undertake grouping of contacts analysis to determine the governing law.zurich ins.shearson lehman hutton.the court endeavors to apply the law of the jurisdiction having the most significant relationship to the transaction and parties.see id.after considering the multiple contacts between this dispute and both new york and california,judge brieant concluded that the new york contacts were stronger than those of california and applied new york law.liberty mutual contests this ruling,chiefly on the ground that when resolving choice of law questions involving insurance contracts,new york courts often give decisive weight to the location of an insured risk here,california.
choice of law does not matter,however,unless the laws of the competing jurisdictions are actually in conflict.in re allstate ins.stolarz.laws are in conflict w here the applicable law from each jurisdiction provides different substantive rules.curley,at citing examples.in the absence of substantive difference,however,a new york court will dispense with choice of law analysis and if new york law is among the relevant choices,new york courts are free to apply it.see,aron chown,affirming application of new york law where there was no actual conflict with the substantive law of newfoundland tronlone lac du quebec,aff,affirming application of new york law where there was no relevant conflict between the substantive laws of new york and new jersey.
as the discussion that follows demonstrates,there is no conflict between new york and california on the principles of insurance law that decide this appeal.absent such a conflict,the district court application of new york law was not error.
an insurer duty to defend claims made against its policyholder is ordinarily ascertained by comparing the allegations of a complaint with the wording of the insurance contract.horace mann ins.barbara,cal th,d,in banc ruder finn seaboard sur.t he initial interpretation of a contract is a matter of law for the courts to decide,morgan stanley group,new england ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also lombardo santa monica young men christian ass,d,and if the wording on the duty to defend is clear and unambiguous,it will be enforced according to its terms.la jolla beach and tennis club,indus.indem,cal th,d,in banc fidelity guar.annunziata.the goal is always to give effect to the intent of the parties,as embodied in their written agreement.la jolla,d,at vernon,at.see also mcgrail equitable life assur.soc.of the.in reading the text,a potent background principle is that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.horace mann,d,at continental cas,continental.the duty is to defend any action,regardless of its merit,that seeks damages potentially within the indemnity coverage.horace mann,d,at citing gray zurich ins,cal d,cal continental,at.
at the same time,an insurer duty to defend is limited absolutely by the scope of the coverage purchased.la jolla,d,at allstate ins.zuk.if there is no legal or factual circumstance that could trigger the duty to indemnify against a claim,then there is no duty to defend against it.ringler assocs.maryland cas,th,d,zuk,at.see also avondale indus.travelers indem,discussing new york law.furthermore,an insurer may withdraw from an ongoing defense if it becomes clear that the claim is wholly outside the indemnification agreement any ambiguity as to the insurer duty to defend is resolved in favor of the insured.ringler,d at charles evans,zurich ins,citing seaboard sur.gillette.see also,horace mann,d,at fidelity,at.california and new york law agree on all of these points.
although the scope of liberty mutual employers liability coverage has remained relatively consistent over time,two modifications over the course of the last twenty years bear upon the insurer obligation to defend the california actions.first,if the triggered policy was issued prior to january,a provision limits coverage to claims filed within three years of the end of the policy period.later policies do not include this provision.second,if a claimant last day of last exposure was after january,liberty mutual duty to defend or indemnify is subject to a high deductible inclusive of defense costs.for the purposes of this appeal,these restrictions taken together effectively limit liberty mutual duty to defend against the california actions to claimants whose last day of last exposure was between january,and january.
