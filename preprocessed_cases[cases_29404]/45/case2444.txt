several defendants filed objections to the amended complaint,including some who moved to stay or dismiss the lawsuit on the ground of forum non conveniens.code civ,subd.a.finding the state of hawaii to be a suitable alternative forum and the relevant public and private interests weighed heavily in favor of having the action litigated in that state,the trial court granted these motions and issued a stay of the california action.

we conclude the trial court properly stayed this action on the ground of forum non conveniens and affirm its decision.while we grant defendants request for judicial notice,in light of our ruling on the merits of the appeal,their motion to take additional evidence and for independent factual findings is denied.
facts and procedural background 
the following is a summary of the material facts taken primarily from the allegations of the first amended complaint along with evidence presented in support of the forum non conveniens motions.
iel was a life insurance company organized under and regulated by the state of hawaii with approximately of its policyholders residing in that state.plaintiff alleges it is a delaware corporation authorized to transact business as a foreign corporation in california.it acquired all of iel shares in.
according to the amended complaint,in plaintiff received authorization from the hawaii division of insurance to enter into what are described as repurchase transactions and to invest in hedging transactions.the next year,defendant reifurth became hawaii insurance commissioner.he filed an action in hawaii state court to seize and rehabilitate iel,claiming the repurchase and hedging transactions had rendered the insurer insolvent.reifurth investors equity life ins.of,ltd,haw.iel president stipulated to appointing a deputy insurance commissioner as the insurer rehabilitator.the amended complaint alleges defendant mccorriston,a lawyer with the mccorriston law firm,which represented reifurth,allegedly told plaintiff if anything is left over in iel estate after rehabilitation or liquidation,then that remainder will go to p laintiff as the sole shareholder.
reifurth later obtained an order liquidating iel.plaintiff appealed that ruling,but the hawaii supreme court affirmed,holding plaintiff lacked standing to oppose the insurance commissioner liquidation petition.metcalf investors equity life ins.of.as noted,the liquidation action is still pending.
in late,reifurth,represented by the mccorriston law firm,filed an action in hawaii state court against plaintiff and its owner,gary vose,alleging fraud and misuse of iel funds.reifurth vose haw.the parties reached a settlement terminating this lawsuit august.plaintiff also alleges that,in,iel entered into a reinsurance assumption agreement with the then hawaii insurance commissioner,defendant association,and hartford life insurance company under which iel transferr ed almost all insurance liabilities to hartford.
according to the amended complaint,a t no time did iel directors authorize forfeiture and cancellation of iel shares of stock,nor has p laintiff surrendered its shares for cancellation and forfeiture.neither reifurth nor any other person holding the position of hawaii insurance commissioner,or any person acting on behalf of a commissioner,has given timely and proper notice for p laintiff,or other person with interest,to cure any impairment that iel had,and reifurth and every other person holding the position of such commissioner have failed to take such other steps as would authorize him or her to effect cancellation and forfeiture of iel shares.but a declaration submitted by defendant yamano,a lawyer with the mccorriston law firm,asserts plaintiff surrendered its iel stock under the settlement and vose signed a document to that effect.yamano further claims the settlement contained a choice of law clause applying hawaiian law.
a focal point of the amended complaint is the purported transfer of iel stock to a trust controlled by the association under a stock subscription agreement.plaintiff alleges that,in december,wayne metcalf iii,then serving as hawaii insurance commissioner,filed a motion in the liquidation action seeking approval of that agreement.according to the amended complaint,a lthough p laintiff was a party to the l iquidation a ction,it was not served with a copy of the s ubscription a greement at the time the motion was filed 
plaintiff claims the stock subscription agreement is void because,by its terms,the agreement needed to be submitted to and approved by the court by december,and that was never done.the amended complaint alleges defendants not only failed to serve plaintiff with a copy of the stock subscription agreement or timely submit that agreement to the court for approval,but also took other steps to misrepresent,deceive,and mislead concerning the a greement and the purported transactions relating to that agreement by which they defraud ed plaintiff and depriv ed it of its right,title,and interest in the monies and assets remaining in iel estate and iel 
stock and value of such stock.it further alleges b y a long series of intertwined,complex,and in many cases unlawful or improper transactions,defendants have siphoned,or assisted others to siphon,monies in a variety of ways from iel estate.
according to the amended complaint,plaintiff first discovered evidence 
of defendant wrongful conduct in march.plaintiff claims it then learned a february interim report on iel assets contained a materially false and misleading entry denot ing some sort of claim by the association for over million.when the balance sheet is adjusted to correct that entry alone,iel has a surplus positive net worth of over million that rightfully belongs to p laintiff.
in february,plaintiff filed the current action.the first amended complaint alleges counts,including causes of action for unlawful taking,denial of due process and equal protection,various species of fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,and unfair competition in violation of business and professions code section.
motions to stay or dismiss the california action for forum non conveniens were filed by defendants schmidt,reifurth,yamano,mccorriston,the mccorriston law firm,komatsubara,one of iel liquidators,plus timothy bogan,a former examiner for hawaii division of insurance.except for bogan,these defendants claimed they were residents of or transacted business in hawaii.bogan had been a california resident,but his declaration supporting the forum non conveniens motion stated that as of july he became a resident of the commonwealth of virginia.defendants mccorriston and yamano acknowledged the mccorriston law firm has a los angeles office but denied either of them currently works at that location.
after a hearing,the trial court ordered the action stayed pending further order of the court and set the matter for a status review hearing in march.it acknowledged defendants had only made an informal offer to stipulate to toll the statute of limitations if necessary,and it was still unclear whether all named defendants could be brought within the jurisdiction of the hawaii c ourts or whether they would be willing to submit to the jurisdiction in hawaii.nonetheless,the court found hawaii is a suitable alternative forum.
balancing the respective private and public interest factors,the court found they favored granting the motion.as for the private interests at stake,it noted the documentation and recordation of the acts claimed of repose in hawaii,as d o most,if not all,of the parties who would have been involved in the activity.the court also gave some weight to the fact california would have the most difficulty in securing personal jurisdiction over percipient witnesses 
the court placed g reat weight on several public interest factors favoring jurisdiction in hawaii.these included the hawaiian courts continuing supervisory jurisdiction over th e ongoing insurance company liquidation matter court orders purport ing to extend protection to some of the named defendants relative to their ability to manage and conserve the assets of the distressed insurer the potential for conflicting interpretations by a foreign state of hawaii own orders the superior interest of hawaiian citizens in the supervising and winding down of a distressed insurance compan y that served almost exclusively the insurance needs of hawaiian residents the fact k ey named defendants are,or have been,employed in state government departments focused on consumer affairs,particularly with respect to the consumer protection of hawaii insureds plus hawaii substantial interest in regulating or fixing the conduct that the lawsuit intends to cure 
addressing the choice of law issue,the court found that even assuming hawaii does not have a restitutionary remedy similar to business and professions code section,the cases are clear that the existence of a favorable statutory scheme or public policy in one forum is not determinative.also a s to any application of hawaii law,including the possible direct or indirect application of principles of sovereign immunity,it has not been established that even if the case remained in california a california court would not apply principles of comity,wherein the plaintiff fate could be the same as if the case were tried elsewhere.
after plaintiff appealed from the stay order,all defendants executed a stipulation declaring s hould p laintiff file any such action in hawaii for the claims made in this action,d efendants agree that any hawaii statute of limitations was tolled from the date of the filing of the complaint in this action to the earlier of such date upon which p laintiff may file or any such action in hawaii or march,and s hould p laintiff file an action in hawaii,no d efendant will contest personal jurisdiction in hawaii.
the trial court continued the status review hearing based on the pendency of this appeal.defendants have now asked us to take judicial notice of a second stipulation filed in the superior court in july.it repeats defendants agreement not to contest personal jurisdiction in hawaii and to toll any hawaii statute of limitations from the date of the filing of the complaint in this action to the 
earlier of such date upon which p laintiff may file or any such action in hawaii 
or days after the court of appeal issues its remittitur however,the stipulation further provides it shall not be construed to revive or allow any claim barred by any applicable statute of limitations at any time prior to february.
discussion 
introduction 
forum non conveniens is an equitable doctrine invoking the discretionary power of a court to decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.citation.stangvik shiley cal d.in determining whether to grant a motion based on forum non conveniens,a court must first determine whether the alternate forum is a suitable place for trial.if it is,the next step is to consider the private interests of the litigants and the interests of the public in retaining the action for trial in california.ibid.
the ruling on a forum non conveniens motion is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion with substantial deference accorded to the trial court determination in this regard.citations.stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at.but the threshold determination whether the alternate forum is a suitable place for trial involves a nondiscretionary determination chong superior court th,that is reviewed de novo american cemwood american home assurance th.
the suitability of hawaii as an alternative forum 
the primary issue presented here is whether the trial court erred in finding hawaii to be a suitable alternative forum.plaintiff argues defendants failed to carry their burden of proof on this requirement by not directly addressing it in their original motions and belatedly filing a postappeal stipulation agreeing only to toll the statute of limitations.additionally,plaintiff contends hawaii is not a suitable alternative forum because defendants failed to establish hawaii can exercise personal jurisdiction over all parties,it would be denied a trial by jury and barred from proceeding with its unfair competition cause of action,plus some defendants will be able to assert sovereign or statutory immunities if the case is tried in that state.
only the statute of limitations waiver presents a significant question in this appeal.an alternative forum is suitable if it has jurisdiction and the action in that forum will not be barred by the statute of limitations.citation.it bears emphasis that i t is sufficient that the action can be brought,although not necessarily won,in the suitable alternative forum.citations.guimei general electric th,see also stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at.the defendant,as the moving party,bears the burden of proof to show the proposed alternative forum satisfies these requirements.stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at.
here,the motions to stay or dismiss this action on forum non conveniens grounds argued hawaii constituted a suitable alternative forum.the trial court order staying this action expressly found hawaii to be so and discussed the factors relevant to the finding.but even without it,such a finding is implicit in the trial court order granting the motion based on forum non conveniens.roman liberty university,th.in any event,since our review of the issue is de novo citation,the trial court determination does not bind us.ibid.
there is no question hawaiian state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the causes of action asserted in the amended complaint.defendants note plaintiff claims arise out of a hawaii an liquidation of a hawaii an domiciled company that involve the alleged unlawful actions of hawaii an government officials and their agents and employees 
as for personal jurisdiction over the parties,defendants note eight of them are either hawaiian residents or entities operating in that state.the remaining defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction in hawaii under that state statute,which provides a ny person submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of hawaii as to any cause of action arising from t he transaction of any business or commission of a tortuous act within th at s tate,a.furthermore,all defendants have now twice stipulated to submitting to personal jurisdiction in hawaii if plaintiff refiles this lawsuit in that state.
plaintiff also relies on a series of arguments based on the premise california law would likely provide certain advantages of procedural or substantive law stangvik shiley,supra,cal d at.it claims a jury trial would not be available in hawaii,it could not proceed on its unfair competition cause of action,and some defendants will be able to assert either sovereign or statutory immunity.these arguments are not determinative of whether hawaii is a suitable alternative forum.
that the law is less favorable to the plaintiffs in the alternative forum,or that recovery would be more difficult if not impossible,is irrelevant to the determination whether the forum is suitable unless the alternative forum provides no remedy at all.citations.the no remedy at all exception applies only in rare circumstances,such as where the alternative forum is a foreign country whose courts are ruled by a dictatorship,so that there is no independent judiciary or due process of law.citation.this exception has been applied in cases where the proposed alternative forum is in a foreign country that lacks an independent judiciary.citation.guimei general electric,supra,th at.
in shiley,superior court th,foreign state plaintiffs received artificial heart valve implants at hospitals outside of california.although none of the implanted valves had malfunctioned,the plaintiffs sued in california alleging physical and emotional distress from the knowledge that the valves may be defective and may fracture or malfunction without warning,causing death or severe physical injury.id.at.the evidence showed courts in the home 
states of of the nonresident plaintiffs had already declared there was no 
cause of action arising out of injuries caused by a product which has not yet malfunctioned.citations.id.at.we held in determining the issue of a suitable place for trial,a court may not even consider the fact that an alternative forum does not recognize a cause of action which would be available to the plaintiff under california law.citation.id.at see also roman liberty university,supra,th at rejecting claim virginia not suitable alternative 
forum because it applies contributory,rather than comparative,negligence principles,and the plaintiff own negligence or assumption of the risk would completely bar his recovery.
so here,the existence of sovereign and statutory immunity defenses,plaintiff loss of his california statutory remedy,and the possibility he may be forced to try this matter in the liquidation proceedings do not render hawaii an unsuitable forum under the forum non conveniens doctrine.the fact that a plaintiff will be disadvantaged by the law of that jurisdiction,or that the plaintiff will probably or even certainly lose,does not render the forum unsuitable in this analysis.boaz boyle th,trial court properly dismissed action by granddaughters of women who,while pregnant,ingested drug in new york even though new york courts had already declined to recognize plaintiffs preconception tort.
as for the statute of limitations defense,stangvik shiley,supra,cal d held that in determining whether a suitable alternative forum exists,the suit will be entertained,no matter how inappropriate the forum may be,if the plaintiff cause of action would elsewhere be barred by the statute of limitations,unless the court is willing to accept the defendant stipulation that he will not raise this defense in the second state citations.citation.id.at.
defendants have agreed to toll the statute of limitations from february,the date plaintiff filed its california action,to the date plaintiff files suit in hawaii.their second stipulation makes clear that,if this action is refiled in hawaii,one issue will be the timeliness of any claims time barred in that state as of february.citing stangvik shiley,supra,cal d and other cases where the defendant agreed to toll the statute of limitations,defendants maintain their representations of a willingness to do the same are sufficient.in addition,they argue hawaii,like california,recognizes the delayed accrual of a claim where the plaintiff is reasonably ignorant of it,plus the tolling of a statute of limitations where a defendant conceals the existence of a cause of action.under the facts of this case,we find the latter argument has merit.
schmidt,reifurth,komatsubara,the mccorriston law firm,and its individually named members contend,and plaintiff does not dispute,under california law the causes of action alleged in the first amended complaint are governed by statutes of limitations ranging from two years to six years in length.generally,a plaintiff must bring a cause of action within the limitations period applicable thereto after accrual of the cause of action.citations.the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises citation.in other words,it sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements citations.norgart upjohn cal th.accrual can occur even though the plaintiff is ignorant of the cause of action or of the identity of the wrongdoer.citation.baker beech aircraft d.it is clear from the amended complaint allegations,the causes of action accrued in the mid and,absent an exception,the applicable statutes of limitation normally would have expired well before february.
however,under california law one important exception to the general rule of accrual is the discovery rule,which postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.citations.fox ethicon endo surgery,cal th.that occurs when a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action which is when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citations.ibid.the facts alleged in the first amended complaint would support application of the discovery rule in this case.
in addition,defendants acknowledge the allegations of the first amended complaint could also support a tolling of the applicable statutes of limitation under the fraudulent concealment doctrine.t he ground of relief is that the defendant,having by fraud or deceit concealed material facts and by misrepresentations hindered the plaintiff from bringing an action within the statutory period,is estopped from taking advantage of his own wrong.pashley pacific ry.cal d.the doctrine is available in all cases citations,that is to say,in actions at law as well as suits in equity citation.regents of university of california superior court cal th.
defendants note the same is true in hawaii.case law has applied the delayed discovery rule to causes of action seeking damages for injury to person or property association of apartment owners of newtown meadows venture,a tort claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the negligent act,the damage,and the causal connection between the two,for a breach of trust pele defense fund paty,the statute of limitation runs from the date the plaintiff cause of action accruedthat is,when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the breach of trust,the injury to its members,and the connection between the breach and the injury,and fraud first interstate bank of hartley i,claims for fraud,whether based on state or federal law,arise when the fraud is or should have been discovered.also,hawaiian law provides i f any person who is liable to any of the actions mentioned in this part or section wrongful death actions,fraudulently conceals the existence of the cause of action or the identity of any person who is liable for the claim from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring the action,the action may be commenced at any time within six years after the person who is entitled to bring the same discovers or should have discovered,the existence of the cause of action or the identity of the person who is liable for the claim,although the action would otherwise be barred by the period of limitations.
generally,application of a statute of limitations is deemed an affirmative defense norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at and a defendant must prove the facts necessary to enjoy the benefit of a statute of limitations samuels mix cal th.but both the discovery rule and fraudulent concealment doctrine are exceptions to this requi
