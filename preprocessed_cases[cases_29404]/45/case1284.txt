when michael patton seriously injured his knee,his doctors concluded that he was no longer able to perform his job as a truck driver for pacvan.patton presented a claim for disability benefits to the administrator of employee benefits plan,life financial distributors.sun life initially approved patton benefits,but discontinued them a year later.it found him able to perform his job in light of his training for an even more physically stressful career as a paramedic and a bizarre series of contradictory letters from his orthopedic specialist,first claiming that patton was unable to work,then indicating he was,then finally reversing course again and indicating that he was unable to work.patton sued for the discontinued benefits under the employee retirement income security act.the district court limited its review to sun life administrative record and denied patton motion to permit discovery and the introduction of new evidence.sun life moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion.patton now appeals the grant of summary judgment and the denial of his motion for discovery.we reverse.
background 
on january,michael patton fell from a ladder while removing christmas decorations at his house,injuring his left knee.he went to his doctor three days later and then,on january,made a fateful visit to a specialist who will feature large in this tale,orthopedic surgeon thomas ambrose.an mri revealed softening of cartilage in the patella and ambrose prescribed a physical therapy regimen that seemed to improve the knee somewhat.but patton returned on march,complaining of intermittent locking and sharp pain in the knee.ambrose decided to operate and performed a left knee arthroscopy,a partial lateral miniscectomy and an adhesive resection.in an april examination,ambrose prescribed a second regimen of rehabilitation.
patton injury interfered with his job as a truck driver for,he stopped working on monday,january.provided its employees with a disability insurance plan administered by life financial distributors,sun life,and funded by an insurance policy issued by sun life.plan participants are entitled to disability benefits when they provide notice and proof that they are totally or partially disabled.at.for months after an initial elimination period,an employee is totally disabled if injury or illness leaves him unable to perform material and substantial duties of his own occupation.id.at.one own occupation is one usual and customary employment as it is generally recognized in the national economy id.at its material and substantial duties are the essential tasks,functions,skills or responsibilities it requires id.at.
on april,patton submitted a disability claim statement to sun life,alleging that he was totally disabled,that is,unable to work as a truck driver.he attached a sun life attending physician statement form filled out by ambrose.ambrose indicated that patton could work an eight hour day,but only with certain restrictions.for instance,he could walk for no more than six to ten hours a day,sit for no more than five to ten hours a day for no more than one hour at a time and lift no more than pounds repeatedly and no more than pounds occasionally.apparently,he did not believe patton could drive a series of check boxes for indicating that patton could drive one to three hours,three to five hours,and five to ten hours were left blank overall,ambrose found that patton was capable only of light work as defined in the department of labor dictionary of occupational titles.in the prognosis section,ambrose checked a box indicating that patton limitations would apply p ermanently.in the vocational rehabilitation section,ambrose indicated that he had reviewed the duties of patton occupation per patient report and recommended vocational counseling and rehabilitation to find a way to decrease stress on his left knee.id.at.
patton also included a letter from ambrose and a fellow practitioner.this letter stated in part 
patton continues to have pain and difficulty with his l knee and for this reason we have recommended activity restrictions in order to decrease the stress on his knee.his current restrictions include no repetitive lifting over pounds,no repetitive climbing or squatting,and no sitting with knees flexed for over one hour at a time.
the natural progression of osteoarthritis is to slowly worsen over time.we hope to prolong the use of his l knee so he does not require total joint arthroplasty for quite some time as joint replacement does not last long in the younger,more active person.unfortunately,his current job requires him to do many stressful activities including driving with his knees flexed,and also requires him to perform repetitive lifting,climbing,and squatting activities.he is currently in need of vocational rehab training in order to be in a career that would not be so stressful on his knee joint.id.at.
on may,while sun life was evaluating patton claim,ambrose discontinued treating patton 
michael is seen back today for follow up of his left knee.he continues to work on physical therapy and rehabilitation and reports improving strength as well as motion about the knee 
michael is going to continue his therapy and rehabilitation on his own.he has resumed school and is going back to study paramedic training.i am going to release him from further routine follow up although i will be happy to see him back on an as necessary basis.id.at.
sun life appears to have received this memo in a medical record request on june.
sun life approved patton claim on july,but a month later noticed something puzzling his paramedic training.patton claim form indicated that he was a former fire department volunteer with some first responder training,and that he had considered retraining as a paramedic.patton visited vocational rehabilitation specialist michael blankenship,who reported that patton wanted to become a registered nurse or paramedic and was enrolled at ivy tech state college,taking courses in english,mathematics and interpersonal communications.
but providing emergency medical service is generally at least as physically stressful as driving a truck.the department of transportation occupational description for indicates v ery h eavy strength requirements.paramedics must be able to stoop and kneel frequently,lift fifty pounds regularly and twenty pounds constantly.some requirements exceed ambrose restrictions.as a result,paramedic training seems a strange course of action for one restricted as patton claims to be.unless his condition ambrose suggested that it would could never put his training to use.
sun life questioned ambrose about this peculiarity.on august,it faxed him the message,patton indicated that you provided him with a release so that he can start paramedic training next week.please provide a copy of the release with any restrictions.id.at.ambrose responded by sending another copy of the april material that patton had included with his claim.on september,sun life sent ambrose a copy of the dot occupational description for,patton job description and a letter,the second page of which is a form above a signature block 
on august,we requested that you provide us with a copy of patton release with his updated restrictions.we received the copy of the april,notes instead.
please provide us with a copy of the recent release allowing patton to start his paramedic training.please include with that release a copy of his current restrictions.
by sending a copy of the april,notes,was your intent to indicate that the restriction contained in the note were patton current restrictions please check one yes no 
please advise if patton restrictions have been revised since april.if so,what are the new restrictions 
if you have released patton to pursue a career in paramedics,would this be reasonable given the described restrictions in your april,notes.id.at.
ambrose did respond to the letter or a reminder sent december.neither did he immediately respond to a second copy of the letter sent february.finally,on march,ambrose faxed to sun life a copy of the form he had received on september and february,which he had signed.he had checked the no box to say that he had not intended to indicate that the april,restrictions were current,and wrote under the question please advise if patton restrictions have been revised the phrase released without restrictions.the form was otherwise unmarked.
armed with this letter,sun life cut off patton benefits on april,explaining to patton that it had discovered that paramedic work was as demanding as truck driving and that ambrose had revealed that patton had not been disabled since may.on may,patton filed an administrative appeal and presented another letter from ambrose,this one dated may,and stating 
michael patton is a patient with known severe premature arthritis of the left knee.he is unable to utilize the knee to depress and release a mechanical clutch of a tractor trailer rig.this is a permanent restriction,and as a result,he is disabled from his previous occupation as an overland truck driver.i am recommending vocational rehabilitation for job retraining.id.at.
patton did not submit any other evidence.sun life referred the case to an orthopedic specialist,robert foster.foster opined that many people with medial facit arthritis can drive a truck doing deliveries and only the test of time would be able to determine its suitability to the degree and duration.sun life reviewed patton file and affirmed its prior decision on july.patton then brought the present action under the employee retirement income security act a b,a b erisa,to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.specifically,patton seeks benefits for the twelve month period after his benefits were cut off,during which he was totally disabled within the meaning of the plan if he was unable to perform the material and substantial duties of a truck driver.
in the district court,the parties disputed the appropriate standard of review of sun life benefits determination.sun life filed a motion for summary judgment on august,in which it argued that its determination should only be overturned if it was arbitrary and capricious,because the plan stated that proof of any disability claim must be satisfactory to sun life,citing donato metropolitan life insurance,cir.matters were complicated on september,when this court decided diaz prudential insurance of america,cir.in diaz,we held that to be subject only to deferential arbitrary and capricious review,a plan must sufficiently warn its participants that it grants the plan administrator the power to interpret the rules,to implement the rules,and even to change them entirely.id.at.we stated that n o single phrase such as satisfactory to us is likely to convey enough information to put plan members on notice,and added that t o the extent that the test applied in donato is inconsistent with the approach we are now articulating,we hereby disapprove of that case.id.at.
patton soon argued not only that diaz had changed the standard of review,but that the change required further changes to the court case management order.on september,patton filed a memorandum of law opposing sun life motion for summary judgment in which he argued that under diaz,sun life decision was entitled not to deferential arbitrary and capricious review,but rather ordinary de novo review.he also filed a summary judgment motion of his own and presented an affidavit claiming that his paramedic training to date had not been physically stressful.sun life moved to strike the motion for summary judgment and affidavit as in violation of the court case management order.the court case management order required dispositive motions to be filed by august,and closed discovery for the plaintiff on september,by agreement,neither party had engaged in any discovery.patton argued in response that the change in the standard of review brought about by diaz opened up avenues for appropriate discovery where none had existed before while a court exercising arbitrary and capricious review must review only the documents presented to the plan administrator,a court exercising de novo review may,in its discretion,hear new evidence.patton asked the court to alter the case management order to reopen discovery and permit the late filing of his summary judgment motion.
the district court denied patton motion to reopen discovery and granted sun life motion to strike patton affidavit and his motion for summary judgment.on november,the district court granted sun life motion for summary judgment.it found that de novo review applied,but that even under this standard the evidence before it did not present a genuine issue of material fact,so that sun life was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.patton now appeals both the grant of summary judgment and the denial of his motion to reopen discovery.
ii.discussion 
the two decisions that patton appeals stand in a somewhat unusual relationship to one another,in that the district court denial of patton motion to reopen discovery may make it pointless to correct any error in the grant of summary judgment.normally,of course,we must remand for trial when we determine that summary judgment is inappropriate,but we have not always followed this general rule in erisa cases,where the plaintiff has no right to a jury trial and unusually limited abilities to introduce evidence.see mathews sears pension plan,cir.the standard for summary judgment is more demanding than the standard for judgment after a bench trial.if on a certain record a district court believes a party is entitled to summary judgment,then the same court,if required to conduct a bench trial on that same record,will probably decide the case for that same party.consequently,if we think that a district court granted summary judgment despite the existence of genuine issues of material fact,but know that no new evidence will be presented at trial on remand,we can in most though not necessarily all situations know with certainty that remand would be an unwarranted empty formality.mathews,at see also.simpson nickel,cir holding that if nothing the plaintiff could show would avoid summary judgment,then dismissing the complaint instead of waiting for a rule motion was harmless error alioto marshall field,cir same.
the present case does not present such a situation,however.patton has appealed both the district court grant of summary judgment and its denial of his motion to reopen discovery.because we reverse both of these decisions,there will be evidence introduced into the record besides that which was before the district court at summary judgment,and we therefore can not say with certainty how the district court will resolve the case on remand.
motion for summary judgment 
we begin with the court grant of sun life motion for summary judgment,which we review de novo.semien life ins.of,cir,cert.denied.summary judgment is appropriate only if the evidence presents no issue of material fact,so the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c semien,at.the moving party is so entitled if no reasonable could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.anderson liberty lobby,d gleason mesirow,cir.whether a reasonable factfinder could return a verdict for the nonmoving party is determined in part by the substantive burden of proof that that party faces.anderson,at.patel allstate ins,cir.
sun life first argues that we should affirm summary judgment for a reason not relied upon by the district court an allegedly heightened burden of proof upon patton.the court held that patton merely had to show that he was totally disabled within the meaning of the plan during the relevant period to prevail de novo review of sun life benefits determination.sun life urges that the plan granted the administrator broad discretion to determine entitlement to benefits,and consequently that patton had to instead show that sun life determination was arbitrary and capricious arbitrary and capricious review.
which burden of proof applies is determined by the erisa plan itself,as interpreted under federal common law.ruttenberg life ins,cir kamler telecomm,cir.erisa contract law is shaped by erisa goal of providing uniform remedies to employees.see erisa b a b,b a b cent.laborers pension fund heinz,d firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also sullivan cox,cir holding that erisa common law of contract interpretation is shaped by substantive erisa goals.absent clear language to the contrary,plans are read to provide for searching judicial review of benefits determinations plenary review of the administrator interpretation of the facts and plan,firestone tire,at.sperandeo lorillard tobacco,cir ruttenberg,at,fortified by the district court discretionary authority to hear evidence that was not presented in the administrative process,casey uddeholm,cir,citing quesinberry life ins.of,cir the employee thus presumptively has a right to an informed and independent judgment on his claim for by evidence as the court thinks necessary,and fully independent of the plan administrator findings and reasoning.id.
as noted,this presumption can be overcome with clear language to the contrary an erisa plan can provide for more restrictive judicial review of benefits determinations by including language that gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.diaz prudential ins.of,cir,citing firestone tire,at.the language must possess requisite if minimum clarity,diaz,at,citing herzberger standard ins,cir see also ruttenberg,at,indicating that the administrator not only has authority to assess compliance with criteria,but also has the power to interpret the rules,to implement the rules,and even to change them entirely.diaz,at 
sun life claims that its plan limits judicial review by stating that proof of disability must be satisfactory to sun life.at.but plan terms requiring only that proof satisfactory to us be submitted for benefits are not sufficiently clear to limit review.every plan will require employees to prove they are entitled to benefits before receiving them,and provisions that merely implement that basic requirement do not warn employees of broad administrative discretion and limited review.diaz,at,citing herzberger,at kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.sun life cites two cases that it claims are to the contrary.see donato metro.life ins,cir bali blue cross blue shield ass n,cir.they are unquestionably to the contrary we have expressly overturned them.see diaz,at.the district court was correct to apply a,de novo standard of review to sun life denial of patton benefits claim.
we must therefore determine whether the district court independent review of the record was correct.summary judgment is appropriate only if no reasonable factfinder could conclude that patton was unable to drive a truck from april,to april.sun life argues that two inconsistencies in patton evidence prevent reasonable disagreement about his claims.first,it notes that ambrose contradicted his initial april,and most recent may,diagnoses that patton is unable to drive a truck in his intervening march,response to sun life letter,in which he stated that patton faced no restrictions.second,it notes that patton is studying a profession that,according to ambrose april,diagnosis,he will be permanently unable to perform.
sun life begins its attack from ambrose contradictory letters by arguing that no reasonable factfinder could believe ambrose most recent letter of may.it describes the may,letter as a conclusory statement,unsupported by any medical evidence,clinical data,or office notes,and correctly notes that medical and all expert opinions which fail to explain the basis for their conclusions can not by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact.bragdon abbott,d vollmert.dep t of,cir weigel target stores,cir fertilizer exch.nat.bank of,cir collecting cases.such naked assertions are indeed insufficient by themselves,but ambrose letter does not stand alone the record also includes ambrose comparatively detailed april,diagnosis.this diagnosis sets forth ambrose opinion as to patton condition,his prognosis and the resulting limitations he faces.it was detailed enough for sun life,which initially approved benefits after receiving it,and it is detailed enough for the federal courts,since even brief expert reports will suffice at the summary judgment stage.abdullahi city of madison,cir,citing vollmert,at holding that an expert report at summary judgment must supply the basis for the opinion but need not give a primer on why the facts allow the expert to reach her conclusion.the may,letter and the april,diagnosis are not identical in all instance,the letter states that patton is unable to drive a truck because of the stress of working the clutch the diagnosis instead mentions stooping,lifting and sitting with knees they are generally consistent and together present a coherent opinion that patton knee leaves him unable to drive a truck.
recognizing that the april,diagnosis is poison to its summary judgment hopes,sun life argues that the march,partially form in which ambrose stated that he released patton without restrictions on may,the diagnosis out of the equation.sun life stresses that the march letter is unqualified and informed,and both qualities are indeed indisputable the letter included no qualification and was written after sun life sent ambrose the department of transportation fact sheets.
nonetheless,a reasonable factfinder would be interested in other qualities as well,for instance,whether the letter was considered,detailed or carefully composed.it is ironic that sun life attacks ambrose may,letter as terse and conclusory when the march,letter it claims decides the case is still less detailed.ambrose markings on sun life form are limited to a few words stating that patton was released without restrictions on may,and a checkmark indicating that his the april,diagnosis was not meant to indicate that the diagnosis was still accurate.if it were not that the letter undermines ambrose credibility,it would lack sufficient basis to have weight as an independent medical opinion.the letter disavows the april diagnosis,but does not explain why ambrose changed his opinion,in fact why he apparently changed his opinion on may,only twelve days after he reported his original diagnosis to sun life.neither is there any explanation why ambrose,apparently having already rejected his april diagnosis,sent another copy of that diagnosis to sun life in august or september.
patton suggests,in light of these mysteries,that ambrose march letter was a mistake somehow,ambrose misunderstood sun life letter and stated that patton faced no restrictions when he actually did.sun life urges that there is no evidence that the letter was a mistake,but that is not quite true.there is no extrinsic evidence of mistake no one has testified as to why the letter was sent if it was not true.but that is not fatal to patton claim in light of the intrinsic evidence suggesting detailed april diagnosis,the subsequent may,letter reaffirming that diagnosis,the lack of detail in the march,letter and the unexplained contradictions between the various communications.some of ambrose messages to sun life contain either errors or lies,but reasonable factfinders could locate them in different places.
sun life cites the rule of thumb that a party can not defeat summary judgment by having a witness contradict her own prior deposition testimony.pourghoraishi flying j,cir jewel,cir.when a witness abandons her testimony in the face of a pending summary judgment motion,the change is often a transparent ruse designed to prolong the case allowing the ruse to succeed would defeat summary judgment purpose of weeding out clearly unmeritorious cases.bank of allied signal safety restraint,cir see also,weigel,at,at.but while a change in testimony is often a clear ruse,it is sometimes plausible.a number of scenarios might explain a change a confusing deposition question,circumstances indicating a lapse of memory,pourghoraishi,at,relevant new information discovered after the original testimony,at,or ambiguous or incomplete earlier testimony,aviles cornell forge,cir shepherd slater steels,cir bank of,at,at.consequently a court must examine the particular circumstances of a change in testimony to see whether it is plainly incredible or merely creates a credibility issue for the jury.bank of,at 
patton points out that ambrose diagnoses and letters were not made under oath,see bank of,at darnell target stores,cir,but there is a more basic problem with sun life argument ambrose representations prior to his may,statement that patton was unable to drive a truck were inconsistent and ambiguous,and the may,letter could plausibly be considered a truthful effort to resolve that ambiguity.in cases where we have rejected a change in testimony,the witness has consistently adhered to one version of events prior to the change.take,for instance,where the court found a doctor testimony that the plaintiff suffered an allergic reaction a model of clarity.at.it is obvious why in such a situation no one could credit the doctor sudden,realization that the plaintiff reaction might have been toxic instead.
in the present case,by contrast,ambrose position prior to may,was inexplicably inconsistent,a model of confusion.any jury faced with both the april,diagnosis patton is unable to drive and the march,letter patton is able to drive would have to conclude either that one of the diagnoses was wrong or that some unknown factor explained the contradiction.the may,letter purports to clarify which of the two earlier positions is correct the april,diagnosis that patton is unable to drive.the jury could go either way in the absence of the clarification why should it be unable to believe the clarification ambrose letter would be more powerful if it explained why he had previously taken inconsistent omission perhaps not the fault of patton or his lawyer,given that as far as we know during the erisa administrative proceeding,patton lacked the ability to compel ambrose testimony or him.beckel,cir.ambrose may not have been eager to explain in detail why his office sent out false information about a patient to an insurance company.but even with the letter of may,as it is,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that ambrose march,letter was a mistake and that the april diagnosis and may,letter represent ambrose true opinion and are correct.
this leaves sun life second and more serious argument that patton is training to perform paramedic work,which is at least as stressful as driving a truck.this is an important problem for patton claim,but on the current record the contradiction is not as glaringly clear as sun life makes out.it urges that ambrose release of patton from further treatment on may,was based on the job requirements of an emt and plaintiff ability to do the emt job.br.of appellee.but ambrose notes do not indicate that ambrose at that time knew the job requirements of an emt or believed that patton could perform them.ambrose is an orthopedic surgeon,not a rehabilitation specialist.he evaluated whether patton was able to perform his own job as patton described it in the april diagnosis,filling out the requested information on sun life form,but he may not have thought it was his business to go beyond that and evaluate patton proposed career.the sole mention of paramedic work in ambrose notes is the brief remark,he has resumed school and is going back to study paramedic training.while a reasonable factfinder could conclude that ambrose thought patton knee could handle the stress of paramedic work,that inference is not compelled.
neither this evidence about patton emt aspirations nor any other evidence in the record,such as foster very limited opinion that,basically,he was unsure whether patton was able to drive a truck,takes the case out of the range of reasonable disagreement.the contradictions in ambrose letters and the possible contradiction in patton studies are key issues that could convince a reasonable factfinder that patton disability is a sham and that he is not entitled to benefits.but they do not compel a reasonable factfinder to so conclude.there remain genuine issues of material fact that render the district court grant of summary judgment inappropriate.
motion to reopen discovery 
though the district court should not have decided the case on summary judgment,the question remains whether,pursuant to patton motion,it should have reopened discovery to permit patton to,for instance,depose ambrose.sun life urges affirmance,arguing that patton had the opportunity during his administrative appeal to introduce the equivalent of the evidence he hopes to introduce on remand.patton rejoins that the evidence he wants to present is necessary for the court to conduct an informed evaluation of his claims.
as already noted,sun life plan does not limit its participants rights to informed,independent review of benefit determinations by the courts,so the district court had discretion to limit the evidence to the record before the plan administrator,or to permit the introduction of additional evidence necessary to enable it to make an informed and independent judgment.casey uddeholm,cir,citing quesinberry life ins.of,cir we review the denial of patton motion for abuse of that discretion,semien life ins.of,cir vallone cna fin,cir,which is appropriate where the district court decision can not be rationally based upon the record evidence,or is based on an erroneous legal conclusion,or is supported by clearly erroneous factual findings or clearly appears arbitrary,vallone,at.the district court must sufficiently explain its decision to show us that it considered the relevant factors and exercised its discretion.united states cunningham,cir.
numerous factors are relevant to the district court decision,the most central being the court need to hear the evidence in order to make an informed evaluation of the parties claims and defenses.in casey uddeholm,cir,the plaintiff sued to recover benefits from the uddeholm health benefits plan for injuries he sustained in an attempt to commit suicide the key question was whether the injuries were sustained accidentally.id.at.the plan administrator determined that injuries from a suicide attempt could never be accidental,but the district court disagreed,holding that the injuries could have been accidental if casey had been insane at the time of the attempt.id.at.the district court then granted summary judgment to uddeholm on the ground that casey had not been insane.id.at.on appeal this court reversed,holding that there were genuine issues of material fact forestalling summary judgment,and then addressed whether the district court should be able to hear additional evidence on remand 
in quesinberry life ins.of north america,cir the sixth circuit sic held that a district court may review evidence beyond that which was before the plan administrator only when circumstances clearly establish that additional evidence is necessary,but that as a general matter the district court should restrict itself to the evidence before the plan administrator.in this case the record before the plan administrator was relatively undeveloped.therefore,in its de novo review the district court may limit the evidence to the record before the plan administrator,or it may permit the introduction of additional evidence necessary to enable it to make an informed and independent judgment.
at.the most important factor for the district court,therefore,seems to be whether the evidence is necessary to an informed and independent judgment on the parties claims and defenses,which will obviously depend on the nature of the claims and whether the administrative record was relatively undeveloped with respect to those claims.most other courts that share our discretionary approach to new evidence agree.hall unum life ins.of,cir holding that the record should be expanded when circumstances clearly establish that additional evidence is necessary to conduct an adequate de novo review of the benefit decision donatelli home ins,cir same luby teamsters health,welfare pension trust funds,cir if the record on review is sufficiently developed,the district court may,in its discretion,merely conduct a de novo review of the record of the administrator decision.
other factors are also relevant.courts have suggested,for instance,that the district court may wish to consider whether the evidence the parties seek to introduce would concern plan terms or historical facts concerning the claimant,whether the plan admini
