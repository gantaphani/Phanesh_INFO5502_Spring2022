the plaintiff,lois kramer,initiated this erisa action against defendants paul revere life insurance company and provident life and accident insurance company,claiming wrongful termination of disability benefits and seeking reinstatement of benefits under policies issued by the defendants.applying de novo review to provident life determination that the plaintiff was no longer disabled,the district court found that plaintiff condition preclude d her from performing the material and substantial duties of her own occupation and thus concluded that she was entitled to continue receiving payments under that policy.however,after reviewing paul revere life decision under the standard,the district court upheld the cessation of benefits by that company based on the same medical record.the plaintiff now appeals the latter ruling.because the record establishes that kramer was disabled under the terms of the paul revere life policy,which were virtually identical to those in the provident life policy,we conclude that the plan administrator decision to terminate benefits was arbitrary and capricious.we therefore reverse the district court ruling in favor of defendant paul revere life.
factual and procedural background 
both of the insurance policies at issue in this case provide disability benefits in the event that the insured becomes totally disabled.that term is defined by the provident life policy as not able to perform the substantial and material duties of your occupation and by the paul revere life policy as unable to perform the important duties of his own occupation on a or basis.emphasis added.the provident life policy had been provided to the plaintiff by her employer,the henry ford health system,where she was employed as a staff physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.through her employer,kramer purchased the additional disability benefits policy from paul revere life.the two insurers were separate companies at the time that the policies were issued but later merged,first with each other and then with unum life insurance.thus,they were both part of unumprovident corporation at the time that payments to the plaintiff were terminated in this case,and the same adjusters made the decision to stop payment under both policies.for that reason,they will be referred to in this opinion,as in the district court opinion,as the defendant or as unum.
the difference in the district court standard of review of the termination decisions stemmed from the fact that the provident life policy did not explicitly vest the plan administrator with discretion regarding the grant or denial of benefits,thus subjecting the decision to terminate payments to de novo review by the district court.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in contrast,the district court construed the paul revere life policy as conferring discretion on the plan administrator and,therefore,utilized the more deferential standard that allows reversal of a termination decision only if that determination was arbitrary and capricious.see,bartling fruehauf,cir.
as detailed in the district court opinion,the administrative record indicates that kramer began suffering from cervical pain as early as,when she evidently had the first of a series of computed tomography ct scans.she underwent physical therapy in january,in an attempt to relieve pain in her neck and right arm that was forcing her to interrupt patient exams,forego surgery,and take various medications,and flexeril.a magnetic resonance imaging mri in showed central disk herniation at the level,causing mild compression of the left side of the spinal cord and spinal stenosis at the level.a ct scan later that year led to surgery,a laminectomy that was accomplished on december.
despite the surgery,the plaintiff continued to experience pain that interfered with her work,and subsequent ct scans and mri showed chronic left radiculopathy with mild ongoing denervation.kramer was noted to be suffering weakness in the biceps,brachial radialis,triceps,and finger extensions of the left hand.she underwent nerve root injections in may but continued to suffer pain that,according to two different physicians,interfered with her professional responsibilities.as a result,kramer stopped working on september,while continuing to seek medical and therapeutic relief from her symptoms and continuing to take vicodin to control pain.when none of the treatments restored normal use of her left arm,kramer applied for disability benefits in the fall of,based on the assessment of her treating physician that with her limitations,she ca deliver babies,ca do surgeries,ca perform multiple pelvic exams or colposciopies.her supervisor informed an investigator for the defendant that,given those limitations,there was no work available to the plaintiff at the henry ford health system.
the plaintiff application for benefits was approved by the defendant in late.in june,her interim medical records were reviewed by the defendant internal consultant,paul martin,who reported that i t would appear that since th e claimant abilities have steadily gone downhill rendering her totally incapable of performing any practice and procedures.she was taking vicodin twice daily,and the dosage was increased after september.in may,she was having increasing difficulties with the discomfort in her left arm and was prescribed a fentanyl patch,which delivered an opioid transdermally.she was subsequently seen by a neurologist,who ordered another mri and discovered that,in addition to narrowing at and,kramer had developed a bone spur at the site of her laminectomy that protrude d posterior into the left,abutting the spinal cord.he concluded in his report that because kramer had experienced little or no relief from the laminectomy performed in,she was unwilling to undergo further surgery without a guarantee that it would improve her condition,neurologist doctor could give her.
another internal review of kramer file ordered by the defendant in april produced a report by a barbara parke that there was sufficient objective medical information to support the plaintiff claim for disability benefits.kramer continued to undergo regular medical,and an mri in june showed no change in her condition,although she did report that her fingers had begun feeling numb.the defendant set up an additional independent medical evaluation in the fall of that year,but there is no copy of the resulting report in the record,an omission the defendant said was due to physician negligence.however,there is also no indication in the record that company officials made any effort to secure a copy of the report.a year later,in june,lois underwent another independent medical exam at the defendant direction.in the resulting first to reflect a radical departure from previous medical phillip mayer concluded that the plaintiff did not have any objective abnormalities to suggest ongoing cervical radiculopathy and noted that he had found no objective reason why this individual should not be able to perform her functions as a physician in the specialty of.the defendants sent this report to a geron brown for an internal review of selected portions of kramer file,including mayer recent report.brown concluded that t he objective medical findings in the records do support some level of impairment,but he opined that th is impairment is mild and would not be expected to preclude a light physical demand occupation.he further asserted that n o restrictions or limitations for this individual profession are indicated.
in the meantime,the defendants had set up video surveillance of the plaintiff,watching as she went about daily activities.the initial videotape showed no reason to question kramer disability,but a second series of surveillance videos a year later included views of the plaintiff and her husband working on their defendant said for purposes of winter storage,but the plaintiff later explained that they were readying the boat for sale because she was no longer able to engage in sailing.based on the second videotape and the reports from mayer and brown,unum informed the plaintiff that there were concerns about her entitlement to continued disability benefits.in response,the plaintiff submitted the report from her next examination by her neurosurgeon,mark silverman 
i am concerned about plaintiff returning to work at her previous occupation.i believe that she may be able to perform some of the activities of her regular duties as a gynecologist for a short period of time during the day however,it would seem to me unlikely that she could continually use her arms throughout the day doing procedures and office work.i do feel that her current symptoms are representative of the underlying cervical disk pathology and spondylosis that is noted on the most recent mri.
i feel a bigger issue may be the safety of her patients,especially in the operating room with the necessity for her to perform surgery and the substantial duties of her specialty.this is especially in regard to surgical procedures that require traction particularly on the forearms for an extended period of time,which i feel unlikely that she would be able to perform for a prolonged amount of time.unfortunately,i do believe that she can return to work in her current status.
a month later,kramer saw her rheumatologist,lydia lasichak,who,noting that her patient was taking vicodin up to three times a day,responded to mayer opinion that she could return to work as follows 
i do not believe mayer fully understands what an doctor must do.it is a profession.she is using sharp instruments intraabdominally and intrapelvically,many times through a laparoscope,and particularly in something such as with a vaginal approach for a hysterectomy i think that it would be extremely difficult for kramer and also extremely dangerous for the patient to have a surgeon who would lose control of the use of her upper extremity at such a time,even with somebody standing by to help in case she ran into trouble.it seems ludicrous to have a doctor on standby to allow kramer to do her job and perhaps injure the patient before the standby doctor can get there.i do not see how she can perform the activities related to her job.
lasichak conceded that the plaintiff can do her activities of daily living,but then a patient life is not in jeopardy,nor is there any chance for bodily harm to another human being when she is hanging up her clothing at home.
kramer treating physician sent the reports from lasichak and silverman to the defendants on december,writing that he hoped that this will put to rest the inconceivable notion that lois can return to her practice of.the defendant nevertheless terminated the plaintiff benefits under both policies less than a week later,saying that because no statistical studies were done as suggested by the ime provider,we do not feel that silverman and lasichak reports provided any additional information to refute our determination regarding your ability to perform your occupational duties as.
the plaintiff appealed this decision internally,sending a letter from william anderson,her former supervisor and the head of the henry ford hospital department of obstetrics and gynecology.in that letter,anderson advised the defendants that kramer was unemployable as an and noted that at the time she was forced to quit work,she could not carry out obstetrical maneuvers in the delivery unit,had difficulty in routine office activity,and had begun requesting that her colleagues perform major and minor surgical procedures for her.anderson also explained that kramer would also be a potential liability and as a result would not be able to obtain medical liability insurance that is a must in order to practice in her specialty.in addition,two of the plaintiff former colleagues at the henry ford hospital wrote unum to explain that kramer had not left her employment willingly but because she could not fulfill departmental work obligations to her patients because of physical limitations and that she had reached a point where she was unable to meet the very demanding physical requirements of her profession in the office,in the operating room,and in the delivery room.supporting these opinions was the report of rehabilitation consultant robert ancell,who concluded that from a vocational rehabilitation standpoint kramer can not perform the material and substantial portions of her occupation,citing the extent,duration and precision that she has to use her left extremity that precludes her from performing her job.
kramer subsequently underwent another electromyogram emg and another mri,which resulted in reports indicating that there were no significant changes in her condition since june except that there has been a slight increase in the size of disc bulge or small herniation to the left at and there is now some deformity on the exiting nerve root sleeve complex.these additional reports were reviewed internally by david frank,who opined that they did not provide clinical assessment findings to support the physicians opinion that the plaintiff was totally unable to work.
one other review was made by an outside consultant hired by the defendants,mark ross,who although the records did not present objective evidence to support the plaintiff inability to use the left upper extremity during functional work activities,neuropathic pain conditions do not always have objective findings that match the patient subjective complaints.he also noted that it would be unfair to completely ignore the consistent subjective support of her limitations offered by multiple healthcare providers.he then ended his report with the following observations that call into question his familiarity both with the demands of the plaintiff practice and with the terms of the paul revere life policy 
it is unclear to me how much sic of the tasks with which she has great difficulty represent sic an integral portion of her more recent work requirements.it is not uncommon for surgeons to change their type of practice over the course of their years in practice.
the plaintiff appeal was denied in september.this litigation followed.
discussion 
before this court,the plaintiff raises three grounds upon which she urges us to reverse the district court determination that the termination of her disability benefits under the paul revere life policy was not an abuse of discretion.in the first,she argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to permit extended discovery concerning the company pervasive conflict of interest in fulfilling both the role of plan administrator and that of payor.in a related ground,she contends that the district court should have reviewed the defendant termination of benefits under a de novo standard because of that conflict of interest and other misconduct that permeated the decision to terminate.we pretermit discussion of those issues because we conclude that the decision to terminate benefits was an abuse of discretion in light of medical evidence that,as the district court found,undeniably established the plaintiff total disability,her inability to perform her own occupation for an indefinite period beginning in and extending at least though the date of termination in september.
the district court observed that the defendant adjusters had initially approved the plaintiff claim for disability benefits based on a finding that she was totally disabled under both policies as a result of her degenerative cervical spine disease and that it was only after making payments for approximately five years that unum sought to terminate benefits on the ostensible ground that the plaintiff was no longer disabled.regarding the provident life policy,the district court set out a lengthy and detailed recitation of the medical evidence in the administrative record leading up to the determination of disability in october and the initial reports submitted by the plaintiff in.the first review of kramer file by the defendant internal consultant,martin,reflected his opinion that her abilities have steadily gone downhill rendering her totally incapable of performing any practice and procedures.despite this assessment by its own consultant and supplemental reports supplied by the plaintiff that showed,if anything,that her condition was gradually worsening as time went on,the defendant undertook
