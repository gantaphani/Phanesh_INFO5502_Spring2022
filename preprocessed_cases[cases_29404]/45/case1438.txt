this appeal involves an insurance coverage dispute over the validity of an insurance policy amco insurance company issued to beckon,insuring the latter business operations as well as the building it occupied but did not own.the district court concluded the entire policy was void on the grounds beckon lacked an insurable interest in the building.beckon appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of amco.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
beckon is in the business of repairing industrial machines used in the beverage container industry.the company started in.in its first several years,beckon operated out of the garage of its owner,john herbst.in september,beckon moved into a square foot building located at east clinton place in kirkwood,missouri hereinafter the building.
the terms under which beckon occupies the building are somewhat atypical.the building is owned by rosalinda rosemann,the widow of the founder of company.occupied the building pursuant to a lease starting in.in the fall of,moved to a new location and vacated the building even though the lease remained in effect.the lease required to use reasonable diligence in the care and protection of said premises and to keep the building in good order and repair and free from any nuisance or filth upon or adjacent thereto.the lease allowed to sublet the building.
during the two years the building was vacant,it was vandalized.in a move that benefitted both companies,reached an oral agreement with herbst to allow beckon to occupy the building in exchange for acting as its caretaker,to maintain the building and prevent it from being vandalized.the agreement also required beckon to pay the utilities for the building,which beckon did,while continued to pay the real estate taxes and sewer bills.instructed herbst to treat the building as your own,or words to that effect.among other things,herbst understood this to mean he should insure the building,which he did,unaware that also continued to insure the building.
when herbst inquired about purchasing the building,told him a sale was a possibility sometime in the future.while herbst was not told as much,the building was never sold or formally leased to beckon because rosemann interest in the building was limited to a life tenancy,and the remaindermen who would jointly own the building upon her death were embroiled in litigation.
after taking possession,beckon treated the building as its own,making numerous improvements.beckon enlarged and replaced the bay doors,remodeled the offices,remodeled the floors and bathrooms,changed the lighting,painted the building,expanded the mezzanine,covered the driveway with asphalt,and installed a large five ton hoist.beckon was not reimbursed for these improvements.
starting in and throughout its occupancy of the building,beckon purchased insurance covering the building,the contents of the building,and its own business operations.in,beckon switched insurers because zurich,its insurer at the time,determined beckon business operations did not fit within any of zurich underwriting programs.beckon insurance agent filed an online application with amco on beckon behalf.the underwriting report amco obtained while considering the application listed beckon as a renter,rents in one story brick building.
in october,amco approved the application and issued a policy of insurance to beckon.the policy insured beckon against damage to the building and its contents,business personal property.the policy listed various additional coverages,for loss of business income,extra expenses,equipment breakdown.separate premiums were charged for the building and the business personal property.amco renewed the policy for terms in october,and again in october.beckon paid all premiums.
between and,beckon had no insurance claims in connection with the building.then,two events occurred within a span of months.on march,sparks from a welder operated by an independent contractor ignited some insulation inside the building and caused a fire.the fire damaged the work areas of the building,and damaged or destroyed many of the building contents.for example,beckon estimated damages of alone to the hoist it had installed in the building.in order to carry on its business,beckon rented space in another location in fenton,missouri,while the building was repaired.the cost of renting the temporary space in fenton approached per month.beckon temporary rental expenses continued for nearly two years until it was finally able to move back into the building in early.on august,while beckon waited for amco to respond to its fire claim,part of the building roof blew off during a wind storm.rain water damaged an interior office area.beckon repaired the roof at a cost of approximately,and again reported the loss to amco.
between the time of the fire and the wind storm,amco investigated beckon ownership interest in the building.after determining beckon did not own the building,amco did not cancel the policy or claim it was void based on the misrepresentation of a material fact.rather,on april,amco continued to provide insurance to beckon,and issued a change of declarations endorsement to the policy which added rosemann and as additional insureds.amco charged beckon an increased premium for adding the additional insureds,which beckon paid.
amco failed to accept or deny beckon fire claim by september,the date it was required to do so under the terms of the policy as extended by agreement of the parties.finally,on october,amco denied beckon claim for the fire damage to the building on the grounds beckon lacked an insurable interest in the building.on october,amco denied beckon claim for wind damage to the building on the same grounds.later,on november,amco paid under the separate coverage beckon had purchased for the business personal property damaged in the fire.
shortly thereafter,beckon filed suit against amco in federal district court asserting claims for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay the two building losses,the fire loss and the wind loss.amco answer asserted numerous defenses not previously raised by amco in its letters denying beckon insurance claims,including an allegation beckon made material misrepresentations in the procurement of the policy.amco also brought a counterclaim seeking to recoup the it paid beckon for losses caused by the fire and covered under the business personal property section of the policy.
amco filed a motion for summary judgment.the primary basis for amco motion was that beckon allegedly misrepresented that it owned the building in its application.secondarily,amco argued beckon lacked an insurable interest in the building because it had no legal or equitable title to the building.
without addressing the issue of misrepresentation,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of amco on the grounds beckon lacked an insurable interest in the building.the district court concluded it did not need to reach the question of fraud in the procurement of the policy because the lack of an insurable interest in the building voided the entire policy.the district court also entered judgment for amco on its counterclaim in the amount of,the amount amco had already paid under the business personal property section of the policy.beckon filed a timely appeal.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.rand yer song moua,cir.we also review de novo the district court interpretation of missouri law.bockelman mci worldcom,cir.
at the outset,we reject amco contention that the lack of an insurable interest in one of several classes of property insured under a single policy is grounds for voiding an entire policy.under missouri law 
w here the policy separates the property insured into distinct classes and specifies the amount of insurance upon each,the contract is severable into as many contracts as there are separate classes of property insured on separate valuations,and the fact that the policy may be void as to the insurance on one class will not necessarily impair its validity as to another.
