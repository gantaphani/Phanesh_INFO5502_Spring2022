on this petition for peremptory writ of mandate petition we are presented with the question of whether compliance with the provisions of civil code section,part of the employment agency,employment counseling,and job listing services act employment agency act div,pt,tit,et exempts petitioner an independent home support service,aihss,a referral agency that provides domestic workers to individuals and entities,from state law requirements of maintaining workers compensation insurance for the domestic workers.we conclude that by complying with the terms of section such referral agencies are deemed not to be the employers,for the purposes of workers compensation,of the domestic workers they refer.accordingly,we issue a writ of mandate directing the respondent superior court of san diego county to vacate its order granting real party in interest state compensation insurance fund state fund motion to strike references in aihss complaint to civil code section,civil code section,and unemployment insurance code section.
factual and procedural background 
aihss is a domestic agency as defined in section,subdivision h.it provides a referral service to individuals and entities that require the services of a domestic worker,typically for an elderly or infirm family member.the company has a roster or pool of between and domestic workers.patients who need home care assistance are often referred to aihss by hospitals at the time they discharge an individual,and,if the patient care custodian is unable or unwilling to administer to his or her needs,the patient may call aihss.aihss will then refer a domestic worker for an interview with the patient.
the domestic worker is free to accept or decline the engagement and negotiate the hourly rate of pay.the domestic worker submits biweekly invoices to aihss,which are approved by the care recipient.aihss is responsible for collecting sums due the domestic worker.receipts are deposited in a separate dedicated trust account,and the domestic worker is paid from this account.
in february the california department of industrial relations,division of labor standards enforcement the department conducted an investigation of aihss offices.as a result of the investigation,the department determined that aihss was employing three office workers for which it had not obtained workers compensation insurance in violation of the law.thereafter,after a hearing before the labor commissioner,that determination was upheld as to two employees.as to the third,that individual was determined to be not subject to workers compensation insurance because that employee was a shareholder,officer and director of aihss.
aihss obtained workers compensation insurance from state fund on behalf of the two office workers.state fund then performed an underwriting inspection of aihss business.as a result of the inspection,state fund advised aihss it had determined that the domestic workers referred to patients by aihss were employees of aihss for workers compensation purposes.according to aihss,this determination would raise its monthly workers compensation premiums from approximately per month to as high as per month.
aihss appealed that determination to state fund san diego district office,asserting that the domestic workers were independent contractors,not employees,under section and the test set forth in borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,borello.state fund denied the appeal,finding that the domestic workers were considered employees of aihss for workers compensation purposes.in doing so,state fund did not discuss the applicability of section or borello.
aihss appealed state fund decision to the insurance commissioner.aihss was informed that as of june the insurance commissioner no longer heard appeals pertaining to a worker status as employee or independent contractor.
aihss then filed a complaint against state fund for declaratory relief,breach of contract and injunctive relief,alleging that its domestic workers were independent contractors under section and borello.in the complaint,it supported its allegations in part by referring to and relying on section,subdivision h,which defines domestic agencies,and unemployment insurance code section,which provides when a company such as aihss is considered an employer of domestic workers for unemployment insurance purposes.
in november state fund filed a motion to strike all references in the complaint to civil code sections,subdivision h,and unemployment insurance code section.state fund argued that these code sections were irrelevant as the legislature did not intend that they apply to workers compensation insurance,but only to unemployment insurance.
the court agreed with state fund and granted the motion to strike,finding 
these provisions pertain to the interpretation and applicability of unemployment insurance,not workers compensation,which is at issue here.the workers compensation act is liberally construed to extend benefits to persons injured in their employment.citation.the tests to determine whether there is an employment relationship have been established through case law.
this petition followed.
discussion 
aihss asserts that its compliance with section exempts it from state law requirements of maintaining workers compensation insurance for the domestic workers it refers to patients,and therefore the court erred in granting state fund motion to strike.we conclude that compliance with the requirements of section does exempt aihss from maintaining workers compensation insurance for its domestic workers.therefore we grant aihss petition seeking to set aside the court order granting state fund motion to strike 
standard of review 
because we are called upon to construe a statutory scheme,we accord no deference to the trial court determination.instead,we apply de novo review to the issues posed by this action.radian guaranty,garamendi th,d.
ii.principles of statutory interpretation 
in interpreting a statute where the language is clear,courts must follow its plain meaning.citation.however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d,see also harris capital growth investors xiv cal d.
iii.analysis 
section unambiguously applies to workers compensation 
aihss asserts that the court erred in striking from its complaint references to section and other relevant statutes because its compliance with the terms of section meant it was deemed not to be the employer for workers compensation purposes of domestic workers it refers to clients.we conclude that the plain language of section demonstrates that it was intended to apply to workers compensation insurance,not,as state fund asserts and the court found,only unemployment insurance.
section,subdivision b provides in part an employment agency is not the employer of a domestic worker for whom it procures,offers,refers,provides,or attempts to provide work,if all of the following factors characterize the nature of the relationship between the employment agency and the domestic worker for whom the agency procures,offers,refers,provides,or attempts to provide domestic work italics added.section,subdivision b then sets forth nine different requirements that the employment agency must comply with in order for it not to be considered the employer of the domestic worker,subd.b.
of relevance to this appeal is subdivision d of section,which provides for the following written notice the employment agency must give to each domestic worker an employment agency referring a domestic worker to a job shall inform that domestic worker,in writing,on or before the signing of the contract pursuant to paragraph of subdivision b,that the domestic worker may be obligated to obtain business permits or licenses,where required by any state or local law,ordinance,or regulation,and that he or she is not eligible for unemployment insurance,state disability insurance,social security,or workers compensation benefits through an employment agency complying with subdivision b.the employment agency referring a domestic worker shall also inform that domestic worker,if the domestic worker is,that he or she is required to pay tax,state tax,and federal income taxes.italics added.
further,subdivision f of section provides an employment agency referring a domestic worker to a job shall orally communicate to the person seeking domestic services the disclosure set forth below prior to the referral of the domestic worker the following disclosure statement name of agency is not the employer of the domestic worker it referred to you.depending on your arrangement with the domestic worker,you may have employer responsibilities.within three business days after the employment agency refers a domestic worker to the person seeking domestic services,the following statement printed in not less than type shall be mailed to the person seeking domestic services name of agency is not the employer of the domestic worker it referred to you.the domestic worker may be your employee or an independent contractor depending on the relationship you have with him or her.if you direct and control the manner and means by which the domestic worker performs his or her work you may have employer responsibilities,including employment taxes and workers compensation,under state and federal law.for additional information contact your local employment development department and the internal revenue service.italics added.
contrary to the contention of state fund,and the findings of the court,nothing in the plain language of section limits its application to unemployment insurance.subdivision b states that a referral agency that complies with its terms is not considered the employer.further,there is no rational reason and state fund posits none why the legislature would require the agencies to notify domestic workers that they will not receive workers compensation benefits from the agency if section did not apply to workers compensation insurance.if state fund interpretation were accepted,such notices would in effect be false and would confuse domestic workers as to who was responsible for providing workers compensation insurance.rather,that notice and the notice required to be given to the clients hiring domestic workers were intended to make clear who was responsible for that obligation.in clear language,the legislature mandated that domestic workers be informed that the referral agency was not responsible for providing workers compensation insurance and domestic workers and the clients hiring them be informed that one or the other of them would be responsible for workers compensation insurance,depending upon the nature of their relationship.the plain language of section demonstrates it applies to workers compensation insurance.
moreover,the items that the employment agencies must comply with to be deemed not the employer of a domestic worker are the same type of factors that would compel a finding that a company or individual was not the employer of a worker for workers compensation purposes under common law tests.in order to be considered not an employer for purposes of section,employment agencies must,among other things,allow the domestic worker to sign with other employment agencies and work for persons not referred by the employment agency allow the domestic worker to select or reject any work referred by the employment agency allow the domestic worker to negotiate the amount of pay for the work referred not provide training to the domestic worker allow the domestic worker to perform his or her work without any direction,control,or supervision exercised by the employment agency with respect to the manner and means of performing the domestic work not provide tools,supplies,or equipment necessary to perform the domestic work incur no obligation to pay the domestic worker if the person for whom the services were performed fails or refuses to pay for the domestic work and not have the power to terminate the domestic worker from his or her employment with the person to which the domestic worker was referred,subd.b.
in borello,supra,cal d,the california supreme court discussed the factors relevant to determining if an individual is an employee or independent contractor for workers compensation insurance.of primary importance was whether the person to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired citations.id.at.the high court also indicated that the right to discharge at will without cause is strong evidence of an relationship.ibid.other factors relevant to the determination,derived largely from the restatement second of agency,include a whether the one performing services is engaged in a distinct occupation or business b the kind of occupation,with reference to whether,in the locality,the work is usually done under the direction of the principal or by a specialist without supervision c the skill required in the particular occupation d whether the principal or the worker supplies the instrumentalities,tools,and the place of work for the person doing the work e the length of time for which the services are to be performed f the method of payment,whether by the time or by the job g whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the principal and h whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relationship of.borello,supra,at.
finally,the supreme court noted that other jurisdictions apply a test involving six criteria.borello,supra,cal d at.the court explained,besides the right to control the work,the factors include the alleged employee opportunity for profit or loss depending on his managerial skill the alleged employee investment in equipment or materials required for his task,or his employment of helpers whether the service rendered requires a special skill the degree of permanence of the working relationship and whether the service rendered is an integral part of the alleged employer business.id.at.
thus,the standards an employment agency must meet to not be considered an employer under section would compel the conclusion under the common law test that that it was not an employer of domestic workers for workers compensation purposes.this is also compelling evidence the legislature,in enacting section,intended that employment agencies that met the requirements of that section were not employers for workers compensation purposes.the reason such agencies are required to give notice to domestic workers they refer that they are not their employer and not responsible for unemployment insurance,state disability insurance,social security,and workers compensation is that compliance with section terms renders domestic referral agencies not the employer of domestic workers for all of these obligations.
state fund raises numerous arguments why the plain language of section does not mean what its states.state fund argues aihss interpretation of section is incorrect because the workers compensation act must be liberally construed in favor of awarding workers compensation benefits workers compensation is an exclusive and complete system and therefore there is no authority for applying section to workers compensation insurance section does not provide an exclusive remedy a review of legislative history compels the conclusion that section does not absolve employment agencies of liability for workers compensation insurance and the relevant language in section results from a scrivener error.we address these contentions in order.
liberal construction of the workers compensation act 
it is true that the workers compensation act act must be liberally construed to extend benefits to persons injured in their employment.borello,supra,cal d at.the act intends comprehensive coverage of injuries in employment.it accomplishes this goal by defining employment broadly in terms of service to an employer and by including a general presumption that any person in service to another is a covered employee.id.at.
however,this does not mean that all relationships are covered.an employer is defined as e very person including any public service corporation,which has any natural person in service,subd.c,italics added.an employee is defined as every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,whether lawfully or unlawfully employed,italics added.
however,an independent contractor,who is defined as a person who renders service for a specified recompense for a specified result,under the control of his principal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is accomplished,is not covered.gonzalez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the law clearly provides that labor code section presumption of employee status is overcome if the essential contract of hire,express or implied,is not present under labor code section.barragan workers comp.appeals bd.d.
thus,to be covered an individual must be in the service of an employer and not an independent contractor.there is nothing in section that contradicts the act if it deems employment agencies that meet certain criteria not to be employers of domestic workers they refer and determines that the domestic workers may be in the service of the client,not the agency.this is the purpose of the required disclosure to the domestic worker that the agency is not responsible for workers compensation insurance,and the disclosure to the client that it may be considered an employer responsible for workers compensation insurance,unless the domestic worker is an independent contractor as to the client.thus,section is consistent with the act.
c.the act as an exclusive and complete system 
state fund asserts that section can not carve out certain relationships from coverage under the act because of the complete and exclusive coverage of the act that covers every person and does not allow for the exemptions claimed by aihss.thus,state fund argues an exemption or exclusion from the act must be found in the act itself,not statutes outside of its parameters.this contention is unavailing.
state fund provides no authority for its position that any exclusions must be found in the act itself.indeed,one test in determining whether an individual comes under the act purview or is an independent contractor is whether there are any other specific statutory exclusions.johnson workmen comp.appeals bd.d,italics added.
further,contrary to state fund assertion,courts are permitted to scour the various codes to determine if a person is an employee under workers compensation law.labor code section,which is not part of the labor code section governing workers compensation,makes a unlicensed contractor who is performing work for which a license is required an employee of the hirer of the unlicensed contractor for purposes of workers compensation insurance.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.as the california supreme reasoned there we have concluded that labor code section,including the penultimate paragraph,must be interpreted as applying to workers compensation cases.although labor code section states that the division is not applicable to workers compensation but only to other matters,labor code section was adopted in,and the subsequent enactment and amendment of labor code section,including the last paragraph,show clearly that it was intended to have an effect in workers compensation cases.the subsequently enacted special provision takes precedence over the general provision.citations.the presence of a provision affecting workers compensation in a division not intended to affect workers compensation is clearly explained in the legislative history.while the bill when introduced may not have been intended to affect workers compensation principles,it was thereafter amended so that the principles set forth in the bill would apply to workers compensation cases.state compensation ins.fund.workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.thus,our supreme court has concluded that a division of the labor code outside that governing workers compensation,which explicitly stated that it was not to apply to workers compensation matters,nevertheless did.
further,the penal code has sections that determine workers compensation coverage for certain prisoners engaged in forced labor.under penal code sections and,county prisoners,when engaged in compulsory work,are only entitled to worker compensation coverage if engaged in prevention and suppression of forest,brush and grass fires.parsons workers comp.appeals bd.d.
thus,we may properly look outside the division of the labor code governing workers compensation to determine if an individual or entity is exempted or included within the requirement that employers carry workers compensation insurance.
lack of exclusive remedy under section 
state fund asserts that because the employment agency act,of which section is a part,does not provide an exclusive remedy,domestic workers may still claim to be employees for workers compensation purposes.this contention is irrelevant to the issue before the court.
it is true,as state fund points out,that the provisions of the employment agency act are not exclusive and do not relieve the parties subject to this title from the duty to comply with all other applicable laws,subd.e.section,subdivision f provides that t he remedies provided in this title are not exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies or procedures provided in any other law.
but state fund contention misses the point.domestic workers that would potentially fall within the confines of section are free to assert that they are employees of an employment agency for workers compensation purposes because it has not complied with the requirements of that section and therefore is considered an employer.further,they may claim to be employees,not independent contractors,of the person or entity hiring them for care,depending upon the nature of the particular employment relationship.if they are considered to be employees of person or entity hiring them,they may pursue any remedy available under the workers compensation act.however,employment agencies that comply with the terms of section are not employers of domestic workers and therefore the workers compensation act and its remedies have no application.
resort to secondary sources to interpret section 
state funds contends that because the term employer in section lends itself to several interpretations,we must look to the legislative history of the employment agency act,which shows that it was not intended to apply to workers compensation insurance.we first conclude that because the term employer is not vague or ambiguous,it is not necessary to resort to the legislative history of the act to resolve this petition.moreover,even if it were proper to consider the legislative history of section,it supports the conclusion that section was intended to apply to workers compensation purposes.
section,subdivision f provides the definition of an employer of a domestic worker as any individual,company,partnership,association,corporation,agent,employee,or representative for whom or for which an employment agency or job listing service attempts to obtain an employee or to place a jobseeker.thus,in the employment agency act,the person who seeks and receives the services of a domestic worker is considered the domestic worker employer,not the agency referring the worker.further,as discussed above,if an employment agency complies with section requirements,it is not considered an employer under the employment agency act for specific responsibilities including workers compensation insurance.state fund does not point to anything in section,or the employment agency act in general,that makes the term employer ambiguous.
accordingly,we can not consider the legislative history of section because,i n determining intent,we look first to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citation.hunt superior court cal th,d.only when the language of a statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction is it appropriate to turn to extrinsic aids,including the legislative history of the measure,to ascertain its meaning.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.
moreover,even if section reference to employer were vague and ambiguous,a resort to the legislative history of the employment agency act does not support state fund position that it was intended to apply to only unemployment insurance.
in the regular session of the legislature,assembly bill was introduced,seeking to amend certain portions of section.the proposed amendments,among other things,would have increased the disclosure requirements of referral agencies.an assembly bill analysis of the proposed amendments reveals that the legislature understood,as recently as june of,that under section employment agencies were not considered employers for workers compensation purposes 
the stated purpose of this bill is to clarify the differences between domestic referral agencies and employers of domestic services.in this industry,there are two general types of businesses.first,some businesses that provide domestic services are the actual employers of the domestic workers that are placed in an individual home.as such,the company is responsible for,among other things,employment tax withholding and the provision of workers compensation coverage.the second type of business generally procures employment for others by the placement of domestic help in private homes.these businesses are sometimes referred to as employment agencies or referral agencies.existing law provides that the referral agency will not be deemed to be the employer of the domestic worker if certain factors characterize the nature of the relationship between the referral agency and the domestic worker.in such a situation,the domestic worker will either be an employee of the client or an independent contractor.this determination depends on a common law test for determining whether there is an employment relationship.the most important factor is whether the client directs and controls the manner and means by which the domestic worker performs his or her work.if the client is deemed to be the employer of the domestic worker,the client may have employer responsibilities,including employment taxes and workers compensation.assem.com.on labor and employment,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.april,italics added.
proponents of the bill,in arguing for the need for the increased disclosures to domestic workers the amendments would provide,also demonstrated an understanding that agencies that complied with section,and thus were not deemed employers of domestic workers,were not responsible for workers compensation insurance,and the hiring party,depending on the relationship with the worker,might be 
the most important factor in determining whether a domestic worker is an employee or an independent contractor is whether the client directs and controls the manner and means by which the domestic worker performs his or her work.if the client is deemed to be the employer of the domestic worker,the client may have employer responsibilities,including employment taxes and workers compensation.if a referral agency does not disclose the fact that it is not the employer,or that the consumer entering into the contractual relationship with the domestic worker may be the employer,the consumer may mistakenly believe that the domestic worker is an employee of the referral agency,while the worker may assume that the agency or consumer is responsible for employment taxes and workers compensation insurance.thus,the consumer may unwittingly face potential tax liability and penalties,and the domestic worker may not be protected from unemployment,injury on the job,or disability because employment taxes were not paid.com.on labor and industrial relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.june,italics added.
this legislative history demonstrates that the legislature understood in discussing the proposed amendments to section that referral agencies that complied with its terms were not employers and thus not responsible for workers compensation insurance and the client hiring domestic workers might have the responsibility for providing workers compensation insurance,depending upon the client relationship with the domestic worker.
assembly bill passed both houses of the legislature,but was later vetoed by the governor in his veto message the governor also demonstrated an understanding that section applied to workers compensation insurance 
this bill requires duplicative reporting for agencies which provide referral services for domestic employees.current law already provides sufficient reporting requirements to ensure that those who hire domestic workers are well aware of their obligations to pay taxes and procure workers compensation insurance.governor veto message to assem.on assem.bill,reg.sess,italics added.
thus,not only the legislature,but also the governor understood,long after section was originally enacted,that it was intended to define employment relationships for workers compensation purposes.as the most recent expression of the meaning of this statute,we give these statements considerable weight.
state fund points to the legislative history of assembly bill which,among other things,enacted section in.although some statements in that history on their face lend some support state fund position,a more analysis results in the conclusion that section was intended to cover workers compensation insurance.
state fund first points to the stated purpose of assembly bill that was 
t o clarify existing law and to resolve the dispute between domestic employment agencies and the employment development department regarding the proper interpretation and application of relevant provisions of the unemployment insurance code,the employment agency,employment counseling,and job listing services act with respect to the characterization of domestic employment agencies as agents and not employers of the domestic workers they refer.stats,ch,italics added.
state fund asserts that because this statement does not mention workers compensation insurance,it was not intended to apply to such matters.state fund also asserts that because there was no preexisting conflict or ambiguity in the law over whether domestic referral agencies were employers for workers compensation purposes,it can not be interpreted as applying to such matters.these contentions are unavailing.
the assembly committee on finance,insurance and public indebtedness commented that assembly bill was intended to be declaratory of existing law decided in avchen kid d oo d.avchen.assem.com.on finance,insurance and public indebtedness,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
the court of appeal in avchen,supra,d at pages,held that a nurses registry was not an employer of nurses for purposes of unemployment insurance because of the lack of control over the nurses by the registry and because the predecessor to the employment agency act and other statutes explicitly defined the nature of the relationship between nurses and their registries as one of agency,not employment.as stated by the senate rules committee,proponents of assembly bill stated that many referral agencies operate in a manner consistent with the principles of the avchen decision and want to codify these principles in statute as they apply to domestic referral agencies.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
state fund argues that as avchen involved unemployment insurance,not workers compensation,assembly bill could only be read as clarifying the law in that limited area.however,in the case riley southwest marine,d.riley,the court of appeal applied avchen to a workers compensation case.in riley,the plaintiff was retained by manpower,a labor broker,which sent riley to work at southwest marine as a general laborer.southwest marine provided all the training,equipment and supervision.manpower
