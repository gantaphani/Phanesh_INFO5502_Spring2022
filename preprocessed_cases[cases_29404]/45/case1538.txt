kent had sold life insurance for approximately years and operated his own insurance business,kent insurance,for six years before he agreed in to serve as the exclusive agent for the independent community bankers association icb in its search for a health insurance provider.kent first contracted with central life insurance company central to provide health insurance for icb,but in august central informed kent that it would no longer offer group coverage and that he needed to find a new provider.kent approached united later that year and it was agreed after negotiations that united would provide health insurance for icb beginning in january and that it would designate kent as the insurance agent for these transactions kent received an fee from united for the icb account,and he rebated a portion of his fee to icb.
in late kent initiated talks with united about converting the fully insured icb health insurance plan into one that would be self insured and using his financial services entity,kent financial,as the plan sponsor.although some member banks had expressed an interest in a self insured policy,kent did not tell icb that he was discussing conversion of the health insurance plan with united nor did he inform united that he did not have authorization from icb for the proposed conversion.he discussed the conversion with united regional manager,dick norberg,who sought advice from its legal department about the self insured plan.norberg then told kent about requirements for converting the plan,such as the need for new descriptive materials and a joint checking account with kent.they agreed that the plan sponsor would be required to maintain a sufficient reserve while united would provide stoploss coverage for excessive losses and services pursuant to an administrative services only agreement.norberg also informed kent that united legal department considered it likely that his practice of rebating a portion of his fee to icb was illegal.
although kent never told icb that he had switched the plan into one that was self insured and still had not informed united that icb had not authorized the conversion,united and kent began treating the icb plan as being self insured beginning in january.united sent kent a contract for the administrative services provision later that month,but kent did not sign it because it listed icb as the plan sponsor and not him.united also sent kent a check made out to icb for based on unused premiums paid in,and kent deposited the check in the joint account he had opened with united.kent withdrew per month from the joint account as his fee and used the account to pay claims for the year.
the legal department at united continued examining the legality of the self insured plan after it had been implemented.norberg sent kent a letter on february,saying that the self insured plan put united at risk financially and legally and that kent could also be at risk for operating an insurance company without a license.norberg proposed that icb instead operate on a minimum premium plan and advised kent to talk to his own attorney.kent met with his attorney and called norberg in late february to request that the icb plan be converted to a minimum premium plan.
united never converted the plan into a minimum premium plan and did not immediately inform kent that it continued to treat the icb plan as one that was self insured.it sent kent a check in may that was again made out to icb for repayment of unused premiums,and kent deposited it in the joint account.after receiving additional documents in july and august listing icb as the plan sponsor for a self insured plan,kent requested a meeting with united.kent told united for the first time at that meeting that he had never been given the authority to convert the icb plan into a self insured plan and that icb did not know that it was operating under such a plan.united then reinstated the fully funded plan retroactive to january,and kent forwarded funds to united in the amount of the two checks that had been made payable to it.united terminated the coverage at the end of,and icb terminated its relationship with kent at the same time.
after icb learned that its plan had been converted into a self funded plan,it filed lawsuits against both united and kent seeking monetary damages.kent responded by seeking indemnification from united.a settlement was reached in september under which united agreed to pay icb and kent agreed to pay it.a settlement agreement was signed by all three parties which released any and all claims which either have been or could have been raised by any party against the other relating to icb health insurance in and.
the state insurance division also commenced proceedings.as a result,united agreed to a penalty of,and an administrative law judge recommended that kent insurance license be revoked.the insurance division revoked the license in august,concluding that kent had deliberately concealed from icb that he was converting its fully insured plan into a self insured plan and that he had also withheld from united the fact that he was acting without authority from icb.kent appealed to the state circuit court which held that the revocation was justified,and the south dakota supreme court affirmed.see kent lyon.kent later reapplied for a new license,and the insurance division issued one in,based in part on the fact that kent had paid back to united the total amount of the premium checks he had deposited in his own account.
the united states attorney also initiated a criminal investigation into kent relationship with icb and united.a count indictment issued in indicting kent for mail fraud and money laundering.kent was found guilty by a jury on two of the mail fraud counts which charged that the mails had been used to deposit the icb checks into the joint account.at trial kent former secretary and norberg both testified that the mails had been used,but prior to sentencing kent began to question whether the checks had actually been sent through a private courier.kent sought to obtain the shipping records from united,but it would not release the documents without a subpoena.the district court declined kent request for a subpoena,and the government did not consent to one.kent never sought a subpoena from the clerk of court but instead filed a motion for a new trial.attached to the motion were his former secretary affidavit stating that her testimony had been in error and evidence from his own records indicating that a private courier had been used to deliver one of the checks.the court denied kent motion for a new trial and sentenced him to months imprisonment.
after completing his sentence kent filed a habeas petition and served a subpoena on united for the shipping documents.united complied with the subpoena,providing evidence that both checks had been sent through united parcel service ups.his mail fraud convictions were subsequently vacated.kent also sued the lawyer who had represented him in the criminal court for malpractice and settled his claim for.
kent alleges in this case that united had a fiduciary relationship with him which it breached and that it violated the south dakota statute on deceit.his complaint further alleged that united was liable for the revocation of his insurance license because it failed to inform him in of the legal problems associated with a self insured plan and because it delayed in informing him that it had not converted the self insured plan into a minimum premium plan.kent also seeks to hold united responsible for his loss of liberty due to the mail fraud convictions.he points out that the convictions were vacated because the checks had in reality been sent by ups rather than through the mails.when he tried to get proof of this before his sentencing,united refused to produce the evidence without a subpoena.kent complains that united had a fiduciary duty to turn over the shipping documents to him and that norberg had deceitfully misled the jury into concluding that the checks had been mailed.
in support of his loss of license claim,kent testified at trial that he would not have converted the icb plan into one that was self insured had he been informed of risks of which united was aware.he also testified that united told him to deposit the checks made payable to icb into their joint account and that he had assumed that a minimum premium plan was in place for icb through the summer months of.kent said he had asked norberg for advice as to whether he should proceed with the self insured plan,and norberg told him it would be no problem even though he knew it involved a great amount of legal risk.kent also told the jury that he had made it known during that he thought the plan was being converted to a minimum premium plan and that he continued to assume that the plan had been converted as late as august because united was slow with paper work.as for the loss of liberty claim,kent testified about his difficulties while incarcerated and the effect his imprisonment had on his family.kent also sought to establish that united had not given him the shipping documents for fear of reprisal from the government.
the district court allowed the loss of license and liberty claims to go to the jury.over united objection the court instructed the jury that united owed a fiduciary duty to kent and that a fiduciary duty is to act in the utmost good faith.the instruction was not charge specific nor time specific.the jury returned a verdict in favor of kent for in damages.it awarded million for his loss of liberty million in punitive damages and million for the loss of his insurance license million in punitive damages.united moved for judgment as a matter of law on all claims.the court granted its motion for the loss of liberty claim after concluding that any special relationship between kent and united had ended before the criminal trial and that united had no duty to give kent the shipping documents without a subpoena.the district court also reduced the punitive damage award on the loss of license claim to million,leaving kent with a million judgment.both parties appealed.
united appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on kent loss of license claim.it argues that kent claim based on breach of fiduciary duty and deceit could not prevail because kent and united never had a fiduciary relationship and it was not responsible for the loss of his license.it also maintains that the loss of license claim is barred by collateral estoppel,the statute of limitations,the terms of the release,and public policy.kent responds that his license would not have been revoked but for united conduct and that the district court correctly determined that its affirmative defenses failed.
kent cross appeals the judgment concerning his loss of liberty claim.he argues that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict holding united responsible for his loss of liberty while he was imprisoned for mail fraud.he argues that united had a duty to provide him with the shipping documents due to norberg inaccurate testimony and its fiduciary relationship with him.united responds that no fiduciary relationship existed and certainly not at the time of the criminal proceedings.it also argues that the deceit claim fails as a matter of law because no united representative made a statement on which kent relied to his detriment.
we turn first to united appeal and its argument that the district court should have entered judgment in its favor on kent loss of license claim because it is barred by collateral estoppel since the south dakota supreme court conclusively determined that kent own dishonest conduct justified revocation of his license.kent responds that united can be held legally responsible in this proceeding because the question of whether its misconduct caused revocation of his license was not at issue in the state proceedings and because an adverse result can have more than one legal cause.
the parties also disagree about the appropriate standard of review for the issue of collateral estoppel.kent argues that we should review the district court decision not to apply collateral estoppel for an abuse of discretion,citing berger transfer storage central states pension fund,cir.in berger transfer,we indicated that district courts have discretion whether to apply offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel.id.that doctrine applies when a plaintiff is attempting to prevent a defendant from pursuing an issue that the defendant previously litigated and lost to a different plaintiff.see parklane hosiery shore,d.the scenario here is different,however,because defendant united is seeking to prevent plaintiff kent from relitigating an issue.united is thus seeking to apply collateral estoppel defensively.kent has cited no supporting authority for his argument that the district court rejection of united collateral estoppel defense should be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard even though united was not a party to the earlier proceedings.see,of,d.the appropriate standard for our review is de novo.robinette jones,cir.
for kent to prevail on either his fiduciary duty or deceit claim that united is responsible for the loss of his insurance license,he must prove that united caused him to lose his license.see,glover,causation is element of claim for breach of fiduciary duty same for statutory deceit claim.kent can not prevail on these claims if it was established in the state revocation proceedings that it was his own misconduct and dishonesty that caused the insurance division to revoke his insurance license rather than the conduct of united.see shevling butte county bd.of comm rs,collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues previously litigated.the principles of collateral estoppel are fully applicable where the basic set of facts was established during state administrative proceedings.see gottschalk state real estate comm n.
based on evidence presented to the insurance division,the south dakota supreme court concluded that kent had violated seven provisions of the insurance code and that the decision to revoke his license was not too harsh a penalty based on kent misrepresentations,fraudulent conduct,and general dishonesty.kent lyon,the court found specifically that kent made material misrepresentations to united about his authority,that he fraudulently concealed material facts from icb,and that he evinced a dishonesty in the manner in which he conducted his affairs.id.at.the court also concluded that kent can not now blame united because it was his responsibility to inform icb of the change in its policy,id.at,and that united conduct was far less egregious than his.id.at.
kent had full opportunity during the revocation proceedings to argue that his license should not be revoked because it was not his fault or was instead caused by united conduct,and all four state decisions concluded that his own conduct constituted sufficient cause for revocation of his license.application of collateral estoppel in such circumstances prevents inconsistent judicial decisions from being made on the same set of facts,and kent argument that united was the cause of his license revocation is a collateral attack on the earlier judgment.frigaard seffens.the state supreme court concluded that kent misconduct supplied more than sufficient grounds for the revocation,kent,at,and he can not blame united for the revocation nor relitigate that conclusion in this action.see shevling,at.
kent raises two additional arguments as to why collateral estoppel is inapplicable in this case,but neither merits extended discussion.he persua
