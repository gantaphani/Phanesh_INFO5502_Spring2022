ii.background 
reyes lived across the street from cedillo.reyes roof needed repairing.so reyes hired cedillo to repair the roof.cedillo in turn hired rodriguez to repair reyes roof.rodriguez began working for cedillo in june.rodriguez worked three to four days a week and was paid per day by cedillo for work at different locations.on july,rodriguez began working at reyes home.rodriguez had worked approximately hours on reyes roof,for.on july,rodriguez crossed the street to return supplies from reyes residence to cedillo home.while crossing the street,rodriguez was struck by a car.a workers compensation judge concluded as an unlicensed contractor,cedillo was not an independent contractor hence,cedillo was an employee of reyes and rodriguez was an employee of the homeowner,reyes.the practical effort of the workers compensation judge ruling was that reyes homeowner insurance was to pay benefits to rodriguez.state farm fire casualty workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
reyes and his insurer,specialty risk services the insurer,filed a reconsideration petition challenging the workers compensation judge finding that rodriguez was an employee of the homeowner.the board granted the reconsideration petition.the board concluded that rodriguez was not an employee of reyes.the board reasoned rodriguez did not spend hours working on reyes roof.labor code section,subdivision h excludes from coverage as an employee,a person working less than hours for an employer during a specified period.the board further concluded that rodriguez was cedillo employee.the board found that section did not impose liability against reyes as the employer based on cedillo unlicensed status.the board held a s between cedillo,the alleged contractor,and reyes,homeowner,cedillo would be an employee under labor code section.however,because cedillo has no claim against reyes and does not meet the hour requirement of labor code section h,anymore than the applicant meets the hour requirement,under division,cedillo can not be an employee.therefore,we are not required to revert to the definition of cedillo,as an employee,as set forth in labor code section.therefore,cedillo is the employer of applicant.the board directed the director to pay benefits to rodriguez if cedillo did not provide benefits.on may,the director filed a reconsideration petition before the board.the results of the director may,petition will be discussed later.
on may,cedillo filed a certiorari petition with this court pursuant to section cedillo argued the board erroneously refused to apply section and find that rodriguez was an employee of reyes refused to apply section to find cedillo was an employee of reyes refused to apply section and hold that reyes stepped into the shoes of cedillo found that cedillo was the employer of rodriguez found that rodriguez was injured while employed by cedillo failed to find that cedillo was not liable to rodriguez failed to find that reyes is liable for rodriguez injuries failed to find that the insurer is liable to rodriguez applied section,subdivision h in a manner that undermined section and made findings in a manner inconsistent with the liberal construction mandated by section.on may,reyes and the insurer answered cedillo petition for review.the may,answer argued section is a general statute dealing with employment section,subdivision h is a specific statute dealing with residential employees and notwithstanding section,section,subdivision h read in conjunction with section,subdivision d provided an exception or exclusion to those persons who performed services at the residence of a homeowner where the worker worked less than hours or earned less than in the calendar days immediately preceding the date of injury.
the director and reyes requested we stay further action on cedillo may,certiorari petition pending the board ruling on a reconsideration petition.on september,we denied the stay requests.the pending reconsideration petition had been filed by the director.we also advised the parties by letter that we would delay decision until the board had issued a decision of the director reconsideration petition.
on october,the board advised us it had denied the director reconsideration petition on july.the board found decisional authority requires sections and,subdivision h be read together a section employee may be excluded as an employee under section,subdivision h in state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,california supreme court held that section,subdivision h applies to unlicensed contractors and excludes from coverage the person who has worked less than the required hours at a residence section,subdivision d exempted from its coverage the provisions of section,subdivision h,which in turn excluded from its coverage persons who have worked less that the requisite hours at the residence even though the homeowner is shielded from liability under the exclusions,an unlicensed contractor may still be an employer for purposes of injuries to an employee if an unlicensed contractor is uninsured,the director is subject to liability and section does not alter or limit but rather supplements sections,subdivision h or,subdivision d which were in existence when section was enacted.
iii.discussion 
the issue here is whether the board properly interpreted section and section,subdivision h in concluding rodriguez was not an employee of reyes.we review the board statutory interpretations de novo and where an examination of a factual determination is required,they are reviewed for substantial evidence.smith workers comp.appeals bd.th,d save mart stores workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.section provides in part there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker performing services for which a license is required pursuant to chapter commencing with section of division of the business and professions code,or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license is an employee rather than an independent contractor in addition to the factors contained in subdivisions a,b,and c,any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to chapter commencing with section of division of the business and professions code shall hold a valid contractors license as a condition of having independent contractor status.for purposes of workers compensation law,this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor,and is not intended to lessen the coverage of employees under division and division.
section applies in workers compensation cases even though it appears in division of the labor code rather than in division or.division or sets forth the workers compensation statutes.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at,furtado schriefer d.rinaldi workers comp.appeals bd.d.for workers compensation purposes,under section,the hirer of a contractor for a job requiring a license is the statutory employer of the unlicensed contractor.in addition,the hirer is the statutory employer of those workers employed by the unlicensed contractor.hernandez chavez roofing,d.neighbours buzz oates enterprises d.nick hagopian drywall workers comp.appeals bd.d.section unequivocally provides that a person lacking the requisite license may not claim to be an independent contractor.state compensati
