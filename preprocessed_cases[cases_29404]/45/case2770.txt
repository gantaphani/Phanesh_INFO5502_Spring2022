background 
the underlying complaints 
the two underlying complaints,both filed in circuit courts of mississippi,contain the same charging allegations both allege the plaintiffs worked in,or were otherwise exposed to,silica at and throughout their employment and f or many years were exposed to dust and suffered serious and permanent bodily injuries as a result of their exposure to silica and silica dust.the complaints continue,during their work life,p laintiffs were injured and damaged through the sale of products,the use of defective respiratory equipment,and the use of sandblasting equipment and other devices necessary to carry out what is commonly known as sandblasting.during a sandblasting operation,dust is created which includes particles that are invisible to the human eye,but which particles are inhaled by workers in a very large area surrounding the sandblasting operation.this dust does not fall to the ground but,in fact,is suspended in the air and travels over a large distance,subjecting many workers in the area to an unreasonable risk of harm.
the complaints name defendants,including claimant pauli systems,who are collectively alleged to have designed,tested,evaluated,manufactured,mined,packaged,furnished,supplied sold abrasive blasting products,protective gear and equipment,safety equipment materials,equipment,products,the complaints further allege the sellers of products failed to provide adequate warnings of the health risks that were reasonably forseeable or scientifically discoverable at the time of the exposure,and that d efendants sold masks and respirators which were wholly inadequate and not approved for blasting operations with products and hoods that were defective by reason of their design,marketing,and their forseeable use or misuse.the complaints contain no allegations describing the nature of claimant business or its particular activities or operations.
the golden eagle policy 
golden eagle issued claimant a commercial general liability insurance policy for the time period in question.the policy provides coverage for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.the pollution exclusion appearing as exclusion in the coverages section of the policy was replaced by a total pollution exclusion endorsement.this endorsement provides that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage which would not have occurred in whole or in part but for the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants at any time.pollutants are defined in the endorsement as any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals and waste.
tender and denial of defense and filing suit 
claimant tendered the defense of both complaints to golden eagle after the liquidation proceedings had been commenced.both tenders were rejected with the following explanation plaintiff brings this action for injuries allegedly incurred as a result of exposure to silica and silica dust.we are denying coverage based upon,but not limited to the total pollution exclusion on the policies.the bodily injury that is alleged to have resulted from the exposure to silica and silica dust is specifically precluded from coverage.claimant thereafter filed two applications pursuant to insurance code section for orders to show cause why the claims should not be allowed.following briefing,the applications were heard and denied on the ground the claims administrator had not abused its discretion in denying coverage.plaintiffs filed timely notices of appeal.
discussion 
because the insurer is in liquidation,the scope of our review of determinations of both the superior court and the liquidation trustees in the resolution of claims by insureds against an insolvent carrier is circumscribed.see generally.our high court has long since observed that such conservation proceedings arise under the broad police powers of the state to insure the reorganization or orderly liquidation of insolvent insurers and the protection of their policyholders and the public.citation.a corollary of that broad power is the judiciary limited scope of inquiry into the liquidation trustees grounds for rejecting claims for compensation by policyholders.as the carpenter pacific mut.life ins.cal d,court put the ruling standard,the only restriction on the exercise of this power to administer liquidation proceedings under the insurance code is that the state action shall be reasonably related to the public interest and shall not be arbitrary or improperly discriminatory.ibid.that seminal formulation has since been glossed repeatedly to mean the measure of judicial review in such proceedings is the familiar abuse of discretion standard.low golden eagle ins.th,d.our review of the liquidation court factual determinations is likewise circumscribed.low golden eagle ins.th,d.
in mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d,mackinnon our supreme court considered at length the derivation and interpretation of a pollution exclusion provision that defined pollution in essentially the same language as contained in claimant golden eagle policy.recognizing that the policy definition of a pollutant as including any irritant or contaminant,read literally,leads to absurd results and ignores the familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion,the court felt it far more reasonable that a policyholder would understand a pollutant as being limited to irritants and contaminants commonly thought of as pollution and not as applying to every possible irritant or contaminant imaginable.id.at,d.the court therefore limited the scope of the pollution exclusion to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution.id.at,d.
applying this standard,the court in mackinnon held that a landlord allegedly negligent use of a pesticide by spraying to eradicate yellow jackets around its apartment building did not come within the scope of the pollution exclusion.the court found it far from clear mackinnon claim for injuries arising from the normal,though negligent,residential application of pesticides,would be commonly thought of as pollution.while pesticides may be pollutants under some circumstances,it is unlikely a reasonable policyholder would think of the act of spraying pesticides under these circumstances as an act of pollution the normal application of pesticides around an apartment building in order to kill yellow jackets would not comport with the common understanding of the word pollute.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.
claimant suggests silica is not a pollutant within the terms of the policy,since it is not smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals or waste,and it is found in many commonplace materials such as sand,glass,concrete and computer chips.but even if silica is not one of the enumerated items listed in the policy definition of pollutants,that listing is not exclusive and silica dust nonetheless comes within the broad definition of any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant.indeed,federal regulations identify silica dust as an air contaminant.see.claimant is correct that under mackinnon the mere fact that silica,like almost anything else,may be an irritant or contaminant under some circumstances is not dispositive.but unlike the residential use of a pesticide for the purpose of killing insects,the widespread dissemination of silica dust as an incidental of industrial sandblastin
