factual and procedural background 
the homeowners association earthquake coverage and northridge earthquake damage claim 
prior to the january,northridge earthquake,state farm issued a condominium association policy with an endorsement for earthquake coverage to the homeowners association insuring a condominium building located at lincoln boulevard,santa monica.the policy in effect from july,to july,had a limit for coverage for damage caused by earthquake of with a percent deductible.
the condominium complex was damaged by the northridge earthquake.by late february the homeowners association had submitted a claim to state farm for damage to the building and common areas of the complex.in march a structural damage appraiser and a state farm claim representative inspected the condominium complex to view the earthquake damage.an initial statement of loss for the homeowner association claim was prepared,which determined the damage to the condominium complex was below the deductible.state farm initial evaluation indicated only in estimated damages.accordingly,by letter dated march,state farm advised the homeowners association it would make no payment on its earthquake damage claim.
the homeowners association hired wagner,hohns inglis whi,an architectural and engineering consulting firm,to prepare its own report regarding damage to the condominium complex from the northridge earthquake.on july,the homeowners association provided state farm with whi report,estimating earthquake damages of,which included approximately to repair the interiors of condominium units.on august,state farm retained pacific gold coast construction pacific to prepare a damage estimate of the earthquake damage to the lincoln fountain villas complex.on august,pacific submitted a damage estimate to state farm totaling,slightly more than the estimate provided by whi.state farm claim file does not indicate state farm ever sent pacific estimate to the homeowners association.
following its receipt of the pacific estimate,state farm met with whi representatives on behalf of the homeowners association.state farm and whi ultimately agreed to as the cost to repair all earthquake damage to the condominium complex including reimbursement of for temporary repairs,a sum that was subsequently increased by several hundred dollars for various minor matters.on september,the homeowners association was paid modified damage figure agreed to by whi and state farm less the percent deductible and without the estimated sum for contractor overhead and profit,which state farm advised the homeowners association would be recoverable if the homeowners association provided a signed contract with a contractor.
the homeowners association retained mceachern company,to repair earthquake damage to the condominium building exterior and common areas as well as to correct a construction defect.mceachern was not asked by the homeowners association to make any repairs to the interiors of individual units.mceachern was paid a total of,including overhead and profit for the work it completed.on september,the homeowners association wrote its members to announce,the earthquake repairs to our building are now complete.the september,letter also explained,considering the amount of work done,the high quality of the repairs and the fact that several longstanding problems that preceded the earthquake were addressed in the course of the repair work,we as owners have faired sic quite well.
the homeowners association complaint for breach of contract and insurance bad faith 
the homeowners association filed a complaint against state farm on april,for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violation of business and professions code section et.on june,the homeowners association filed a first amended complaint asserting only claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the first amended complaint,which seeks both compensatory and punitive damages,alleges state farm failed to investigate properly the homeowners association claim of earthquake damage,failed to evaluate and adjust the claim objectively and failed to pay the full cost to repair the damage caused to the condominium complex by the northridge earthquake.
state farm motion for summary judgment 
on march,state farm moved for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication.in its moving papers state farm argued its policy obligates it to pay its insured only the amount necessary to repair earthquake damage with equivalent construction or the amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged property,whichever is less,and it had in fact paid the homeowners association everything it was due under the insurance contract the homeowners association spent to repair the exterior and common areas of the condominium complex and for temporary repairs those two amounts plus the estimated by whi for interior unit repairs totaled less than the deductible.accordingly,the homeowners association was entitled to no further benefits and had actually obtained a windfall by virtue of state farm payment of on september.
the homeowners association opposition to the summary judgment motion 
the homeowners association filed opposition papers on june,asserting triable issues of material fact exist regarding the adequacy of state farm investigation and evaluation of its earthquake damage issues necessary for resolution of both its breach of contract and bad faith causes of action.according to the homeowners association,based on the evaluation and report of consultants it has retained,state farm failed to identify or did not adequately identify a wide range of damage listed in both its memorandum of points and authorities and its separate statement to the lincoln fountain villas condominium complex caused by the northridge earthquake.the homeowners association also stated its consultants estimate complete repair of the earthquake damage to the complex will cost.as evidentiary support for these assertions,the homeowners association cited in its separate statement to portions of the deposition of ruth mittleman,a of the homeowners association,taken on december,attached as exhibit e to the compendium of exhibits filed in support of the homeowners association opposition to state farm motion and to paragraph of the declaration of glenn rosen,the homeowners association counsel.
paragraph of the rosen declaration describes in general terms the consultants reports referred to in the homeowners association opposition papers but does not attach copies of those reports or provide any detailed information about the consultants work.consultants retained by plaintiff have prepared reports and estimates regarding the nature and cost of repair for the association earthquake damages in the amount of,an amount that is more than three times greater than the sum state farm agreed to in.however,based on the contentiousness of this litigation,plaintiff has not yet provided state farm with its experts reports and estimates and will not do so unless and until there is an agreement that such will be protected by cal.evid.and or until production of the reports is required pursuant to code of civil procedure section.however,plaintiff has described certain of the unrepaired items in its responses to interrogatories provided to defendant.
state farm reply in support of summary judgment and objection to the homeowners association evidence 
state farm filed a reply memorandum and response to the homeowners association separate statement of undisputed facts on june,one week before the scheduled hearing date.state farm concurrently filed objections to paragraph of the rosen declaration on the grounds it is vague,ambiguous,lacks foundation,contains hearsay statements,misstates the evidence and is irrelevant.in particular,state farm objected that rosen had not established that he or his consultants are qualified to determine earthquake damage from damage caused by some other source,that he or his consultants knew the condition of the property immediately prior to the earthquake,or that he or his consults sic knew the condition of the property after the earthquake.in addition,state farm objected the declaration contains impermissible hearsay evidence as to the findings of others,citing evidence code section.
the trial court ruling on the motion for summary judgment 
the court heard oral argument on state farm motion on june,and thereafter granted the motion.plaintiff hired and paid to do all the earthquake repairs as well as other work.plaintiff advised the association members by letter on september,that the earthquake repairs were complete.even though state farm paid plaintiff,plaintiff had the work done within the deductible.under the circumstances,state farm paid more than they owed,not less.the trial court did not rule on state farm objections to paragraph of the rosen declaration.
judgment was entered on july,in favor of state farm.notice of entry of judgment was served on september.the homeowners association filed a timely notice of appeal.

standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.intel hamidi cal th,d,code civ,subd.c.
code of civil procedure section serves only to eliminate certain time limitation defenses 
the theme of both the homeowners association opposition to summary judgment in the trial court and its appellate briefs is that the legislature adoption of code of civil procedure section section,effective january,obligated insurers like state farm to investigate and adjust new northridge earthquake damage claims presented in without regard to actions the insurers may have taken with respect to claims relating to the same property originally presented in.accordingly the homeowners association contends state farm payment to it in can not as a matter of law support summary judgment.
the homeowners association substantially overstates the scope and effect of section,which simply revives certain claims for policy benefits against insurers for losses caused by the january,northridge earthquake and provides a cause of action on such a claim may be commenced within one year of the statute january,effective date the statute was enacted specifically to obviate the adverse impact the limitations period was having on the ability of many insureds to obtain compensation from their insurance companies for property damage caused by the northridge earthquake the legislative history of the statute indicates the author introduced the bill because the limitations period has unfairly barred victims of the northridge earthquake from being compensated for their losses because many were tragically misled by their insurers or representatives thereof about the extent of damage suffered as a result of the earthquake.hellinger farmers group,th,d.according to the statute proponents,t housands of people who suffered damage to their homes did not receive the benefit of their insurance contracts because of the insurance companies conduct a mple evidence exists to show that insurers handling northridge earthquake claims engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes.later,when it became clear that the problems were indeed significant,the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.century ins.superior court th,d.

state farm did not assert a time limitation defense as a ground for summary judgment.accordingly,section is irrelevant to our review of the trial court order granting state farm motion.see rosenblum safeco ins,supra,th at,d.
the trial court properly granted summary judgment 
state farm satisfied its initial burden of demonstrating the homeowners association could not establish necessary elements of its causes of action 
under the terms of the homeowners association policy with state farm,the homeowners association was entitled to be paid either the actual cash value or the replacement cost of property lost or damaged by the northridge earthquake.payment based on replacement cost without deduction for depreciation will not be made until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced and the sum paid will not exceed the amount actually spent for the repairs or replacement of the property 
if the insured initially elects to have its loss settled on an actual cash value basis and then makes repairs,the insured may apply for and receive additional payment on a replacement cost basis if the cost of necessary repairs is greater than the actual cash value payment.the policy states the insured must notify state farm of its intent to make an additional claim on the replacement cost basis within days of the loss.of course,if the actual cost to repair is less than the actual cash value payment previously received,the insured is not entitled to any additional payment.
the undisputed facts before the trial court on summary judgment established that in state farm and whi,as the representative of the homeowners association,agreed to a valuation for the damage to the condominium complex a sum that did not include any deduction for depreciation and state farm then paid the homeowners association the replacement cost less the applicable deductible and unincurred contractor overhead and profit.the figure included approximately for repairs to individual condominium units.thereafter,the homeowners association hired a contractor to repair the condominium building exterior and common areas that repair work,including overhead and profit,was completed for substantially less than the amount to which state farm and whi had agreed.the homeowners association wrote its members in september announcing,the earthquake repairs to our building are now complete.state farm did not hear again from the homeowners association until this litigation.
this evidence is sufficient to satisfy state farm initial burden on summary judgment as to the claims for both breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing all parties involved in in the adjustment of the claim agreed to the amount of damage and its cost of repair.state farm paid the homeowners assoc
