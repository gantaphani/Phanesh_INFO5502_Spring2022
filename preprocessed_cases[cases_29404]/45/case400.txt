on april,marek szpakowski,a construction worker employed by city club hotel,llc,fell and sustained serious injuries when the scaffolding he was standing on snapped.city club was a tenant on the subject premises,and performing renovation work pursuant to a lease with the property owner,shelby realty,llc shelby.underwriters insurance company underwriters had issued a general commercial liability insurance policy the policy to shelby and city club,as named insureds,in connection with renovation work that city club was undertaking.the policy specified that the members of any insured limited liability company were insured under the policy,but only with respect to the conduct of that insured limited liability company business.metropolitan hotels,llc metropolitan,and forthright development,llc forthright are both members of city club.
szpakowski retained counsel,who informed shelby,by letter dated july,that the firm had been retained to pursue szpakowski claim for personal injuries sustained as a result of shelby negligence on april.the letter also requested that shelby refer the letter immediately to its insurer.shelby forwarded this letter,through a series of intermediaries,to underwriters.what underwriters ultimately received was a general liability notice of occurrence claim form identifying the policy number and listing city club as the insured.attached to that form was a copy of the letter that szpakowski counsel had sent to shelby informing shelby that it might be sued.
underwriters confirmed receipt of the claim on july.in doing so it identified city club and shelby as our insured.in addition,on or about july,city club manager sent a letter to underwriters parent company,liability insurance group,referring to the claim by marek szpako w ski against city club hotel,llc,our landlord shelby realty,llc.the letter reiterated that szpakowski had filed a claim against shelby,informed the insurer that szpakowski was collecting workers compensation payments,and indicated that city club would,subject to underwriters approval,soon discontinue certain supplemental payments made to szpakowski.
around the same time,underwriters retained j n investigation and claim service j n to look into the accident.underwriters informed j n that it provided insurance to city club and shelby,and instructed j n,inter alia,to contact the named insured,to obtain copies of any lease agreements involved in the claim,and to incorporate the claimant employment status in a signed statement.in a report dated august,j n confirmed that the insured premises was owned by shelby and leased by city club,that city club and shelby were both named insureds under the policy,that szpakowski was an employee of city club,and that city club was a limited liability company.
in november,szpakowski and his wife filed an action for damages in the new york supreme court,asserting claims against shelby,metropolitan,and forthright under various state labor and industrial laws szpakowski shelby realty,llc,filed,the personal injury action.a copy of the verified complaint was sent to underwriters on or about december.by letter dated december,underwriters disclaimed coverage of city club and shelby,quoting the employee exclusion clause of the insurance policy and copying the letter to metropolitan and forthright.
in september,underwriters brought this action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york buchwald,asserting diversity jurisdiction,and seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify shelby,city club,forthright,and metropolitan,or stephen brighenti and jonathan zambetti corporate officers of metropolitan and forthright,respectively,and guarantors of the lease between shelby and city club in the personal injury action underwriters subsequently moved for summary judgment,as did the defendants,who principally asked i that the plaintiff complaint be dismissed with prejudice as to shelby,forthright,and metropolitan,on the grounds that underwriters disclaimer of coverage was untimely ii that,as regards shelby,the complaint,alternatively,be dismissed with prejudice on the merits,because the exclusionary clause in the insurance policy did not apply to shelby iii that the complaint against city club,brighenti,and zambetti be dismissed because they are not asserting a claim for coverage against plaintiff iv that the court declare underwriters obligated to defend and indemnify shelby with respect to the personal injury action and v that defendants be awarded their attorneys fees,costs,and expenses in defending against the declaratory action.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on the issue of disclaimer of coverage,but denied the defendants any attorneys fees.underwriters now appeals the issue of its liability under the policy,and the defendants,seeking to reverse the judgment denying them attorneys fees.we deal first with underwriters responsibilities to the defendants under the policy,and subsequently with the question of attorneys fees.
disclaimer of coverage 
under new york law,an insurer must notify an insured as soon as is reasonably possible of its intention to disclaim coverage for bodily injury under a policy.ins.law d.a failure by the insurer to give such notice as soon as is reasonably possible after it first learns of the accident or of grounds for disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage,precludes effective disclaimer or denial.hartford ins.county of nassau.we measure the reasonableness of the delay from the point in time when the insurer first learns of the grounds for disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage.allcity ins,see also allstate ins.gross,time for notice should be measured from the moment the insurer first learns of the accident or of grounds for its disclaimer and not from the time when it chooses to disclaim w here the grounds for disclaimer are not readily apparent,an insurer must be given reasonable time to adequately investigate a claim in order to determine whether it wishes to disclaim coverage,underwriters ins.roka,llc,wl,at,but the insurer also has an obligation to engage in a reasonably prompt,thorough,and diligent investigation of the claim,prudential prop.cas.ins.div d dep t.
lastly,a n insurer who delays in giving written notice of disclaimer bears the burden of justifying the delay.first fin.ins.jetco contracting.while n ormally the question whether a notice of disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage has been sent as soon as is reasonably possible is a question of fact which depends on all the facts and circumstances,especially the length of and the reason for the delay,in the exceptional case this question may be decided without the benefit of a jury.hartford ins,at.and new york courts have concluded that an unexcused delay of days or longer is unreasonable as a matter of law.first financial,at,see also hartford ins,at,two month delay of disclaimer unreasonable as a matter of law.
applying this law to the facts before us,we hold,first,that the district court was correct to dismiss underwriters complaint as regards city club,brighenti,and zambetti,on the grounds that none of these defendants seek coverage under the policy.indeed,none are being sued in the personal injury action that is the subject of this disclaimer suit.
we further agree with the district court that underwriters gave inexcusably late notice,as a matter of law,of its intention to disclaim coverage of shelby.in july,underwriters received notice that szpakowski was bringing a claim against shelby,and that szpakowski was employed by city club.it was therefore in at the latest,august,when it received the j n underwriters first learn ed of the grounds for disclaimer of liability or denial of coverage.allcity,at.nonetheless,it waited four or five months longer to disclaim coverage.
underwriters contends that it could not disclaim sooner because it did not have proper notice of shelby claim until december,when it received the verified complaint in the personal injury action.we are not persuaded.although the notice of claim form that was filed in july listed city club as the insured,attached to that form was the letter from szpakowski attorney,addressed only to shelby,and clearly indicating that a claim was being asserted against shelby.this was sufficient to fulfill shelby contractual requirement to see to it as the policy put it that underwriters was notified of the claim 
underwriters further argues that it did not have enough information to disclaim coverage of shelby until december,because it was not aware until it received the verified complaint that there was a contract between shelby and city club for the,the lease between the two parties,which included several provisions related to the construction.this argument is unavailing.throughout this suit,underwriters has relied upon two grounds for disclaimer of shelby,both derived from the employee exclusion clause in the policy.underwriters contends that the clause excludes from coverage bodily injury a to any employee of any insured,and that szpakowski is an employee of an insured city club,and b to any employee of any contractor of any insured,and that the lease makes city club the contractor of shelby for the purposes of this clause.as we noted above,underwriters was in possession of all of facts necessary for their first ground of disclaimer in july or august of.and although new york courts have expressed concern that p iecemeal denials of coverage would frustrate the insurer right to investigate claims,wilczak ruda capozzi.div.dep t,to allow an insurer to delay a disclaimer for several months because additional arguments for exclusion might emerge over time is fatally inconsistent with new york requirement of prompt notice.the existence of an additional ground for disclaimer is,after all,always a theoretical possibility.we note,moreover,that underwriters offers no satisfactory explanation for its tardiness in discovering the terms of the lease,and hence the basis for the second disclaimer ground,even though it knew of the existence of the lease between shelby and city club by july or august,and had instructed its own claims investigator in july to secure copies of any relevant leases.
a four to five month delay in investigating the terms of that lease was therefore unreasonable as a matter of law,particularly where another ground for disclaimer existed.first financial,at,noting that,for the purposes of summary judgment,there is no material difference between a delay that is unexplained and a delay that is unexcused,meaning the explanation is unsatisfactory.accordingly,we agree with the district court that shelby was entitled to have the complaint against it dismissed with prejudice,and to receive a declaration that underwriters must defend and indemnify shelby in the personal liability action.
metropolitan and forthright 
we also affirm the district court holding that underwriters notice of disclaimer to defendants metropolitan and forthright was untimely as a matter of law,only these entities claim coverage as members of city club,and are being sued in the personal injury action in their capacity as members of city club underwriters argues that it had no notice of any claim from metropolitan and forthright until december,when it received the verified complaint naming these two companies as defendants.we disagree.
metropolitan and forthright claim coverage solely as members of city club.the policy requires only that a named insured give the insurer notice of claim.as a result,metropolitan and forthright were entitled to rely upon city club notice of claim.similarly,under the terms of the policy,underwriters disclaimer of coverage of city club would operate as a disclaimer of coverage of its member companies because underwriters failed,as a matter of law,to notify city club in a timely manner of its intention to disclaim coverage of city club,it also failed to notify city club members in a timely manner 
finally,we note that the defendants only asked the district court to declare underwriters notice to forthright and metropolitan untimely,and did not assert a counterclaim that underwriters has a duty to defend and indemnify these two defendants.we affirm no more than the district court held underwriters notice was untimely as a matter of law as regards metropolitan and forthright,insofar as these entities are claiming coverage as members of city club,and,hence,underwriters complaint against these two defendants must be dismissed with prejudice 
ii.attorneys fees 
the issue of attorneys fees involves an important,unsettled,and determinative question of state law,which we certify to the new york court of appeals.
legal standard 
new york courts have carved out a narrow exception to the general american rule that a prevailing party can not recover attorneys fees.under this exception,an insured who prevails in a declaratory action brought by an insurance company seeking to deny a duty to defend and indemnify is allowed to recover fees expended in defending against that action.the insured is allowed fees,that is,when he has been cast in a defensive posture by the legal steps an insurer takes in an effort to free itself from its policy obligations.see mighty midgets,centennial ins.
mighty midgets states the exception in broad terms.nevertheless,lower federal and state courts have consistently disagreed about whether the exception applies in cases where the insurer,who sought a disclaimer of liability and lost,had earlier discharged its duty to defend the insured in the underlying action.this issue was not discussed in mighty midgets.
most federal district courts have expressed concern that allowing fees under these circumstances would create an incentive for the insurer to refuse to defend in the underlying suit,thereby leaving it up to the insured to bring a declaratory action seeking coverage.under mighty midgets,an insured,even though it prevails,is not entitled to attorneys fees in any declaratory action that it initiates.id.an insurance company focused on avoiding attorneys fees might therefore refuse to defend in the underlying state suit and force the insured to bring the declaratory action 
for this reason,a number of district courts have concluded that,in a case in which it was clear that the insurer had discharged its duty to defend in the underlying action,the court of appeals would retreat from its categorical statement in mighty midgets and would not award attorneys fees to the insured.see,nationwide mutual ins.welch,reasoning that allowing attorneys fees in such a case would reduce the incentives for insurance companies to defend in the underlying tort actions and that would likely shift the burden of obtaining a declaratory judgment from the insurance company to the insured see also mount vernon fire ins.congregation kehilath yakov,wl,at,safeguard ins.angel guardian home,great northern ins.dayco,aetna cas.surety dawson.div.dep t,aff,
several appellate divisions and at least one federal district court,however,have concluded that mighty midgets requires the awarding of fees whenever the disclaimer declaratory action has been brought by the it does so,that is,even where an insurer does not breach its duty to defend in the underlying suit.see united states fid.guar.new york,susquehanna ry.div.dep t holding that t he fact that plaintiff initially paid the cost of defendant defense in the underlying action is of no moment underwriters ins.mesiftah eitz chaim of bobov.div d dep t awarding attorneys fees to an insured where the insurer abandoned prosecution of the declaratory action and defended in the underlying action see also grange mutual ins.udar,wl.
this division in interpreting new york law between the majority of new york lower courts,and the majority of federal district courts which could not seek guidance from the new york court of appeals through certification of the question,has created an unusual,and undesirable,degree of uncertainty in cases of this sort,cases like the one we have before us today.
application 
it is undisputed,on this appeal,that underwriters has cast the insureds in a defensive posture by bringing this declaratory action.it is also undisputed that,in the underlying personal injury action,underwriters did provide a defense to one of the insureds,she
