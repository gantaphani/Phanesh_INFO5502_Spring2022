this appeal concerns an insurance coverage dispute between an excess insurer and a primary insurer over the obligation to defend a housing developer in a construction defect case.the court determined the excess insurer,insurance company of the state of pennsylvania isop,had an obligation to pay the developer defense costs.isop asserts other carriers providing coverage for several subcontractors,and which named the developer as an additional insured,had the duty to provide defense coverage.it asserts the california rule of horizontal exhaustion required the payment from these primary policies before any excess or umbrella policies could be triggered.we conclude the trial court got it right.the judgment is affirmed.
barratt american,windsong partners,and pacific gateway homes,collectively barratt is the developer of the windsong common interest development in orange county.barratt hired several subcontractors to work on the project.it also secured several layers of insurance protection.
first,barratt obtained primary insurance coverage from united national insurance to provide indemnity against all losses.second,barratt required each subcontractor to obtain a commercial general liability policy,and for those carriers to issue additional insured endorsements to barratt.ten of the subcontractors obtained their coverage from the cna affiliated companies,comprised of transcontinental insurance company,the continental insurance company,and the valley forge insurance company collectively referred to as cna.
cna policies contain essentially the same additional insured provisions.relevant to this case,each contained a provision limiting coverage for barratt,agreeing to indemnify only against liability arising out of the subcontractors own work on the project 
as a final layer of protection,barratt obtained four excess insurance policies from isop,containing the following indemnity provisions defense,settlement and supplementary payments should applicable underlying insurance s become exhausted by payment of covered claims,this insurance will continue in force as underlying insurance and shall defend any suit arising out of a covered occurrence,as respects occurrences not covered under the underlying insurance s,but covered by this policy,the company shall likewise defend any suit and coverage to pay on behalf of the insured that portion of the ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit as hereinafter defined,which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages to third parties for liability imposed upon the insured by law,or liability assumed by the insured under contract because of i personal injury,ii property damage,or iii advertising liability as defined herein 
in,the windsong community association filed a construction defect lawsuit.barratt tendered the defense to its primary carrier and that policy soon became exhausted.barratt next tendered the defense to isop and various carriers for the subcontractors.isop initially paid over,but then asserted it had no defense obligation.it demanded reimbursement from the subcontractors carriers having policies naming barratt as an additional insured.
under the threat of litigation from barratt,cna paid approximately in defense fees and costs,but did so under the agreement it had full and complete reservation of rights to later seek contribution from isop and other carriers.it also reimbursed isop the defense fees and costs previously paid.
the windsong case settled for.isop paid in indemnity.it paid no defense costs.on behalf of the subcontractors,cna paid less than in indemnity.
cna filed a complaint for declaratory relief and equitable contribution against isop and several other insurance carriers.it asserted isop must share in barratt defense costs in the windsong construction defect case.isop responded with a summary judgment motion msj,arguing carriers for some of the subcontractors had issued additional insured endorsements naming barratt,and the limits of all those policies had to be exhausted to trigger isop defense obligation.
the court denied the msj,concluding the cna additional insured endorsements provided coverage for only derivative risk and not for barratt direct negligence,and consequently there was no defense obligation.however,the court determined isop insured barratt for a wide spectrum of risks,including its direct negligence,and the defense obligation was therefore triggered.
this court denied isop petition for writ of mandate challenging the court ruling.the parties asked the court to enter a stipulated judgment in favor of cna to appeal the court ruling.they entered a judgment by stipulating that if cna were to file a msj based on the same pleadings,exhibits,and declarations presented to the c ourt in connection with isop prior msj,as augmented by a few facts described in paragraph two of the stipulation,the court would grant said msj on the same basis that it denied isop prior msj,and enter judgment 
in addition,the agreement stated,the parties have reached an agreement and stipulation as to the amount of defense costs incurred for the defense of barratt in the underlying windsong action.moreover,they agreed in order to avoid the unnecessary expenditure of court time and attorneys fees and costs,the parties have agreed upon an appropriate allocation to isop of that portion of the unreimbursed attorneys fees and costs paid by cna.
the duty to indemnify v.the duty to pay defense costs 
we begin by noting the parties do not dispute their respective duties to indemnify barratt for the settlement of the windsong lawsuit.after exhaustion of the united national insurance policy,the excess policy from isop provided indemnity for claims against barratt in the amount of.cna policies,which limited indemnity coverage to losses arising out the work of subcontractors,paid of the settlement.it is unclear who paid the remaining portion of the million settlement,but there were approximately other insurance companies representing over subcontractors involved in the underlying litigation.
the above disparity in payments towards the settlement shows the lawsuit involved,what is commonly referred to in insurance law,as a mixed action.this means not all the potential liability was covered by all the various carriers and some insurers coverage was limited to specific claims.relevant to this case,cna was required to indemnify only for liability arising out of work performed by its insured subcontractors,which amounted to of the million settlement.given this relatively small indemnity bill,it is understandable why cna is unhappy about the fact it paid a disproportionate share of the defense fees and costs over million.
cna also makes clear that it does not dispute its initial obligation to provide a full and complete defense of all claims asserted in the lawsuit.it correctly recognized that in insurance law,it is settled that where an insurer has a duty to defend,the obligation generally applies to the entire action,even though the suit involves both covered and uncovered claims,or a single claim only partially covered by the policy.citations.presley homes,american states ins.th,d presley homes.a subcontractor insurer must provide a defense to a developer listed as an additional insured under the subcontractor liability policy when the developer is sued by a third party for construction defects allegedly resulting from the subcontractor work.citation.id.at,d.this obligation is based on public policy,not the terms of the parties contract.id.at,d.
having provided barratt a complete defense in the windsong lawsuit,cna can now seek reimbursement from the other insurers obligated to defend the lawsuit under principles of equity.see maryland casualty nationwide mutual ins.th,d maryland.as explained in maryland,in the insurance context,equitable subrogation and equitable contribution doctrines each pertain to the allocation of costs when there is more than one potentially responsible insurance company.but,the two doctrines are entirely different concepts.citation.ibid.as we will explain,cna claim for reimbursement against isop invokes the doctrine of equitable subrogation.
equitable subrogation and equitable contribution 
equitable subrogation allows an insurer that paid coverage or defense costs to be placed in the insured position to pursue a full recovery from another insurer who was primarily responsible for the loss.citation.because this doctrine shifts the entire cost burden,the moving party insurer must show the other insurer was primarily liable for the loss and that the moving party equitable position is inferior to that of the second insurer.citations.maryland,supra,th at,d.
equitable contribution,on the other hand,applies to apportion costs among insurers that share the same level of liability on the same risk as to the same insured.citation.it arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.citation.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.maryland,supra,th at,d.
in this case,equitable contribution can not apply because cna and isop did not share the same level of liability and were not obligated to defend the same loss or claim.cna level of liability was as a primary insurer for several subcontractors and the developer as an additional insured.however,its overall risk was limited to claims arising out of the particular subcontractor own work on the project.cna never agreed to be obligated for liability totally unrelated to the work of those subcontractors.
as an excess carrier,isop bargained for a different kind of liability,and its potential obligation for coverage was limited differently than cna.isop agreed to pay only when the various underlying insurance became exhausted on any covered claims.this obligation potentially could include claims involving the barratt torts,as well as liability arising from the subcontractors work 
as isop points out,ordinarily there is no contribution between a primary and an excess carrier the rule of horizontal exhaustion.primary coverage is insurance coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability excess or secondary coverage is coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins.d,italics fn.omitted.
however,there can be equitable subrogation between a primary and excess carrier in limited circumstances w here different insurance carriers cover differing risks and liabilities,they may proceed against each other for reimbursement by subrogation rather than by contribution.citations.reliance nat.indemnity general star indemnity th,d commercial union assurance companies safeway stores,cal d.such is the case here.the issue presented in this case is whether cna were entitled to equitable subrogation against isop for reimbursement of defense costs.
elements of equitable subrogation 
in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid.citations.as now applied the doctrine of equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.citations.citation.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d fireman fund.
the essential elements of an insurer cause of action for equitable subrogation are as follows a the insured suffered a loss for which the defendant is liable,either as the wrongdoer whose act or omission caused the loss or because the defendant is legally responsible to the insured for the loss caused by the wrongdoer b the claimed loss was one for which the insurer was not primarily liable c the insurer has compensated the insured in whole or in part for the same loss for which the defendant is primarily liable d the insurer has paid the claim of its insured to protect its own interest and not as a volunteer e the insured has an existing,assignable cause of action against the defendant which the insured could have asserted for its own benefit had it not been compensated for its loss by the insurer f the insurer has suffered damages caused by the act or omission upon which the liability of the defendant depends g justice requires that the loss be entirely shifted from the insurer to the defendant,whose equitable position is inferior to that of the insurer and h the insurer damages are in a liquidated sum,generally the amount paid to the insured.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.
the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have.citations.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.
the parties primarily focus their discussion on appeal to the second element of equitable subrogation,was the claimed loss one for which the insurer was not primarily liable.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.isop asserts cna were primarily liable for all the defense costs.it provides a lengthy summary of insurance cases holding a defense obligation in an additional insured endorsement must be interpreted broadly.citing acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d.these cases show that courts agree the arising out of language used in most endorsements requires only a minimal connection between the liability and the subcontractor operations to trigger coverage.id.at,d.
based on the above legal premise,isop offers two reasons for this court to hold cna was primarily liable for all the defense costs.the first argument can be easily dealt with.isop asserts cna clearly admitted in the respondent brief it had a duty to defend all of the claims brought against the developer.we conclude isop has misconstrued the statements made in the brief.
as stated earlier,cna does not dispute its initial obligation to provide a complete defense of all claims,even though the suit was a mixed action and involved some uncovered claims.see presley homes,supra,th at,d.under the rules of insurance law,this public policy based obligation to provide the insured with a complete defense is widely recognized not to result in any unfairness because the insurer can always later seek either equitable subrogation or contribution from other insurers obligated to defend the claim.id.at,d.
here,cna paid the complete defense costs under threat of litigation from the developer.and,it paid only after reserving full and complete rights to later seek reimbursement from the other carriers.its payment can not be deemed an admission of full liability in a later subrogation action.and,we found nothing in its briefs suggesting it waived its reservation of rights or it now concedes complete liability.
isop second argument is more complicated,but also lacks merit.it asserts each claim in the underlying action allegedly arose out of the work of the subcontractor on the windsong project and,therefore,each of those claims gave rise to a duty under the cna policies to defend.isop relies on the supreme court decision in buss superior court cal th,d,buss,for the legal argument an insurer has an immediate duty to defend its insured against merely potentially covered claims and can not later seek reimbursement.isop reads too much into buss.
the buss case involved whether an insurer could seek reimbursement for defense costs paid on behalf of a corporation having a standard commercial general liabili
