in march,the state of minnesota submitted a state plan amendment plan amendment to the centers for medicare and medicaid services medicaid services or cms,seeking a increase in the annual supplemental medical assistance payments made by the federal medicaid program to fourteen nursing homes.after requesting additional information from the state,medicaid services disapproved the plan amendment and denied minnesota request for reconsideration.the state now petitions this court to review and reject the final determination of the secretary of health and human services hhs adverse to minnesota.we deny the petition.
the medicaid program,authorized by title xix of the social security act,benefits children,the poor,and the elderly.we have observed that a lthough a state participation in the medicaid program is optional,participating states in compliance with the applicable federal rules and regulations are given matching funds by the federal government.bowlin montanez,cir see requiring participating states to submit for approval plans for medical assistance.minnesota petition centers on three rules.a state plan must provide for financial participation by the state equal to not less than per centum of the share of the expenditures under the plan,a provide such safeguards as may be necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan will be determined,and such care and services will be provided,in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients,a and assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care,a a.

medicaid services,however,requested additional information from the state.see f permitting secretary to request in writing any additional information which is needed in order to make a final determination with respect to the request.in a june letter,medicaid services asked minnesota to explain whether the services funded by the plan amendment complied with a a the efficiency,economy,and quality of care rule how the services were funded whether counties funded the portion of the medicaid payment the role of intergovernmental transfers in the funding mechanism whether the nursing homes retained all of the medicaid payments and whether the payments were below the upper payment limit.
before the state could respond medicaid services sent a second request in august asking whether the nursing facilities retained all of the medicaid funds paid to them or whether they returned funds to the state or their local governments if the state complied with the percent requirement of a and how the state provided its share through legislative appropriations,intergovernmental transfers,or other means if the payments complied with a a efficiency,economy,and quality of care rule for a detailed upper payment limit calculation and whether the state recoups any payments to facilities that exceed the cost of services.
minnesota responded to the requests in august.notably,the state equated medicaid upper payment limit with a a efficiency requirement and observed that 
i f cms medicaid services now finds that the upper payment limit is set so high that it allows payment rates that are inefficient and not economical,then the proper response should be to amend the upper payment limit regulation,not to impose new,burdensome requirements on states to justify payment rates that are below the upper payment limit,especially against an unspecified standard.
consistent with its reliance on the upper payment limit,minnesota also responded that n one of the funds are returned.once the medical assistance program pays a provider,the funds are not tracked.at.as a result,the state could not calculate a ratio between the state and local share of the nonfederal share of medicaid,though it assured medicaid services that the state share exceeded the percent required by a.at.
finally,the state made the claim that a rate can comply with the efficiency and economy requirement without a comparison to cost,or even be above cost,as long as the rates are under the required limits because there is no cost limit,a payment is not necessarily excessive simply because it may be greater than cost.at.
to understand minnesota responses to medicaid services,it is necessary to briefly explain medicaid upper payment limit.to help control rising medicaid expenses hhs established the upper payment limit,which created a medicaid payment ceiling based on expenses that would be allowed under medicare payment rules.see indep.acceptance california,cir citing a,b.a state must assure medicaid services that the payments requested through a plan amendment do not exceed the upper payment limit before medicaid services may approve the plan.but,prompted by ever rising medicaid reimbursements,the government accountability office gao and the office of the inspector general determined in that even the upper payment limit lead to misuse and excessive federal medicaid spending.alaska dep t of health soc.servs.ctrs.for medicare and medicaid,cir.
hhs amended the upper payment limit regulations in,see revision to the medicaid upper payment limit requirements,but the problem continued.in the gao identified medicaid as a program,concluding that l imited oversight has afforded states and health care providers the opportunity to increase federal funding inappropriately.gao,performance accountability series dep t of health human,highlights.one concern in particular provoked medicaid services scrutiny of minnesota plan amendment.the gao reported that 
for more than a decade,states have used various financing schemes to inappropriately generate excessive federal medicaid matching funds while their own share of expenditures has remained unchanged or decreased.using statutory and regulatory loopholes,some states have created the illusion that they have made large medicaid payments to certain providers,such as county health facilities,in order to generate federal matching payments.in reality,generally through electronic funds transfers,the states have only momentarily made payments to these providers,as states have required the payments to be returned.
although the congress and cms medicaid services have repeatedly acted to curtail abusive financing schemes when they have come to light,states have consistently developed new variations to this basic approach.each variant has the same result the state share of program expenditures is shifted to the federal government,while federal medicaid payments escalate,with no assurances that the excessive federal payments are used for valid medicaid expenditures for covered beneficiaries.
id.at emphasis added.minnesota responses did not distinguish the plan amendment from the scheme described by the gao.
medicaid services initially disapproved the plan amendment in june.the state sought reconsideration,but presiding official kathleen reached the same conclusions in her proposed hearing decision.the official rejected the contention that compliance with the upper payment limit is alone sufficient because cms medicaid services is obligated to inquire further to ensure that the spa state
