following a state court trial in missouri,a jury found rockwell automation,rockwell liable for damages exceeding million.the court also awarded interest which eventually accrued to over million.rockwell excess insurers,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh national union,federal insurance company federal,and gulf insurance company gulf refused to pay the interest,and rockwell filed suit in wisconsin state court seeking indemnification.the insurers removed the action to federal court.national union settled with rockwell,paid the interest,and then filed against the other excess insurers seeking to recoup the million.the district court granted motions to dismiss and for summary judgment filed by federal and travelers indemnity company travelers,gulf successor in interest.the motions were granted based on the district court conclusion that the general coverage sections of federal and gulf did not make them responsible for payment of interest,and that national union assumption of rockwell defense obligated it to pay the interest under its policy.national union appeals the entry of judgment against it on these bases,as well the district court determination that national union policy should be construed under wisconsin law thus making it responsible for all of the interest that accrued on the judgment against rockwell.we affirm.
this case arises out of a negligence and products liability lawsuit filed in in jackson county,missouri.kansas city power and light kcpl sued those it believed responsible for a natural gas explosion which occurred on february,and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.among the defendants was rockwell,whose excess insurers are the parties in this appeal.the case proceeded to trial,and on march,the jury returned a verdict assessing kcpl damages at million,and finding rockwell at fault.after it applied credits for settlements between kcpl and other defendants,the trial court determined that rockwell portion of the jury verdict was.the trial court also determined,however,that based on limiting language in the contract between rockwell and kcpl,rockwell liability should be reduced to.kcpl appealed,and the missouri court of appeals reversed the trial court decision to reduce the judgment.the lower court was directed not only to reinstate its original judgment,but to award interest from august,the date the judgment was originally entered.
rockwell had several layers of insurance coverage relevant to the liability it incurred in the missouri suit.first,it was for million per occurrence,and held a policy with travelers providing million in excess general liability coverage.next,national union issued an excess general liability policy with coverage up to million over the million in underlying coverage.federal issued an additional million excess policy to rockwell,and a third million excess policy was issued by gulf the questions before us on appeal relate to coverage under the three million excess policies 
the national union policy begins with a general coverage section entitled coverage.in that section,national union states that it 
will pay on behalf of the insured those sums in excess of the retained limit that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed by the insured under an insured contract because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury that takes place during the policy period and is caused by an occurrence happening anywhere in the world.
a section entitled defense follows and states,in pertinent part,that whenever national union assumes the defense of any claim or suit,it will pay 
interest awarded against the insured on that part of the judgment we pay.if we make an offer to pay the applicable limit of insurance,we will not pay any interest based on that period of time after the offer 
all interest that accrues after entry of judgment and before we have paid,offered to pay or deposited in court the part of the judgment that is within our applicable limits of insurance.
the federal policy lists the national union policy as underlying insurance,and states in its coverage section that federal will pay that part of loss,covered by this insurance,in excess of the limits of underlying insurance.the federal policy does not expressly mention payment of interest.the gulf policy also lists the national union policy as underlying insurance,and its coverage section provides that gulf will indemnify the insured that amount of loss which exceeds the amount of loss payable by the underlying policies described in the declarations like the federal policy,the gulf policy makes no express mention of payment of interest.
while not expressly mentioning interest,both policies contain language indicating that they follow form with the national union policy.the federal policy provides that t he terms and conditions of underlying insurance are made a part of this policy,except with respect to any contrary provision contained in this policy.the gulf policy likewise provides that,subject to certain exceptions irrelevant here,this policy shall apply in like manner as the underlying insurance.therefore,the terms of the national union defense section,and specifically those covering payment of interest,are subject to our review in determining the obligation of federal and travelers to pay interest.see sphere drake ins.all am.ins,cir noting that it is the essence of a policy to follow the underlying policy in every respect except where specifically mentioned see also houbigant,fed.ins,cir noting that under a policy coverage issues presented turn solely on the interpretation of the underlying polic y.
because rockwell was for the initial million of its coverage,it retained and paid for its own trial counsel,steven sanders.the record shows that national union,federal,and travelers were,at the very least,being kept abreast of developments in the case by sanders.national union also retained and paid for attorney melinda kollross with the intention that she would,at a minimum,assist at trial by identifying and preserving appellate issues.to that end,kollross worked on a proposed verdict form and the motions,and prepared a memorandum identifying appellate issues which she forwarded to sanders.towards the end of the trial,kcpl asserted the existence of a conflict with kollross firm,and it was decided that counsel other than kollross would be sought to assist on motions and the appeal.attorney susan ford robertson was retained by national union for that purpose.national union admits that it paid robertson fees,but the parties dispute whether national union alone selected robertson,and whether primary responsibility for rockwell defense ever transferred from sanders to robertson.
following the decision of the missouri court of appeals,national union and federal contributed the amounts within their respective policy limits to satisfy the damages portion of the judgment.however,the three excess insurers refused to pay the interest ordered by the appellate court prompting rockwell to initiate this action in the milwaukee county circuit court seeking indemnification.rockwell alleged that national union was responsible for the interest because it had assumed rockwell defense after the jury verdict.it also alleged in the alternative that each of the excess insurers was responsible for payment of the interest under the general coverage sections of their policies.the excess insurers removed the action to federal court citing as the basis for federal jurisdiction.national union and rockwell entered into a settlement where rockwell assigned to national union its claims against federal and travelers.in return,national union payed the interest at issue,which by that point had accrued to an amount exceeding million.
national union filed amended against federal and travelers denying that it had assumed rockwell defense and alleging that it,federal,and travelers had each merely participated in defending rockwell.national union sought from federal and travelers damages to compensate it for paying the million in interest.federal and travelers both moved to dismiss national union arguing that the general coverage sections of their policies did not obligate them to pay rockwell interest.federal moved alternatively for summary judgment arguing that national union assumed rockwell defense,and that it was therefore solely responsible for payment of interest.
the district court granted federal and travelers motions to dismiss concluding that their policies did not require them to pay interest on the judgment against rockwell.specifically,the court found that the language in national union policy,with which federal and gulf policies follow form,requiring it to pay interest when it assumed rockwell defense would be rendered superfluous if interest were included in the terms sums and loss used in the general coverage section of the excess policies.the court therefore concluded that the excess insurers were only required to pay interest when they assumed the defense,and that since national union did not allege that federal and travelers had done so,it had not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court also concluded,as an alternative basis for its finding,that federal and travelers were entitled to summary judgment because even if interest was covered by the sums and loss language,national union assumed rockwell defense and therefore became solely liable for the interest.finally,the district court determined that wisconsin law applied when construing the policies,and that national union was therefore responsible for all of the interest on the judgment against rockwell,and not just the portion falling with national union coverage limits.
on appeal,national union argues that there was at least a question of fact about whether it assumed rockwell defense during the missouri trial,and that the district court therefore erred in entering summary judgment for federal and travelers.national union also asserts that the district court erred in determining that its policy should be construed under wisconsin law.it argues that facts exist in the record raising the possibility that its policy should be construed under california law,which is more favorable to national union,and that the parties should have been allowed to develop the factual record more fully before the determination was made.finally,national union argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted the policies when it concluded that interest was not included in the sums and loss for which the excess insurers covered rockwell.
when the district court grants motions to dismiss made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b or for summary judgment,our review is de novo and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.williams seniff,cir.we turn first to the question of whether national union assumed rockwell defense during the missouri state proceedings.this question was considered below on a motion for summary judgment,and we may therefore consider the evidence filed by the parties.c.we have previously noted that selection,supervision,and payment of counsel by an insurer are signs that the insurer has assumed an insured defense.taco bell cont l cas,cir.national union argues that our statement was dicta,and does not provide a controlling test for when an insurer has assumed the defense of its insured.it is true that our concern in taco bell was an insurer complaint that its insured had incurred unreasonable expenses in defending itself for which the insurer did not want to be held responsible.however,our discussion took for granted that selection,supervision,and payment of counsel are accepted indications that an insurer has assumed an insured defense.see id.noting that if the insurer did not trust the insured,it could have assumed the defense and selected and supervised and paid for the lawyers defending the insured see also pendleton pan am.fire cas,cir noting that while an insurer did not have a duty to defend the insured,it assumed the defense by retaining two lawyers and controlling the litigation but see mfrs.mut.ins.aries marine,cir concluding that mere presence at and participation in settlement discussions did not constitute an assumption of the defense.
national union argues that even if these factors are accepted as showing that an insurer assumed the defense,there exist genuine issues of material fact in determining whether it alone selected robertson,and whether robertson was in control of the missouri state litigation on appeal.in support,national union points to emails exchanged before robertson selection in which national union claims handler,doug brosky,solicited and received input from rockwell and its insurers on identifying appellate counsel.however,although input was being sought from rockwell and its insurers,national union was taking the lead,at least implying that the decision regarding selection of appellate counsel was national union to make.
we need not rely solely on any inference arising from the fact that national union was seeking input from the other concerned parties.in an email sent to rockwell general counsel on may,brosky stated that his inclination was to retain robertson regardless of what federal says.brosky continued that he would like to have federal support,but their position should not and will not affect the selection process.additionally,a representative from federal sent brosky an email the following day asking if he had decided on an appellate counsel,to which brosky responded that he was working on it and hoped to have the matter decided by the end of the month.while national union argues that its solicitation of input creates a question of material fact to determine who selected robertson,it should be remembered that we are not required to draw every conceivable inference from the record,and mere speculation or conjecture will not defeat a summary judgment motion.mccoy harrison,cir quotations omitted.the fact that national union was the one seeking input,when combined with bosky later statements that he was going to make the decision regardless of what input he received from federal,shows that national union was in charge of selecting appellate counsel.
national union admits that it paid robertson fees,but it says it only did so after suggesting that all of the excess insurers pay part,and they declined to do so.its purpose in making this argument is to point out that it paid robertson voluntarily,and not because of any contractual obligation to do so.national union motivation for retaining and paying for robertson is was going to be the first excess insurer impacted if the missouri trial court decision was overturned on appeal.while clear,however,the motivation is not the deciding factor here.national union policy binds it to pay interest not included in any underlying policy or other insurance when it assumes the defense of any claim or suit against its insured.there is no concern expressed in the policy for what may have caused national union to assume the defense,or attention given to the effect of any particular motivation.therefore,national union is not relieved of its obligation to pay interest if it assumed rockwell defense voluntarily rather than because it was contractually obligated to do so.
national union final argument on this point is that robertson was not in control of the case on appeal,and therefore national union can not be said to have assumed rockwell defense.if true,this would be important because mere participation in rockwell defense would not obligate national union to pay interest under the defense section of its policy.in support of its argument,national union again highlights an email in which brosky responds to robertson submission of motion drafts saying he would defer to sanders on their final approval.national union also relies on communications indicating that robertson was receiving advice from sanders and others on appellate strategy,and that robertson kept rockwell,sanders,and the excess insurers apprised of the status of the appeal.the conclusion national union draws from this evidence is that it did not assume exclusive control over rockwell defense at the stage.however,the fact that various parties were participating in r
