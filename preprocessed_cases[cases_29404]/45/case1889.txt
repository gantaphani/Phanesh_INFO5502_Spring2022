and the p i underwriters contend that the royal big shield policy and the mel endorsement do not constitute marine insurance over which we may exercise admiralty jurisdiction,and as a result the uberrimae fidei doctrine does not apply to bar indemnification from royal.we agree,but affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of royal on the ground that royal is not obligated to provide indemnity for the injured seaman injuries because those injuries did not occur in an accident covered by the mel endorsement.
we do not reach the question whether the injured seaman injuries were covered under the alaska state workers compensation act whether covered or not under that act,royal is not obligated to provide indemnity for them under the facts of this case.

background 
this litigation arises out of an accident which occurred on land in napakiak,alaska during the movement of a modular prefabricated house from a barge to a remote construction site,a construction company based in seattle,washington,shipped prefabricated houses from washington and installed them in various native alaskan villages under a contract with the federal government.when the barge carrying the houses reached alaska,the houses were unloaded from the barge onto house movers,which were large treaded vehicles used to carry the houses to the construction sites.
on september,james okada,a maritime employee of working on the tugboat casey marie,was electrocuted while he was helping a crew deliver a prefabricated house to a building site located approximately one and a half miles from the shore.the crew enlisted okada to stand on top of the house and lift up what were supposed to be electrical power lines so that the house and the house mover could pass underneath.unfortunately,the high voltage electrical power line running into napakiak from another village had not been,and okada was electrocuted,suffering severe injuries.
although okada normally worked as a seaman,on the day of the accident a crew borrowed okada to help them deliver the houses.for his work with the crew,paid okada cargo time or lashing pay in addition to his daily rate as a seaman.okada sued for negligence under the jones act,a formerly codified as a,and eventually obtained a settlement in excess of million.
when the accident occurred,had several insurance policies in place covering multiple aspects of its operations.sentry select and lloyd insure vessel operations and crewmembers under a marine protection and indemnity policy p i policy.alaska national insures for various risks,including injuries.part one of the alaska national policy covers washington and alaska state workers compensation,unemployment,and disability claims,as well as claims under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,et.part two of the alaska national policy,the employers liability portion,provides coverage for bodily injuries arising out of and in the course of employment,but excludes any obligation imposed by a workers compensation law.
royal is the insurer for its big shield policy provides excess coverage over part two of the alaska national policy,automobile insurance,and commercial general liability cgl policy with alaska national.the big shield policy does not provide excess coverage over claims under part one of the alaska national policy or the p i policies,and contains a workers compensation exclusion excepting from coverage a ny obligation of the insured under a workers compensation law.at the time of the accident,paid a flat yearly premium of for the royal big shield policy.
in,obtained from royal an mel endorsement to part two of the alaska national policy employers liability and the royal big shield policy.the mel endorsement extended coverage for bodily injuries suffered by a master or member of the crew of any vessel performing work necessary or incidental to the following tasks painting scraping of decks of tugs or barges,and loading and unloading as applicable in washington and alaska.the coverage limit on the mel endorsement to the employers liability insurance with alaska national is million any liability in excess of million,so far as applicable in this case,is covered by the royal big shield policy.
after the accident,on behalf of okada,filed a claim for alaska workers compensation benefits under part one of the alaska national policy.although alaska national initially processed the claim and paid benefits,it notified on november,that it was controverting the claim because okada was a jones act crewman whose claim was covered under the p i policy.contested alaska national denial of coverage under part one of the policy.however,rather than challenge the loss of workers compensation benefits,okada in july filed suit in the western district of washington against for damages under the jones act,a,and general maritime law.
in may,the p i underwriters entered an agreement with to defend and indemnify for okada claim in the event alaska national denied coverage.the p i underwriters also agreed to waive two coverage limitations that could have operated to exclude okada claim.in return,assigned to the p i underwriters any and all causes of action it had against alaska national.
on december,and the p i underwriters filed the instant suit against alaska national,requesting a declaratory judgment on coverage and allocation of liability.and the p i underwriters later stipulated to okada seaman status at the time of his injury.on april,and the p i underwriters moved for summary judgment,asking the court to determine that coverage for okada injuries fell under part two of the alaska national policy,the employers liability provision,rather than under the p i policies.the district court issued an order on july,directing alaska national to defend the claim because was entitled to look to alaska national mel policy for defense and indemnification.the court also awarded sentry select attorney fees based on the court determination that coverage for okada claims are properly under the alaska national policy.the district court further clarified that although liability had not yet been found,liability would implicate as the employer of okada,and therefore the p i policy would not cover okada claims because that policy covered only as owner of the vessel casey marie.
alaska national then moved for reconsideration,arguing that the district court order failed to separate the duty to defend from the duty to indemnify.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration,but clarified that the previous order held only that alaska national had a duty to defend.the district court further held it would not look to extrinsic evidence of the parties intent to determine if the alaska national policy covered okada claim.alaska national sought interlocutory review from our court and on october,we affirmed the district court decision.sentry select ins.alaska nat.ins,cir.
in the meantime,on august,okada settled his claims against for.following the settlement,on december,and the p i underwriters moved to amend their complaint to add royal as a defendant.they then immediately moved for summary judgment,asking the court to determine that alaska national and royal were in breach of their policies to the extent that those insurers are obligated to defend indemnify plaintiffs pursuant to their policy of marine insurance and sought a declaration of their rights with respect to the policies of marine insurance identified above.on january,the district court issued a stay pending a ruling on the interlocutory appeal.
the district court lifted the stay on october,and the plaintiffs again moved for summary judgment,asking the court to determine the individual insurers respective obligations for reimbursement for the okada settlement.the district court denied the motion on march,and granted the parties additional time for discovery.
alaska national filed a motion for partial summary judgment on september,seeking a declaration that part one of the alaska national policy,the workers compensation provision,did not cover okada claims.royal opposed alaska national motion for summary judgment,arguing that okada claims were properly covered under the alaska national workers compensation provision and that the workers compensation exclusion in its big shield policy precluded liability by royal for a ny obligation of the insured under a workers compensation or any similar laws.royal filed a motion for summary judgment on october,asserting that okada claims did not fall within the mel endorsement of part two of the alaska national policy the may agreement between and the p i underwriters created other excess coverage and the p i underwriters waived their rights to collect from royal and the mel endorsement was void ab initio because violated the federal maritime doctrine of uberrimae fidei,the duty of utmost good faith,because it failed to disclose to royal several material facts prior to the issuance of the mel.and the p i underwriters also filed a motion for summary judgment on october,but the district court struck the motion as untimely.
on january,the district court granted alaska national motion for partial summary judgment,ruling that the okada settlement was not covered by alaska workers compensation laws because the okada settlement settled a jones act negligence claim and not a workers compensation claim.the district court stated that it is well settled that w here an action settles prior to trial the duty to indemnify must be determined on the basis of the settlement,the undisputed facts set forth in the underlying complaint and those known to the parties.alterations in original quoting enron oil trading transp.underwriters of lloyd of london,d,aff in part,rev in part sub nom.enron oil trading transp.walbrook ins,cir.
the district court acknowledged that royal had alleged there had been collusion between sentry select,lloyd,and alaska national which led to the joint stipulation in the first lawsuit that okada was a seaman,but found that this was beside the point at this stage in the litigation.the district court further noted that t hose arguments go to the reasonableness of the settlement,which can not be relitigated and stated that the proper time for royal to have raised the issue of the workers compensation exclusion in its big shield policy would have been at the time of the settlement,when it should have sought to apportion the settlement funds.the court found that the parties settled a jones act negligence claim,not a workers compensation claim,and therefore,the workers compensation portion of the alaska national policy is not implicated in the allocation of the underlying settlement fund.finally,the court found that the settlement was not intended to include any potential workers compensation monies and that the clause in the settlement releasing any such claims did not indicate an actual settlement of such a claim.
the district court issued a separate order on january,granting in part and denying in part royal motion for summary judgment.the court denied royal motion insofar as it rejected royal contention that okada injuries fell outside the scope of the mel endorsement.the district court first found that the terms loading and unloading in the mel endorsement are ambiguous,and that washington law required it to give effect to the reasonable interpretation most favorable to the insured.because the terms loading and unloading appeared in a clause relating to coverage rather than exclusion of coverage,the court found that a broad interpretation was appropriate.the court then adopted a definition of the terms under the complete operation theory,which defines loading and unloading as the entire process involved in the movement of the article,thereby omitting any distinction between loading and preparatory activities or unloading and delivery.citing transamerica ins.group united pac.ins,overruled on other grounds by state olson.
the court next determined that okada employment was incidental to loading and unloading,referencing the definition in the online dictionary which defined incidental as being likely to ensue as a chance or minor consequence.the court then stated there is no question that part of okada employment duties was to assist the crew move sic houses from the tug boat to the construction site.the court has already determined that he was in the process of unloading the house at the time he was injured.therefore,the court reasoned,okada claims fell within the mel endorsement.
the district court granted royal motion for summary judgment on uberrimae fidei because it found that failed to disclose material facts about what type of work its vessel employees performed.the district court found disingenuous and the p i underwriters contention that the federal maritime law of uberrimae fidei was inapplicable because brought the suit in admiralty and initially argued that the big shield policy was marine insurance.
the district court then rejected and the p i underwriters argument that,even if federal maritime law applied,did not have a duty to disclose that its employees would be handling power lines because it knew only that they would be working with lines.the district court found that this excuse mischaracterizes the real issue,reasoning that any reasonable person knows that when handling power lines,whether low voltage or high voltage,there is a risk of handling a wire that has not been and injury could occur.accordingly,the court determined that had violated the duty of utmost good faith and that royal may void its excess liability policy as to okada injuries pursuant to the uberrimae fidei doctrine.finally,because the district court granted summary judgment in favor of royal on the issue of uberrimae fidei,it did not address royal second contention that the p i underwriters waived royal obligation to provide coverage in excess of the mel portion when they agreed to defend and indemnify.
and the p i underwriters timely appeal to this court the district court summary judgment in favor of royal on uberrimae fidei.royal timely the district court summary judgment in favor of alaska national on the question of workers compensation coverage,and in favor of and the p i underwriters on coverage for okada injuries under the mel endorsement.

iii.discussion 
admiralty jurisdiction 
royal argues that either waived or is estopped from raising the argument that the big shield policy is not marine insurance because it brought this action in admiralty,initially claiming that the policy is a marine insurance contract over which we have admiralty jurisdiction.royal also points out that and the p i underwriters can not have it both ways they can not simultaneously argue that the big shield policy is not maritime insurance and that it covers okada jones act claim.
we disagree.although and the p i underwriters did not challenge admiralty jurisdiction until later in the course of the litigation,their failure to challenge the district court subject matter jurisdiction earlier did not waive such a challenge.see attorneys trust videotape computer,cir.a disappointed plaintiff may attack subject matter jurisdiction for the first time on appeal,id.at,and may raise a jurisdictional issue even though it is not of constitutional magnitude.clinton city of new york,d.it is inconsequential to our jurisdictional analysis whether at one point claimed that the policy was a marine insurance policy,because even a joint stipulation can not cure a jurisdictional defect.see rains criterion,cir see also galt ag,cir w e inquire sua sponte whether admiralty or diversity jurisdiction provided the district court with an independent basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction.
we thus turn to the question whether admiralty jurisdiction exists over claim against royal.admiralty jurisdiction hinges on whether the big shield insurance policy with the mel endorsement is a maritime insurance contract.see insurance dunham,wall.holding that admiralty jurisdiction extends to maritime insurance contracts.if the big shield policy is maritime,and the dispute is not inherently local,federal law controls the contract interpretation.norfolk ry.kirby,d citing kossick united fruit,d.
unfortunately,it is often difficult to determine whether a contract is maritime because there are few clean lines between maritime and contracts,norfolk ry,at,and the separation between the two is conceptual rather than spatial,kossick,at.the conceptual boundary is defined by the purpose of the jurisdictional grant the protection of maritime commerce.exxon cent.gulf lines,d internal quotation marks omitted.
to ascertain whether an insurance policy is maritime,we must examine the nature and of the contract,exxon,at,and the true criterion is whether it has reference to maritime service or maritime transactions,norfolk ry,at.internal quotation marks omitted.under the old and now outdated rule,admiralty jurisdiction was said to be reserved to contracts,claims,and services purely maritime,rea v.the eclipse.emphasis added.we have recognized two exceptions to this purely maritime rule.
first,admiralty may take jurisdiction of an entire contract if the nonmaritime obligations are merely incidental to the primary maritime nature of the contract.second,if the nonmaritime obligations are substantial,admiralty may take jurisdiction over any maritime obligations that can be severed from the nonmaritime obligations and separately adjudicated without prejudice to the parties.

the supreme court later decision in norfolk southern railway kirby,d,undercuts the continuing force of these two exceptions by our court.see miller gammie,cir en banc holding that a panel may depart from circuit precedent that has not been expressly overruled when an intervening en banc or supreme court decision has undercut the theory or reasoning underlying the prior circuit precedent in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.
the dispute in norfolk centered on whether a through bill of lading,a single bill of lading under which cargo owners can contract for transportation across oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction,was a maritime contract despite providing for significant land transit by rail.norfolk ry,at.the sea leg of the journey was successful,but the train carrying the cargo inland derailed en route,causing approximately million in damage to the cargo.id.at.the supreme court held that although the accident occurred during the land portion of the journey,the entire bill of lading was nonetheless a maritime contract over which admiralty jurisdiction extended.the court explained that courts can not simply ask whether a ship or other vessel was involved in the dispute,or focus solely on the place of the contract formation or performance.id.at.rather,the dispositive inquiry must be whether the principal objective of the contract is maritime commerce.id.at.
in articulating the primary objective test,the norfolk court explicitly rejected the spatial approach adopted by some lower federal courts,which had determined whether a contract was maritime by assessing whether its land components were incidental to its maritime components.id.at.the court reasoned that it seems to us imprecise to describe the land carriage required by an intermodal transportation contract as incidental realistically,each leg of the journey is essential to accomplishing the contract purpose.id.at.the court then found the incidental test inconsistent with the conceptual approach and overruled it to the extent that it depends solely on geography.id.at.in finding that the through bill of lading was a maritime contract governed by federal law,the court explained that its primary objective was to accomplish the transportation of goods by sea from australia to the eastern coast of the united states.id.at.the court emphasized that the bill of lading character as a maritime contract is not defeated simply because it also provides for some land carriage and that c onceptually,so long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea,its purpose is to effectuate maritime thus it is a maritime contract.id.at.
here,royal argues that the big shield policy is a maritime insurance contract because the maritime obligations contained in the mel endorsement can be severed from the big shield policy.however,we find that our severability exception collapses in the wake of the norfolk court primary objective test.first,severing the maritime components from the components is inconsistent with the court directive that we look to whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce.id.at.second,although the court in norfolk rejected a purely spatial approach,the court stated that g eography is useful only in a limited sense i f a bill sea components are insubstantial,then the bill is not a maritime contract.id.at.emphasis in original.the severability exception incorrectly focuses on the severability of the sea components,not on whether they are insubstantial in comparison to the land components.third,if the court had wished to recognize a severability exception,then there could not have been a better context in which to fashion this exception than the intermodal shipment court could have treated the ocean shipping leg as maritime and severed the land leg of the bill of lading.yet instead,the court employed a primary objective test which examined the contract as a whole to determine whether its primary purpose was to protect or affect maritime commerce.
in rejecting the lower courts piecemeal approach,the norfolk court undermined the viability of our severability exception.id.at.see also folksamerica reinsurance clean water of new york,cir the second circuit incidental exception such that it focuses on whether the principal objective of a contract is maritime commerce,rather than on whether the components are properly characterized as more than incidental or merely incidental to the contract,and holding that admiralty jurisdiction will exist over an insurance contract where the primary or principal objective of the contract is the establishment of policies of marine insurance internal quotation marks and citations omitted.therefore,we decline to apply the severability exception and focus instead on whether the primary objective of the big shield policy was to provide insurance coverage for maritime commerce.see miller,at.
