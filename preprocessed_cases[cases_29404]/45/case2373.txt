this proceeding arises out of a qui tam action against bristol myers squibb to impose civil penalties for violation of the insurance fraud prevention act ifpa,insurance code section et.the relators allege bristol myers employed runners and cappers to induce physicians to prescribe its drugs to their patients.
the california insurance commissioner and related petitioners seek a writ of mandate challenging a summary adjudication order in which the trial court concluded that proof of liability under insurance code section requires that a claim for payment be presented to an insurer that the claim must itself be fraudulent,containing express misstatements of fact and that the claim would not have been presented but for bristol myers unlawful conduct.petitioners contend that the order unduly limits the application of section.
we conclude that for the assessment of monetary penalties but not the imposition of other available remedies,insurance code section requires proof of resulting claims that are in some manner deceitful,though not necessarily containing express misstatements of fact and that causation may be established under the standard test,not the test.accordingly,we grant the writ and reverse the trial court order.
background 
the underlying action 
michael wilson,a former bristol meyers squibb sales representative,on behalf of the people of the state of california,filed the underlying qui tam action against bristol meyers squibb bms on march,and later amended it to add lucius and eve allen,also former bms sales representatives,as relators state of california ex rel.michael wilson,lucius allen,and eve allen,relators bristol meyers squibb,los angeles superior court case no.the complaint was filed in the name of the state of california,under seal,as required by statute,subd.e,and was later unsealed by the court.in march,the california insurance commissioner the commissioner intervened,and an amended complaint was filed on march.the third amended complaint the operative pleading was filed in november 
the lawsuit alleges,in a factually detailed pleading,that in marketing its drugs,bms engaged in a course of illegal and fraudulent conduct aimed at doctors,health care providers,pharmacists,and insurance companies.it alleges bms targeted physicians,members of formulary committees and sometimes their families,to be recipients of lavish gifts and other benefits such as tickets to sporting events and concerts,free rounds of golf,resort vacations,meals,gifts,and other such incentives characterized in the complaint as kickbacks,in order to induce physicians to prescribe bms drugs and to reward them for doing so.the suit alleges bms specifically targeted these benefits to physicians who had large numbers of patients enrolled in private health insurance plans,and instructed its sales representatives to hold the targeted physicians responsible for increased prescriptions expressly characterizing this as shaking the doctors down.and it alleges the targeted physicians wrote prescriptions and submitted them to the private insurance companies as a result of kickbacks bms provided to them.the suit alleges that in carrying out this program,bms effectively employed physicians and others to act as runners and cappers,paying them for the purpose of procuring patients whose prescriptions will be covered by insurance.this conduct,the suit alleges,violated the ifpa,insurance code section,subdivisions a and b,as well as a number of provisions of the penal code.the complaint seeks monetary penalties,equitable relief,and such other and further relief as the court deems proper.
bms has not yet answered,but in its return to the petition it denies the complaint material allegations.for example,bms denies any assertion that its sales representatives gave doctors items of value to try to influence prescription decisions that either the promise to provide or the provision of an item of value to a doctor constitutes a kickback or that its sales representatives or the doctors they called on constitute runners,cappers,steerers or other persons to which the provisions of section,subdivision a,apply.
this petition concerns the proof required to establish a violation of subdivision a of insurance code section,a portion of the ifpa that relates to health insurance and workers compensation insurance fraud,informally entitled,employment of persons to procure clients or patients.subdivision a makes it unlawful to knowingly employ runners or cappers to procure clients or patients to obtain insurance benefits 
subdivision b prescribes civil penalties and other remedies for violation of either subdivision a or penal code sections,or,which target insurance and workers compensation fraud the remaining subdivisions of section relate to the rights,duties,and procedures to be followed by governmental entities and other interested parties in the prosecution,settlement and dismissal of actions brought under subdivisions a and b,and the allocation of fees and costs for the prosecution of such actions.
the summary adjudication motion 
the parties submitted below a stipulated motion for summary adjudication pursuant to subdivision s of code of civil procedure section,which permits summary adjudication of legal issues that the parties stipulate and the trial court agrees will reduce the time to be consumed in trial or will significantly increase the likelihood of settlement.see code civ,subd.s stats,ch.the motion submitted two legal questions based on hypothetical facts to which the parties stipulated for purpose of the motion.
question postulated three hypothetical facts 
bms provided or promised to provide an item or service of value to a physician 
ii.one purpose of bms providing or promising the item or service was to influence the physician to prescribe bms drugs 
iii.subsequent to bms providing or promising the item or service,the physician prescribed a medically appropriate bms drug.
question asked whether there can be a violation of section,subdivision a or b under these hypothetical facts absent proof that the item or service caused the prescription.
question postulated two additional hypothetical facts 
iv.express factual assertions on the claim submitted to the third party for payment of a health care benefit were not misstated 
the claim for payment does not disclose the item or service provided or promised to the physician.
question asked whether subdivision a or b is violated under these facts 
bms argued that both questions should be answered,no.as to question,bms contended that a violation of subdivisions a or b requires proof that but for the provision of the benefit to a physician,the insurer would not have been presented with a claim for the bms drug.as to question,bms contended that a claim to an insurer is not actionable under section,subdivision b,unless it is facially false or fraudulent in other words,unless the claim is for services that were not provided or were not necessary.
the summary adjudication ruling 
the trial court kenneth freeman,judge agreed with bms.it looked to subdivision b final sentence,which states that t he penalty prescribed in subdivision b shall be assessed for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company and not for each violation.italics added.the court held that under that language it is not enough to prove that the unlawful conduct was a substantial factor resulting in the prescription.the court held this language permits the assessment of penalties only if the prescription would not have been written but for the unlawful conduct that the prescriptions must be shown on a and basis to have been a quid pro quo for value provided by bms and that the resulting claim must be independently fraudulent and not merely unlawful,containing on its face an express misstatement of fact 
ruling on the summary adjudication motion,the trial court held that subdivision b penalties can not be assessed under the facts postulated in the summary adjudication motion.under these rulings,neither the conduct made unlawful by subdivision a,nor even much of the conduct that is unlawful under penal code section,can constitute the fraud that is a prerequisite to the assessment of subdivision b penalties.
the trial court filed and served its ruling on september,stating as part of its order that pursuant to code of civil procedure section,appellate resolution of the issues raised by the summary adjudication may materially assist in the resolution of the litigation.
the petition for writ of mandate 
on october,petitioners applied for a writ of mandate or other appropriate relief in this court,filing supporting exhibits and a request for judicial notice of certain documents.on november,we requested opposition to the petition,which we received on november,along with supporting exhibits.on december,we ordered the superior court to show cause why the october,order should not be set aside.bms filed a return to the petition,with supporting exhibits,to which the petitioners replied,also with supporting exhibits,and with an additional request for judicial notice.

the writ petition in this proceeding was timely filed on october.the order granting summary adjudication had been entered september.on october,the trial court granted an extension of the statutory day time within which to petition for an extraordinary writ,to october,as subdivision m of code of civil procedure section gives it discretion to do.
the trial court interpretation of section on undisputed facts raises pure issues of law.it therefore is subject to independent review.pugliese superior court th,california teachers governing bd.of golden valley unified school dist.th.we view the evidence the parties stipulated hypothetical facts,and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and petitioners.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th.
we granted writ review in part due to the dearth of appellate review of matters involving interpretation of section,and because the parties and trial court urged that resolution of issues raised by the motion may in the long run ease the expense of the underlying litigation and its burden on the court in granting the alternative writ,we concluded this is an appropriate matter to be considered on a petition for writ of mandate.fisherman wharf bay cruise superior court,supra,th at.
rulings on requests for judicial notice 
petitioners request judicial notice of the senate committee on criminal procedure analysis of senate bill reg.sess,relating to amendments to section.respondent contends the document is irrelevant but interposes no objection to judicial notice.we grant the request.
petitioners request judicial notice of an excerpt from the legislative counsel digest relating to assembly bill reg.sess.we have received no opposition to the request,which we grant.
petitioners also request judicial notice of a notice of intervention filed by the commissioner in another matter,as well as pleadings and settlement documents from other cases,apparently in order to counter contentions that their interpretations of section are unprecedented.these requests we deny as irrelevant under the de novo standard of review that applies here.
discussion 
summary adjudication questions and.
the parties and the trial court agreed to summary adjudication of questions whether subdivision a or b is violated under the postulated facts.the answers to those literal questions are straightforward.but the trial court ruling on them is somewhat less so.
subdivision a makes unlawful certain conduct done with the intention to induce the presentation of claims to insurers.subdivision b first sentence provides for the imposition of equitable and other remedies,and the assessment of civil monetary penalties,for e very person who violates any provision of subdivision a or specified penal provisions most notably.
the conduct made unlawful by subdivision a is identified by a single verb to employ subdivision a single verb makes a single act unlawful employment.what kind of employment is unlawful employment of a person or persons runners,cappers,steerers or other persons,for a specified purpose to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits that will be the basis for an insurance claim.subdivision a is violated by the employment of others with that objective it does not make proof of that result a prerequisite to its violation.
question postulates that bms provided or promised to provide an item or service of value to a physician in order to induce the prescription of bms drugs,and that the physician thereafter prescribed bms drugs.it thereby assumes an employment for the purpose that subdivision a defines as unlawful the literal answer to question therefore must be yes there can be a violation of subdivision a without proof that the item or service of value provided or promised to the physician caused a particular prescription to be written.
question asks whether subdivision a or b is violated if two additional facts are postulated that the claim for payment has on its face no express misstatement of fact and that the claim for payment does not disclose that the physician received the unlawful inducement.neither of question added facts could negate a violation that rests on the facts postulated in question.certain conduct is defined as unlawful by subdivision a and by penal code section,without regard to any result the conduct may or may not cause.if bms violated subdivision a or penal code section by employing others for the purpose that is defined as unlawful by subdivision a,or by concealing material events or supporting a claim with false or misleading information,subds.b,b,such a violation would not be negated by the absence of an express misstatement of fact contained in a resulting claim.for this reason,the literal answer to question must also be yes there can be a violation of subdivision a even if the claim contains no express misstatement of fact and does not disclose the unlawful conduct.
questions and ask also whether there can be a violation of subdivision b under the postulated facts.but subdivision b does not itself make any conduct unlawful it merely prescribes the remedies that may follow violations of subdivision a and the referenced penal code provisions.
however,the trial court rulings involve not so much whether there can be a violation of these provisions under the postulated facts,but the proof that is required to justify the assessment of civil penalties under subdivision b.we discuss these underlying issues below.
b.the underlying issues.
addressing the issues involved in the trial court rulings,we conclude below that the trial court was correct in ruling that for the assessment of its monetary penalties,subdivision b final sentence requires proof of fraudulent claim s resulting from the defendant unlawful conduct.however,the trial court erred in a number of respects with respect to the proof required to establish these elements.
contrary to the trial court,we conclude 
the fraudulent claim requirement refers broadly to claims that are in some manner deceitful,and is not limited to claims that contain an express misstatement of fact.
whether claims resulting from the conduct made unlawful by subdivision a and penal code section are or are not fraudulent or deceitful within subdivision b meaning can not be determined as a matter of law upon the postulated facts that proof may depend also on factors such as the parties relationship,course of conduct,and communications the facts that are and are not communicated and the materiality of those facts the manner in which the prescriptions and claims were or were not induced and the impact that the inducements did or did not have on the prescriptions written.
subdivision b requirement of claims presented to an insurance company refers to claims that have in some manner resulted from the conduct proscribed by subdivisions a and b.the requirement is a prerequisite to the assessment of subdivision b penalties,but not an element of the offense for which the penalties are assessed.it is not necessarily limited to claims written strictly as a quid pro quo for items of value received from bms,nor to prescriptions that would not have been written and claims that would not have been presented in the absence of the proscribed conduct.
the postulated fact that the prescriptions for which claims are presented are medically appropriate neither compels nor precludes determinations that the claims are in some manner deceitful,or that that the unlawful conduct was a substantial factor in causing them to be written.
for the assessment of civil penalties subdivision b requires proof of claims that are in some manner deceitful.
a legislative history of section and subdivision b.
until,subdivision b first sentence provided the direction for its application every person who violates any provision of this section or section,or of the penal code shall be subject to its civil penalties,as well as to any other available penalties.the language of this provision remained unchanged when subdivision b was amended to add its final sentence in,but that amendment affected its application.the added sentence provided for the first time that subdivision b penalties are to be assessed and measured by the number of fraudulent claims presented to an insurer,rather than for each instance in which subdivision a or the incorporated penal code provisions have been violated.former,amended stats,ch,assem.bill see amendments,deering ann.ed.foll.
the petitioners argue that the legislature purpose in adding subdivision b final sentence was to make the amount of the monetary penalties commensurate with the violators success in increasing the volume of its insurance claims by unlawful means.by making the amount of the penalties proportionate to the number of claims rather than the number of unlawful attempts to induce claims,large and successful violators those most successful in inducing prescriptions for their drugs would be subject to greater penalties than small players in the market.no contrary purpose has been suggested,and bms counsel conceded during oral argument in this proceeding that the legislature apparent purpose in adding subdivision b final sentence was to maximize,rather than reduce,the penalties to be imposed.
the actual impact of the amended language,as interpreted by the trial court in this case,apparently will be the opposite of that intention.section provides for a system of enforcement incentives in which qui tam plaintiffs typically whistleblowers,as in the underlying proceeding file the action,to be joined by the commissioner,subds.d,e,f,subd.c.such procedures modeled on those of the false claims act,et enable and encourage the enforcement of regulatory provisions,such as section,that would otherwise be beyond the resources of public entities to enforce.state ex rel.harris pricewaterhousecoopers,llp cal th,see state of california ex rel.metz farmers group,th,subdivision b was designed to encourage insurers to bring section actions.without these procedures to involve potential whistleblowers in the enforcement of regulatory provisions such as section,the commissioner would lack the evidence and the resources to discover violations and to prosecute action such as these 
the likely impact of the final sentence of subdivision b,as interpreted by the trial court,would be to render the imposition of penalties difficult or impossible,thereby removing from section much of the incentive for qui tam whistleblower participation.whistleblower participants in the underlying case,former employees of bms typically provide key information concerning the violations on which qui tam actions are based.but while the former employees of bms can provide information about,for example,payments made by their employer to induce prescriptions of its drugs,information about the results of those payments whether a particular claim resulted from a particular violation is likely to be far less available.this sort of problem of proof is seen in many regulatory arenas,ranging from insider trading to campaign finance.typically,proof is available to show that a particular stock transaction followed disclosure of particular information,or that favorable votes followed contributions or gifts but proof of the causal relationship between such events is ordinarily a matter of inference rather than eyewitness testimony.a requirement that causation must be established will often make subdivision b penalties unavailable even when violations of subdivision a or penal code section may be clear.
we have discovered no indication that in adding the final sentence to subdivision b the legislature intended or even considered its negative impact on the enforcement of the ifpa regulatory scheme,by drastically narrowing the application of its penalties to those circumstances in which a fraudulent claim can be shown to have resulted from the unlawful conduct.nevertheless,while courts will not give statutory language a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences in re cal th,where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.ennabe manosa cal th,quoting in re jennings cal th.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,we must presume the legislature meant what it said.day city of fontana cal th.
despite the legislature apparent intention to maximize the penalties for violators whose unlawful conduct resulted in large numbers of claims,we can not ignore its addition of the final sentence to subdivision b,nor the resulting change in the law.legislative intent must be garnered from the revised language rather than the version it replaced.subdivision b amendment to provide that its penalties shall be assessed not necessarily against every person who violates subdivision a or the referenced penal code sections,but only for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company by a defendant and not for each violation,requires some proof of claims that are characterized by fraud and are causally related to the violations,as discussed below.
b subdivision b requirement that its civil penalties are assessed based on proof of fraudulent claims does not apply to equitable or other remedies.
subdivision a and penal code section make specified conduct unlawful.apart from that,they contain no requirement that the unlawful conduct must have resulted in actual prescriptions and claims to insurers,nor any requirement that any claim must be independently fraudulent.under subdivision b,every person who is guilty of the unlawful conduct shall be subject to the specified civil penalties,to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law,and to other equitable relief.subdivision f of section provides that these remedies are nonexclusive.subdivision g of section provides for the reimbursement of costs and attorney fees in certain instances.
the final sentence of subdivision b limits the assessment of its penalties to something less than every person who is guilty of the unlawful conduct,however.under it,the penalty prescribed in this paragraph may be assessed only for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company,and not for each act that violates subdivision a or the incorporated penal provisions.the penalty prescribed in this paragraph is the civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars,and the assessment of not more than three times the amount of each claim for compensation but it does not encompass the other equitable relief that is authorized by subdivision b,including injunction,disgorgement,costs,and attorneys fees,nor the other penalties that may be prescribed by law.those additional remedies which are outlined but not specifically defined are not within the meaning of the penalty prescribed by this paragraph.
the petitioners contend,with some justification,that this interpretation of subdivision b,requiring proof of resulting fraudulent claims for the assessment of its penalties,will effectively condone and immunize conduct that the legislature plainly intended to proscribe.proof that a claim for payment of a prescription resulted directly from bribery and fraud used to induce the prescription,they contend,is an almost impossible burden,rendering subdivision b toothless to civilly prosecute or regulate drug companies use of prohibited means to procure prescriptions and profits.and they contend that the error of this interpretation is shown by the fact that it renders subdivision a superfluous,because under penal code section proof of a fraudulent claim would alone be sufficient to justify assessment of subdivision b penalties.under the trial court interpretation,they argue,subdivision a is rendered unnecessary surplusage there would never be any reason to go to the trouble of establishing its violation by running or capping,because subdivision b penalties would be available even without it.that result,they contend,violates the mandate that statutes must be interpreted to give effect to all of the statutory language.code civ.
but the requirement that fraudulent claims resulted from the unlawful conduct does not render subdivision a wholly superfluous,although it does limit the application of subdivision b to far less than the petitioners urge.subdivision b leaves the court with equitable and other remedies such as injunction and disgorgement to address violations that can not be causally connected with fraudulent claims.subdivision a remains a viable identification of running or capping activity as conduct that the legislature has found to be unlawful,and to be almost always a harbinger of fraud.analysis of comm.on crim,bill reg.sess.
in adding the final sentence to subdivision b,the legislature could and presumably did conclude that the employment of runners and cappers that does not result in claims,or that results only in nonfraudulent claims,may appropriately be remedied by equitable devices,but that when the result is the presentation of fraudulent claims,the additional consequence of subdivision b monetary penalties is justified.this is consistent with the clear words of the statute,and we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.ennabe manosa,supra,cal th at.if the resulting remedies are less vigorous than the legislature intended,it is there that correction must be sought.
under the clear language of subdivision b,the equitable and other remedies that do not constitute the penalty prescribed in this paragraph may be imposed without proof that a prescription or claim resulted from the unlawful conduct,or that any resulting claim was fraudulent or deceitful.
c the assessment of civil penalties under subdivision b requires proof of resulting claims that involve deceit.
relying on subdivision b requirement that penalties must be assessed on the basis of fraudulent claims to insurers,the trial court ruled that subdivision b can not be violated unless claims presented for payment are themselves independently fraudulent,and that the fraud must consist of an express misstatement of fact contained in the claim.it reasoned that i f the express factual assertions on the claim were not misstated,then the claim would not be a fraudulent one subjecting the presenter of the claim to liability under subdivision b.
the statute does not justify the prerequisites that this ruling imposes on the assessment of penalties under subdivision b.under the trial court interpretation,the requisite fraud can not be established by proof of the sort that would ordinarily be sufficient to prove deceit,such as the intentional concealment or nondisclosure of material facts it can not be established by proof of communications or a course conduct apart from the contents of the particular claim and it can not be inferred from the commission of acts that are unlawful under subdivision a or the incorporated penal code provisions.it can be established only by proof of an express factual assertion on the face of the claim.we disagree.
subdivision b provides that every person who violates any provision of subdivision a or of penal code section shall be subject to its civil penalties,which are to be assessed on the basis of the fraudulent claims presented to insurers.neither subdivision a nor penal code section expressly identify fraud as an independent requirement.subdivision a is violated by the employment of runners or cappers to induce claims that will be subject to insurance.penal code section may be violated not only by the knowing submission of claims that are false or fraudulent,subd.a,but also by the knowing concealment or failure to disclose material information,and by knowingly making false or misleading statements in connection with insurance claims,subds.a,b b.
california law uses the words fraud and deceit interchangeably.gonsalves hodgson cal d,sixta ochsner d,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.a claim is fraudulent if it is characterized by deceit,dishonesty,or trickery,perpetrated to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.webster college,supra,at.this broad definition comports with the admonition of subdivision c of section that subdivision b remedies are to be adjusted to conform to other available remedies in light of the statute remedial purpose it is consistent also with subdivision b incorporation of the violations in penal code section,which encompass deceits shown by false or fraudulent claims,subd.a,and statements that are false or misleading,subds.a,b b.
the words fraudulent claim in subdivision b do not justify the trial court narrow interpretation,which limits actionable claims to those that contain express misstatements of fact.in construing a statute,the objective sought to be achieved and the evil sought to be prevented by the statute are of prime consideration.where words of common usage have more than one meaning,the one which will best attain the purposes of the statute should be adopted,even though the ordinary meaning is thereby enlarged or restricted and this is especially true where necessary to avoid absurdity.people ex rel.san francisco bay conservation development com.town of emeryville cal d.far from justifying this narrow interpretation of subdivision b reference to fraudulent claims,the provision context suggests that the term must be interpreted broadly,to encompass not just claims that can be shown to themselves contain fraudulent statements,but also those characterized in any way by deceit.
a substantial purpose for subdivisions a and b enactment is to enable the assessment of civil penalties for unlawful running and capping activities,without the practically impossible showing that a particular claim resulted from a particular violation.such a showing,if it were possible,would likely be sufficient to establish not just violations of subdivision a and penal code section,but also bribery or illegal kickbacks in violation of business and professions code section and undoubtedly other provisions of law.while section nowhere defines the conduct identified in subdivision a as necessarily fraudulent or deceitful,neither is there any indication that such conduct is categorically free of fraud when it is characterized by deceit,dishonesty,or trickery,perpetrated to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.webster college,supra,at.the legislature has found that conduct to be unlawful,and almost always to be identified with fraud.analysis of com.on crim,bill reg.sess.the legislature is unquestionably justified in seeking to curb that conduct,not because it is itself necessarily fraudulent or deceitful though it often may be,but because of the difficulties of proving the fraudulent nature of either the conduct or its consequences.
subdivision a identifies certain running and capping activities as unlawful without regard to whether the resulting services are competently rendered.running and capping activities are disfavored and unlawful not just because they may often result in services that are excessive or unnecessary,but also because their purpose is to unfairly and perhaps deceptively obtain the benefits clients,patients,prescriptions,claims,that otherwise might have gone to others who did not use the prohibited methods.in enacting section,the legislature could have concluded that using runners and cappers for the prohibited purpose tends to result in additional insurance claims and payments,that have substantial social costs despite their inability to be identified on an individual basis.subdivision b identifies remedies for conduct that the legislature has concluded leads to undesirable results that are rarely subject to available proof.
upon proof of a cause of action for deceit,the plaintiffs would be entitled to the damages resulting from the defendant wrongful conduct.but subdivision b is not a substitute for a civil tort action for deceit.it provides civil penalties for conduct that is made unlawful by other provisions of law the plaintiffs in an action for its penalties are not direct victims,they did not rely on any misstatements or nondisclosures,and they suffered no resulting harm apart from that suffered by insurance policyholders and society as a whole.
yet even fraud that would be sufficient to give rise to a tort action for deceit would not necessarily satisfy the trial court requirement of proof that the resulting claim contained an affirmative misstatement of fact.proof of fraud even a cause of action for damages for deceit does not depend on proof of affirmative misstatements of fact,nor on their location in particular documents or claims actual fraud may be conduct that does not constitute an express misstatement of fact,and that is not embodied in any particular document including,for example,concealment or suppression of a material fact,as well as a ny other act fitted to deceive,subds.an action for fraud or deceit will lie,for example,for the suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it,or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact,subd.see,subd.
this context gives ample reason to interpret subdivision b requirement of fraudulent claims broadly,to encompass claims that result from deceit or conduct that is done with an intention to gain unfair or dishonest advantage.webster college,supra.there is no reason to conclude as a matter of law that the legislature intended the term fraudulent in subdivision b to have a narrower meaning.
california law recognizes many circumstances in which the proof required to show fraud requires far less than would be required to establish a civil cause of action for fraud,hughes bd.of architectural examiners th,fraud or deceit sufficient to justify revocation of professional license,shown by misrepresentations on resume and license application,without proof of any defect in quality of resulting services or reliance by any client murrill state board of accountancy.d,accountant intentional failure to file income tax returns found to be conduct characterized as fraud or deceit.in the underlying case certain conduct is alleged to have been done in order to induce additional prescriptions and claims to insurers for bms drugs,using methods that subdivision a and penal code section identify as unlawful.we are unable to discern in these provisions a legislative intent that subdivision b penalties can be available only upon proof that a claim resulting from the unlawful conduct would also independently support a cause of action for fraud,that the unlawful conduct can not be used to show the requisite fraud,or that the fraud must consist of affirmative misstatements of fact contained in claims presented to insurers.
the fraudulent claim requirement does not limit the availability of the equitable and other remedies available under subdivision b but it does limit the imposition of subdivision b civil penalties to proof of claims that have a causal relationship to the unlawful conduct,and that are in some manner deceitful.
the conduct made unlawful by section may but does not necessarily constitute fraudulent conduct within the meaning of subdivision b.
the parties have postulated for the purpose of their summary adjudication motion that items or services of value have been provided in order to induce prescriptions of bms drugs,that bms drugs were thereafter prescribed,and that the claims for payment did not disclose those facts.but beyond that sparse outline,the actual facts remain unknown at this stage of the trial court proceedings.contrary to the parties urging,we conclude that the postulated facts do not provide a sufficient factual basis on which to conclude that bms conduct either does,or does not,constitute the fraud that is required for the assessment of penalties under subdivision b.
contrary to the petitioners urging,we are unable to find anything in the statutory language or history of section that defines the nature of the fraud that is required for the assessment of penalties,or that equates subdivision a unlawful conduct with fraudulent claims.by the same token,however,we discern no basis on which to conclude that the conduct that is unlawful under subdivision a could not,upon a sufficient factual showing,be found to be fraudulent within the meaning of subdivision b.the legislature could have defined subdivision a unlawful conduct as constituting fraud,or it could have provided that penalties shall be assessed for claims arising from the unlawful conduct but it did neither.it could also have specified that fraud must be established by some particular proof,but that,too,it did not do.as in most cases,the existence of fraud remains an issue of fact.
subdivision b says nothing at all concerning the countless forms that fraud and deceit may take,nor to limit the evidence by which it might be proved.various possible factual circumstances might strengthen,weaken,or wholly negate any inference of deceit that could arise from the drug company conduct.these factors might include the magnitude of the unlawful conduct,whether the bms drug is medically preferred,and whether the nature and extent of the drug companies incentives have been disclosed,for example.
the postulated facts are not sufficient to demonstrate either the existence or nonexistence of fraud in the transaction.we therefore conclude that the showing of fraud that is required for the assessment of penalties is neither established as a matter of law by subdivision a unlawful conduct,nor can the existence of that unlawful conduct necessarily preclude a factual determination that it constitutes or evidences fraud.
the assessment of civil penalties under subdivision b requires proof of claims resulting from unlawful conduct,but not necessarily proof that without the unlawful conduct the claim would not have been presented.
the trial court interpreted subdivision b to require proof of causation as a predicate to assessment of subdivision b penalties,relying on the provision in subdivision b final sentence,that its penalties may be assessed only for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurer.although petitioners dispute that subdivision b requires proof that specific claims resulted from specific violations,they nevertheless correctly concede,at least implicitly,that there must be some manner of causal relationship between the unlawful conduct and its results.the penalties can not be imposed merely because claims for prescriptions of bms drugs have been presented sometime after bms engaged in the proscribed conduct.
we agree that to justify subdivision b penalties,there must be a causal relationship between the prohibited conduct and the prescriptions the unlawful conduct must be shown to have been a substantial factor resulting in the claims for bms prescriptions.and while an inference of causation may often arise when one event follows another,that temporal relationship may not alone be sufficient.
just as factors such as the magnitude and temporal proximity of the unlawful conduct might evidence or negate the existence of fraud,so too might many of the same factors influence the extent to which an inference of causation is appropriate.any number of possible circumstances might severely weaken or negate the inference of a causal relationship such as whether the bms drug is a medically preferred prescription whether it was supplied although the prescription was for another company drug,a substitution by pharmacy,or resulting from an insurance company preference whether the magnitude of the unlawful conduct justifies an inference that it had a substantial influence on the drug selection and whether the passage of time since the unlawful conduct has been so great as to dissipate any such inference.
notwithstanding the petitioners apparent understanding that a causal relationship must exist between the unlawful conduct and its results,they dispute the trial court ruling that causation must be shown on a basis,however.they argue the requisite causation may be proof that bms unlawful conduct was a substantial factor leading to the claims.this might be established,for example,by showing that the unlawful conduct strongly influenced the physician or his or her decisionmaker in determining what medication to prescribe.bms argues that petitioners must prove more,however they must prove not just that bms unlawful conduct strongly influenced the result,but that without the unlawful conduct,the physician would not have written the prescriptions and the claims for payment would not have been presented.
the trial court agreed with bms,concluding that the proof must in all cases show not only that unlawful conduct was a substantial factor influencing physicians to write prescriptions,but also that without that conduct the prescriptions would not have been written.the court reasoned that such proof is required by the final sentence of subdivision b,and the decision in viner sweet cal th.we conclude this requirement fails to take into account the possibility of concurrent independent causes for the physician conduct.
in viner sweet,a suit for damages for legal malpractice,the supreme court reaffirmed its holding in rutherford owens illinois,cal th,that california has definitively adopted the substantial factor test of the restatement second of torts for determinations.viner sweet,supra,cal th at.under the test set forth in restatement second of torts section,the substantial factor test subsumes the test of causation,e xcept as stated in subsection of that section.the exception stated in subsection provides that the test does not apply if two forces are actively operating and each of itself is sufficient to bring about harm to another in such circumstances,the actor conduct may be found to be a substantial factor in bringing about the result,without proof that the result would not have occurred but for the actor conduct.viner sweet,supra,cal th at.the court thus recognized that when multiple forces operate independently,each of which is sufficient by itself to bring about the harm,a force that is a substantial factor in bringing about the harm may be found to have caused the harm.the supreme court recently reaffirmed this rule in in re ethan cal th,holding that the but for limitation on proof of causation does not apply if the wrongful conduct would alone have produced the harm even without the contribution by other forces.id.at see rest d torts.
the viner sweet,supra,decision therefore does not support the trial court ruling that causation necessarily must be established on a basis.see engalla permanente medical group,cal th,to show that plaintiff damages resulted from defendant misrepresentation,i t is not necessary that a plaintiff reliance upon the truth of the fraudulent misrepresentation be the sole or even the predominant or decisive factor in influencing his conduct it is enough that the representation has played a substantial part,and so has been a substantial factor,in influencing his decision.rest d torts,com.b.this reasoning is reflected also in in re tobacco ii cases cal th,in which the supreme court reiterated the engalla decision analysis of the causation requirement.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at pp.although proof of causation often requires proof that the plaintiff would not have acted as he or she did in the absence of the fraud,under the fraud prong of the unfair competition law bus,et.it is not necessary that the plaintiff reliance upon the truth of the fraudulent misrepresentation be the sole or even the predominant or decisive factor in influencing his conduct it is enough that the representation has played a substantial part,and so has been a substantial factor,in influencing his decision.citation.in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at.
here,the stipulated facts expressly assume a physician prescribes a medically appropriate drug.given a choice among two or more medically appropriate drugs,the reasons why a physician would prescribe one over another could include many possible factors,including not just the physician independent medical judgment as to the particular prescription,but also,for example,patient requests and preferences,direct advertising,relative costs of alternative treatments and drugs,dictates of institutional formularies,availability of particular drugs,insurance company preferences,and of course the unlawful conduct in which bms had engaged to induce such prescriptions.
these potential causes can be,and in some respects must be,independent.benefits provided to a physician by a drug company such as tickets for the physician family to attend amusement parks,sporting events,or vacation spas do not implicate the physician medical knowledge or judgment in selecting which drugs to prescribe.patient preferences might or might not reasonably influence physicians medical judgments.institutional formularies might impose requirements that influence or override physicians independent judgments,based on economy and other factors,which might themselves be influenced by unearned benefits received from a drug company.logic does not dictate that these causes necessarily combine with or depend on one another.they might and,as a matter of motivational diversity alone,probably do militate toward conflicting results.
the trial court reliance on viner sweet,supra,as the controlling authority on the causation issue assumes that bms conduct could operate as a causative factor only in combination with these forces,not independently or at odds with
