liberty mutual insurance company liberty,a general liability insurer,filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend or indemnify one of its policyholders,fag bearings corporation fag,in various class actions and administrative proceedings arising out of environmental contamination at fag joplin,missouri plant.the district court granted liberty summary judgment,finding that fag was precluded from relitigating the relevant issues regarding coverage because they had been decided in an earlier action between liberty and fag,and alternatively,that the liability insurance policy did not cover the alleged acts potentially giving rise to fag liability in the underlying suits.furthermore,the district court concluded that the insurance policy did not create a duty to defend in administrative proceedings.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
background 
this is the second time these two parties have appeared in a case before this court in,liberty brought a declaratory judgment action lm i,seeking to determine its obligation under a liability policy to defend and indemnify fag in two civil actions,lewis fag bearings the lewis action and thomas fag bearings the moretz action,and two administrative proceedings involving the epa and the missouri department of natural resources mdnr.the district court in lm i the lm i court found that recurring malfunctions in fag trichloroethylene tce reclamation system at its joplin plant caused airborne emissions that led to the groundwater contamination,property damage,and bodily injury giving rise to the underlying actions.see liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,slip op.at.may.in granting liberty motion for summary judgment,the lm i court found that these releases fell within the pollution exclusion clause in fag liability insurance policy because they were not sudden and accidental.id.at.the lm i court noted in its summary judgment order and in a subsequent order denying fag motion to alter and amend judgment,that its ruling in the case did not determine the parties rights in other pending or future actions.
fag filed a rule b motion for relief from judgment in lm i on the basis of newly discovered evidence,specifically,expert reports used against it in a related contribution action gulf states showing that fag released tce in a number of ways other than through airborne emissions.the court in gulf states,notably the same court as that in lm i,found that in addition to the faulty vapor recovery system,fag lost between and gallons of tce through pump malfunctions,still bottoms generated during distillation of tce,collection tank overflows,leaking barrels,dumping,incidental use by employees,and seal leaks in the vault.see fag bearings gulf states paper,et,wl,slip op.at.the lm i court denied fag motion,finding that fag had not exercised due diligence in discovering the other sources of release,that the evidence was merely cumulative,and that fag did not even assert that any of the new sources of contamination were sudden and accidental.
on appeal,we affirmed the lm i court judgment.see at.we held that fag had failed to put forward evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there were releases of tce other than the vapor emissions that were sudden and accidental.id.we noted that although the complaints in the underlying suits alleged other methods of release,the undisputed evidence in the moretz action related only to vapor releases through the tce reclamation system,and fag failed to put forward evidence to create an issue to the contrary.in affirming the lm i court denial of fag rule b motion,we agreed that fag had failed to exercise due diligence in discovering the new evidence.id.at.
in,liberty filed the complaint in this action lm ii,seeking to determine its obligation to defend and indemnify fag in two civil actions,the lewis action and black fag bearings,and the administrative proceeding involving the epa.fag filed a counterclaim,seeking reimbursement for defense costs and indemnification in these actions as well as the mdnr investigation.at some point after the complaint was filed,the parties amended their pleadings to add the case of hughes fag bearings to the list of underlying suits for which fag was seeking coverage.
the lewis action was filed in and resulted in a jury verdict of in compensatory damages and in punitive damages.the punitives were set aside by the trial court.in september,the missouri court of appeals affirmed the judgment which awarded compensatory damages to lewis and which abrogated the jury award of punitive damages.see lewis,at.the evidence in lewis was based almost entirely on fag allegedly improper tce storage and disposal practices during the years it utilized tce in it operations.id.at.the black action was filed in and settled in after the discovery of new scientific evidence.the hughes action was filed in and is still pending in missouri state court.
the mdnr began its investigation of the joplin facility in.after determining that fag was a potentially responsible party for the groundwater contamination,the mdnr demanded that fag remediate the contamination and fund a new public drinking water system.in,fag entered an abatement order on consent with the mdnr,requiring fag to conduct an investigation and remediation at the joplin facility.in september,the epa sent an information request to fag regarding the joplin site.in january,the epa simultaneously filed a complaint seeking reimbursement for response and removal costs at the joplin facility,and an agreed upon consent decree under which fag must pay.
fag alleges for the first time in lm ii that the contamination giving rise to the underlying claims resulted when a plumbing contractor working for fag cut an underground,abandoned pipeline on fag property in or.the pipeline was originally used to transport tce and was allegedly drained and capped in when fag stopped using the chemical.some months later,fag directed that the pipe be cut for use in a new system,at which time a clear liquid flowed from the pipe.the only fag employee to witness this event believed that the liquid was water and directed the plumbing contractor to continue his work.varying testimony indicates that the liquid continued to flow into the ground for at least thirty minutes,and for up to two hours after the cut.later evidence indicated that the liquid was actually tce that had remained in the pipe after it was capped in.
according to fag,the first evidence of the pipeline cut was discovered in by its adversaries in other litigation.fag alleges that the concentration of tce in the pipeline trench is times greater than any other location at its joplin facility.based on the opinions of its experts,fag asserts that the tce released from the pipe cut was the primary,if not the exclusive,source of contamination in the surrounding groundwater,and that its discovery proves that the conclusions of the lm i court as to the source of contamination were erroneous.fag argues that the release from the pipe was sudden and accidental and,therefore,covered under the liberty policy.
in an order granting partial summary judgment in lm ii,the district court found that the decision in lm i precludes fag from relitigating the issue of liberty obligation to defend and indemnify fag in other actions based on tce releases.the court,on its own initiative,also went on to find that even if it was to consider evidence of the pipe cut as a source of tce contamination,releases from the cut were not sudden and accidental and,therefore,fall outside the policy coverage.finally,the court determined that liberty owes no duty to defend or indemnify fag in the administrative proceedings,because they are not suits within the coverage of the insurance policy.fag appeals the judgment,challenging the district court application of issue preclusion,its finding that releases from the pipe cut were not sudden and accidental,and its conclusion that the administrative proceedings are not suits.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing the district court grant of summary judgment,we review de novo its conclusions of law,see tillery hoffman enclosures,cir,including the availability of issue preclusion,see boudreau stores,cir a trial court determination as to whether the legal prerequisites for issue preclusion have been met on the facts before it is a mixed question of law and fact,subject to de novo review by this court.therefore,if issue preclusion is unavailable as a matter of law,we owe no deference to the district court decision to apply that doctrine.
liberty argues that we must apply an abuse of discretion standard of review.we disagree.a number of courts have concluded that although the availability of issue preclusion is subject to de novo review,because the district court has broad discretion to determine whether the doctrine should be applied when available,appellate courts should review this secondary decision for an abuse of discretion.see united states sandoz pharms,cir,cert.denied,d plaine mccabe,cir.we note that the cases adopting this abuse of discretion standard generally rely upon parklane hosiery shore,d adopting a test of discretion with respect to nonmutual offensive collateral estoppel only.see,berger transfer storage central states pension fund,cir setter robins,cir state daniels.because mutuality is not lacking in this case,the equitable considerations requiring deference to the district court evaluation of the overall fairness to the litigants in a nonmutual case are not present.balbirer austin,cir we note at the outset that application of collateral estoppel in a particular case is a matter of trial court discretion,but that this court exercises plenary review over the rules governing collateral estoppel.
issue preclusion 
we look to state law in determining whether to apply issue preclusion.see royal ins.of am.kirksville coll.of osteopathic,cir.this rule applies even when the original judgment is that of another federal court sitting in diversity.follette stores,cir citations omitted,cert.denied,d.
the underlying goal of issue preclusion,also known as collateral estoppel,is to promote judicial economy and finality in litigation.thus,when an issue of ultimate fact has been determined by a valid judgment,it may not again be litigated between the same parties.king contractors reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints,en banc see also restatement second of judgments when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties,whether on the same or a different claim.under missouri law,we consider three factors in determining whether to apply the doctrine 
whether the issue decided in the prior adjudication was identical to the issue presented in the present action whether the prior adjudication resulted in a judgment on the merits and whether the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.
king contractors,at.furthermore,only those issues actually and necessarily decided in the first suit may have preclusive effect in a subsequent action.see brown felsen,d whereas res judicata forecloses all that which might have been litigated previously,collateral estoppel treats as final only those questions actually and necessarily decided in a prior suit.abeles wurdack,a judgment between the same parties on a different cause of action is binding as to the facts actually decided,and necessarily determined in rendering the judgment.
at times,courts also apply an additional factor when analyzing collateral estoppel.see,aetna cas.sur.dynamics,cir stating that the fourth factor requires a court to determine whether the party against whom preclusion is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue shahan shahan,en banc same.however,the full and fair opportunity to litigate factor was developed to analyze cases where the parties in the first action are not the same as those in the second.see james paul,en banc describing the full and fair opportunity to litigate factor as a shorthand description of the analysis required to determine if collateral estoppel permits use of a prior judgment to preclude relitigation of an issue even though the party asserting collateral estoppel was not a party to the prior case emphasis added.accord haberer woodbury county,cir applying iowa law and refusing to consider the full and fair opportunity to litigate factor where the parties in both actions were the same restatement second of judgments and cmt.g limiting the fairness inquiry in cases with the same parties to situations involving misconduct by adversaries or other special circumstances.fag and liberty were both parties in lm i,therefore,absent a strong showing to the contrary,we assume that both had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the relevant issues.accord restatement second of judgments cmt.j noting that preclusion can be avoided by a compelling showing of unfairness.
analyzing these requirements,the district court observed that the only factor in dispute is the identity of the issues in both cases.in rejecting fag attempt to define the issue in lm i the airborne releases of tce prior to were sudden and accidental the court noted that fag tactic of limiting the evidence presented in lm i did not change the issue that was decided.instead,the district court defined the issue in lm i broadly and concluded that it is the identical issue being litigated in lm character of,and derivatively the insurance coverage for,fag tce releases.the district court concluded that the decision in lm i precludes fag in lm ii from presenting any sources of tce contamination other than vapor emissions.
on appeal,fag argues that issue preclusion should not apply because the issues in lm i and lm ii are not identical there has been a material change in circumstances since lm i was decided and application of the doctrine would be inequitable.we address each argument in turn.
first,fag asserts that the issues in lm i and lm ii are not identical and,therefore,that issue preclusion can not apply.defining the issue in the prior litigation is crucial in determining whether issue preclusion is available.generally speaking,the broader a court defines the issue previously litigated,the more likely it is to have preclusive effect in a subsequent litigation.on the other hand,by defining the issue narrowly and only in terms of the evidence or arguments actually considered by the court,litigants may be successful in arguing that the second proceeding involves a new or distinct issue not decided in the first.using this tactic,fag asserts that the only issue decided in lm i was whether its airborne emissions of tce were sudden and accidental releases,and that the issue presented in lm ii is whether the pipeline cut was a sudden and accidental release.
the court below rejected this narrow definition of the issue in lm i,as do we.in granting summary judgment to liberty,the lm i court necessarily decided three relevant issues.ultimately,the court determined that liberty had no obligation to indemnify or to continue to defend fag in the moretz action.in reaching this conclusion,the lm i court also determined,based on the undisputed evidence,that the only sources of contamination were airborne emissions of tce released through fag reclamation system next,the lm i court concluded that these airborne emissions were not sudden and accidental releases and,therefore,were excluded by the policy.
in lm ii,the ultimate issue is whether liberty has an obligation to indemnify and defend fag in a number of other underlying suits arising out of the same contamination at issue in moretz.the two subissues in this case are the same as those in lm identification of the sources of release and whether those releases were sudden and accidental.as the district court noted,the fact that fag now possesses previously unpresented evidence as to the sources of release does not serve to change the issues decided in lm 
fag argues that this broad definition of the issue in lm i is directly contrary to the limitations expressed by the lm i court in granting summary judgment.in a footnote in its may,order,and again in the order denying fag motion to alter and amend judgment,the lm i court stated 
we make no finding with respect to liberty duty to defend fag in actions which involve third party defendants,or in actions based upon facts other than those now before the court.in addition,with respect to any pending case in which settlement has not been reached,liberty is cautioned that it continues to be obligated to defend fag against complainants filing substantially false or fraudulent claims.
liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,slip op.at.may.fag asserts that this statement prevents the order from having any preclusive effect in this litigation.as explained below,we agree with the district court that fag arguments fail to properly acknowledge the distinctions between claim preclusion and issue preclusion.liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,slip op.at.may.
the district court noted that the purpose for the lm i court statements was to avoid the effect of claim preclusion in future cases.id.at despite fag attempts to expand the scope of his ruling,judge stevens decision was necessarily limited to the moretz action because he did not know what allegations were or would be raised in other lawsuits.not knowing whether a plaintiff might sue fag for injuries resulting from the release of a chemical other than tce as intimated by both parties filings,judge stevens simply acknowledged that his judgment could have no effect over those cases when he refrained from addressing liberty mutual obligations in suits other than the moretz action.although his decision did not necessarily decide the rights and obligations of the parties as to other pending or future suits,any issues necessarily determined by judge stevens in the resolution of lm i,to the extent that they are now common to this pending action,can not be relitigated.
the issue of the source of tce groundwater contamination at fag factory was actually litigated and necessarily decided in lm i,and,therefore,may not be relitigated in lm ii.in order to determine whether fag tce releases were sudden and accidental,the lm i court was required to ascertain the source of those releases.the lm i court did not simply look to the moretz record and assume that vapor emissions were the only source of contamination.fag consistently argued that the faulty tce reclamation system was not the sole source of the contamination giving rise to the underlying actions,and recognized that a finding to the contrary could serve to prejudice fag in future actions.the lm i court and this court both rejected its repeated attempts to argue this position because fag allegations were not supported by sufficient evidence to raise an issue of material fact as to the existence of any other source of contamination or any other methods of release.
next,fag argues that even if the issues are the same,there is an exception to the application of issue preclusion where circumstances have changed since the initial litigation.according to fag,the changed circumstances exception allows litigants to avoid issue preclusion where the underlying facts have changed or where new evidence requiring a different result is discovered.fag asserts that the recent discovery of the pipe cut incident qualifies either as a change in events or as newly discovered evidence and,therefore,prohibits the application of issue preclusion.
fag argues that the discovery of the pipe cut incident is the same as a change in the underlying facts.we disagree.the cases cited by fag all involve situations where the courts refused to apply collateral estoppel because of events that occurred or relationships that actually changed between the first and second actions.in this case,all of the events giving rise to fag liability in the underlying suits occurred before the filing of lm where the first and second actions are both based on an evaluation of the same historical facts,a litigant seeking to introduce newly discovered evidence otherwise in existence at the time of the first suit may not argue that the facts have changed in the time period between the two actions in order to avoid the preclusive effect of the first decision.the line of cases cited by fag is clearly distinguishable.see,montana united states,d noting that changes in facts essential to a judgment will render collateral estoppel inapplicable and citing as examples cases dealing with alteration of alimony in light of remarriage by former wife,reevaluation of amount of condemnation award in subsequent condemnation actions where effect of government option is dependent on changing economic conditions,and reevaluation of taxpayer status in subsequent tax years farrow brown,refusing to apply preclusion in action for private road where issue of necessity had been decided years earlier and physical changes to the land had occurred in the meantime.
fag also argues that because restatement second of judgments cmt.j suggests that there should be no preclusion where new evidence has become available that could likely lead to a different result,it should not be precluded from introducing evidence of the pipe cut in lm ii.fag relies upon its earlier failures to present evidence of the pipe cut to argue that coverage for damages arising out of that incident was not actually litigated.liberty argues that because fag had an opportunity to present evidence of the other types of release in lm i and failed to do so,it is precluded from attempting to present that additional evidence now.the court below adopted this same reasoning,concluding that fag tact in limiting the evidence presented to judge stevens did not change the issue that was before him it was incumbent upon fag to present favorable evidence demonstrating the character of those releases brought them with in the policy coverage.liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,slip op.at.may,i ssues that are litigated are not necessarily with the evidence presented.we agree that at the time fag argued in lm i that there were multiple potential sources of tce contamination,it had the opportunity,but failed to produce any evidence to substantiate these allegations.accord in re kelly,the issue is not whether the party to the prior proceeding offered all of the evidence it proposed to offer,but whether the party had an opportunity to do so.citing buckley buckley.
liberty also notes that of the restatement is applicable only to cases involving different parties,and that the relevant provisions of the restatement define issue litigated broadly enough to preclude bringing forth in a later proceeding new evidence or new legal theories that might have been raised in the prior adjudication of the issue.we agree.see restatement second of judgments,cmts.c,e.comment c states that if the party against whom preclusion is sought did in fact litigate an issue of ultimate fact and suffered an adverse determination,new evidentiary facts may not be brought forward to obtain a different determination of that ultimate fact.id.cmt.c.the following illustration extrapolates on this view 
a brings an action against b to recover for personal injuries in an automobile accident.a seeks to establish that b was negligent in driving at an excessive rate of speed.after trial,verdict and judgment are given for b.in a subsequent action by b against a for injuries in the same accident,a is precluded from setting up b negligence as a defense,whether or not the alleged negligence is based on an assertion of excessive speed.it is reasonable to require a to bring forward all evidence in support of the alleged negligence in the initial proceeding.
id.illus.in order to decide the ultimate issue in lm i,the district court was required to determine first,how fag released tce,and second,whether that method of release was sudden and accidental.the lm i court concluded,and we agreed on appeal,that the only method of release supported by the undisputed evidence was the release via vapor emissions.under the analysis in the example above,any evidence or theories asserting a different factual basis for how the tce was released should have been presented in lm 
there is a significant line of cases suggesting that litigation of an issue necessaril
