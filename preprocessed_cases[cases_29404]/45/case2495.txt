in,the voters of california enacted an initiative measure designated on the ballot as proposition.proposition required approval of insurance rate increases by the insurance commissioner of the state of california commissioner,provided for consumer participation in the administrative process,and permitted the recovery of advocacy and witness fees and expenses together referred to as compensation under certain circumstances.this lawsuit involves the validity of the amendments to regulations permitting consumer interest interveners to obtain compensation for participation in the administrative process where an order or decision is issued by the commissioner on an insurer application without a formal rate hearing,where,for example,the matter was resolved by a settlement among the parties.
plaintiffs,the association of california insurance companies,the personal insurance federation of california,the american insurance association,and the pacific association of domestic insurance companies insurance companies,filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that because the amended regulations permit an award of compensation without a formal rate hearing,the regulations conflict with insurance code sections and.unspecified statutory references are to the insurance code.the trial court rendered a judgment upholding the validity of the regulations and denying the insurance companies petition and requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.the trial court also issued an order awarding compensation to intervener,the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights ftcr.insurance companies appealed from the judgment and the order awarding compensation.
as explained below,we affirm the judgment because the regulations are consistent with the governing statutes and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of those statutes.we also affirm the trial court award of compensation to ftcr because the trial court was authorized to award such compensation under section,subdivision b.

before proposition,ratemaking and rate regulation for various classes of insurance were governed by the insurance regulatory act of as amended mcbride act,set forth in chapter of the insurance code.economic empowerment foundation quackenbush th,d economic empowerment foundation.an administrative procedure to enforce the laws regulating insurance rates predated proposition and still exists.section,subdivision a states that any person aggrieved by a rate charged,rating plan,rating system,or underwriting rule may file a complaint with the commissioner and request a public hearing.the commissioner must review and investigate the matter and may conduct a public hearing,subd.c,subds.a b.if the commissioner finds that a violation has occurred,the commissioner must issue an order prohibiting the misconduct and may order other corrective action.any finding or determination by the commissioner under chapter is subject to judicial review under the independent judgment standard,including a decision not to conduct a hearing.any failure to comply with a final order by the commissioner gives rise to a monetary penalty,and the commissioner may bring an action in the superior court to enforce collection.the foregoing provisions all predated proposition.farmers ins.exchange superior court th,d farmers ins.
the laws regulating insurance rates before proposition were widely viewed as ineffective and public dissatisfaction with such laws was the primary impetus for proposition.farmers,supra,th at,d.the stated purpose of proposition was to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace,to provide for an accountable insurance commissioner,and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.stats.id.at,d.
accordingly,the uncodified findings and declaration of proposition stated that insurance reform is necessary.first,insurance rates shall be immediately rolled back to what they were on november,second,automobile insurance rates shall be determined primarily by a driver safety record and mileage driven.third,insurance rates shall be maintained at fair levels by requiring insurers to justify all future increases insurance companies shall pay a fee to cover the costs of administering these new laws so that this reform will cost taxpayers nothing.stats.farmers,supra,th at,d.
under proposition,an insurer which desires to change any rate shall file a complete rate application with the commissioner the applicant shall have the burden of proving that the requested rate change is justified and meets the requirements of this article article of chapter,subd.b.thus,after november,proposition institutes a permanent regulatory regime comprising the prior approval system,under which,in the words of insurance code section,subdivision a,the insurance commissioner must approve a rate applied for by an insurer before its use century ins.garamendi,supra,cal th at,d,century.the commissioner must notify the public of the insurer application for a rate change,subd.c.the application is deemed to be approved days after public notice unless a consumer or his or her representative requests a hearing within days of public notice and the commissioner grants the hearing,or determines not to grant the hearing and issues written findings in support of that decision,or the commissioner on his or her own motion determines to hold a hearing,or the proposed rate adjustment exceeds of the then applicable rate for personal lines or for commercial lines,in which case the commissioner must hold a hearing upon a timely request,subd.c.
the provisions of the insurance code enacted by proposition and which are key to this appeal are subdivisions a and b of section,which provide a any person may initiate or intervene in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to this chapter chapter,challenge any action of the commissioner under this article article,and enforce any provision of this article.b the commissioner or a court shall award reasonable advocacy and witness fees and expenses to any person who demonstrates that the person represents the interests of consumers,and,that he or she has made a substantial contribution to the adoption of any order,regulation or decision by the commissioner or a court.where such advocacy occurs in response to a rate application,the award shall be paid by the applicant.
as noted by the court in calfarm ins.deukmejian,supra,cal d,calfarm,proposition does not establish a detailed method of processing and deciding rate applications.it contains a few provisions relating to public notice and participation,subd.c,but hearings are generally held in accordance with provisions of the administrative procedure act.see,which provides generally that h earings shall be conducted pursuant to sections through of the government code.much is necessarily left to the insurance commissioner,who has broad discretion to adopt rules and regulations as necessary to promote the public welfare.citations.calfarm,at,see also century,supra,cal th at,d,proposition impliedly authorizes commissioner to formulate regulations adopted in proceedings.

c.the regulations 
in september,the commissioner issued a notice of proposed action and notice of public hearing to amend the regulations governing the prior approval process,including regulations governing consumer participation.the proposed regulations will modify those regulations contained in subchapter rules of practice and procedure for rate proceedings in order to clarify that consumers who participate in the approval process after having filed a petition for hearing may seek an award of reasonable advocacy fees.for example,former regulations and contain definitions.the department proposes to amend these definitions to clarify that a proceeding is established upon submission of a petition for a hearing by a consumer in addition,the department proposes to amend regulation a to expand the list of the types of documents that a consumer may use to prove that it has made a substantial contribution to the adoption of any order,regulation,or decision by the commissioner.cal.reg.notice register.
regulation,subdivision b permits an intervener or participant to show a substantial contribution with documents including but not limited to stipulations or settlement agreements regarding the outcome or material issues in the proceeding,and decision or order by the department or commissioner concerning a petition for hearing or rate or class plan application issued without a formal hearing.
a more detailed initial statement of reasons stated that the commissioner proposes to adopt and amend regulations to change the definitions related to proceedings and to establish an application withdrawal procedure following the filing of a petition for a hearing,so as to ensure that consumer representatives are eligible to seek compensation when they make a substantial contribution to any order,regulation,or decision by the commissioner prior to a formal hearing being granted or denied.the balance of the proposed amendments conform various provisions of existing regulations regarding compensation to intervenors in such proceedings to those changes.cal.of insurance,file no,initial statement of reasons.
the initial statement of reasons explained the necessity for the amendments it has been the department practice to encourage consumer representatives and applicants to resolve rate challenges informally so as to avoid engaging in lengthy formal hearings that benefit no one.often during negotiations,insurers seek to withdraw their rate applications.in some instances,applicants have withdrawn their applications after a petition for a hearing has been filed and after the petitioner has expended substantial time and effort advocating its position through its advocates and experts.in these instances,the result of the informal process has been either no rate change,or a substantial alteration in the rate ultimately approved by the commissioner.such results benefit the public without the necessity of conducting a formal hearing.in several of these instances,either the challenge was settled by the parties or the case was dismissed as moot when the applicant chose to withdraw rather than proceed with its application and potentially be subject to a hearing.after extensive and careful consideration,the commissioner determined that the petitioner made a substantial contribution to his decision concerning the rate applications even though no hearing was held.recently,several insurers have objected to the commissioner authority to award compensation to petitioners who make a substantial contribution in these circumstances a superior court recently ruled that the commissioner was not authorized to award a petitioner a fee award t he commissioner believes that the intervenor regulations should be amended to reflect the fact that once a petition for hearing has been filed,a proceeding has been established and that an insurer may not withdraw its rate application without approval of the commissioner.consumer representatives who make a substantial contribution to the outcome of that proceeding are entitled to compensation for their work,even if the proceeding concludes without a hearing.cal.of insurance,file no,initial statement of reasons,supra.
the superior court decision to which the commissioner referred was an october ruling in american healthcare indemnity company garamendi,no.american healthcare.in american healthcare,the trial court granted the insurers petition for a writ of mandate seeking to vacate the commissioner award of compensation to ftcr.there,ftcr had filed petitions for a hearing and for intervention but the insurers withdrew their rate applications before any hearing on their applications,and no hearing was granted.the trial court determined that because ftcr petition to intervene was not granted,ftcr was not a party to the proceeding and there was no,and could not be,a substantial contribution made by ftcr,and the commissioner therefore abused his discretion in awarding compensation to ftcr.
it was the commissioner view that section,subdivision b plainly mandates that any person who represents the interests of consumers and who made a substantial contribution to the adoption of any order,regulation,or decision by the commissioner is entitled to an award of compensation for reasonable advocacy fees and expenses.an insurer attempt to withdraw its application in order to avoid paying compensation defeats the purpose of the statutes in summary,the commissioner believes that,as the voters intended,the scrutiny of consumer representatives is an important tool to ensure that applicants comply with the statutory and regulatory prohibition on excessive,inadequate,and unfairly discriminatory rates,or rates that otherwise violate the law,and that if consumer representatives are denied the ability to seek compensation when they make a substantial contribution in proceedings,such scrutiny would be discouraged and curtailed.such a result contravenes the public policy underlying section and analogous intervenor compensation statutes of encouraging consumer participation in administrative and court proceedings,and thereby aiding regulators and courts in their decisions.citations.cal.of insurance,file no,initial statement of reasons,supra.
both insurance companies and ftcr submitted written comments concerning the proposed amendments to the regulations.on november,ftcr petitioned the commissioner to participate in the rulemaking proceeding for the purpose of representing the interests of consumers.ftcr estimated advocacy fees and expenses of participation in the rulemaking proceeding were.on december,the commissioner granted ftcr petition and found that ftcr was eligible to seek compensation in department proceedings for a term of two years,beginning july.
on november,the department held a public hearing on the proposed amendments to the regulations regarding compensation to interveners.a representative of insurance companies spoke in opposition to the proposed amendments,and a representative of ftcr spoke in favor of them.
on november,the commissioner submitted the amendments and the record of the rulemaking proceeding to the office of administrative law,which approved the amendments and filed them with the secretary of state.the amendments became effective on january.the commissioner originally submitted the adoption of a new regulation proposed regulation to the office of administrative law that would have precluded an insurer from withdrawing a rate or class plan application after a petition for hearing had been filed unless the commissioner approved of the withdrawal of the application.before january,the commissioner withdrew this proposed regulation and it never became effective.cal.reg.notice register.

ftcr filed a motion for an award of compensation for reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred in the superior court action,pursuant to section,subdivision b.insurance companies opposed the motion on several grounds,arguing,among other things,that such fees were not permitted under section because the action was not one permitted or established under chapter of the insurance code and all of the work done by ftcr was duplicative of the work by poizner and the department.after a hearing,the court awarded ftcr pursuant to section,subdivision b.insurance companies appealed from the order.
discussiona.governing law and standard of review 
government code section provides the general standard of review for determining the validity of administrative regulations.that section states that w henever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement,interpret,make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute,no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.communities for a better environment california resources agency th,d,fn.omitted communities.
insurance companies do not challenge the trial court finding that they failed to demonstrate that the amended regulations are not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of proposition.accordingly,on this appeal we need not address the reasonable necessity requirement,but only the consistency requirement of the standard set out in government code section.
the standard of consistency in government code section means being in harmony with,and not in conflict with or contradictory to,existing statutes,court decisions,or other provisions of law,subd.d.
with respect to the consistency requirement,the judiciary independently reviews the administrative regulation for consistency with controlling law.the question is whether the regulation alters or amends the governing statute or case law,or enlarges or impairs its scope.in short,the question is whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred if it is not,it is void.this is a question particularly suited for the judiciary as the final arbiter of the law,and does not invade the technical expertise of the agency.communities,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.by contrast,the second prong of this standard,reasonable necessity,generally does implicate the agency expertise id.at,d yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.
proposition,in section,requires that j udicial review shall be in accordance with section.section states in pertinent part any finding,determination,rule,ruling or order made by the commissioner under this chapter shall be subject to review by the courts of the state and proceedings on review shall be in accordance with the provisions of the code of civil procedure.in such proceedings on review,the court is authorized and directed to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and unless the weight of the evidence supports the findings,determination,rule,ruling or order of the commissioner,the same shall be annulled.
the independent judgment standard requires the trial court to accord a strong presumption of correctness to the commissioner findings,and the burden of proof rests on the party challenging those findings,but ultimately the trial court is free to reweigh the evidence and substitute its own findings.citation.on appeal,we apply the substantial evidence test to the trial court factual findings,but review legal determinations independently.state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush th,d.
in deciding whether the regulation conflicts with its legislative mandate,the court does not defer to the agency interpretation of the law under which the regulation issued,but rather exercises its own independent judgment.see murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,fn,d,w hile the agency construction of a statute is entitled to consideration and respect,it is not binding and it is ultimately for the judiciary to interpret this statute yamaha,supra,cal th at,fn,d,t he court,not the agency,has final responsibility for the interpretation of the law under which the regulation was issued see also california of psychology providers rank cal d,a dministrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may,but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.aguiar superior court th,d.courts must,in short,independently judge the text of the statute,taking into account and respecting the agency interpretation of its meaning,of course,whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.yamaha,supra,cal th at,d.

analysis of consistency requirement 
insurance companies contend that the amendments to the intervener regulations are invalid because the amendments conflict with and enlarge the scope of sections and.insurance companies maintain that the foregoing statutes allow consumers to obtain compensation in connection with public hearings on rate applications,and not in connection with other parts of the administrative process where no public rate hearing is ordered by the commissioner.insurance companies reasoning can be summarized as follows an informal prehearing proceeding involving a rate application is not a proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter of part of division of the insurance code that is,sections through,and there is no right to intervene in that prehearing proceeding and thus no right to compensation.
the logical corollary of insurance companies argument,as acknowledged in their opening brief,is the assertion that proposition does not afford or contemplate consumer participation in every aspect of the administrative process,but only in the public rate hearing.
as explained below,we conclude that the amended regulations allow compensation for participation in the process beginning with the submission of a petition for a hearing or the commissioner notice of a rate hearing,even if there is no public rate hearing.we further determine that the amended regulations are consistent with proposition and valid.
the only provision in proposition addressing the issue of compensation advocacy and witness fees and expenses is in subdivision b of section.see ante,pp.subdivision b sets out two requirements for an award of compensation representation of consumer interests and substantial contribution to the adoption of an order,regulation,or decision by the commissioner or a court.subdivision a of section deals with entirely different issues,including the initiation of,or intervention in,certain proceedings.the structure and language of section indicates that the issues of intervention in subdivision a and compensation in subdivision b are separate and independent.accordingly,the only statutory requirements for compensation are set out in subdivision b of section.the regulations,however,limit compensation to petitioners,intervenors,and participants in proceedings reg.see also regs,subd.a.subdivision b does not expressly or by implication require that the order,regulation,or decision of the commissioner be adopted only after a public hearing,or only after any specific procedure.
an administrative agency is not limited to the exact provisions of a statute in adopting regulations to enforce its mandate.t he absence of any specific statutory provisions regarding the regulation of an issue does not mean that such a regulation exceeds statutory authority citations.ford dealers department of motor vehicles cal d.the agency is authorized to fill up the details of the statutory scheme.mineral associations coalition state mining geology bd.th,d.the absence of any specific provisions regarding the proceedings in which compensation is authorized does not mean that regulations as to such issues exceed statutory authority,but only that the electorate did not itself choose to determine the issue and instead deferred to and relied upon the expertise of the commissioner and the department.see credit ins.agents payne cal d,credit ins.courts have long recognized that the legislature may elect to defer to and rely upon the expertise of administrative agencies.
according to insurance companies,the amended regulations exceed statutory authority because consideration of section,subdivision b in conjunction with other provisions of proposition and chapter reveals that the statutes limit compensation only to rate hearings.we disagree.
the first two provisions of proposition that insurance companies attempt to read together are subdivisions a and b of section.insurance companies maintain that subdivision a of section limits and qualifies subdivision b so as to permit compensation only in conjunction with a rate hearing because only a rate hearing is a proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter within the meaning of subdivision a.
as stated,we disagree with the assertion that subdivision a limits or qualifies the two requirements for compensation set out in subdivision b of section.but assuming for purposes of argument that subdivision a adds a third statutory requirement for an award of is,that compensation must be for initiation of or intervention in any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter conclude that a rate proceeding is a proceeding permitted by chapter.
proposition specifically refers to only several parts of the administrative rate review process section,subdivision b provides that an insurer which desires to change any rate shall file a rate application with the commissioner section,subdivision c addresses the issue of when an application is deemed to be approved and refers to rate change application hearings section deals with the law governing hearings,the commissioner adoption of a decision,and discovery section addresses the issue of judicial review and section,subdivision a refers to consumer intervention.the foregoing procedures can be considered as established by proposition.
but not all details of the administrative rate review process are established by the statutes.as noted in calfarm,supra,cal d at page,proposition does not provide a detailed method of processing and deciding rate change applications.many procedures and details were necessarily left to regulations and rules to be promulgated by the commissioner.in point,subdivision a of section refers broadly to any proceeding permitted or established pursuant to chapter.italics added.
proposition contemplates or permits public participation and intervention in the rate review process.proceedings arising out of an insurer rate change application,and which entail public participation and intervention in the rate review process,are procedures permitted and established by chapter.the rate proceeding commences with the submission of a petition for a hearing or with a notice of a hearing.reg,subd.h.the rate proceeding thus constitutes a proceeding permitted pursuant to chapter and falls within the ambit of section,subdivision a.consequently,the amended regulations pertaining to rate proceedings are consistent with the latter statutory provision.
citing language in farmers,supra,th,d,insurance companies maintain that the only proceeding to review an application for a rate increase permitted by chapter is the public rate hearing because only a rate hearing and not a rate proceeding is specifically addressed in chapter in sections and.farmers ins.provides no support for insurance companies.farmers ins.held that section,subdivision a did not create a private right of action for insureds wishing to sue insurers for violation of the good driver discount provisions of section.farmers,supra,th at,d.farmers ins.did not deal with any issues pertaining to the regulations or compensation under subdivision b of section.
without citation to any authority,insurance companies characterize a rate proceeding as not an administrative proceeding,but simply a label for the commissioner internal nonpublic review of a rate application before any hearing has been ordered.contrary to insurance companies claim,the rate proceeding as defined in regulation,subdivision h commences with the submission of a petition for hearing or with a notice of hearing.the petition and notice are pleadings reg,subd.g and part of the public record reg.although regulation,subdivision h specifies the beginning but not the end of the rate proceeding,the regulatory scheme contemplates that the rate proceeding culminates in an order or decision by the commissioner on the insurer rate application.the rate proceeding is thus part of the public process.
also part of the process is the rate hearing.reg,subd.i.a rate hearing may in some cases constitute a part of the rate proceeding,but a rate hearing is not necessary in all instances for the adoption of an order or decision by the commissioner.for example,regulations not challenged by insurance companies specifically address the issue of stipulations and settlements.an administrative law judge may accept a stipulation or settlement if the agreement is in the public interest and is fair,adequate,and reasonable.see reg,subd.a.regulation,subdivision a provides parties may stipulate to the resolution of an issue of fact or the applicability of a provision of law material to a proceeding,or may agree to settlement on a mutually acceptable outcome to a proceeding,with or without resolving material issues.stipulations and settlements must be filed with the administrative law judge for proposed acceptance or rejection.when a stipulation or settlement is filed with the administrative law judge,it shall also be served on all parties.if a stipulation dispositive of the case or a settlement is proposed prior to the taking of any testimony,the parties supporting the stipulation or settlement shall file and serve supporting declarations indicating the reasons that the settlement or stipulation is fundamentally fair,adequate,reasonable and in the interests of justice.reg,subd.c.
the administrative law judge must reject a proposed stipulation or settlement whenever the stipulation or settlement is not in the public interest and is not,taken as a whole,fundamentally fair,adequate,and reasonable.reg,subd.a.the terms of a stipulation or settlement adopted by the administrative law judge shall be included in any proposed decision provided to the commissioner.reg,subd.b.
the regulations thus permit the commissioner to adopt an order or decision on a rate change application based on an approved settlement and without holding a formal rate hearing.accordingly,an intervener in such a proceeding is entitled to seek compensation under the amended regulations.the amended regulations fill in the details not specifically addressed by proposition but nevertheless fall within the scope of statutory authority.
other provisions which insurance companies claim support their proposition that awards of compensation are limited to expenses incurred in rate hearings are sections,subdivision c see ante,fn.and their argument is as follows section,subdivision c permits a rate application to be deemed approved under certain circumstances unless a consumer requests and is granted a hearing,the commissioner determines to hold a hearing,or the proposed rate adjustment exceeds specified amounts,in which case the commissioner must hold a hearing upon timely request.insurance companies reason the foregoing language indicates that the only way to disapprove a rate application is by way of a public rate hearing conducted pursuant to section,which is required for the adoption of any order,regulation or decision by the commissioner,subd.b.insurance companies conclude that the statutory scheme does not contemplate that the commissioner will entertain evidence or arguments against a rate application except in a public hearing,that unless and until the commissioner orders a hearing,the only statutory role for a consumer in response to a rate application is to petition for a hearing,and that until the commissioner orders a hearing on a rate application,there is no proceeding in which to intervene.if there is no proceeding in which to intervene,there is no forum in which to incur advocacy and witness fees and expenses under section,subdivision b.
the fallacy in insurance companies argument is that section,subdivision c sets out the circumstances under which a rate change application may be deemed to be approved without a rate hearing.it does not address the proceedings that may occur after the commissioner determines to hold a hearing or after an intervener submits a petition to intervene or a petition for a hearing.section does not address the issue of the resolution of a rate change application by way of a stipulation or settlement.an
