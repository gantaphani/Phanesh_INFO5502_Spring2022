timothy moore bought an unoccupied duplex located in a flood plain from walsh county,north dakota,on condition that it be moved by a date certain,and american family insurance company insured the property for.after a fire destroyed the building about five weeks before the deadline for moving it had expired,american family denied moore insurance claim on the ground that the fire was a result of arson for which moore was responsible.moore and his wife,sylvia moore,then brought suit against american family,claiming that it had breached the insurance contract and had acted in bad faith when it denied moore claim.a jury found for the moores on both claims it awarded them on their contract claim,and in actual damages and in punitive damages on their bad faith claim.the district court then denied american family motion for judgment as a matter of law jaml,a new trial,or remittitur.
american family now appeals,arguing that it was not liable for bad faith as a matter of law,that the evidence did not support awards for actual damages on the bad faith claim or for punitive damages,that the district court erred by not declaring a mistrial for juror misconduct,and that the district court improperly instructed the jury.we affirm.
a district court must grant a motion for jaml when a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient basis to find for a party on that issue.a.the moores,at the end of their case on the breach of contract claim,moved for jaml on the matter of whether american family had breached the insurance contract,and the district court denied the motion.american family maintains that this ruling is fatal to the moores claim of bad faith north dakota law provides that an insurance company is not guilty of bad faith when it denies a claim that is fairly debatable.see hartman estate of miller.according to american family,because the district court held that there was a fact question about whether the insurer had breached the contract by refusing to pay moore claim,that claim was necessarily fairly debatable,and thus american family could not have acted in bad faith by denying it.we conclude,however,that american family failed to preserve for review the contention that it was entitled to jaml on the claim.
american family originally raised this issue and two other matters in an oral motion for jaml after the plaintiffs submitted their case.the district court denied the motion,and the insurer orally renewed it at the close of the evidence.see.a.after the jury returned a verdict for the moores,american family filed a motion under rule b.the motion stated,in part,that the defendant was renew ing the motions for jaml that it made,raised and asserted during the trial of this action but did not specify the grounds for granting jaml.in compliance with the court rule requiring that all motions be accompanied by a supporting memorandum,see civ,american family filed a memorandum that listed over twenty grounds for relief,including one of the grounds raised in its original rule a motion.but nothing in the supporting memorandum indicated that american family was renewing its request for judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith claim.
in its written motion denying the motion,the district court specifically addressed,in turn,each ground that american family raised in its lengthy memorandum,but the court did not rule on whether the evidence supported the bad faith claim,most likely because it did not think that it was being asked to.federal rule of civil procedure b requires that all motions state with particularity the grounds for seeking an order,and we think therefore that american family did not effectively make a rule b motion on this ground.where a party fails to make a rule b motion in the district court regarding an issue,there is nothing for the court of appeals to review,and we thus lack the power to review the matter.see southwestern bell,cir.
we note,moreover,that local rule further provides that a moving party failure to serve and file a memorandum in support may be deemed an admission that the motion is without merit.civ.similarly,we generally deem an issue waived if an appellant brief does not include an argument addressing that issue,and we have explained that this rule promotes proper judicial administration.see,jenkins winter,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also fed.a.as we have already said,american family did not even assert in its memorandum that it was entitled to jaml on the claim,much less provide an argument supporting that assertion.we therefore do not believe that the district court,even if it had the discretion to do so,was obligated to treat the issue as having been raised,and we therefore do not see how the court could have erred by not entering judgment for american family on the moores bad faith claim.
american family also maintains that the district court erred by giving instruction,which told the jury that it could consider as evidence of bad faith the insurer violations of the north dakota prohibited practices in insurance business act,see.we review jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.see gill maciejewski,cir.our review is limited to a determination of whether the instructions,taken as a whole and viewed in the light of the evidence and applicable law,fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.instruction read in pertinent part if american family,who is engaged in the business of insurance,performed,without just cause and with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice,one or more of the following unfair practices,you may consider violation of this law as evidence of bad faith on the part of american family.the instruction then went on to rehearse several of the unfair claim settlement practices listed in,the relevant north dakota statute.
for the first time on appeal,american family challenges instruction on legal grounds,contending that an insurer violation of is not evidence of bad faith.we conclude that american family waived this objection by failing to raise it during the instruction conference before the case was submitted to the jury.see.niemiec union pacific rr,cir.parties must make a timely objection to jury instructions,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection,in order to give the district court an opportunity to correct errors before submission,and,relatedly,to prevent a losing party from obtaining a new trial by pointing out an error only after receiving an unfavorable verdict.see.c horstmyer black decker,cir.because american family did not do so,it waived its legal objection to the instruction,absent plain error.
though we may grant plain error relief when instructional error is plain,affects a party substantial rights,and seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings,cedar hill hardware and const.supply,insurance of hannover,cir quoting united states olano,d,these circumstances are absent here.at a minimum,we believe that evidence that an insurer conduct violates a statute prohibiting unfair settlement practices is relevant to whether the insurer acted in bad faith.as one commentator has remarked,there is some logic to using evidence of violations of statutes addressing unfair insurance practices in bad faith actions,just as evidence of violations of safety codes have been used to show negligence.see lee russ thomas segalla,couch on ins.ed.and american family,consistent with this view,raised no objection when the moores attorney elicited expert testimony that a violation of was evidence of an insurance company bad faith and that american family had violated particular provisions of that statute.american family later asked its own expert whether american family had violated the act.we therefore do not believe that the error,if any,was plain.
american family also maintains that even if the instruction correctly stated the law,the court erred in giving it because the evidence,at best,supported a finding that the insurer committed the unfair claim settlement practices listed in the instruction only as to the
