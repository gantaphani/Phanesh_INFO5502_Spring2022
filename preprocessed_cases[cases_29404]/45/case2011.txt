background 
in august,marla sewell contacted insurance brokerage acquire insurance coverage for her family,including her husband,christopher sewell,and their only child,brooke sewell.sewell spoke with virginia nied and requested quotations for a homeowner policy,a policy,and an umbrella policy for extra protection.sewell did not specifically request any information pertaining to coverage.nor did she understand that an umbrella policy could consist of two components,liability coverage and coverage.pli then sent quotations to sewell in september that contained a number of quotations for automobile coverage,including two different amounts of coverage or per person per accident.sewell eventually selected a policy with of minimum available to be eligible for umbrella coverage.
in november,another pli employee,mary laheist,sent an umbrella application and policy to sewell,including a letter from pli stating that sewell should review the policy before signing it and returning it.the effective date of the policy was november.the umbrella policy,which was completed by pli before it was sent to sewell,indicated that there was million in liability coverage and,under the optional coverages to apply section,there were lines for coverage which were left blank.in addition,the coverage summary stated that whenever covered vehicles were shown,the type of coverage would be indicated and when there was no indication,there was no coverage.next to the vehicles listed in the summary,excess liability only appeared.sewell read the materials,signed the policy,and returned it without making any changes.no one at pli ever discussed coverage with her and she never asked.sewell renewed the policy in,and.sewell was the only member of her family to speak with any representative of pli.
in late,sewell contacted laheist after receiving a letter from pli indicating that her personal injury protection pip coverage would be eliminated from her policy due to the fact that colorado had eliminated its automobile liability law.laheist told sewell that she believed sewell did not have to increase any of her coverages.after sewell asked whether her umbrella coverage would kick in,laheist said yes.at.sewell never specifically mentioned coverage or requested any review of her coverage other than with respect to pip.id.she simply was hoping laheist would bring up any particular needs that she needed met.id.
on december,sewell was hit in his automobile,as he waited for a stoplight to change,by an escaping felon during a police chase.sewell died of his injuries.sewell then filed a claim for excess benefits under the umbrella policy with great northern but was denied because she never purchased excess coverage.sewell then filed this action on behalf of herself and her minor daughter asserting breach of negligent misrepresentation breach of fiduciary duty breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and deceptive trade practices.after a motion by pli,the district court granted summary judgment for pli on all claims.sewell,wl,at.
the district court held there was no breach of contract because the sewells received precisely what they requested an umbrella policy with no excess coverage.id.at.pli had no special relationship with the sewells requiring it to affirmatively advise or warn the sewells concerning their coverage,the district court reasoned,and reformation of the contract would be inappropriate given sewell unilateral mistake in assuming she had coverage.id.at.in addition,pli made no negligent misrepresentations because no false information was conveyed by pli to sewell.id.at.pli did not breach any fiduciary duty because pli only had an ordinary relationship with the sewells,and pli did not breach any duty of good faith and fair dealing because the sewells have no private cause of action under.and no action under.because it only applies to insurers,not brokers like pli.id.at.finally,the district court held that the sewells could not prove any deceptive trade practices by pli because they had not demonstrated that any allegedly deceptive practice affected the public.id.at.the district court entered its judgment on may.the sewells now appeal that decision.
discussion 
we review the entry of summary judgment de novo.natural gas nash oil gas,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we view the evidence and make all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.natural gas,at.
this case originated in diversity,and therefore we,just as the district court,apply the substantive law of the forum state colorado.see erie tompkins.
the sewells first argue that they are entitled to a trial on the issue of whether pli should have advised sewell about excess coverage aplt.br.at.they also argue that sewell did not make a unilateral mistake because pli never advised her,an unskilled,uninformed layperson,about excess coverage.id.at.pli again breached the contract,the sewells contend,when colorado repealed its automobile liability law and they lost coverage that laheist never addressed in sewell conversation with her.id.at.
in order to prove a breach of contract,the sewells must prove the existence of a contract performance by the plaintiff or some justification for nonperformance failure to perform the contract by the defendant and resulting damages to the plaintiff.distrib.diodosio.
colorado follows the general rule that insurance agents have a duty to act with reasonable care toward their insureds,but,absent a special relationship between the insured and the insurer agent,that agent has no affirmative duty to advise or warn his or her customer of provisions contained in an insurance policy whether a special relationship has been formed turns on whether there is entrustment,that is,whether the agent or broker assumes additional responsibilities beyond those which attach to an ordinary,reasonable agent possessing normal competencies and skills.

we agree with the district court that the sewells presented nothing during the summary judgment proceedings to suggest that pli had anything more than a normal relationship with them.see sewell,wl at.regardless of sewell expectation of what pli was to do for her or what she sought from it,there is nothing in the record to suggest that there was any entrustment.kaercher,at.the representations on pli website to which the sewells direct us,including the financial wherewithal of the insurer,the need to understand and analyze the insured,the importance of proper amounts of insurance for adequate risk management,and the availability of coverage,are really no different than an agent holding himself out as knowledgeable about insurance and attentive to the needs of individual insureds which,as a matter of colorado law,are insufficient to create any legally meaningful level of entrustment.see aplt.br.at citing.nothing suggests that sewell paid more for a detailed needs analysis or for personal services.see kaercher,at.in short,pli assumed no responsibilities beyond those which attach to an ordinary,reasonable agent possessing normal competen
