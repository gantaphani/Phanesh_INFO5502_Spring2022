in this ordinary breach of contract action by plaintiff liberty mutual fire insurance company liberty to recover workers compensation insurance premiums,defendant lcl administrators,lcl filed an answer and alleging that liberty mishandled its claims.
liberty propounded simple,straightforward interrogatories,asking for witnesses,documents and evidence to support lcl affirmative defenses and.each time,lcl gave vacuous,meaningless responses.frustrated with lcl continued stonewalling,the trial court granted liberty motion for terminating sanctions,striking both the answer and the.
lcl appeals from the resulting judgments,claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in granting terminating sanctions because the court finding that lcl willfully failed to comply with discovery was not supported by substantial evidence even if the discovery violations were willful,terminating sanctions were unwarranted because these derelictions did not prejudice liberty ability to try the case and the sanctions were excessive because they were punitive in nature and addressed past conduct that had already been sanctioned.we shall affirm the judgments.
factual and procedural background 
i.the pleadings 
on august,liberty filed a complaint for breach of insurance contracts and common counts,seeking to recover premiums due on a series of workers compensation insurance policies issued to lcl by liberty or its predecessor in interest,employers insurance of wausau,a mutual company.the complaint alleged that the policies issued to lcl contained a variable dividend and retrospective rating plan based on the number of claims experienced.depending on the level of loss,lcl would either be entitled to a refund or obligated to pay an increase in the base premium.according to the complaint,lcl loss history on these policies generated additional premiums due in the amount of.

ii.discovery history 
motion to strike the answer 
on october,liberty served its first set of interrogatories.form interrogatory requested that lcl state all facts on which it based its denial and affirmative defenses in the answer.it further asked lcl to identify all persons who had knowledge of these facts,and to specify all documents that supported lcl denial and affirmative defenses.
first response.
lcl asked for and was granted two extensions of time to respond to liberty interrogatories.on january,all further unspecified references are to that calendar year,lcl finally served responses.form interrogatory was answered in the following manner 
the statutory denials are based upon the authorization of the code of civil procedure,and a belief that the contracts of insurance were improperly implemented and interpreted by plaintiff liberty as liberty provides responses to discovery,lcl will be able to detail the specific areas of breach.
on february,after its meet and confer letter was ignored,liberty filed a motion to compel answers to interrogatories and for imposition of monetary sanctions.the motion was granted.finding the response to form interrogatory inadequate and evasive,the trial court ordered lcl to provide a supplemental response on or before april and imposed monetary sanctions.lcl requested and received an extension of time to serve these supplemental responses until april.
supplemental response.
on april,lcl served its supplemental response to form interrogatory.as to the basis for lcl denial,the response again recites 
the statutory denials are based upon the authorization of the code of civil procedure,subd.d,and a belief that the contracts of insurance were improperly implemented and interpreted by plaintiff liberty as liberty provides responses to discovery,lcl will be able to detail the specific areas of breach.
for each of the affirmative defenses,lcl gave substantially similar responses the defense was based o n information and belief,to be developed during discovery the witnesses are actually known to liberty and subject to being developed in discovery by lcl and are the liberty employees and agents who sold,administered,and implemented the policies referred to in the complaint and the supporting documents consist of time records of the liberty employees who worked on the claims,as well as the writings received,reviewed,drafted and compiled by these same employees and agents.
on april and may,liberty sent meet and confer letters,advising lcl that the supplemental responses were inadequate and did not constitute complete and straightforward response s as required by code of civil procedure section,subdivision f.the letters also warned that liberty was prepared to proceed with a further motion to compel and to seek issue and monetary sanctions.
second supplemental response.
on june,liberty filed a motion for issue and monetary sanctions.on july,the court denied the request for issue sanctions,granted the request for monetary sanctions and gave lcl a final opportunity to provide straightforward answers,stating that w hile the court concurs that the answers given are evasive and incomplete,it also finds,in the exercise of its discretion,that an issue sanction is appropriate only after other options have been exhausted.the ruling continued the court will require a further verified supplemental response to form i nterrogatory no,containing substantive information as to its general denial and affirmative defenses.if the further supplemental answers remain devoid of substantive information and continue to be unverified,the court will entertain a motion to strike the affirmative defenses at a later date.
on august,lcl served its second supplemental response to form interrogatory.the response referred to a belief that the contracts of insurance were improperly implemented and interpreted by liberty,and gave the policy number of every insurance policy at issue.to answer further,lcl asserted,would require it to make a compilation or summary of information contained in liberty writings regarding the workers compensation claims and no such compilation currently exists,in part because liberty has delayed and failed to produce requested documents,and has not yet produced all the writings in its possession regarding the claims referred to.lcl named witnesses with knowledge of these facts,none of whom were associated with lcl,but rather were employees of liberty or hospital and medical providers.the response to the request for identification of documents stated that the documents were in the possession of liberty and contained an offer to make available for further review previously produced documents so that liberty could make its own compilation or summary.
on september,liberty wrote a final meet and confer letter,warning that a motion to strike lcl answer would follow if meaningful responses were not delivered.lcl requested that liberty withhold making a motion,promising to provide a third supplemental response by september,but it never did so.
motion to strike answer.
on september,liberty brought its third motion,this time asking for issue terminating sanctions.although a hearing on the motion was originally set for november,it was postponed until february,allowing lcl additional time to review liberty case files.
lcl opposed the motion with declarations from two experts who had examined liberty files.eleanor good,lcl controller,who was previously identified in discovery as its person most knowledgeable,stated that since lcl original discovery responses,she discovered that liberty was upcharging lcl by rounding actual expenses up to the next highest dollar when the claim is closed,instead of to the nearest dollar.
robert drake identified himself as a workers compensation consultant and expert witness.he declared that he had begun review of documents produced by liberty in december.drake said it was shocking to learn that liberty did not have a written policy and procedure manual.based on a recent partial review of liberty case files,he opined that liberty breached the standards of workers compensation claims handling by failing to have certain office safeguards in place during the handling of claims.the declaration concludes i have formed the preliminary opinion that economic damages have certainly been suffered by lcl administrators,and the amount will be determined when the remaining unproduced documents are available and the evaluation is completed.
the trial court granted liberty motion for terminating sanctions.after documenting the history of lcl noncompliance with discovery,the court ruled that lcl had abused the discovery process by repeatedly providing evasive and incomplete responses and by ignoring liberty meet and confer letter requesting a third supplemental response.the court also rejected lcl claim that liberty,not lcl,had the information and documents necessary to provide the responses,noting that a fter months of litigation,lcl should have some factual basis for its affirmative defenses and its general denial.the court ordered the answer stricken and awarded liberty monetary sanctions against lcl and its counsel.
once the answer was stricken,liberty obtained a default judgment for in unpaid premiums,plus interest and costs.
motion to strike the 
the events leading up to the court order to strike lcl followed a similar path as the motion to strike the answer.in february,liberty propounded special interrogatories,set no.two hereafter special interrogatories seeking to discover the factual basis and supporting documents for lcl allegation that it suffered losses as the result of liberty improper handling of workers compensation files.
lcl initially failed to serve any response to the special interrogatories,despite receiving an extension of time until april.thus,on april,liberty filed a motion to compel responses.
on may,prior to the hearing on the motion,lcl served a response declaring that liberty had not allowed lcl to inspect the documents that would support its allegations.due to this alleged lack of ability to inspect documents,lcl claimed that it was unable specifically to identify entries that it considered improper or unfair.lcl also stated that bad faith damages had not been calculated,and that a s investigation progresses,lcl will be able to identify the scope,type,nature and character of damages that it has suffered,including bad faith damages.
on july,the trial court granted liberty motion and ordered responses served,without objections by july.lcl again failed to serve responses.consequently,on july,liberty brought a second motion to compel,to which lcl filed a statement of.on august,the trial court granted the motion and ordered lcl to serve responses by september.
on september,lcl served further responses to the special interrogatories.lcl again claimed it had been restricted in its capacity to identify documents supporting its claims and that liberty had not allowed lcl to inspect liberty accounting records,ledgers,correspondence files,books,and other writings relating to the subject insurance policies that the documents,records,ledgers,correspondence and numbers in possession of liberty would disclose a systematic and unfair practice of overcharging of costs and expenses that lcl bad faith damages have not currently been calculated or quantified and that it was not in a position to state how damages were calculated.
on october,liberty sent out a final meet and confer letter asserting that the further responses were evasive and incomplete and stating its intention to move forward with a motion to strike the.
on october,liberty filed a motion to strike the on grounds that lcl had abused the discovery process by its failure to provide complete and straightforward responses as ordered by the court.
on february,the motion to strike the was heard jointly with the motion to strike the answer,and lcl opposed both motions with the declarations of good and drake,which we have previously summarized.
on february,the trial court granted the motion and struck lcl.the court ruled that lcl supplemental responses were devoid of any substantive information and are evasive and incomplete as the responses fail to identify any witnesses,documents or facts supporting the amount of alleged contract damages and alleged bad faith damages that lcl is claiming against liberty in the.the court also observed that w hen lcl person most knowledgeable was deposed,she had no information on damages or on lcl contention that its claims were not fairly and adequately handled.
noting that lcl not only repeatedly gave deficient responses but also failed to meet and confer,the court ruled that lcl conduct constituted a flagrant abuse of the discovery process,warranting terminating sanctions.
motions for reconsideration and motion for new trial 
subsequently,lcl filed motions for reconsideration of the trial court orders striking the answer and.finding no legal basis to reconsider its orders,the court denied both motions.
lcl then filed a motion for new trial,which was similar in many respects to the motions for reconsideration.finding lcl arguments no more convincing now than they were before,the trial court denied the motion for new trial

ii.trial court finding of willfulness 
lcl first contends that the trial court finding that it willfully violated discovery orders was not supported by substantial evidence in the record.lcl reasons that the finding of willfulness was predicated on a finding that it was being evasive,a finding that lacked supporting evidence because lcl gave liberty all the evidence which it possessed and did not conceal anything.we disagree.
lcl averment that its final responses we
