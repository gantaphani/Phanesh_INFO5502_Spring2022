a series of individuals hereafter plaintiffs sued calsol,calsol,an insured of defendant golden eagle insurance corporation golden eagle,in separate but similar personal injury lawsuits.although calsol was in bankruptcy,the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs limited relief from the automatic stay,allowing them to pursue claims against calsol on the condition any judgment could be enforced only against calsol insurers,not against calsol itself.
golden eagle was itself in conservatorship.as part of its plan of rehabilitation,golden eagle had adopted a procedure for administering claims made under the insurance policies it had issued,and it notified the plaintiffs it would require them to pursue their covered claims against golden eagle in the conservatorship proceeding.when the plaintiffs failed to submit timely claims,the insurance commissioner declared their claims denied and refused demands by calsol other insurers to contribute toward the defense of the plaintiffs lawsuits the insurers filed an unsuccessful application for an order to show cause osc in the superior court challenging the commissioner refusal to share costs of defense.we affirm the trial court denial of the order to show cause.
background 
the plaintiffs sued calsol and other defendants in nine separate lawsuits,each alleging harm from exposure to safety kleen solvent hereafter safety kleen,a product used in connection with mechanical repairs safety kleen consisted largely of mineral spirits,a complex chemical mixture containing benzene.calsol,which had since fallen into bankruptcy,supplied mineral spirits to the manufacturer of safety kleen between and.the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiffs relief from the automatic stay to pursue their claims against calsol,but the terms of the relief order allowed them to enforce a final judgment only by c ollecting upon any available insurance in accordance with applicable law.
during a portion of the time calsol supplied mineral spirits for use in safety kleen,it was covered by comprehensive general liability insurance policies issued by golden eagle that ran noncontinuously from may through february.appellants,the claimants in this matter claimants,are other insurers that issued general liability insurance policies to calsol from through judged solely by the duration of coverage,golden eagle had by far the greatest exposure to the plaintiffs claims its period of coverage was more than double that of the insurer.
golden eagle was placed in conservatorship in.see generally garamendi golden eagle ins.th,d garamendi golden eagle low golden eagle ins,supra,th,d.as provided in the insurance code,the commissioner established an administrative procedure to handle claims against the assets of golden eagle.garamendi golden eagle,at,d.pursuant to this procedure,counsel representing the commissioner sent a letter to the plaintiffs counsel,informing counsel that a company in liquidation,like golden eagle,is entitled to adjust claims of claimants,and in conjunction with that adjustment process,is also entitled to require sworn statements from potential claimants golden eagle has elected to pursue your client claim in that fashion.the letter enclosed a form referred to in the letter as a sworn statement proof of loss sspl and requested each plaintiff complete an sspl and return it to the commissioner within days.two and a half months later,a second letter was sent stating that although the commissioner had granted extensions of time to the plaintiffs to return the sspl,none had been returned.accordingly,the letter stated,the plaintiffs claims were denied.
this approach represented a change of strategy by the commissioner with respect to the handling of similar claims against calsol.notwithstanding the conservatorship proceedings,the commissioner had litigated jointly with the claimants an earlier series of safety kleen lawsuits filed against calsol,appearing in state court and sharing the costs of defense and settlement.assuming the commissioner would do the same with the plaintiffs lawsuits,the claimants sought from golden eagle a joint defense commitment for those lawsuits.citing the plaintiffs failure to file claims in the conservatorship proceeding and contending that failure forever bars any coverage potential under golden eagle policies,the commissioner refused to participate further in the defense of the plaintiffs lawsuits.
claimants filed claims of their own in the conservatorship proceeding for the costs of defense and settlement of the plaintiffs lawsuits,but the commissioner denied them.in the letter announcing the denial of the claims,counsel for the commissioner explained the rationale the commissioner attempted to resolve the action directly with the claimants,the plaintiffs by providing those claimants with an sspl form and requesting that that sspl be completed by the claimants and returned to the commissioner.when they failed to do so,the commissioner advised that the claim was being denied for lack of sufficient information and for failure to comply with the insurance code.the claimants were given days in which to seek relief before the liquidation court overseeing the liquidation of golden eagle.no such relief was sought by the claimants within that day period,and therefore,under the insurance code and the orders of the liquidation court,the claimants claim is now barred.consequently,there is no potential for coverage under any golden eagle policy.a similar approach was adopted by the commissioner when you submitted the claim.the commissioner issued an sspl to you unfortunately,the response which you provided provides little or no information which would allow the commissioner to properly adjust or pay the claim in question.we recognize that you are asserting a right to have golden eagle participate in the defense of these claims.however,in light of the fact that there is no coverage potential due to the claimants refusal to participate in the claim process,it follows that there is no duty to defend these actions on the part of golden eagle.
claimants filed an application for an osc in the court in charge of overseeing golden eagle plan of rehabilitation,challenging the refusal to share in defense of the plaintiffs lawsuits,as well as two other,similar lawsuits see,garamendi golden eagle,supra,th at,d.the court denied the osc,holding,the legislature requires coverage issues arising under golden eagle policies to be processed via the expedited procedures of insurance code et.those procedures have resulted in the determination that golden eagle owes no duty to indemnify,and hence none to defend,to the insureds here.thus golden eagle may not be asked for equitable contribution.
ii.discussion 
claimants contend golden eagle was required to share costs of defense of the plaintiffs claims against calsol,arguing the plaintiffs failure to return the claim forms did not extinguish golden eagle obligation to defend calsol because,at most,the failure extinguished the plaintiffs rights to recover against golden eagle,not against calsol the plaintiffs failure to return the claim forms did not extinguish claimants rights of equitable contribution against golden eagle and claimants claim forms contained sufficient evidentiary support to trigger golden eagle obligation to defend.
legal background 
two components of insolvency law are relevant here,governing insolvent insurance companies and bankrupt insureds.
insolvent insurers 
the insurance code authorizes the commissioner to manage an insolvent insurer affairs and liquidate it if it no longer can operate profitably.quackenbush mission ins.th,d.upon the proper showing,the supervising trial court is directed to enter an order vesting title to all of the assets of the insurer in the commissioner and directing the commissioner to conduct,as conservator,the business of the insurer,to the exclusion of the insurer officers and employees.garamendi golden eagle,supra,th at,d.in the role of conservator,the commissioner has a duty to administer the affairs of the insolvent insurer for the benefit of not only the general creditors but also of the policyholders and the public generally.garris
