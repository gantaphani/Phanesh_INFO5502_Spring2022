james corporation and its president,james stanclift,were sued by a competitor in federal court.they tendered the defense of the lawsuit to their business liability insurer,truck insurance exchange,which accepted the tender subject to a reservation of rights.truck then retained counsel to provide the insureds with a defense.the insureds objected to being represented by retained defense counsel and,citing an alleged conflict of interest,demanded that truck allow them to choose their own counsel.truck refused,and the insureds filed the instant declaratory relief action in the superior court.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of truck,finding that there was no actual conflict of interest.the insureds appeal from the ensuing judgment and from an earlier discovery order.we shall affirm the judgment.
plaintiffs james corporation,doing business as sugar sweet syrup company,and sugar sweet president,james stanclift,manufactured and sold beverage syrups to and other stores for use in frozen carbonated beverages,more commonly known as slurpees.from december,to december,plaintiffs were insured by truck under various commercial general liability insurance policies.
on august,coca cola company,which competed with plaintiffs in supplying soft drink syrups to eleven franchises in the bay area,filed suit against plaintiffs in the united states district court.in its lawsuit,alleged that sugar sweet was dispensing its generic syrup through dispensers owned by,thereby misleading the public into believing they were receiving genuine coca cola products,and based on these allegations it asserted the following eight causes of action against plaintiffs trademark infringement under the lanham act,contributory infringement,false designation of origin,california trademark infringement,california statutory unfair competition,common law unfair competition,fraud,and accounting.the following month,filed a first amended complaint.
plaintiffs retained an attorney who filed an answer to coca cola complaint on september.two months later,that attorney tendered defense of the action to truck.truck accepted the tender and retained attorney david miclean of the ropers,majeski,kohn bentley law firm to defend the insureds.
on february,truck notified the insureds that it would provide a defense based on the potential that coca cola complaint seeks damages within the advertising liability definition,subject to a reservation of rights to deny coverage in the event damages were not sustained as a result of plaintiffs advertising activities.truck denied coverage for any breach of contract or punitive damages and reserved its right to seek reimbursement of attorney fees and costs paid to defend noncovered claims.truck also informed the insureds that there was no conflict of interest between you and truck and that consequently it would not pay for independent defense counsel.
subsequently,miclean,truck retained counsel,sent truck an initial evaluation of the case identifying various affirmative defenses,including one for antitrust violations.miclean noted that it might be in the insureds best interest to file an affirmative counterclaim alleging violation of antitrust laws.later,however,miclean told the insureds that he had only been retained to represent their interests as a defendant in this lawsuit and would probably not be able to perform work on an affirmative counterclaim other than perhaps an indemnity claim.
in april,the insureds retained independent counsel the wineberg,simmonds narita law firm to codefend the underlying action and to pursue an affirmative counterclaim against.in may,independent counsel wrote to truck,demanding that truck pay their fees and costs because of a conflict of interest.independent counsel explained,truck has reserved its rights on several issues,the outcome of which can be controlled by counsel first retained by truck for the defense of the claims asserted,raising potential conflicts of interest between truck and the insured which require truck to pay for independent counsel.those issues include,but are not limited to the fraud claim asserted by the company against the insured truck reservation of the right to allocate any payment between covered and claims to seek contribution or reimbursement from the insured for any costs,fees or indemnity payments made on claims truck reservation of rights as to contractual damages and truck reservation of rights as to advertising activities.
in response to the insureds demand,truck retained a second attorney,arthur schwartz of the fisher hurst law firm,to evaluate and advise whether a disqualifying conflict of interest existed.on june,schwartz responded to independent counsel,stating that truck must respectfully decline to appoint you as counsel in our opinion,no conflict is created by some of the reservations you cited.as to the remaining reservations,truck will waive them.truck then explained that it would waive its advertising activities reservation,thereby agreeing to indemnify the insureds for compensatory damages arising out of the trademark infringement,unfair competition,and related causes of action.it would also waive its reservation of rights as to damages for breach of contract.truck,however,reiterated that there was no coverage under the policy for fraud claim,its claim for restitution and disgorgement of the insureds allegedly wrongfully obtained profits,or its request for attorney fees under the lanham act.finally,truck stated it would defer until after the underlying action was resolved any decision to exercise its right to seek reimbursement of indemnity payments or defense costs allocable to noncovered claims.
on june,plaintiffs filed the instant declaratory relief action,requesting a judicial determination that truck is obligated to pay for cumis counsel because truck has reserved its rights on several issues,the outcome of which can be controlled by defense counsel and because of truck refusal to pay for prosecuting the insureds antitrust counterclaim.plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in october,but that motion was denied.
in april,the insureds filed a motion to compel further responses from truck to requests for production of truck claims files,correspondence,bills,invoices,reports,coverage evaluations,and claim or billing procedures that in any way referred or related to the coca cola action.the trial court denied the insureds motion,noting that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this case,which is a limited declaratory relief case.in this declaratory relief action,it limited to whether or not cumis counsel should be appointed.
on june,truck filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no conflict as a matter of law.while that motion was pending and notwithstanding the earlier discovery order,the insureds counsel served subpoenas on the ropers,majeski,kohn bentley law firm calling for the oral deposition of david miclean and for production of the entire file in the action.the insureds opposed truck motion for summary judgment,arguing that truck refusal to provide discovery required that the motion be denied or continued pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision h,so that they could compel compliance with the subpoenas.
in its order granting summary judgment,the trial court stated,plaintiffs fail to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of fact material to determining whether defendant is obligated to provide plaintiffs cumis counsel,based either on the theory that appointed counsel is able to control the outcome of a coverage issue to the detriment of plaintiffs,or on the theory that there is a conflict of interest which has rendered appointed counsel representation less effective by reason of his relationship with truck.see dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange th,d golden eagle ins.foremost ins.th,d.
discussion 
entitlement to independent and case law 
in the landmark cumis opinion,the court held that if a conflict of interest exists between an insurer and its insured,based on possible noncoverage under the insurance policy,the insured is entitled to retain its own independent counsel at the insurer expense.cumis,supra,d at.see fn,ante.
the cumis opinion was codified in by the enactment of civil code section which clarifies and limits the rights and responsibilities of insurer and insured as set forth in cumis.buss superior court cal th,d,san gabriel valley water hartford accident indemnity th,d.section provides,in pertinent part a if the provisions of a policy of insurance impose a duty to defend upon an insurer and a conflict of interest arises which creates a duty on the part of the insurer to provide independent counsel to the insured,the insurer shall provide independent counsel to represent the insured b for purposes of this section,a conflict of interest does not exist as to allegations or facts in the litigation for which the insurer denies coverage however,when an insurer reserves its rights on a given issue and the outcome of that coverage issue can be controlled by counsel first retained by the insurer for the defense of the claim,a conflict of interest may exist.no conflict of interest shall be deemed to exist as to allegations of punitive damages or be deemed to exist solely because an insured is sued for an amount in excess of the insurance policy limits.
as statutory and case law make clear,not every conflict of interest triggers an obligation on the part of the insurer to provide the insured with independent counsel at the insurer expense.for example,the mere fact the insurer disputes coverage does not entitle the insured to cumis counsel nor does the fact the complaint seeks punitive damages or damages in excess of policy limits,subd.b citations.the insurer owes no duty to provide independent counsel in these situations because the cumis rule is not based on insurance law but on the ethical duty of an attorney to avoid representing conflicting interests.golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th at,d.for independent counsel to be required,the conflict of interest must be significant,not merely theoretical,actual,not merely potential.dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.some of the circumstances that may create a conflict of interest requiring the insurer to provide independent counsel include where the insurer reserves its rights on a given issue and the outcome of that coverage issue can be controlled by the insurer retained counsel,subd.b golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th at,d where the insurer insures both the plaintiff and the defendant borad cal d,where the insurer has filed suit against the insured,whether or not the suit is related to the lawsuit the insurer is obligated to defend truck ins.exchange fireman fund ins.th,d where the insurer pursues settlement in excess of policy limits without the insured consent and leaving the insured exposed to claims by third parties golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th at,d and any other situation where an attorney who represents the interests of both the insurer and the insured finds that his or her representation of the one is rendered less effective by reason of his or her representation of the other.spindle indemnity group d.golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th at,d.
as we explained in the last paragraph,not every conflict of interest entitles an insured to independent counsel.nor does every reservation of rights entitle an insured to select cumis counsel.there is no such entitlement,for example,where the coverage issue is independent of,or extrinsic to,the issues in the underlying action citation or where the damages are only partially covered by the policy.citations.dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.however,independent counsel is required where there is a reservation of rights and the outcome of that coverage issue can be controlled by counsel first retained by the insurer for the defense of the claim,subd.b,emphasis added blanchard state farm fire casualty th,d truck ins.exchange superior court th,d foremost ins.wilks d.
contentions 
the insureds contend they are entitled to independent counsel not because of specific language in section or in the cumis opinion but rather because of the policies underlying section and cumis.they rely on the following statement from golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th,d,attorney control of the outcome of a coverage dispute is written into section,subdivision b as an example of a conflict of interest which may require appointment of independent counsel.it is not,however,the only circumstance in which cumis counsel may be required.the language of section does not preclude judicial determination of conflict of interest and duty to provide independent counsel such as was accomplished in cumis so long as that determination is consistent with the section.citation.t he governing principle underlying cumis and section is the attorney ethical duty to the clients.thus,an attorney representing the interests of the insurer and the insured is subject to the rule a c onflict of interest between jointly represented clients occurs whenever their common lawyer representation of the one is rendered less effective by reason of his representation of the other.citation.id.at,d,fn.omitted,emphasis added.
refusal to pursue affirmative defense 
the insureds contend they have a right to cumis counsel in this case because the attorney retained by truck refus es to pursue the affirmative defenses of trademark misuse and violation of the antitrust laws,solely to serve the financial interests of truck,thereby render ing him substantially less effective in defending the insureds.italics added.we disagree.
this is not a case where the insurer has reserved its right on a coverage issue and outcome of that issue can be controlled by the insurer counsel.to the contrary,truck has agreed to defend the insureds against the trademark infringement and related claims without any reservation of rights.the antitrust affirmative defense could potentially reduce claim for damages for which truck is liable under the policy.if truck decides not to prosecute the antitrust defense,then that decision will not adversely affect the insureds it is truck that will be harmed as it will have to indemnify the insureds if they are found liable for damages covered by the truck policy.ivy pacific automobile ins.d.
in this case,the interests of the insureds and truck do not conflict defense of the trademark infringement,unfair competition and related causes of action in complaint.it is in the interest of both to be found not liable or,if found liable,to minimize damages.as the court explained in a similar situation in blanchard state farm fire casualty,supra,th,d,insurance counsel had no incentive to attach liability to appellant.respondent recognized its liability for certain damages flowing from appellant liability thus it was to the advantage of both appellant and respondent to minimize appellant underlying liability.citation.id.at,d.here,as in blanchard,it is in the interest of both truck and the insured to defeat liability.
golden eagle ins.foremost ins,supra,th,d,the case upon which the insureds rely for the less effective language,is clearly distinguishable.in that case,the insurer provided its insured with a defense without a reservation of rights.because there was no reservation of rights,the insureds would not normally be entitled to independent counsel under cumis or section.but the court found that a conflict arose when the insurer defense counsel,over the insureds objections,attempted to negotiate a settlement in excess of policy limits,and that settlement would have exposed the insureds to claims by tenants who were not plaintiffs in the underlying action.defense counsel attempt to negotiate a settlement in excess of policy limits rendered his representation of the insureds less effective and,consequently,the insureds were entitled to advice from independent counsel regarding settlement.
in golden eagle,the insurance counsel representation of the insurance company interest made his representation of the insureds less effective,because it exposed them to claims by third parties.moreover,one set of seeking to settle the case with the other clients money.id.at,d.here in contrast,truck decision not to pursue the antitrust affirmative defense will not expose the insureds to claims by third parties,nor has truck attempted to settle the case using the insureds money.truck representation of the insureds is not less effective because its appointed counsel also represents truck,as truck is contractually obligated to indemnify the insureds for any damages awarded in the coca cola action based on trademark infringement,unfair competition and related causes of action.thus,the insureds reliance on golden eagle is misplaced.
refusal to fund and prosecute counterclaim 
the insureds also contend they are entitled to cumis counsel based on truck refusal to fund and prosecute the insureds counterclaims for affirmative relief against coca cola.they contend that a reasonable construction of an insurer agreement to provide a defense would encompass an obligation to file counterclaims for the insureds when such are factually intertwined with the affirmative defenses being asserted.again,we disagree.
insurance policies are contracts and,as such,are subject to the statutory rules of contract interpretation.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.under the policy,truck is contractually obligated to provide the insureds with a defense.however,there is nothing in the policy that contractually obligates truck to fund and prosecute an insured affirmative relief counterclaims or.as the court observed in barney aetna casualty surety d,aetna had no duty under the policy to file a on the insured behalf,for nothing in the policy provisions imposes upon the insurer the duty to prosecute claims of the insured against third parties.id.at.likewise in silva and hill constr.employers mut.liab.ins.d,the court noted,the duty to defend could not extend to requiring the insurer to take affirmative action to recover money id.at.
the cases upon which the insureds rely,safeguard scientifics,liberty mut.ins.and aerosafe,itt hartford of midwest cal,no.mhp,wl,are again distinguishable.both of those cases,unlike the instant case,were insurance bad faith cases,and in both the insurers wrongfully refused to defend their insureds in the underlying action.in safeguard scientifics,the court held that expenses and fees paid by an insured to bring noncompulsory counterclaims had to be paid by the insurer under its duty to defend because the pursuit of the counterclaims was inextricably intertwined with the defense of the claims against the insured and was necessary to the defense of the litigation as a strategic matter.safeguard scientifics,liberty mut.ins,supra.at.however,safeguard scientifics was applying pennsylvania law.moreover,that opinion was reversed in part by safeguard scientifics,liberty mutual ins.cir and has repeatedly been disagreed with,called into question,and not followed.see,sherwood brands,hartford acc.and indem,tplc,united nat.ins.cir,american planned communities,state farm ins.d.
one opinion that did follow safeguard scientifics was the other case cited by the insureds,aerosafe international,itt hartford of the midwest,supra,wl.in aerosafe,after the insurer refused to defend the insured,the insured hired its own counsel.that counsel prepared but never filed a potential federal antitrust action and a state.in the bad faith action,hartford argued it should not be responsible for fees and costs related to preparing those actions and.the court,applying california law,noted that hartford gave up the right to control the litigation.citation.it can not now complain that it will not pay for legal that was prepared as part of aerosafe defense strategy simply because it was not filed.while hartford may now opine that the preparation of such an action as part of aerosafe overall defense strategy was improvident or unreasonable,such an opinion hardly amounts to undeniable evidence.again,having breached its duty to defend,hartford can not now attempt retroactively to dictate the legal strategies of aerosafe lawyers.the court will permit hartford to provide evidence that the and federal antitrust action were unrelated to the defense of the systron action.however,under california undeniable evidence standard,hartford will have to show that the subject matter of these projects could not arguably be related to the systron action.id.at pp,original italics.
in the instant case,truck has not breached its duty to defend and therefore has not given up its right to control the litigation.as noted earlier,an insurer has the right to control the defense it provides to its insured provided there is no conflict of interest.safeco ins.superior court,supra,th at,d assurance of america haven,supra,th at,d spindle indemnity group,supra,d at.here,truck has no contractual obligation to file a counterclaim against coca cola and it has decided not to do so.truck decision provides no basis for the appointment of independent counsel for the insureds.
reservation of the right to seek reimbursement of defense costs allocable to noncovered claims 
the insureds also contend that truck reservation of the right to seek reimbursement of attorneys fees paid to appointed counsel to defend claims is a separate and independent reason why they are entitled to cumis counsel.again,we disagree.
in buss superior court,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court held that in a mixed action in which some claims are potentially covered and others are not,the insurer must defend the action in its entirety,including those claims for which there is no potential coverage under the policy.this requirement is not a contractual one but rather is prophylactic.to defend meaningfully,the court explained,the insurer must defend immediately.citation.to defend immediately,it must defend entirely.it can not parse the claims,dividing those that are at least potentially covered from those that are not.to do so would be time consuming.it might also be futile the plasticity of modern pleading citation allows the transformation of claims that are at least potentially covered into claims that are not,and vice versa.id.at,d.
although the insurer must defend the action in its entirety,the insurer has an right to be reimbursed from the insured for defense costs allocable solely to claims that are not even potentially covered under the policy.id.at,d.the reason is that the insurer has not received premiums and did not bargain to defend such claims therefore,defending the entire action unjustly enrich es the insured.id.at,d.in seeking reimbursement,the insurer bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the claim is not even potentially covered.state of california pacific indemnity th,d.
in the instant case,the insureds argue because truck issued a buss reservation reserving its right to seek reimbursement of defense costs on noncovered claims,a cumis obligation under section was automatically triggered.they rely on the buss case itself,where it was noted that cumis counsel was appointed b ecause of the insurer reservation of rights and the conflict of interests arising therefrom.buss superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
however,the buss court was not asked to decide,and did not address,the question of whether an insurer reservation of the right to seek reimbursement for defense costs of noncovered claims automatically requires appointment of cumis counsel.that question was raised and answered in dynamic concepts,truck ins.exchange,supra,th,d,where the court refused to adopt the insured proposed per se rule requiring the appointment of an independent counsel whenever a carrier pursuant to buss superior court,supra,cal th,d,reserves its right to seek reimbursement for defense costs for uncovered claims.id.at,d,fn.omitted.instead,the court found that a analysis was required.the potential for conflict requires a careful analysis of the parties respective interests to determine whether they can be reconciled such as by a defense based on total nonliability or whether an actual conflict of interest precludes defense counsel from presenting a quality defense for the insured.id.at,d.under section,the focus of the inquiry should be on whether the outcome of a coverage dispute can be controlled by the defens
