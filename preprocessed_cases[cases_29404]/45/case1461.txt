ii.discussion 
in support of her motion to dismiss the appeal,gerhardt asserts that the district court decision to remand the claim to liberty was not a final decision under and thus is not reviewable on appeal.according to gerhardt,the district court entered an opinion and order reversing liberty determination,remanding the claim to liberty for further proceedings consistent with the opinion,and stating that liberty should consider various factors outlined in the opinion.as a result,the district court order and judgment do not meet the collateral order standard and therefore may not be immediately appealed.in support of her argument,gerhardt cites borntrager central states,southeast southwest areas pension fund,cir.
in response,liberty argues that the district court order is a final order and directs this court attention to chronister baptist health,cir,in which we considered an appeal from a district court order remanding a benefits claim to an administrator without discussing whether jurisdiction existed under.in addition,liberty asserts that borntrager is inapposite because,in that case,the district court remanded the claim specifically for the purpose of developing the record to assist the district court in reaching a final decision,which is not the case here.liberty maintains that,in the present case,the decision remanding the claim,together with the district court instructions,is the final decision.in support of this conclusion,liberty points out that the district court did not indicate that it was retaining any jurisdiction and that the opinion and order of the court does not contemplate its further involvement.
