lago canyon,lago canyon appeals the district court entry of a final judgment in favor of paul fire marine insurance company paul.lago canyon owns a yacht that partially sank at a dock while undergoing engine repairs,causing over million in damages.lago canyon filed a damage claim under its marine insurance policy the marine policy from paul.
paul filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that the marine policy did not cover the damage because it was caused by a corroding part.lago canyon counterclaimed for breach of contract,the marine policy.after a bench trial,the district court found that the proximate cause of the damage was the failure of a hose barb which resulted from corrosion,that the marine policy excluded corrosion,and that the loss is not covered by the marine policy unless a provable manufacturer defect can be shown.the district court also found that the manufacturer use of yellow brass for the hose barb knowing its exposure to saltwater created a condition likely to cause corrosion but that this defect was not covered by the term manufacturer defect in the marine policy.
lago canyon appeals,claiming the district court erred in applying admiralty law and striking lago canyon demand for a jury trial concluding that the marine policy did not cover the damage to the yacht and not awarding lago canyon prejudgment interest on the towing charges.after review and oral argument,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
i.the marine policy and procedural history 
lago canyon is the named insured under the all risks marine policy issued by paul.the marine policy states that the quay marine agreement,any endorsements or amendments thereto,and the declarations page constitute the coverage on the yacht.the marine policy has a property damage limit of million,a property damage deductible of,and a personal property damage limit of.
the property damage coverage section of the marine policy provides that paul will pay for accidental direct physical loss of or damage to the yacht except as specifically stated or excluded in this policy.the parties agree that accidental loss or damage to the yacht covers fortuitous loss unless subject to an exclusion.the coverage paragraph also states that if the loss is caused by a provable manufacturer defect,no deductible will apply the district court concluded that the marine policy indicates that a loss must be fortuitous to be covered and that a manufacturer defect is an example of a covered,fortuitous loss where no deductible applies 
the marine policy,however,expressly excludes loss or damage caused by or resulting from corrosion,as follows 
exclusions we will not provide property damage coverage for any loss or damage caused by or resulting from wear and tear,electrolysis,lack of maintenance,corrosion,deterioration,mold,or fiberglass blistering.
emphasis added.the commercial towing section of the marine policy covers reasonable costs,up to,to tow the yacht if it is disabled from a cause other than a covered loss.
paul issued a reservation of rights advising lago that its loss might not be covered.paul then filed a declaratory judgment action based on admiralty jurisdiction under paul complaint alleged,t his action concerns a policy of marine insurance on a vessel,which is deemed a maritime contract,giving rise to admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.it is well settled that cases involving marine contracts give rise to admiralty jurisdiction.see,norfolk ry.kirby,d.paul complaint also invoked rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure,which allows plaintiffs to elect admiralty jurisdiction over some other ground of federal jurisdiction in other words,if there are two grounds for jurisdiction in the same as admiralty and diversity h provides that the plaintiff may elect to proceed in admiralty.
lago canyon counterclaimed that paul had breached its contract,the marine policy by refusing to pay the damages to the yacht and demanded prejudgment interest.lago canyon counterclaim is the flip side of paul own claim.lago canyon asserts its loss is covered by the marine policy,and paul asserts no coverage.thus,both parties make claims under the same maritime insurance contract.lago canyon counterclaim also alleged that the action was between citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeded.lago canyon separately demanded a jury trial.
paul then moved to strike lago canyon demand for a jury trial.based on our precedent in harrison flota mercante grancolombiana,cir the district court granted paul motion and struck lago canyon jury demand.the district court noted that t he issue before the court is whether paul election to bring this case in admiralty precludes lago canyon from demanding a jury trial on its related state common law counterclaim.the district court concluded that paul rule h designation of its marine insurance claim as an admiralty claim trumped lago canyon right on its counterclaim where lago canyon counterclaim arose out of the same operative facts and same marine policy as paul claim.the district court recognized that there was a split of authority on this issue but concluded the binding precedent in harrison required that both claims be tried by the court 
after a bench trial,the district court declared that paul marine policy did not cover lago canyon damage and granted final judgment in favor of paul.first,the district court found that the hose barb failed and caused the water intrusion,sinking,and damage there was c lear and convincing evidence that the proximate cause of the loss was the failure of the hose barb which resulted from corrosion both experts determined that the hose barb failed because of corrosion,albeit they each found a different type of corrosive process was present and t he use of yellow brass knowing its exposure to saltwater created a condition likely to cause corrosion.
the district court acknowledged that the marine policy covered loss caused by a manufacturer defect.because the marine policy explicitly excludes damage caused by or resulting from corrosion,the district court determined that the loss is not covered by the marine policy unless a provable manufacturer defect can be shown.
the district court treated the term manufacturer defect in the marine policy as meaning a manufacturing defect and then distinguished between a manufacturing defect,a problem in the manufacturing process,and a design defect,a problem with the design of the product.the district court concluded that only manufacturing defects,not design defects,were covered by the marine policy.as to manufacturing defects,the district court found that lago canyon failed to submit any evidence to establish that the hose barb deviated from the manufacturer own design,standards or specifications,or establish that something went wrong during the manufacturing process.
the district court ordered paul to pay a towing fee to lago canyon because the marine policy covered towing fees if the yacht was disabled from a cause other than a covered loss.lago canyon incurred a towing fee of the district court order did not mention prejudgment interest.
ii.bench jury trial 
on appeal,lago canyon claims that the district court erred in striking its jury demand.we first review our harrison precedent,which the district court applied as controlling on the admiralty and jury trial issue 
a.our harrison precedent 
in harrison,the plaintiff was a longshoreman who came into contact with liquid chemical isobutyl acrylate iba while cleaning up a spill on a ship.at.the plaintiff condition steadily deteriorated until he was left totally disabled.id.the plaintiff sued the vessel owner,alleging negligence and unseaworthiness.id.at.the plaintiff designated his claim as one within the admiralty jurisdiction of this honorable court as that term is defined by section h.id.
the defendant then impleaded the plaintiff employer,alleging that any unseaworthiness of the vessel was due to the employer negligence.id.the employer,in turn,filed a complaint against the shipper of the iba,seeking indemnification based upon products liability and negligent failure to warn of the dangerous propensities of iba.id.the defendant then asserted a claim against the shipper.id.the plaintiff amended his complaint to state a claim against the defendant shipper,alleging products liability and negligent failure to warn,and the plaintiff again specified in his pleading that the action was within the court admiralty jurisdiction under rule h.id.after a bench trial,the trial court awarded a judgment for the plaintiff solely against the defendant,the shipper of the iba.id.
the defendant shipper of the iba appealed,arguing,inter alia,that it was deprived of its right to trial by jury.id.the shipper emphasized that the actions against it were predicated on negligence and products liability and,as such,fell within the diversity jurisdiction of the district court id.
this court concluded that the district court did not err in denying the shipper demand for a jury trial.id.at.first,we explained the history of rule h and how it preserves a trial when cases involve both admiralty and some other basis for jurisdiction,as follows 
the unification of the admiralty and civil rules in was intended to work no change in the general rule that admiralty claims are to be tried without a jury.h serves only as a device by which the pleader may claim the special benefits of admiralty procedures and remedies,including a trial,when the pleadings show that both admiralty and some other basis of federal jurisdiction exist.
id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.we explained that,in such dual jurisdiction cases,the plaintiff may elect to proceed in admiralty under rule h,rather than under diversity jurisdiction,and thereby preclude a defendant from exercising his right to trial by jury id.we noted that the advisory committee notes to rule h support this conclusion,and quoted those notes as follows 
many claims,however,are cognizable by the district courts whether asserted in admiralty or in a civil action,assuming the existence of a nonmaritime ground of jurisdiction.thus at present the pleader has the power to determine procedural consequences by the way in which he exercises the classic privilege given by the clause or by equivalent statutory provisions one of the important procedural consequences is that in the civil action either party may demand a jury trial,while in the suit in admiralty there is no right to jury trial except as provided by statute the unified rules must therefore provide some device for preserving the present power of the pleader to determine whether these historically maritime procedures shall be applicable to his claim or not the pleader must be afforded some means of designating his claim as the counterpart of the present suit in admiralty,where its character as such is not clear other methods of solving the problem were carefully explored,but the advisory committee concluded that the preferable solution is to allow the pleader who now has power to determine procedural consequences by filing a suit in admiralty to exercise that power under unification,for the limited instances in which procedural differences will remain,by a simple statement in his pleading to the effect that the claim is an admiralty or maritime claim.
id.at quoting.h,advisory committee note.
this court also noted that the complaint is based upon the same set of operative facts which gave rise to the first complaint.id.at.we added,t hat is,the facts which established admiralty jurisdiction for the plaintiff original claim,injury upon navigable waters performing a task traditionally performed by seamen,also form ed the basis for the action by the plaintiff against the iba shipper.id.we then determined that the plaintiff has specifically elected to pursue a admiralty claim pursuant to rule h and that the trial court correctly denied the shipper demand for a jury trial.id.at.we noted that the plaintiff,in amending his complaint to include a claim against the shipper,specified that he was bringing the claim under rule h.id.
lago canyon jury demand 
in this h case,the district court was,as we are,bound by harrison and thus did not err in striking lago canyon demand for a jury trial.paul declaratory judgment complaint as to its marine policy claimed the special benefits of admiralty procedures,including a trial,by setting forth why admiralty jurisdiction existed and by designating this action under rule h as one brought within that admiralty jurisdiction indeed,rule h expressly authorizes paul to elect to proceed in admiralty rather than some other ground of jurisdiction,such as diversity.h.as explained by the advisory committee notes to rule h quoted in harrison,this accords with the longstanding tradition in admiralty proceedings that the pleader has the right to determine procedural consequences including the right to a jury trial by a simple statement in his pleading that the claim is an admiralty claim.h,advisory committee note.
lago canyon contends that harrison should not apply because paul brought a declaratory judgment action,whereas the plaintiff in harrison brought a suit for damages.lago canyon argues that the supreme court decision in beacon theatres,westover,d,requires a different result from that reached in in harrison.paul counters that beacon theatres,while involving a suit for declaratory relief,was not an admiralty case,but an antitrust case under the sherman antitrust act where the seventh amendment right to a jury trial controlled rule h was not at issue and there is no seventh amendment right to a jury trial on maritime claims.
the problem for lago canyon is that harrison in no way depended on the fact that the plaintiff filed a complaint for damages instead of a declaratory judgment against a defendant.rather,harrison addressed what happens when both admiralty and some other ground of federal jurisdiction exist in the same case and the plaintiff invokes admiralty jurisdiction under rule h.at.this court stated in harrison that,in admiralty cases,by electing to proceed under rule h,rather than by invoking diversity jurisdiction,the plaintiff may preclude the defendant from invoking the right to trial by jury which may otherwise exist.id.at.that is what happened here,which makes harrison in point.thus,our prior panel precedent rule requires us to follow harrison see saxton acf,cir u nder this circuit prior panel precedent rule,we are bound by the holding of the first panel of this court to address an issue of law,unless and until that holding is overruled en banc or by the supreme court.cohen office depot,cir t he prior panel precedent rule is not dependent upon a subsequent panel appraisal of the initial decision correctness.nor is the operation of the rule dependent upon the skill of the attorneys or wisdom of the judges involved with the prior what was argued or considered.
accordingly,under our prior panel precedent rule,we affirm the district court order striking lago canyon demand for a jury trial 
iii.manufacturer defect 
on appeal,lago canyon asserts that the manufacturer choice of yellow brass for the hose barb was a manufacturer design defect which resulted in the corrosion and that the district court erred in concluding that the term manufacturer defect in the marine policy did not cover design defects.more specifically,lago canyon emphasizes that its trial evidence showed that the hose barb corroded because it was made of yellow brass yellow brass was a material unsuitable for a part exposed to salt water and the use of yellow brass constituted a design defect by the manufacturer in other words,lago canyon contends that the manufacturer design defect caused the hose barb failure and ultimate water intrusion.
at trial,paul responded that yellow brass fittings in vessels,such as this hose barb,provide many years of service but must be properly maintained the corrosion process here took approximately seven years wear and tear is a natural part of the service life of a material lago canyon failed to maintain and inspect the hose barb and in any event,the manufacturer choice of yellow brass for its product is a design defect,not a manufacturing defect,and not covered by the marine policy 
the district court found that sunseeker international was the manufacturer of the yacht and t he failed hose barb was an original part of the vessel installed by the manufacturer the failed hose barb was made of yellow brass and t he use of yellow brass knowing its exposure to saltwater created a condition likely to cause corrosion.however,even if yellow brass was an improper material choice,the district court concluded that the marine policy covered only manufacturing defects and the use of yellow brass did not constitute a manufacturing defect covered by the marine policy.as noted earlier,the district court found that there was no evidence that something went wrong in the manufacturing process or that the hose barb deviated from its intended design.
on appeal,lago canyon acknowledges that a design defect is different from a defect in the manufacturing process.lago canyon,however,points out that a manufacturer may be liable for both design defects and defects in the manufacturing process.lago canyon argues that the term manufacturer defect,as used in the marine policy,means any defect attributable to the manufacturer and is not limited in any way.lago canyon thus claims that the term manufacturer defect includes both design and manufacturing defects.lago canyon argues that the district court order jumped from manufacturer defect to manufacturing defect and erred in equating manufacturer defect,as used in the marine policy,with manufacturing defect.
we agree with lago canyon that the district court erred in construing the term manufacturer defect in the marine policy.the marine policy does not define the term manufacturer defect.although there is a distinct difference between a manufacturing defect and a design defect,manufacturers may be liable for both types of defects.see jennings bic,cir explaining that florida has adopted the restatement second of torts a,under which a manufacturer may be held liable for a design defect,a manufacturing defect,or an inadequate warning.thus,both are manufacturer defects.paul problem is that its marine policy uses the broad term manufacturer defect and not manufacturing defect as focused on by the district court.attempting to give the term manufacturer defect its plain meaning and mindful of the settled rule that ambiguous provisions in an insurance policy are construed against the insurer,we conclude the term manufacturer defect includes defects attributable to the manufacturer whether in the manufacturer design or manufacturing of the product thus,the district court erred in its legal interpretation of that term 
because the district court interpreted the marine policy not to cover a manufacturer design defect,the district court did not make findings as to other issues in the case.for example,although the district court found that t he use of yellow brass knowing its exposure to saltwater created a condition likely to cause corrosion,it did not determine whether the use of yellow brass rose to the level of a manufacturer design defect and,if so,what impact this had on the multiple causation issues in the case and the court other fact findings.while the district court found that the proximate cause of the damage was the failure of a hose barb which resulted from corrosion and corrosion was excluded,the district court also then found that the loss is not covered by the marine policy unless a provable manufacturer defect can be shown.because it concluded that a design defect was not a manufacturer defect,the district court did not address further the interplay between the manufacturer defect coverage and the corrosion exclusion or what impact such a design defect had on its causation findings.therefore,because our ruling triggers the need for the district court to address other issues in the first instance and because this is such a fact intensive case,we remand this case to the district court for further bench trial proceedings consistent with this court ruling as to the manufacturer defect issue 
prejudgment interest 
lastly,we turn to lago canyon contention that the district court erred in not awarding lago canyon prejudgment interest as a general rule,interest should be awarded in admiralty cases.interest is not a penalty,but compensation to the plaintiff for the use of funds that were rightfully his.ins.of am.ocean lynx,cir.a district court has discretion to deny prejudgment interest when there are peculiar circumstances that make it inequitable for the losing party to pay prejudgment interest.self great lakes dredge dock,cir.i n any admiralty case in which the trial court refuses to award prejudgment interest,the best practice would be for it to detail the peculiar circumstance it has found,and specifically indicate that it is denying prejudgment interest as an exercise of the discretion created by the existence of peculiar circumstances.in the absence of clear findings by the district court,an appellate court could search the record for peculiar circumstances and decide to award or deny prejudgment interest without a remand.id.at.
here,we not only have no clear finding of peculiar circumstances,but also no finding or mention at all of prejudgment interest.the district court order does not deny or grant prejudgment interest.it says nothing about it.thus,we remand the issue of prejudgment interest to the district court to address in the first instance.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court rulings except as to the issue of the manufacturer defect and prejudgment interest on the towing charges.because of the fact intensive nature of this case,we vacate the judgment in favor of paul and remand the case to the district court for further bench trial proceedings as to the alleged manufacturer defect and prejudgment interest issues.we do not mean the district court must hear all the evidence again,but only that the parties should be able to supplement the record before the district court rules on the remaining issues.
affirmed,in part vacated and remanded,in part.
i concur in the court opinion but,as to section ii,i have doubts about the correctness of our prior precedent in harrison flota mercante grancolombiana,cir relying on harrison,the district court struck lago demand for a jury trial,reasoning that because paul elected to file this claim pursuant to rule h and lago arises out of the same operative facts as paul claims,both claims must be tried by the district court,not by a jury.accordingly,paul was successfully able to defeat lago right to a jury trial by invoking rule h,and designating its declaratory judgment action as one preceding in admiralty jurisdiction.but for harrison,i believe that the nature of a declaratory judgment action requires a different result with regard to lago demand for a jury trial on its breach of contract counterclaim.
we are bound by our prior panel precedent in harrison.in harrison,grover harrison,a longshoreman,suffered injuries stemming from an incident aboard a freighter when barrels containing an industrial chemical fell and leaked in the hold and harrison offered assistance as part of the crew.harrison sued flota mercante grancolombiana,flota mercante,the owner of the vessel,alleging negligence and unseaworthiness.harrison invoked admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to rule h.flota mercante,in turn,impleaded harrison employer,james flanagan stevedores stevedores,alleging that the unseaworthiness of the vessel,if any,was due to the employer negligence.harrison,at.stevedores,in turn,filed a complaint against rohm and haas company,the shipper of the industrial chemical,seeking indemnification based on product liability and negligent failure to warn.flota mercante,as the vessel owner,also filed a claim against rohm and haas following the lead of both the vessel owner and his employer,harrison amended his complaint to state a claim against rohm and haas,alleging product liability and negligent failure to warn.once again,harrison invoked admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to rule h.
the district court found against rohm and haas,only.rohm and haas appealed,arguing,inter alia,that the district court deprived it of the right to trial by jury.in support,rohm and haas asserted two arguments stevedores complaint against it cited rule a,not rule c,as the basis for its indemnity claim and the claims against it negligence and product liability may fall within the district court diversity jurisdiction.id.at.therefore,notwithstanding the plaintiff invocation of rule h,rohm and haas argued,it was entitled to a trial by jury.
the fifth circuit disagreed,explaining that by electing to proceed under h rather than by invoking diversity jurisdiction,the plaintiff may preclude the defendant from invoking the right to trial by jury which may otherwise exist.id.at.the harrison court found the plaintiff election under rule h dispositive as to whether rohm and haas was entitled to a jury trial.id.at.the fifth circuit then highlighted the fact that harrison elected to proceed against both the vessel flota mercante and the shipper,rohm and haas,pursuant to rule h of the federal rules of civil procedure,with the attendant right to a trial.id.at.the fifth circuit found that the stevedores invocation of rule a,as opposed to rule c,was of no consequence for three reasons.id.first,the court refuse d to permit a defendant stevedores to emasculate the election given to the plaintiff by rule h by exercising the simple expedient of bringing in a defendant rohm and haas.id.second,harrison claims against flota mercante first complaint and rohm and haas complaint stem from the same set of operative facts.id.third,harrison amended his complaint to state a claim against rohm and haas and,in doing so,invoked rule h.id.in conclusion,because harrison elected to pursue an admiralty claim pursuant to rule h,the fifth circuit concluded that the district court did not err in denying rohm and haas a jury trial.
here,we conclude that our prior precedent rule requires us to follow harrison.majority op.at.see united states,cir per curiam under the prior precedent rule,we are bound to follow a prior binding precedent unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the supreme court.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.specifically,we rely on the following passage by electing to proceed under rule h,rather than by invoking diversity jurisdiction,the plaintiff may preclude the defendant from invoking the right to trial by jury which may otherwise exist.majority op.at citing harrison,at.
although we are bound by the fifth circuit analysis,i believe that the fourth circuit sets forth a more persuasive analysis.in in re lockheed martin corporation,cir,cert.denied,d,a case indistinguishable from this case on its facts,the fourth circuit addressed the right to a trial by jury in an admiralty case.at.there,lockheed martin lockheed ship suffered damages at sea and a dispute regarding coverage arose between lockheed and its insurer,national casualty company national.national filed a declaratory judgment action against lockheed,seeking a declaration that lockheed claims were time barred national designated its claim as one in admiralty.lockheed answered and filed a counterclaim,seeking payments for the damages to the ship.lockheed requested a jury trial,which the district court subsequently struck.lockheed petitioned the fourth circuit for a writ of mandamus.the fourth circuit issued the writ and said that a n admiralty plaintiff who chooses to proceed at law,has the right under the clause to demand a jury trial.id.at lockheed presented two arguments because it asserted an in personam counterclaim against national meeting the requirements of diversity jurisdiction,it has the right under the clause to demand a jury trial on the counterclaim and it had the right to a jury trial under beacon theatres,westover,d,in which the supreme court held that the right to a jury trial in a declaratory judgment action depends on whether there would have been a right to a jury trial had the action proceeded without the declaratory judgment vehicle.lockheed martin,at.the fourth circuit declined to consider the merits of the first argument but agreed with lockheed as to its second argument 
having determined that the seventh amendment applies to admiralty claims tried at law by way of the clause,the fourth circuit recognized that national decided to proceed in admiralty,not at law.given the nature of a declaratory judgment action,the fourth circuit found national admiralty designation under rule h not to be dispositive of the right to a jury trial issue 
this case,like beacon theatres,involves a declaratory judgment action commenced by the party that,but for the existence of the declaratory judgment procedure,would have been the defendant.although the action sounds in admiralty,that is only because national won the race to the courthouse door and made the rule h designation first.beacon theatres,however,requires us to ignore national status as the declaratory judgment plaintiff and to instead look to how the action otherwise would have proceeded.without the declaratory judgment vehicle,lockheed would have sued national for breach of the insurance policy,a claim over which admiralty and law courts have concurrent jurisdiction.as the plaintiff,lockheed would have been entitled under the clause to designate its claim as a legal one as to which there is a seventh amendment right to jury trial.
id.at.the fourth circuit conclusion rested on two points i n the usual course of is,without the declaratory judgment would have sued national for breach of the insurance contract and under the clause,lockheed would have been entitled to a jury trial on that claim.id.at.accordingly,lockheed can not lose its right to a jury trial simply because national initiated the declaratory judgment action.id.at.
this case stands on all fours with lockheed martin.the facts are indistinguishable insurer sues insured for declaratory judgment that insurance policy does not provide coverage insurer invokes rule h and,insured files a counterclaim for breach of insurance contract,pleads diversity jurisdiction,and demands a jury trial.similarly to lockheed martin,two points lead me to conclude that lago was entitled to a jury trial on its breach of contract claim lago would have been entitled to a jury trial on its breach of contract counterclaim pursuant to the saving to suitors clause and the unique nature of a declaratory judgment action.
generally speaking,the seventh amendment does not extend the right to a jury trial to cases in admiralty.see waring,at.yet,w hile the supreme court has held that the seventh amendment does not require jury trials in admiralty cases,neither that amendment nor any other provision of the constitution forbids them.nor does any statute of congress,or rule of procedure,civil or admiralty,forbid jury trials in maritime cases.fitzgerald,at.under supreme court precedent,moreover,the seventh amendment right to a trial by jury may apply in admiralty cases tried at law by way of the clause.in ellerman lines,leighton beard,a longshoreman employed by atlantic and gulf stevedores atlantic,suffered injuries while unloading bales of burlap from a vessel owned by ellerman lines,ellerman,who had hired atlantic to perform stevedoring services.at.beard sued ellerman in united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania based on diversity jurisdiction,alleging unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligence.beard designated the action as one at law and demanded a jury trial.ellerman,in turn,impleaded atlantic as beard employer,alleging negligence based on its manner and method of unloading and seeking indemnification in the event it were held liable to beard.based on the jury answers to special interrogatories,the district court entered judgment in favor of beard against ellerman and in favor of atlantic on ellerman indemnity claim.the united states court of appeals for the third circuit affirmed the judgment in favor of beard but reversed the judgment in favor of atlantic.finding a violation of the seventh amendment prohibition against the reexamination of facts by a court the supreme court reversed,reasoning that neither we nor the court of appeals can redetermine facts found by the jury any more than the district court can predetermine them.id.at.the supreme court began its analysis by noting the application of the seventh amendment to that case t he requirements of the seventh amendment were brought into play in this case,even though a stevedoring contract is a maritime contract.id.at.of particular relevance here,the supreme court explained that t his suit being in the federal courts by reason of diversity of citizenship carried with it,of course,the right to trial by jury.id.at.
ellerman lines affirms the principle that the seventh amendment may apply to admiralty cases tried at law by way of the clause.see lockheed martin,at in our view,ellerman makes it clear that the seventh amendment applies to admiralty claims that are tried at law by way of the clause.ghotra by ghotra bandila shipping,cir the difference between proceeding in admiralty or at law in state or federal court is mostly procedural of greatest significance is that there is no right to jury trial if general admiralty jurisdiction is invoked,while it is preserved for claims based in diversity or brought in state court.koch fuels,cargo of barrels of oil,cir an admiralty claim that is also cognizable as a civil claim,however,may be brought as an ordinary civil action.in these cases,the right to trial by jury attaches.in the matter of complaint of mcallister towing of,one of the remedies saved to suitors is the right to a trial by jury.
ellerman lines,therefore,belies paul argument that the seventh amendment does not apply to admiralty cases.as the fourth circuit in lockheed martin put it,such a contention is an oversimplification w hile the seventh amendment is not applicable to an admiralty claim,it can be applicable to certain over which the law court has concurrent jurisdiction.lockheed martin,at.in addition,the supreme court has even endorsed allowing traditional admiralty claims to be tried by a jury.see fitzgerald lines,d holding that a maintenance and cure claim joined with a jones act claim that,by statute,carries the right to a jury trial must be submitted to the jury when both arise out of one set of facts.
assuming the presence of diversity jurisdiction the seventh amendment may apply to lago counterclaim for breach of the maritime insurance contract.see ellerman lines,at.providing that a suit for breach of a maritime contract,while it may be brought in admiralty,may also be pursued in an ordinary civil action,since it is a suit in personam footnote and internal citation omitted.
although paul elected to proceed in admiralty,rather than at law,i do not believe that a plaintiff election to proceed in admiralty pursuant to rule h in a declaratory judgment action trumps the seventh amendment guarantee of the right to a trial by jury where it would otherwise apply.rather,the supreme court instructs that a declaratory judgment action can not defeat the seventh amendment guarantee to a jury trial on a legal counterclaim because the counterclaim represents the real controversy.
in beacon theatres,the supreme court addressed the right to a jury trial when a claim for declaratory relief is a part of the equation.after beacon theaters,beacon notified fox west coast theaters fox that it believed fox had violated federal antitrust laws,fox filed a declaratory judgment action,seeking a declaration that it had not violated the sherman antitrust act.beacon filed a counterclaim,alleging antitrust violations and seeking treble damages.beacon also demanded a jury trial.the district court viewed fox claims as equitable and ordered that its claims be tried in a bench trial before a jury considered beacon counterclaim.unsatisfied with that decision,beacon sought a writ of mandamus from the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.the ninth circuit refused to issue the writ and beacon appealed to the supreme court.the supreme court issued the writ,reasoning that the declaratory judgment statute 
while allowing prospective defendants to sue to establish their nonliability,specifically preserves the right to jury trial for both parties.it follows that if beacon would have been entitled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against fox it can not be deprived of that right merely because fox took advantage of the availability of declaratory relief to sue beacon first.since the right to trial by jury applies to treble damage suits under the antitrust laws,and is,in fact,an essential part of the congressional plan for making competition rather than monopoly the rule of trade,the sherman and clayton act issues on which fox sought a declaration were essentially jury questions.
beacon theatres,at.footnote and internal citation omitted.in other words,the right to a jury trial in a declaratory judgment action depends on whether there would have been a right to a jury trial had the action proceeded without the declaratory judgment vehicle.see also gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d actions for declaratory judgments are neither legal nor equitable,and courts have therefore had to look to the kind of action that would have been brought had congress not provided the declaratory judgment remedy.
paul argues that beacon theatres does not apply here for two reasons it did not address the interplay of an admiralty claim and the seventh amendment,and the supreme court decided it before the unification of civil and admiralty procedure in.i find both reasons unavailing.like beacon theatres,this case involves a legal claim lago breach of contract to which the seventh amendment applies just as the seventh amendment applied to beacon claim for treble damages under the sherman act.in addition,the ninth circuit found beacon theatres applicable in a similar scenario,holding that a plaintiff election to proceed in admiralty does not deprive another party of a jury trial on a properly joined claim.see wilmington trust united states district court for the district of hawaii,cir see id.at noting that the supreme court in beacon theatres held that the right to a jury trial as provided by the seventh amendment overcomes another party preference for a bench trial when those interests conflict second,as to paul unification argument,t he merger of civil and admiralty procedure in made no change in the complicated pattern of when a right to jury trial exists.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice procedure.
as this circuit has noted,in the context of a declaratory judgment action,the normal position of the parties is reversed.hudson ins.am,cir stuart weitzman,llc microcomputer,cir.in that sense,lago is the real and paul is the real.moreover,our precedent teaches that the complaint for declaratory relief does not control the case,at least for purposes of determining the presence of a federal question.in hudson,we looked not to the face of the complaint but to the cause of action anticipated by the declaratory judgment plaintiff w here the complaint in an action for declaratory judgment seeks in essence to assert a defense to an impending or threatened state court action,it is the character of the threatened action,and not of the defense,which will determine whether there is jurisdiction in the district court.hudson,at quoting public serv.comm wycoff.see also stuart weitzman,llc microcomputer,cir providing that the inquiry into the presence of a federal question turns on whether,absent the availability of declaratory relief,the instant case could nonetheless have been brought in federal court.to do this,we must analyze the assumed coercive action by the declaratory judgment defendant.likewise here,lago counterclaim for breach of contract represents the actual matter in controversy.we even acknowledge as much in the majority opinion,referring to lago counterclaim for breach of contract as the flip side of paul declaratory judgment complaint.majority op.at.consequently,the fact that lago filed a counterclaim to protect its right to a jury trial is essentially irrelevant.see lockheed martin,at.
in beacon theatres,a defendant right to a jury trial on a legal counterclaim was upheld,even though the plaintiff sought declaratory relief in equity,traditionally a case.similarly here,lago should be entitled to a jury trial on its legal counterclaim for breach of contract even though paul sought declaratory judgment and invoked admi
