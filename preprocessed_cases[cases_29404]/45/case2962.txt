discussion 
liability arising out of the work of named insured 
the standards applicable to a motion for summary judgment are well established.see code civ.we review de novo a trial court ruling on a motion for summary judgment.northland ins.briones th,d.
the standards applicable to the interpretation of an insurance policy were recently reiterated by the supreme court in palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d,
i nterpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th d,waller.while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,bank of the west.thus,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu ins.if possible,we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy.see id.at.if the policy language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west,supra,cal th at d.
when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.aiu,supra,cal d at,quoting.we must also interpret these terms in context bank of the west,supra,cal th at d,and give effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the other,see also holz rubber,american star ins.cal d,
a policy provision is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole.see,national union fire ins.cal th,d.the court may then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,
at the heart of this controversy is the meaning of the clause of the additional insured endorsement protecting arco against liability arising out of crider work for arco by or for crider.the same endorsement language was interpreted in syufy,supra,th,d,and the first district held the additional insured is covered without regard to whether the injury was caused by the named insured or the additional insured.id.at,d.
ffic asserts the holding in syufy and,by implication,the majority rule which it followed are wrong.first,ffic argues the proper interpretation of the term liability should not focus on whether the injury arose out of crider work,but whether arco liability for riddle injury arose out of crider work.
