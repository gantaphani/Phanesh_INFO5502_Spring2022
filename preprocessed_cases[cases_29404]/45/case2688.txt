this case concerns consolidated appeals from the entry of a renewal of judgment code civ,and an order denying appellant motion to vacate the renewal code civ.all further section references are to this code.we conclude the renewal of judgment is not an appealable order,but the order denying the motion to vacate is appealable as an order after judgment.see,subd.a.next,we determine the trial court did not err in failing to vacate the renewal of judgment.we do not reach the question whether the court erred in declining to amend the renewal of judgment see,subd.c,however,since we conclude the renewal of judgment has no separate existence from the underlying judgment.accordingly,the renewal of judgment was vacated by operation of law upon issuance of the remittitur in the appeal reversing the underlying judgment.the present appeal,as a result,is moot.
facts and procedural history 
a longer account of the facts and history of this case is contained in the supreme court opinion in jonathan neil associates,jones cal th,d.for the purpose of the present appeal,a shorter version will suffice.
respondent freddie jones obtained insurance from appellant insurance company through the state commercial insurance program.respondent owned a trucking company and,after expiration of the policy,performed an audit of respondent records for the purpose of adjusting the premium,as permitted by the policy.a dispute arose when asserted the right,at first,to in additional premiums it later lowered its demand to.when respondent refused to pay the premium,assigned its claim to appellant jonathan neil associates,a collection agency neil.
neil sued respondent for the adjusted premium.respondent together with his wife and associated business entities,to whom we will collectively refer as respondent filed a against and respondent insurance broker,johnsey insurance company johnsey.trial resulted in a jury verdict that respondent owed neil no additional premium,that had engaged in bad faith breach of the contract and fraud toward respondent,and that johnsey was not negligent in its handling of respondent insurance application.the jury awarded respondent compensatory damages from in the amount of and punitive damages in the amount of judgment was entered on the verdict.in posttrial proceedings the trial court conditioned its denial of new trial motion on remittitur of the punitive damages award to.respondent agreed to the remittitur,reserving its right to appeal from that order.request for entry of a modified judgment,reflecting the remittitur,was denied,apparently on the basis that the remittitur functioned simply as a credit against or partial payment of the original judgment.
appealed from the judgment in.respondent from the remittitur order and from the judgment in favor of johnsey.briefing and preparation of the record were delayed.we reversed the judgment against in on the basis that the alleged bad faith breach of the insurance contract was not actionable as a tort and could not support an award of punitive damages.jonathan neil associates,jones may,nos.hereafter referred to as granted.we also held that respondent entire claim against was precluded until and unless respondent exhausted his administrative remedies to challenge assertion of the right to additional premiums.we remanded the case,directing the trial court to stay further proceedings until and unless either party petitions for dissolution of the stay based on the final administrative outcome,at which time the trial court shall conduct further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
when respondent petitioned for review,the supreme court in agreed with our conclusion that respondent bad faith claim was not actionable as a tort.the supreme court also held that deferral of respondent pending respondent assertion of his remedy through administrative processes would be ordered pursuant to the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.jonathan neil associates,jones,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court affirmed our judgment and directed that further proceedings should be conducted in accordance with the views expressed in the supreme court opinion.ibid.we understand from the parties that a hearing before the department of insurance was scheduled for april.
with that history of the litigation between the parties,we will now focus on the facts concerning the renewed judgment.on september,while the appeal and were pending in this court,respondent applied for renewal of the judgment e ntered on july,that is,the judgment on the jury verdict.the application calculated that the renewed judgment was either,including interest,without the remittitur or following accepted remittitur.the clerk of the superior court entered a notice of renewal of judgment,which stated that t his renewal extends the period of enforceability of the judgment until years from the date the application for renewal was filed.the notice of renewal did not purport to establish the amount of the renewed judgment instead,a copy of the application showing the two different amounts was attached to the notice as served on appellants.the notice informed appellants that if they objected to this renewal,you may make a motion to vacate or modify the renewal with this court.
and neil filed a motion to vacate the renewal of the judgment.the motion was denied.
and neil filed a notice of appeal from the renewed judgment.at that time,the appeal from the underlying judgment had not been decided by this court.
an issue arose whether renewal of a judgment constitutes an appealable order.we issued an order deferring consideration of that question until we considered the merits of the appeal.shortly after that order,and neil filed a notice of appeal from the order denying the motion to vacate the renewed judgment.we consolidated the two appeals.we also stayed briefing in the consolidated appeal pending the issuance of remittitur in jonathan neil associates,et fred jones,et,or further order of this court.when referring to the present appeal,appellants mean and neil unless otherwise stated.
after the supreme court affirmed our judgment,the clerk of this court issued a remittitur on december.on december,appellants filed a motion for summary reversal of renewed judgment.the court notified the parties it was considering dismissal of the appeal as moot or was willing to consider resolving the appeal without further briefing.the parties objected.on february,this court denied the motion for summary reversal of the renewed judgment and ordered briefs filed within a time stated.
that same day,filed a motion to exonerate its surety bond it had filed to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.over respondent objection,the court exonerated the bond.respondent filed a notice of appeal from that order.that appeal no.has not been consolidated with this appeal.we contemporaneously decide that appeal by separate opinion.
discussion 
issues presented.
appellants contend the trial court should have vacated the renewal of judgment when asked to do so in.they also contend the renewed judgment was void because the trial court had no jurisdiction over the judgment while appeal from the judgment was pending in this court and that the application for renewal was fatally ambiguous and in claiming both the preremittitur and postremittitur amounts.in addition,they contend the renewal of judgment must be reversed because the underlying judgment was reversed and because respondent counsel acknowledged as much in the lower court prior to reversal of the judgment.
respondent contends this court has no jurisdiction over the appeal because an appellate court has no jurisdiction over a nonappealable order.he contends the application for renewal was not defective and that the trial court did not err in declining to vacate the renewal.he argues that if the renewal of judgment is ambiguous or the application states an incorrect amount,the proper remedy is remand for correction,not reversal of the renewal.respondent argues that the appeal is not moot because the possibility exists that on remand from the earlier appeal the trial court could reinstate the judgment,at least in part.finally,respond
