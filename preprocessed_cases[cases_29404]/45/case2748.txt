plaintiff appeals the judgment,contending the second judge ruling constituted an invalid reconsideration of the first judge denial of the motion for summary it incurred cognizable damages permitting the matter to proceed to a jury trial and the trial court erred by denying the motion to amend the complaint.we affirm the judgment.notwithstanding the pretrial motion ruling,the trial judge had jurisdiction to determine whether plaintiff had incurred cognizable damages and,based on the record before us,he correctly determined plaintiff failed to plead or prove it suffered any compensable loss.on the third issue,the court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff posttrial motion to amend the complaint.
plaintiff is the homeowners association for a common interest residential development.diana and george lopez,the owners of a residence in plaintiff development,sued plaintiff and the members of its board of directors over a dispute concerning the lopezes efforts to construct improvements to their residence.the lopez complaint sought injunctive relief and damages for the lost use of and damage to their property,and contained a cause of action for discrimination in violation of the unruh civil rights act,alleging members of plaintiff board had made disparaging comments about the lopezes.
plaintiff carried a million commercial general liability insurance policy issued by defendant.it also had a million directors and officers liability policy and a million policy,both issued by federal insurance company federal.plaintiff tendered defense of the lopez action to each insurer.the tender made to defendant appeared in a letter dated june.
federal agreed to provide a defense under its directors and officers policy with a reservation of rights.at trial,the parties stipulated federal policies provided both a defense and some coverage for the lopez lawsuit.
thereafter,both plaintiff counsel as well as federal representatives sent several requests to defendant concerning the tender and seeking a determination of coverage under its policy.in march,defendant sent a check for to a law firm that had represented plaintiff.three months later,defendant sent written notice accepting the tender of this lawsuit subject to a strict reservation of rights.the letter noted,as this case develops,facts may arise showing that one or more exclusions previously listed or defenses to coverage may apply furthermore,defendant expressly reserves and does not waive any right to raise other coverage defenses at any subsequent time,as circumstances may warrant capitalization omitted.
in september,defendant sent plaintiff a letter stating that after receiv ing the lopezes second amended complaint and having reviewed it in light of the coverages afforded under your polic y,it had concluded your polic y provide s no coverage for the claims set forth in the complaint.defendant informed plaintiff that it would be unable to provide plaintiff with a defense or indemnification in this matter.nonetheless,the parties stipulated that defendant thereafter paid nearly for attorney fees and defense costs on plaintiff behalf.
plaintiff filed this action against defendant in february,stating causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,declaratory relief,and unfair business practices.plaintiff alleged defendant breached the insurance policy by failing to promptly respond to the tender of defense or thoroughly investigate the lopez claim,making false representations to plaintiff,and promising to provide coverage for defense and indemnity and then failing and refusing to do so.the complaint alleged plaintiff had sustained approximately in the form of defense costs and fees paid by federal,which have directly reduced the indemnity limits of the federal policy finally,plaintiff alleged that,since defendant failed to honor its duty to defend,or participate in attempting to protect its insureds,plaintiff had retained insurance coverage counsel in order to attempt to the obtain benefits to which it was entitled under its policies.
in november,plaintiff settled the lopez action for million.federal funded the settlement.the parties stipulated that the amounts paid by federal for defense and settlement of the lopez action exceeded million.they also stipulated that,of the million in policy limits provided by federal,over remained in unexhausted limits.
in early,plaintiff and federal executed a agreement.it provided federal agreed to conditionally advance and pay,subject to the terms of this agreement,the defense costs incurred,as well as million in settlement of the lopez action plaintiff in consideration of federal agreement to advance the settlement and its payment of defense costs in the lopez action and the present suit,hereby commits to repay said sums and agreed to pursue defendant for damages and,or,sic coverage under defendant policy satisfaction of plaintiff repayment obligation would occur by.full repayment to federal or.payment by plaintiff to federal of any compromised amount accepted by federal or.payment of any amount to federal which is deemed to constitute satisfaction or.the final ruling against plaintiff in the legal proceedings against defendant.but plaintiff would only be liable to repay federal from funds actually paid to plaintiff by defendant 
in addition,the agreement contained a provision whereby federal conditionally assign ed to plaintiff its rights against defendant,subject to plaintiff compliance with the obligations set forth in this agreement and upon plaintiff having the right and standing to assert these claims against defendant i n the event it is ever determined that plaintiff is without legal standing to assert the conditionally assigned rights,such rights shall immediately revert to federal.
before trial,defendant moved for summary judgment.noting the only damages alleged in the complaint were the fees and costs paid by federal,defendant argued a s a matter of law,an insured is not damaged when its insurer pays a claim.judge jonathon cannon heard the motion and denied it,finding genuine issues of material fact existed.

discussion 
the trial court jurisdiction to consider plaintiff standing 
plaintiff contends judge chaffee ruling constituted nothing more than a reconsideration of the exact same facts that judge cannon had decided in denying the summary judgment motion.not so.
except in circumstances governed by code of civil procedure section,if an action is transferred from one department to another,the latter may issue a ruling inconsistent with a prior interlocutory order made in the first department.wrightson dougherty cal d,finding without merit a claim that where one department overruled a demurrer,the trial court was bound by the previous order and was without authority to grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings haines commercial mortg.cal,order vacating receivership upheld,rejecting claim the order was invalid,for the reason that in making it the second judge was exercising appellate jurisdiction over the order of the judge who granted the receivership witkin,cal.procedure ed.courts.
contrary to plaintiff analysis,judge chaffee ruling did not amount to a reconsideration of judge cannon order.code of civil procedure section applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court,or for the renewal of a previous motion code civ,subd.e.
judge cannon decided a motion for summary judgment,which focused on whether all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment code civ,subd.c.denial of a motion for summary judgment does not establish any fact or resolve any issue it merely determines that the issues will be decided later,at the time of trial.
judge chaffee,on the other hand,treated defendant motion for nonsuit as a motion for judgment under code of civil procedure section,and granted it at the completion of plaintiff introduction of evidence in the trial first phase.section authorizes the trial court to weigh the evidence and render a judgment in favor of the moving party once the opposing party has completed his or her presentation of evidence in a trial by the court code civ,subd.a.unlike the scope of judge cannon ruling on the summary judgment motion,judge chaffee could weigh the evidence and make factual findings based on the evidence presented at trial.jordan city of santa barbara th,d.
in community memorial hospital county of ventura th,d,the plaintiffs argued code of civil procedure section precluded the trial court from granting a motion for summary adjudication because the issues adjudicated were essentially the same propositions of law which the defendant argued and lost on demurrer.community memorial hospital county of ventura,supra,at,d.the court of appeal disagreed.a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is not a reconsideration of a motion overruling a demurrer.they are two different motions.to hold that a trial court is prevented in a motion for summary judgment or adjudication from revisiting issues of law raised on demurrer is to condemn the parties to trial even where the trial courts decision on demurrer was patently wrong.the result would be a waste of judicial resources,the very evil code of civil procedure section was intended to avoid.nothing in the language of section compels its application to the instant motion for summary adjudication.in fact,to apply it here would run contrary to its purpose.id.at,d.thus,judge chaffee had the authority to decide the standing issue in this case.
plaintiff right to sue defendant 
introduction 
the trial court entered judgment for defendant after finding plaintiff suffered no cognizable damages on the first cause of action for breach of contract or the second cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.although the complaint third and fourth counts sought declaratory and injunctive relief,plaintiff does not claim that the trial court erred in failing to rule in its favor under either of them.thus,we treat any objection to this aspect of the trial court judgment as waived.bagley international harvester d,since appellant presented arguments concerning only the first and second causes of action,the third cause of action was deemed abandoned universal ins.manhattan line d,where appellant makes no argument or reference to two causes of action,any claimed error concerning them is waived.
as for the trial court no compensable damages finding,plaintiff challenges it on several grounds.first,plaintiff asserts the postsettlement agreement with federal entitled it to recover in its own right.second,plaintiff claims that,since defendant knew about the postsettlement agreement with federal,the court erred in relying on plaintiff failure to adequately allege the assignment of federal rights.finally,citing defendant allegedly unreasonable delay in providing policy benefits and its ultimate denial of them,plaintiff argues it can also recover for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing even though defendant and federal paid all of its defense and indemnification costs.all of these claims lack merit.
breach of contract 
the complaint alleged defendant breached its contractual duties by failing to timely investigate the lopez claim or provide plaintiff with a defense in that action,making false representations concerning its intent to protect plaintiff rights,and ultimately denying it was obligated to defend or indemnify plaintiff for any recovery.the first cause of action generically alleged plaintiff sustained financial damages because of defendant conduct.but the only specific damage allegation was in the form of defense costs and fees which have been paid by federal.
an insurer obligation to provide its insured with a defense arises when it ascertains facts which give rise to the potential of liability under the policy.gray zurich insurance cal d,see also isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d.if a potential for liability exists,an insurer is obligated to provide an immediate and complete defense to the action.buss superior court cal th,d.the fact that one insurer may owe a duty to provide a defense will not excuse a second insurer failure to honor its separate and independent contractual obligation to defend.continental cas.zurich ins.cal d.
but to support an action at law for breach of contract,the plaintiff must show it has suffered damage.bramalea california,reliable interiors,th,d patent scaffolding william simpson constr.d.contractual damages are the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused thereby,or which,in the ordinary course of things,would be likely to result therefrom.citations.amato mercury casualty th,d see also.the general measure of damages for a breach of the duty to defend an insured,even if it is ultimately determined there is no coverage under the policy,are the costs and attorney fees expended by the insured defending the underlying action.hogan midland national ins.cal d,amato mercury casualty th,d.where the policy provides coverage for the claim and,as occurred in this case,the insured settles the underlying action,an insured may also recover from the insurer the amount of any reasonable,good faith settlement.isaacson california ins.guarantee,supra,cal d at,tradewinds escrow,truck ins.exchange th,d.
since defendant paid a portion of plaintiff legal expenses and federal,which concededly had an independent obligation to defend and indemnify plaintiff in the lopez action,paid the balance of those expenses plus the settlement,plaintiff can not show it suffered any contract damages.bramalea california,reliable interiors,supra,th at,d.the complaint admitted the contractually recoverable damages sustained by plaintiff before filing the action consisted of defense costs and fees which have been paid by federal plaintiff did not allege that either it or its board was subject to other pending third party claims,the defense of which had exhausted federal director and officer policy limits.in fact,at trial the parties stipulated to the following facts federal policies provided some coverage and defense for the lopez lawsuit the defense costs in the lopez action were paid by either defendant or federal the lopez lawsuit settled for which was paid by federal and federal provided policy limits to the plaintiff of,of which over remained unexhausted.italics added.
ringler associates maryland casualty th,d presents an analogous situation.there the insured sued its insurer for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing after the insurer declined to provide a defense in two lawsuits asserting defamation claims.the court of appeal affirmed a judgment for the insurer,primarily because there was no evidence the insured made a defamatory statement during the policy period.id.at,d.but the appellate court also noted,even if we harbored a reasonable doubt that respondents might have had a duty to defend because of some conceivably arguable possibility or potential of coverage citations,california law would still not permit ringler to recover damages for breach of the duty to defend ringler suffered no liability in excess of the policy limits nor was it compelled or unable to defend itself.instead,it was fully protected from having to pay any costs of its own defense by other insurers who were on the risk when ringler allegedly first slandered the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation.ringler was adequately protected by other insurers,and respondents withdrawal from its defense did not enhance its defense liability or increase the costs it incurred in defense of the underlying lawsuits.citations.id.at,d,italics omitted.
another analogous case is tradewinds escrow,truck ins.exchange,supra,th,d,where the court affirmed a defense judgment in an insured action against its commercial general liability insurer,rejecting a claim for posttender defense costs paid by the insured errors and omissions carrier.s uch costs may not be recovered where other insurers were on the risk and assumed the insured defense.citation.id.at,d.holdings in other cases are also consistent with our decision.see bramalea california,reliable interiors,supra,th at,d contractor sued for construction defects could not recover attorney fees from subcontractors under indemnity provisions of subcontracts obligating them to pay the contractor attorney fees where the fees were paid by the contractor own insurer atlantic mutual ins.lamb,th,d insured who settled with one insurer for an unallocated portion of the defense and settlement costs incurred can only recover the balance of the unreimbursed indemnification expense that it incurred prichard liberty mutual ins.th,d where multiple insurers potentially provide coverage,an insured can not insist the insurers should each be required to pay the whole of an attorney bill ceresino fire ins.exchange d.where one insurer paid for insured defense in underlying litigation,second insurer failure to do so was of no consequence to insured.
as explained in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,the fact that several insurance policies may cover the same risk does not increase the insured right to recover for the loss,or give the insured the right to recover more than once.rather,the insured right of recovery is restricted to the actual amount of the loss.hence,where there are several policies of insurance on the same risk and the insured has recovered the full amount of its loss from one or more,but not all,of the insurance carriers,the insured has no further rights against the insurers who have not contributed to its recovery.similarly,the liability of the remaining insurers to the insured ceases,even if they have done nothing to indemnify or defend the insured.id.at,d,italics omitted.
citing the postsettlement agreement,which described federal defense and indemnification payments as an advance and required plaintiff to pursue defendant to recover them,plaintiff argues it was entitled to sue in its own capacity.but plaintiff argument ignores the stipulated facts and the effect of the foregoing cases.the parties conceded federal policies both obligated it to defend plaintiff and afforded at least some coverage for the claims asserted in the lopez action.consequently,federal also had an immediate obligation to provide plaintiff and its board of directors with a defense in that lawsuit and an obligation to contribute to the settlement.the mere fact plaintiff and federal agreed between themselves to characterize federal payments as a loan does not alter the legal effect of what occurred.defendant alleged liability for the breach of its contractual obligations was reduced to the extent both it and federal paid the lopez litigation expenses and by the amount federal paid to settle that case.
alternatively,plaintiff argues it can enforce federal rights in this action.first,we note the trial judge correctly acknowledged t he complaint was never amended to allege the assignment of federal claim against defendant.while the court afforded plaintiff an opportunity to amend the complaint,it declined to do so.plaintiff counsel argued t he pleadings do need to be amended because federal rights emanate d from plaintiff rights against defendant,and the postsettlement agreement acknowledged we had the right to pursue the rights in the first place this assertion is wrong.
contrary to plaintiff suggestion,the absence of an assignment allegation did not amount to a mere technicality.the pleadings establish the scope of an action and,absent an amendment to the pleadings,parties can not introduce evidence about issues outside the pleadings.trafton youngblood cal d,hughes blue cross of northern california d.generally,one suing as an assignee must allege and prove the assignment to recover on the assigned claim.ford bushard cal,sterling adjustment laher auto spring.however,unless defendant could show it was misled or would be prejudiced by plaintiff failure to allege the assignment,the trial court would have probably abused its discretion if it denied recovery solely on this ground.casey overhead door th,d,disapproved on other grounds in jimenez superior court cal th,fn,d.
but the question arises,what claim could federal assert against defendant federal was not a party to the insurance policy defendant issued to plaintiff,and generally,only a party to the contract may sue for breach of the agreement terms.seretti superior nat.ins.th,d.thus,federal could not sue defendant for the latter failure to honor its contractual obligations to plaintiff.gulf ins.tig ins.th,d.
what remains is federal right to seek contribution from defendant for the amount of the payment exceeding its proportionate share of the defense and indemnification costs incurred in the lopez action.bramalea california,reliable interiors,supra,th at,fn,d.equitable contribution is a separate and distinct cause of action from one for breach of contract it permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation so as to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.thus,a claim for equitable contribution is based on a set of operative facts different from the factual allegations in plaintiff complaint.more importantly,this cause of action limits recovery to that portion of the def
