the guardian life insurance company of america guardian life allegedly sold david powell a whole life insurance policy in by falsely promising through its agent john davidson that earnings from the policy would be sufficient to pay the premium costs after the year and by providing misleading marketing materials that similarly represented premium costs would be eliminated in the year of the policy referred to as a vanishing premium policy.in a complaint for fraud,negligent misrepresentation and related statutory violations,powell and kirk broberg as trustees of the powell irrevocable trust powell alleged they did not discover they had been deceived until guardian life billed them for additional premium payments in september.notwithstanding these allegations,the trial court sustained without leave to amend guardian life and davidson demurrers to the first amended complaint,concluding the claims accrued when powell purchased the policy in and were.the court also found,as a matter of law,powell would be unable to establish justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations because of inconsistent language in the policy itself and in footnote disclosures to the marketing materials.we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the vanishing premium,whole life policy 
powell purchased a whole life insurance policy from guardian life on august,the policy was described to powell by davidson as a vanishing life is,one where,after a certain number of premium payments had been made,the policy itself would generate sufficient sums through its dividend and interest income to pay future premiums for the balance of the insured life.
as part of his effort to sell the guardian life policy,davidson provided powell a illustration entitled lifeplan illustrations that depicted the elimination of premium in the year of the policy life.the first page of the illustration indicates it was prepared for powell and was not a preprinted,generic form.handwritten on the top of the first page are the notations standard option and year.the printed portion of the first page includes the term vanishing premium and contains a schedule that reflects an annual premium of to be paid in each of the first years and no annual outlay after the year.there are no disclaimers,cautionary language or footnotes anywhere on the first page of the illustration and,in particular,nothing suggesting the annual outlay column or the series of after year in that column is contingent on guardian life future dividend scale.
powell first amended complaint alleges guardian life knew at the time the policy was sold this portion of the illustration in its marketing materials was false and deceptive it knew that its term vanishing premium indicated to the reasonable consumer that out of pocket premiums would cease after which all premiums would be paid from the policy internal values,when this was not the case guardian knew that the dividend scale upon which the illustration was based was not likely to continue,making it highly to the guarantees noted in the illustration and made by its agent additional out of pocket premium payments,beyond the illustrated years,would become necessary.
the second page of the illustration continues the schedule from the first page for an additional five years.no annual outlay is shown in any of those years.the second page does include the general statement,please see attached sheets with important footnotes,but once again there is no cautionary language directed to the annual outlay column.the third page of the document contains a single,lengthy lines,all various conditions,qualifications and limitations about the life insurance product being offered.in the middle of the page,not set apart in any way from the surrounding text by contrasting type,font,color,border or spacing,the following disclaimer appears figures depending on dividends are neither estimated nor guaranteed,but are based on the dividend scale.actual future dividends may be higher or lower than those illustrated depending on the company actual future experience.following another dozen lines of in the same type further caution is provided the number of years of required cash outlays depends upon age at issue,policy class,face amount,and continuation of the guardian current dividend scale,and assumes no policy loans.
powell complaint for fraud,negligent misrepresentation and statutory violations 
for years powell paid the annual premiums.in september guardian life informed powell,because dividends had steadily declined,he would be required to continue making premium payments,extending beyond the year of the policy,for the policy to remain in effect.believing the demand for further premiums breached guardian life sales promises,on june,powell filed a complaint for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,unfair competition and false advertising bus,et,et and violation of the consumers legal remedies act,et clra against guardian life and davidson arising out of the marketing,promotion and sale of the vanishing premium policy.
guardian life demurrers and the trial court orders 
guardian life demurred to the complaint,contending that powell misrepresentation claims accrued when he purchased the vanishing premium policy in and thus were and that powell could not establish justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations as a matter of law.in addition,guardian life asserted the unfair competition was and the clra does not apply to transactions involving insurance.
more specifically,guardian life argued neither the policy nor the marketing illustration,both of which were attached to powell complaint,offered any guarantees or made any promises concerning the income that would be earned by the policy over its life.to the contrary,according to guardian life,the illustration contains clear language explicitly disclaiming any such guarantee and cautions that the number of years of required cash outlays depends on continuation of the guardian current dividend scale moreover,the actual policy delivered to powell a few weeks after the marketing materials stated premiums are payable for life.
the trial court sustained the demurrer in part.in its tentative ruling,essentially adopted without change as its ruling after oral argument at the hearing,the court explained the disclaimer in the marketing illustration and the policy language itself were sufficient to give powell at least inquiry notice,if not actual notice,as of august that earnings from the policy were not guaranteed.thus,the fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims,filed nearly years later,were barred by the governing statute of limitations.the court also concluded the disclaimers,as a matter of law,precluded proof of justifiable reliance on any contrary promises by davidson and guardian life.finally,the court decided the cause of action under the clra was not viable because a contract for life insurance is not included within the statutory definition of goods and services,based on the supreme court decision in civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,insurance is technically neither a good nor a service within the meaning of the clra.
the court overruled guardian life demurrer as to powell unfair competition cause of action,however,concluding,although the allegations in the complaint could not support relief under the vanishing premium theory,they were sufficient to state a claim that guardian life actions amounted to an unfair and unlawful sales tactic.the court also granted powell leave to amend to attempt to plead a different,albeit related,fraud theory a claim for knowing of a n established plan by defendant to reduce dividends in future years which was known,but not disclosed,when the illustration was prepared and provided to plaintiffs.
powell filed an amended complaint on november,alleging the marketing of fraudulent vanishing premiums was perpetuated by the practice of substitution or pegging and asserting,at the time the policy was sold,guardian life knew additional premiums would be required if dividend rates dropped.powell further alleged in guardian life was already engaged in a plan to gradually ratchet down its dividend scale from the artificially high levels it had paid in the early to to generate whole life insurance sales and,in an effort to prevent detection of the deceptive marketing scheme,failed to disclose the actual,annual reductions in its dividend scales effective january,and.rather,powell alleged,the annual statements for those years reported guardian life was providing the very dividends depicted at the time of sale as set forth in the policy illustration,thereby further deceiving powell into believing the dividend scale used in the illustration was still effective.
guardian life demurred to the amended complaint on january,davidson joined.at the conclusion of the hearing on february,the trial court concluded the allegations concerning guardian life pegging and substitution scheme did not save powell claim from being,explaining powell annual statement showed a total cash value less than that displayed for the corresponding year on the policy illustration the illustration had a value of the annual benefit statement showed difference of.thus,as early as,powell was on inquiry notice with respect to this potential claim.the court sustained guardian life demurrer in its entirety and denied powell request for leave to further amend the complaint.

the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers to the fraud,negligent misrepresentation and unfair competition claims 
the trial court sustained guardian life demurrer to the fraud,negligent misrepresentation and unfair competition claims without leave to amend,holding as to all three claims the disclaimers in the marketing illustration,considered with the express policy terms,were sufficient a to trigger at least inquiry notice in,thus starting the running of the statute of limitations on powell misrepresentation and statutory claims and b to preclude justifiable reliance on any promises or representations that no additional payments would be required after the policy year.although the analysis is slightly different,both points depend on the conclusion the disclaimers were sufficient,as a matter of law,to require powell to exercise caution in proceeding with this purchase of the whole life insurance policy.
a.the applicable limitations periods 
the limitations period for powell fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims is three years.code civ,subd.d.the limitations period begins to run only when the aggrieved party discovered the facts constituting the fraud.see royal thrift loan county escrow,th,d limitations period for fraud claims in code civ,subd.d,incorporates the delayed discovery rule.
a claim for unfair competition under business and professions code section must be brought within four years of its accrual.bus,grisham philip morris,cal th,d.the supreme court has not yet decided,and the courts of appeal are in disagreement,whether the delayed discovery rule applies to claims for unfair competition.see grisham,at,fn,d,compare snapp associates ins.services,robertson th,d delayed discovery rule does not apply with massachusetts mutual life ins.superior court th,d delayed discovery rule probably applies to unfair competition claims based on alleged nondisclosure of material information regarding vanishing premium policies.at least in the context of unfair competition claims based on the defendant allegedly deceptive marketing materials and sales practices,which is simply a different legal theory for challenging fraudulent conduct and where the harm from the unfair conduct will not reasonably be discovered until a future date,we believe the better view is that the time to file a section cause of action starts to run only when a reasonable person would have discovered the factual basis for a claim.see april enterprises,kttv d.the nature of the right sued on,not the form of the action determines the applicability of the statute of limitations id.at.delayed discovery rule may be applied to breaches of contract that can be,and are,committed in secret and where the harm flowing from those breaches will not be reasonably discoverable until a future time.
b.the disclaimers were not so clear and obvious as to trigger notice or preclude reliance as a matter of law 
when a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered facts for purposes of the accrual of a case of action or application of the delayed discovery rule is generally a question of fact,properly decided as a matter of law only if the evidence or,in this case,the allegations in the complaint and facts properly subject to judicial notice can support only one reasonable conclusion.jolly eli lilly cal d.similarly,w hether reliance on a misrepresentation was reasonable is a question of fact for the jury,and may be decided as a matter of law only if the facts permit reasonable minds to come to just one conclusion.grisham philip morris,supra,cal th at,d,accord,alliance mortgage rothwell cal th,d,except in the rare case where the undisputed facts leave no room for a reasonable difference of opinion,the question of whether a plaintiff reliance is reasonable is a question of fact.because this case is only at the demurrer stage,we can not agree with the trial court the disclaimers in the policy illustration are so clear and so obvious that,as a matter of law,powell claims of delayed discovery and reasonable reliance must be rejected.see generally perdue crocker national bank cal d,in evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint,the question of plaintiff ability to prove her allegations,or the possible difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.
the adequacy of a disclaimer in the context of an action for fraud is judged by reference to the plaintiff knowledge and experience only i f the conduct of the plaintiff in relying upon a misrepresentation in the light of his own intelligence and information was manifestly unreasonable will he or she be denied recovery.hefferan freebairn cal d,accord,winn mcculloch d.generally,a plaintiff will be denied recovery only if his conduct is manifestly unreasonable in the light of his own intelligence or information.it must appear that he put faith in representations that were preposterous or shown by facts within his observation to be so patently and obviously false that he must have closed his eyes to avoid discovery of the truth.citation.even in case of a mere negligent misrepresentation,a plaintiff is not barred unless his conduct,in the light of his own information and intelligence,is preposterous and irrational.citation.ocm principal opportunities fund,cibc world markets th,d.the effectiveness of disclaimers is assessed in light of these principles.ibid.
here,there is a question for the trier of fact concerning the presence or absence of a manifest unreasonableness in powell reliance on guardian life deceptive policy illustration and its agent promise that premiums would not be required after the year of the policy.certainly,if the evidence ultimately establishes the disclaimers were read and understood,they may be sufficient to defeat powell claims.but the placement of the disclaimers buried in a sea of,capitalized print,coupled with the absence of any cautionary language on the first page of the policy illustration,which contains the deceptive language and figures indicating powell payments will vanish,preclude a determination the disclaimers are adequate as a matter of law.
in a similar context,when interpreting limitations of coverage in an insurance policy,the supreme court has repeatedly cautioned,t o be enforceable,any provision that takes away or limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured must be conspicuous,plain and clear.citation.thus,any such limitation must be placed and printed so that it will attract the reader attention.haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d,starbucks superior court th,d we see no problem with the language of the california disclaimer,but we see significant problems with its placement.
to say the very least,the placement and format of the disclaimer language at issue in this case are not conspicuous as that term is used in related contexts.see,subd.a conspicuous,with reference to a term,means so written,displayed or presented that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it conspicuous terms include the following a a heading in capitals and b language in the body of a record or display in larger type than the surrounding text,or in contrasting type,font,or color to the surrounding text of the same size or set off from the surrounding text of the same size by symbols or other marks that call attention to the language.in short,this issue is not one that can be decided as a matter of law on demurrer 
c.the policy for life language did not trigger notice or preclude reasonable reliance as a matter of law 
guardian life also attempts to support the trial court conclusion that powell was on inquiry notice in and could not reasonably rely on any promise or representation regarding a vanishing premium by referring to the policy term that premiums would be payable for life.however,powell does not allege he was told premiums would stop,rather that premiums after the year would be paid from earnings from the policy and that no further payments would be required.accordingly,even though powell may be charged with knowledge of the terms of the policy he received,nothing in the policy itself was inconsistent with the misrepresentations on which the lawsuit is based.see paper savers,nacsa th,d the instant case has nothing to do with the interpretation of insurance policy terms.no one is disputing the policy terms or their meaning.the dispute is whether the insurer agent actively misled the insured representative as to the effect of those terms.
the trial court properly sustained guardian life demurrer to powell clra claim 
the clra is a statute that prohibits specific deceptive or unfair acts in any transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer,subd.a.without question,the clra proscribes at least several practices that powell has alleged occurred in connection with the sale of the vanishing premium policy at issue in this case.for example,the clra prohibits r epresenting that goods or services have characteristics,benefits,or quantities which they do not have,subd.a,or r epresenting that goods or services are of a particular standard,quality,or grade,or that goods are of a particular style or model,if they are of another,subd.a.the clra allows for restitutionary and injunctive relief,as well as compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees,subds.a,d.
the issue whether insurance is a good or service subject to the clra is currently pending in the supreme court.fairbanks superior court,review granted,d.more than years ago,however,in civil service employees ins.superior court,supra,cal d,the court clearly indicated its view that insurance was outside the scope of the statute.in that case the supreme court,considering a class action against an insurer,held a trial court has the authority to order a defendant to bear the costs of notifying absent class members,concluding the clra class action procedures should be utilized in all class actions.in dicta the court commented that insurance is neither a good nor a service under the clra although civil code section,subdivision d does not directly apply to the present case because insurance is technically neither a good nor a service within the meaning of the clra,we expressly held in an earlier case that the class action procedures prescribed by the consumer legal remedies act could and should appropriately be utilized by trial courts in all class actions.civil service employees ins,at.
the plain language of the clra supports the supreme court observation.goods are defined in the clra as tangible chattels bought or leased for personal,family or household use,subd.a.insurance is not a tangible item.services are defined as work,labor,and services for other than a commercial or business use,including services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods,subd.b.insurance,in contrast,is defined by the insurance code as a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.obviously,insurance contracts are not work or labor.nor can these indemnification agreements easily be described as personal services or services furnished in connection with the sale or repair of goods.they are simply agreements to pay if and when an identifiable event occurs.berry american express publishing,th,d issuance of credit card is not a service under the clra 
particularly in view of these statutory definitions,until directed otherwise by the supreme court,we,like the trial court,will adhere to the supreme court dicta in civil service employees ins.superior court,supra,cal d at page,that insurance is not a good or service subject to the clra.see generally people trice d.kaus,whether the supreme court obvious awareness of the consequences of its statement elevates the dictum to a holding or whether it is a dictum that we must follow,does not make much difference.we follow.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed,and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.powell is to recover his costs on appeal.
the majority determination that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to powell clra claim,in light of california supreme court precedent civil service employees ins.superior court cal d,is correct in my view.i concur in the analysis.
nonetheless,i respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the other causes of action.as i shall explain,in my view the trial court correctly concluded powell claims were barred by the statutes of limitation because the disclaimers in the illustration and the policy language were sufficient,as a matter of law,to give powell actual,if not at least inquiry notice,that the cash values were not guaranteed as of august and that the complaint failed to establish the element of justifiable reliance.
preliminarily,however,i note my agreement with the opinion analysis on a number of other points.first,i agree with the description of when the various statutes of limitation begin to run and of the delayed discovery rule application to the claims.second,i also concur that in general the question of when a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered the facts for the purposes of accrual of an action or the discovery rule is a question of fact that may be resolved as a matter of law when the undisputed evidence can support only one reasonable conclusion.third,the majority is correct in stating that sufficiency of a disclaimer in a fraud claim must be assessed in light of the plaintiff knowledge and experience.where my view departs from that expressed in the majority opinion,however,is in the application of these principles.because the material facts are undisputed and,as i shall explain,can support but one reasonable conclusion in this case,the application of the statute of limitations can be decided as a matter of law on a demurrer,and was decided properly by the trial court.
language in the illustration and policy triggered the statutes of limitation.
the determination of powell reasonableness in relying on guardian life policy illustration and the agent alleged promise that premiums would not be required after the year of the policy turns upon the disclaimers contained in the policy and the illustration.more specifically,it depends on whether those disclaimers were legally adequate,that is,whether the disclaimers were sufficiently
