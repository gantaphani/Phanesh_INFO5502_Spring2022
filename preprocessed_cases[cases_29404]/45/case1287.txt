this is a complicated diversity suit with a counterclaim.we shall simplify ruthlessly.moran foods franchises grocery stores under the name and sells the stores many of the groceries they need.and an affiliate that we ignore was one of the franchisees.stores faltered,and eventually defaulted,leaving it owing moran a considerable amount of money for groceries bought but not paid for.later declared bankruptcy.roger camp,the owner of,and his wife,susan camp,had guaranteed the company debts to moran.when they refused to honor their guaranties,moran brought this suit for breach of contract against the two camps plus.and susan camp counterclaimed.claimed that moran had violated a provision of their contract that required moran to furnish certain accounting services to.susan camp claimed that moran had violated the equal credit opportunity act,which so far as relates to this case forbids any creditor to discriminate against any applicant,with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction on the basis of marital status.a.the various contracts recite that they are governed by missouri law.
the district judge granted summary judgment to moran on its breach of contract claim and awarded it damages of million for the unpaid groceries and the rest for interest at the percent annual rate specified in the contract.the counterclaims were then tried to a jury,which awarded the identical on its breach of contract claim and as corrected by the district judge susan camp.since the award to canceled the debts on which moran had based its suit,and with it susan camp guaranty of that indebtedness,her damages were limited to guaranties of three debts that moran might still try to collect because their collection was not yet barred by the judgment in this case or by the statute of limitations.the defendants challenges the grant of summary judgment to moran on its breach of contract claim and also asks that susan camp be awarded the attorney fees that she incurred in litigating her claim under the equal credit opportunity act,plus additional relief under the act.
argument that it did not break its contract with moran,and its argument that moran breach entitled to damages exactly equal in amount to the damages that the district judge awarded moran for breach,come to the same thing.essentially is arguing that had it not been for moran breach which by the way is conceded,it would not have run up any debt to moran.moran breach consisted of its unexcused failure to furnish with profit and loss statements for the franchised stores for the last three quarters of.for a fee of a week,moran had agreed to monitor the financial condition of each of the stores and advise every quarter of their condition.in the last three quarters of that condition was bad.contends that had it been advised of the parlous state of its stores it would have taken steps to mitigate its losses by changing management or product mix,selling the stores or simply closing them,and as a result it either would have had greater revenues or would have stopped buying groceries from moran altogether and either way it would have avoided incurring the million debt for unpaid groceries and thus the interest on that debt as well.
the problem with this argument is that failed to present any evidence that would have enabled the jury to quantify the loss the company incurred as a result of moran failure to provide the three quarterly financial reports.not that such evidence could have been presented it just was.it is plausible that had roger camp realized how badly the stores were doing,he would have taken steps to cut his losses,and the steps might have been maybe it was too late to take them nine months later,when he at last discovered the extent of the losses.we are not much impressed by moran argument that camp opening several additional stores after he learned the true condition of the existing ones severs any possible causal connection between moran breach and running up a large debt to moran.the new stores may have been in better locations and therefore could reasonably have been expected to do better than the existing fact they did do better,though not by enough to offset the losses on the existing stores,losses that eventually drove under.but all this is speculation.for to be entitled to damages for moran breach,it had to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could estimate with reasonable objectivity the loss that the breach inflicted.
should have proceeded in two steps.the first would have been to present evidence of when the missing quarterly reports,if received,would have induced to take actions designed to minimize the losses that the reports revealed.it is not obvious that the first report,showing bad results for the first quarter of,would have precipitated drastic action but it might have.the reactions of other moran franchisees who receive bad news about their financial performance in one quarter would have been helpful evidence on this question.suppose the first report would have caused to take action.if so,the second step in proving damages would then have been for to present evidence of the costs and benefits of the most effective action that it could have taken,such as altering management or product mix or selling or closing the stores.each of those efforts at mitigation of loss would have cost something and then the question would be how quickly a given effort would have produced a reduction in the stores costs and how great the reduction would have been.conceivably the early warning provided by the quarterly reports,had received them,would have enabled it to cut its losses so rapidly and deeply that rather than trying and failing to recoup by opening additional stores,it would have kept current with its obligations to moran.but there is no evidence to firm up such a conjecture.
in any event it is doubtful that such evidence would have justified damages measured by the debt that incurred to moran as a result of the failure of the stores.there is a for want of a nail the kingdom was lost flavor to theory of damages.the company ultimate demise is not plausibly attributable solely to a delay in the receipt of quarterly profit and loss statements.and only the first statement was delayed nine months the other two were delayed six and three months respectively.roger camp was an experienced operator of grocery stores and surely knew that his stores were not doing well,even if he did know the details.knowing that the stores were losing money,he was irresponsible in allowing months to pass without wondering where the quarterly reports were.his lassitude undermines his contention that time was of the essence in avoiding a mounting debt to moran.
it is hard to believe that for a week had bought an insurance policy,with no cap,against its business losses,however careless the insured was in letting them mount up.of course there was no formal insurance policy,but because liability for breach of contract is a form of strict liability,a promisor is in effect a guarantor of performance even if he is unable and not merely unwilling to perform his contractual obligations.zapata hermanos sucesores,hearthside baking,cir united states blankenship,cir see oliver wendell holmes,the path of the law,harv.this gives an insurance dimension to many contracts.winniczek nagelberg,cir.
