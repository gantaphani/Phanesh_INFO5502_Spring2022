introduction 
appellant jpi westcoast construction,jpi,the general contractor on a large construction project,hired respondent rjs associates rjs as a subcontractor on a phase of the project.the construction contract between jpi and rjs contained an indemnity clause in favor of jpi.during the course of the work undertaken by rjs,a worker was killed in an accident.in the underlying action,the worker family sued jpi,rjs and others for wrongful death.rjs insurers assumed defense of the action on behalf of jpi and rjs.a jury found that jpi was at fault for the accident,rjs was at fault,and awarded judgment in the amount of in favor of the worker family.after trial,the family settled with jpi and rjs for a total of million.
this appeal arises from the subsequent round of litigation between jpi and its primary insurance carrier,transcontinental insurance company transcontinental and rjs and its excess carrier,great american insurance company great american,over contributions to the settlement of the underlying action.on stipulated facts,the trial court ruled in favor of rjs and great american,and against jpi and transcontinental,on four separate motions for summary judgment.we shall affirm the trial court summary judgment rulings for reasons more fully explained below.in doing so,we address an issue involving principles of indemnity and subrogation that may be stated as follows assuming jpi contractual right to indemnity by rjs is triggered under the facts presented here,then does the indemnity clause control the payment obligations of the parties respective insurers,or are such obligations determined by the language in the applicable policies of insurance 
facts procedural background 
a.the subcontract 
on december,jpi entered into a contract with jefferson at bay meadows,to serve as general contractor for the construction of bay meadows apartment complex project.on january,jpi entered into subcontract number subcontract with rjs,by which rjs agreed to build seven complete subterranean concrete podium structures for the contract price of,including all design engineering work.
the subcontract contained the following indemnity clause to the fullest extent permitted by law,subcontractor shall indemnify and hold harmless contractor and contractor agents and employees the indemnitees from all claims,damages,losses and expenses attributable to bodily injury,death or injury arising out of or in connection with the performance of the work of subcontractor performed in connection with the project,by anyone directly or indirectly employed by subcontractor,or anyone for whose acts subcontractor is liable even if caused jointly and concurrently by the negligence of the indemnitees and subcontractor the above indemnity provisions do not extend to,or cover any loss,damage,or expense arising out of the sole negligence or willful misconduct of contractor,its employees and agents or any other indemnitees.italics added.
the subcontract contained the following provision regarding insurance coverage prior to the commencement of the work and periodically thereafter as required by contractor,subcontractor shall deliver to contractor satisfactory certificates evidencing compliance by subcontractor with the insurance requirements set forth in section vii of the project manual to these general provisions and incorporated herein for all purposes.all policies,with the exception of workers compensation,shall name contractor and the owner as additional insured parties on a primary basis all original insurance certificates are to be sent to jpi if requested by contractor,subcontractor shall furnish copies of insurance policies required by the contract documents.the requiring of any and all insurance as set forth in these paragraphs,or elsewhere,is in addition to and not in any way in substitution for all the other protection provided under the subcontract to contractor,including paragraph indemnity.
b.the insurance policies 
jpi purchased commercial general liability coverage from transcontinental in the form of policy number,issued on december.the transcontinental policy carried a per occurrence limit of million.for purposes of summary judgment,jpi and rjs stipulated that the transcontinental policy covers jpi for the damages arising from the underlying action.
rjs purchased commercial general liability insurance from underwriters at lloyds lloyds in the form of policy number with an effective date of march,and a policy expiration date of october.the lloyds policy provided aggregate coverage in the amount of million,with a per occurrence limit of million.jpi was named as an additional insured on the lloyds policy in an endorsement added to the policy.another endorsement added to the lloyds policy provided that the lloyds policy shall be considered primary and to any similar insurance held by third parties in respect of work performed by you the insured under written contractual agreement s with said third parties.
in addition,rjs was the sole named insured on a commercial umbrella policy that rjs purchased from agricultural excess and surplus now great american with a general aggregate and per occurrence limit of million.the great american policy had an effective date of april,and an expiry date of october.the great american umbrella policy contained a schedule of underlying policies listing,among others,the lloyds policy,but not the transcontinental policy.in its coverage provisions,the great american policy states that great american will pay on behalf of the insured those sums in excess of the retained limit that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law or assumed by the insured under an insured contract because of bodily injury that takes place during the policy period and is caused by an occurrence happening anywhere.italics added.as pertinent here,the great american policy defines retained limit as follows t he greater of.the total amounts stated as the applicable limits of the underlying policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance and the applicable limits of any other insurance providing coverage to the insured during the policy period for purposes of summary judgment,jpi and rjs stipulated that jpi qualifies as an additional insured under the great american policy.
the great american policy also contains an other insurance clause,which states if other insurance applies to a loss that is also covered by this policy,this policy will apply excess of the other insurance.nothing herein will be construed to make this policy subject to the terms,conditions and limitations of such other insurance.however,this provision will not apply if the other insurance is specifically written to be excess of this policy.
c.the underlying lawsuit 
on september,luis sanchez was working as a hose man for a concrete pour at the project when the left front outrigger of a concrete pump truck plunged into the soil above a buried irrigation box.as a result,the outstretched boom of the truck dropped down and struck sanchez,ultimately causing his death.sanchez wife and two minor children filed a wrongful death lawsuit against jpi,rjs,cf t operator of the concrete pump truck and others.
jpi tendered its defense in this action to rjs and lloyds.lloyds accepted jpi defense as an additional insured under the lloyds policy.during the course of the lawsuit,coverage counsel for transcontinental then known as cna wrote to lloyds and great american on the matter of indemnification.transcontinental noted that damages would likely exceed the limits of the lloyds policy and asserted that p ursuant to the terms of the contracts between the parties,rjs,lloyds and great american owe an obligation to indemnify jpi for a judgment or settlement up to the combined million policy limit of both the lloyds and great american policies prior to the application of the cna policy.great american rejected transcontinental assertion and replied that all primary coverage,including that provided by transcontinental,must exhaust before its excess coverage was triggered.
ultimately,the matter was tried against jpi,rjs and cf t.the jury returned verdicts against all three defendants on november.specifically,the jury found all three defendants negligent,apportioning fault to jpi,to rjs,and to cf t.the jury awarded plaintiffs economic damages in the amount of and damages in the amount of million.after it was reduced by a percentage of previous settlements by other parties,the resulting award to the plaintiffs was.
after the jury verdict,rjs and its insurers,lloyds and great american,entered settlement negotiations with plaintiffs.great american demanded that transcontinental participate in the settlement,but transcontinental refused to contribute any amount to the settlement on behalf of jpi.nor did jpi contribute any amount to the eventual settlement.subsequently,rjs,lloyds and great american settled with plaintiffs for million pursuant to a settlement agreement and release settlement agreement signed by the parties on and around march.the settlement agreement states that rjs is the named insured under the lloyds and great american policies and that jpi qualifies as an additional insured under those policies.under the terms of the settlement agreement,lloyds paid million,with paid on behalf of rjs and on behalf of jpi.great american paid the remaining million,with paid on behalf of rjs and on behalf of jpi.great american settlement payment on behalf of jpi was made subject to a full reservation of rights against transcontinental.also,jpi and transcontinental agreed that any payment by great american to compromise the judgment should not be deemed a voluntary payment.
d.this litigation 
on january,jpi filed a complaint for express contractual indemnity and declaratory relief against rjs and its insurers great american and lloyds in its complaint,jpi requested that the court order rjs to indemnify jpi for the full amount of the jury verdict and any subsequent judgment in the underlying action pursuant to the terms of the express written indemnity agreement in the contract.jpi also sought declaratory relief against great american,alleging that jpi and rjs clearly intended that rjs would be primarily responsible for fully indemnifying jpi and jpi own insurance carriers owe no obligation to pay any of the verdict entered in the underlying action.
on june,great american filed a first amended for equitable subrogation and equitable indemnity against transcontinental.in its,great american alleged that any obligation it owed under its policy is subject to the terms and conditions of its policy.further,great american alleged it was entitled under equitable principles of subrogation to reimbursement from transcontinental of its settlement payment on behalf of jpi.great american also alleged it is entitled to equitable indemnification from transcontinental according to the terms of their respective policy provisions,including their limits of liability and other insurance clauses,as well as principles of equity,for its payment of transcontinental portion of the settlement.
motions for summary judgment 
on february,the parties filed their motions for summary judgment.plaintiff jpi and transcontinental filed a joint motion for summary judgment against rjs and great american.in their motion for summary judgment,jpi and transcontinental argued that the indemnity in the subcontract was triggered by the jury finding that jpi was not solely negligent.relying on rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,rossmoor,they further argued that the indemnity clause controls the priority of insurance between carriers.on these bases,jpi requested summary judgment on its cause of action for express contractual indemnity against rjs and on its cause of action for declaratory relief against great american.also,transcontinental requested summary judgment in connection with the for contribution filed against transcontinental by great american.
rjs filed a motion for summary judgment against jpi on the latter claim for express contractual indemnity.rjs argued that jpi claim should be dismissed as moot because any exposure jpi had to the judgment in the underlying case evaporated when settlement was reached and satisfied by lloyds and great american.also,rjs argued that if the trial court reached the issue of indemnity,rjs was entitled to summary judgment on the alternate grounds that the indemnification clause does not indemnify jpi for its own active negligence.
great american filed separate motions for summary judgment against jpi and transcontinental.in its summary judgment motion against jpi,great american argued it was entitled to summary judgment on two grounds.first,great american argued that jpi claim against it does not present an actual controversy because it paid on behalf of jpi as an additional insured to settle the underlying judgment against jpi.second,great american argued that it has no obligation under the indemnity provision in the subcontract because the indemnity provision does not trump the rule that as an excess carrier great america obligation is not triggered until the limits of the transcontinental policy are exhausted.
in its summary judgment motion against transcontinental,great american argued it is entitled to equitable indemnification from transcontinental for that it paid on behalf of jpi as an additional insured under its policy to settle claims against jpi.as well,great american argued it had established as undisputed facts the elements necessary to satisfy its cause of action against transcontinental for equitable subrogation.
summary judgment rulings 
the trial court held a hearing on the summary judgment motions on march.subsequently,the trial court entered two separate orders ruling on the various motions for summary judgment.
in the first of these,filed on april,the trial court granted rjs motion for summary judgment on jpi claim for express contractual indemnity.the trial court noted that jpi sued rjs for express indemnity regarding the underlying wrongful death lawsuit.that lawsuit has been adjudicated at trial,and settled thereafter,with the entire being paid by rjs insurance carriers.on that basis,the trial court concluded that the basis of jpi cause of action is moot,as jpi no longer has any right of recovery against rjs.on similar grounds the trial court also granted great american summary judgment on jpi declaratory relief claim.the trial court concluded there was no longer any controversy between the jpi and great american,again because the entire was paid by rjs insurance carriers,including million paid by great american insurance so that the declaratory relief action as pleaded in the complaint is moot.
on may,the trial court issued its second order regarding the motions for summary judgment.rejecting jpi and transcontinental reliance on rossmoor,supra,cal d,the trial court resolved the coverage issue in favor of great american.in a nutshell,the trial court concluded the primary carrier of the indemnitee here jpi had to pay out before the excess carrier of the indemnitor here rjs was obliged to contribute.in accordance,the trial court granted great american motion for summary judgment on its against transcontinental,ruling that great american is entitled to reimbursement contribution in the amount of from transcontinental insurance.the trial court also denied as moot in light of its other summary judgment rulings jpi motion for summary judgment on its complaint against rjs and great american,and transcontinental motion for summary judgment on great american for contribution and indemnity.
notice of entry of judgment was filed on june.jpi and transcontinental timely filed a notice of appeal on july.

great american for equitable subrogation 
we first consider the trial court summary judgment ruling on great american against transcontinental for equitable subrogation and equitable indemnification,because therein lies the principal issue on this appeal.jpi and transcontinental assert that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of great american.relying principally on rossmoor,supra,cal d,jpi and transcontinental contend that pursuant to the indemnity clause in the subcontract,transcontinental had no obligation to respond on behalf of jpi until exhaustion of rjs primary and excess policies.on the other hand,great american,relying principally on reliance,supra,th,d,contends that its secondary coverage does not apply until transcontinental primary coverage is exhausted.
the facts underlying the supreme court decision in rossmoor,supra,cal d,were these rossmoor sanitation,rossmoor employed pylon,pylon to construct a sewage pump station.under the terms of the contract,pylon agreed to indemnify rossmoor for damages arising out of the work.pylon also agreed to obtain insurance and name rossmoor in the policy as an additional insured.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.thereafter,pylon named rossmoor as an additionally insured under a policy issued to it by united states fire and insurance company fire.also,rossmoor had its own coverage with insurance company of north america ina.the fire and ina policy each contained an other insurance clause stating that losses were to be apportioned if the insured held other insurance covering the loss.id.at.subsequently,one worker was killed and another injured when a trench collapsed.in an underlying tort action,the families of the workers sued rossmoor and recovered a judgment.rossmoor satisfied the judgment through its policy with ina.id.at.next,rossmoor brought a declaratory action against pylon and fire,seeking indemnity for the sums it paid in satisfaction of the judgment in the underlying action.rossmoor claim for indemnification was based on its indemnity agreement with pylon.fire against ina seeking apportionment between the carriers pursuant to the other insurance clauses in the policies.after a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of rossmoor and ina.ibid.
on appeal to the supreme court,pylon and fire argued that the indemnity clause was nullified by rossmoor active negligence and that liability should be apportioned between the carriers.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.after concluding that rossmoor was entitled to the protection of the indemnity clause,id.at,the court turned to the issue of liability between the two insurance companies.as an initial matter,the court agreed that ina was subrogated to rossmoor right of indemnification since ina paid the tort judgment for rossmoor and since rossmoor has a right of indemnity against pylon.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.
next,the supreme court rejected pylon and fire reliance on the proposition that the terms of the insurance contracts requiring proration in case of other insurance should control,rather than the right to indemnification that exists between the parties insured by the contracts.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.noting that although this proposition might hold true in tort suits arising out of automobile accidents,the court stated it did not apply in the case before it,which concerns a contractual indemnity agreement,not theoretical noncontractual rights of indemnification between insureds.ibid.the court added it appears that both ina and fire calculated and accepted premiums with knowledge that they might be called upon to satisfy a full judgment.there is no evidence that either company knew there was or would be other insurance when they issued the policies.the fact that there is other insurance is a mere fortuitous circumstance.we view one factor as compelling,however to apportion the loss in this case pursuant to the other insurance clauses would effectively negate the indemnity agreement and impose liability on ina when rossmoor bargained with pylon to avoid that very result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement.we therefore conclude that the rights of indemnity and subrogation must control,and are persuaded the trial court was correct in finding that because the fire policy was part of the consideration for the construction job,it must be viewed as primary insurance under the facts of this case and that ina was subrogated to the rights of rossmoor.id.at,italics added.
in sum,rossmoor stands for the proposition that an insurer subrogation of its insured right to contractual indemnification controls in a battle of other insurance clauses between.key to the rossmoor court reasoning was the compelling fact that to apportion the loss between the insurers pursuant to the other insurance clauses would effectively negate the indemnity agreement and impose liability on ina when rossmoor bargained with pylon to avoid that very result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.appellants argue rossmoor controls here.appellants contend the indemnity agreement in favor of jpi would be similarly negated if any liability was imposed on transcontinental because,as in rossmoor,jpi bargained with rjs to avoid that very result as part of the consideration for the construction agreement.
despite such parallels,we do not agree that rossmoor controls.the key distinction between rossmoor and the case at bar is that rossmoor involved a dispute between two primary carriers,each of whose polices contained an other insurance clause,on the issue of whether their respective liability on the loss should be settled on the standard basis of apportionment see fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d law generally favors proration among carriers in such cases,or by subrogation to an insured right to indemnity.indeed,it is a basic rule of california insurance law that an other insurance issue can arise only between carriers on the same level of coverage.carmel development rli ins.th,d.but here we are faced with a subrogation claim by a secondary or excess carrier,great american,and a primary carrier,transcontinental.california insurance law recognizes a fundamental distinction between primary and excess insurance coverage primary coverage is insurance coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability.citation.primary insurers generally have the primary duty of defense.excess or secondary coverage is coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.citation the excess insurance referred to in this definition is that secondary insurance which provides coverage after other identified insurance is no longer on the risk in short,excess insurance is insurance that is expressly understood by both the insurer and insured to be secondary to specific underlying coverage which will not begin until after that underlying coverage is exhausted and which does not broaden that underlying coverage.citation.citations.american casualty general star indemnity th,d italics omitted see also couch on insurance ed.excess insurance,to true excess insurance,which is written specifically to begin its coverage at a level well above the first dollar of loss does not come into operation until the damage exceeds the maximum limitation of the primary policy fn.omitted.
the distinction between primary and excess coverage was central to the appellate court decision in reliance,supra,that rossmoor did not control the issue before it.in reliance,reliance national indemnity company reliance sought complete indemnity from general star indemnity company general star for moneys it expended in defense and settlement of a lawsuit.reliance,supra,th at,d.the underlying lawsuit arose after a spectator at a rock festival was injured as a result of crowd surfing.id.at,d.the festival was organized by don law company don law and sponsored by lollapalooza joint venture lollapalooza.under the terms of the sponsorship contract,don law was required to indemnify lollapalooza for losses due to personal injury.id.at,d.the contract also required don law to purchase liability insurance with policy limits of million per occurrence and million per event,and naming lollapalooza as an additional insured.ibid.
gulf insurance company gulf insured don law under a primary policy with an aggregate limit of million.lollapalooza was named as an additional insured to this policy in an endorsement to the policy.don law was also insured by general star under an excess policy with limits of million per occurrence and aggregate.lollapalooza was an additional insured under the general star policy.reliance,supra,th at,d.lollapalooza also held a general liability policy with reliance with a limit of million.reliance also insured lollapalooza under an excess policy also with a limit of million.ibid.in the underlying lawsuit,which settled for,reliance defended lollapalooza and contributed million to the settlement on its behalf,as well as under the excess policy.gulf defended don law and paid its policy limits of million towards the settlement on behalf of don law and lollapalooza.general star contributed.id.at,d.
after the underlying action settled,reliance sued don law insurers,general star and gulf,for declaratory relief.reliance asserted it was subrogated to the indemnification rights of its insured lollapalooza,and,as a consequence,it had no duty to indemnify lollapalooza until general star and gulf paid their combined policy limits of million.reliance,supra,th at,d.general star against reliance for a declaration that general star duty to indemnify did not arise until the primary policies of reliance and gulf had exhausted.ibid.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the trial court entered judgment in favor of general star and against reliance.reliance appealed.id.at,d.
the appellate court outlined the position of the parties reliance claimed error because as a matter of law,under the contract,don law was to provide full indemnity to lollapalooza and its insurer for any damages arising from the festival.general star counters that the indemnity agreement does not supersede the explicit language of the relevant policies.those policies provided that reliance would be a primary insurer and that general star coverage would be excess to all other insurance.reliance,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.the court acknowledged that u nder insurance principles,there are two levels of insurance coverage,primary and excess.citations.id.at,d.the court also noted it is well settled under california law that an excess or secondary policy does not cover a loss,nor does any duty to defend the insured arise until all of the primary insurance has been exhausted.citations.id.at,d.
building on these fundamental principles of california insurance law,the court explained why rossmoor did not control.in the first place,the duty to contribute applies to insurers that share the same level of obligation on the risk as to the same insured.reliance,supra,th at,d.but reliance and general star do not share the same level of coverage and there is no right of contribution established.id.at,d.rather,reliance obligation was primary and general star was excess.general star had no obligation for any part of the loss,damage,or defense covered by the other primary insurance.this is a materially distinguishing characteristic between the present litigation and rossmoor.id.at,d.additionally,rossmoor did not purport to establish a general rule that a contractual indemnification agreement between an insured and a third party takes precedence over general rules of primary and excess coverage in an action between insurers this is particularly true in this case because general star policy specifically states nothing herein shall be construed to make this policy subject to the terms,conditions and limitations of other insurance,reinsurance or indemnity.see also hartford casualty ins.hawley ins.th,d this is not to say that,under rossmoor,an indemnity agreement always prevails over provisions in an insurance policy,as for example where there are two levels of insurance coverage,primary and excess.
finally,the court concluded that the equities did not permit recovery for reliance.the court stated reliance primary contention is that rossmoor supports the theory that in all cases an indemnification agreement allows an insurer to be subrogated to the rights of its insured,even against an insurance company providing excess coverage.it is undisputed that the parties to the indemnity agreement are not present and this is an action between primary and excess carriers as identified by their policies.the risks involved in providing primary coverage are different from those involved in issuing an excess policy.these differences are reflected in part by the premium costs.as rossmoor noted in discussing the risks of two primary insurers it appears that both insurers calculated and accepted premiums with knowledge that they might be called upon to satisfy a full judgment.there is no evidence that either company knew there was or would be other insurance when they issue the policies.citation.by contrast,an excess insurer does not accept premiums with the knowledge that it will be called upon to satisfy a full judgment.the california supreme court has noted the policyholder pays for two kinds of liability coverage,each at a different rate.the premium charged by the primary insurer supports more localized claims adjustment facilities than those of the excess carrier.it takes into account costs of defense,including legal fees,which the primary insurer normally provides.citations.if we were to accept the arguments of reliance,the basic rules construing primary and excess policies would be altered.a primary insurer would be allowed to charge a higher premium for insuring a greater risk however,then the primary insurer would be allowed to shift the loss to an excess carrier which charged a lower premium.this is not a case between two primary carriers which have each received premiums for bearing the loss which ultimately occurred rather,this is an action between an excess and a primary carrier.while the loss at issue must be borne by reliance,it is nothing more than what is bargained for,particularly given the absence of any evidence that it calculated its premium with an understanding that an indemnity agreement would exist between its insured and don law.under the circumstances,rossmoor,a case involving a subrogation and indemnity dispute between two primary carriers and their insured is not controlling in the present case.reliance,supra,th at,d.
reliance is factually analogous to the case at bar and we find its reasoning highly persuasive.as in reliance,this dispute is between an excess carrier,great american,who filed its seeking equitable subrogation against a primary carrier,transcontinental.like reliance,transcontinental contends it is subrogated to the contractual indemnification rights of its insured,therefore its policy is secondary to all of jpi policies,including its excess policy with great american.we reject transcontinental contention for similar reasons to those outlined by the reliance court.
first,t he contractual terms of insurance coverage are enforced whenever possible.reliance,supra,th at,d.great american contracted with rjs to provide a commercial umbrella policy.by the specific language of its contract,great american
