background 
employment relationship and prior litigation 
prior to,johnson,an african american,was employed by lucent predecessor,at t bell laboratories,in pennsylvania in,johnson took disability leave on grounds of mental disability.in,johnson was terminated.
in,johnson,pro se,sued lucent for disability benefits in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the court found johnson eligible for disability benefits under lucent benefit plan.johnson was directed to place himself under the care of one of three recommended psychiatrists or under the care of a psychiatrist of his own choosing,if approved by lucent or its plan administrator,and to provide proof,on a monthly basis,that he was engaged in an ongoing satisfactory treatment program.lucent and its plan administrator retained the right to petition the court to terminate the benefits upon johnson failure to adhere to the terms of the order or upon any other just and sufficient cause.
lucent did not comply with the order.in,johnson sued lucent again.the pennsylvania district court again found johnson eligible for disability benefits and ordered lucent to pay johnson disability benefits retroactively.lucent was also ordered to pay the bills of johnson or such other psychiatrist as selected by johnson.the court directed that the treating psychiatrist notify lucent quarterly that johnson was undergoing psychiatric treatment and that he was participating meaningfully in the treatment.lucent retained the right to petition to terminate the benefits if such notice was not provided.the court previous order otherwise remained in full force and effect except as amended by its current order.
in,johnson,pro se,sued lucent and several individuals in los angeles county superior court for,inter alia,assault,battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violations of the california fair employment and housing act,related to events that allegedly occurred in.lucent removed the case to the district court for the central district of california and moved to dismiss it for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.see.b.the district court granted the motion to dismiss,but twice granted johnson leave to amend.johnson took the opportunity to add numerous new claims.the district court dismissed all claims as.this court affirmed.
on june,while johnson case was pending before the california district court,lucent filed a petition in pennsylvania to terminate johnson disability benefits.lucent alleged that since,johnson had failed to provide,in violation of the court order,quarterly documentation that he was receiving ongoing treatment.lucent further alleged that since,johnson failed to provide medical evidence that he was under a physician care and that he followed the recommended course of treatment,in violation of lucent benefit plan.
in response,johnson,again pro se,stated that he had been seeing a new doctor,shamie,since,but he had been having difficulty paying for treatment because the doctor was not an provider under lucent health plan.johnson provided,among other exhibits,a letter from shamie,dated may,stating that johnson had been under his care since august.also attached was a form completed by shamie on june,describing johnson current condition as still under the influence of thoughts of not trusting others,his diagnosis as paranoid psychosis nos,and his subjective symptoms as being paranoid not trusting others.thinking that there was a conspiracy from at t against him.johnson also provided a june,letter from the of lucent plan informing him that it could not authorize reimbursement for shamie bills because the plan did not allow reimbursement for outpatient treatment with an provider when providers were available.
in september,following a telephone conference with the parties,the pennsylvania district court ordered lucent to send johnson the documents he and his psychiatrist needed to complete in order to comply with the court and orders.it also ordered johnson to complete and return the paperwork by november.johnson failed to return the paperwork.on december,the court granted lucent petition to terminate johnson disability benefits.in january,lucent stopped paying benefits.
johnson appealed.in his notice of appeal,he stated that in july,shamie sent a form to lucent plan which completed his file,and that shamie refused to complete the new forms because he had already done so in july.johnson also stated that after the district court september order,he saw two doctors,both of whom refused to complete the required forms.
on july,the third circuit denied johnson appeal.as relevant here,the third circuit noted that although johnson contended that he provided forms to the plan in july,he did not provide that information during the telephone conference preceding the district court september order or at any time before the court entered its order terminating benefits.
meanwhile,on june,johnson filed a charge of discrimination against lucent with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,which dismissed the case as untimely.
ii.the instant action 
on august,johnson,pro se,filed the instant action in the los angeles county superior court against lucent and the current administrator of his disability insurance benefits,connecticut general,alleging retaliation in violation of title and section and intentional infliction of emotional distress iied.johnson alleged that,i n retaliation for his filing suit against lucent in,alcatel lucent stopped disability payments december,alleging that plaintiff did not provide a current disability form in.johnson claimed that a proper form had been in fact on file with the plan administrator.
lucent and connecticut general removed the case to the district court for the central district of california,then filed separate motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to rule b and on statute of limitations grounds.the district court granted lucent motion to dismiss on the grounds that johnson title vii claim was barred by his failure to file a timely charge with the eeoc,and that his and iied claims were under the relevant california statute of limitations,having been filed more than two years after the day when the petition to terminate benefits was filed.the court rejected johnson argument that the statute of limitations in a applies to his claim.the court granted johnson days leave to amend his complaint to plead fraud and medical malpractice and allege any grounds for equitable tolling or equitable estoppel.
johnson filed an amended complaint.he added the los angeles police department lapd as a defendant and added claims for medical benefits malpractice,rico charges,extortion,psychiatric coercion,malicious use of process,discriminatory failure to rehire,and fraudulent concealment.
defendants again moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court struck the claims against the lapd and dismissed all of johnson other claims with prejudice.the court ruled that johnson failed to state claims for abuse of process and fraudulent concealment because johnson personally filed the allegedly concealed june medical form from shamie with the pennsylvania district court.as it concerns johnson title vii,and iied claims,the court ruled that johnson was not entitled to equitable estoppel based on lucent allegedly persuading him in that a discrimination suit was unnecessary johnson was not entitled to equitable tolling during the pendency of his appeal before the third circuit and johnson was not entitled to equitable tolling because his mental disability did not rise to the level of mental incompetence.
johnson,through counsel,appeals.
retaliation claim 
a dismissal on statute of limitations grounds is reviewed de novo.ventura mobilehome cmtys.owners ass city of san buenaventura,cir.a ruling on the appropriate statute of limitations is a question of law also reviewed de novo.northwest airlines,camacho,cir.
section of the civil rights act of provides that a ll persons within the jurisdiction of the united states shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.a.like many other federal statutes,does not contain a statute of limitations.jones donnelley sons.in goodman lukens steel,u,the supreme court held that federal courts should apply the most appropriate or analogous state statute of limitations to claims based on asserted violations of.id.at.three years later,congress enacted a catchall statute of limitations for actions arising under an act of congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section.a section was enacted on december.thus,johnson retaliation claim is subject to the statute of limitations if it arose under an act of congress enacted after that date.
the supreme court interpreted arising under requirement in jones.jones and others filed a class action alleging hostile work environment,wrongful discharge,and refusal to transfer under.jones,at.although,as originally enacted,had been interpreted quite expansively,the supreme court held in patterson mclean credit union,that the statutory right to make contracts did not protect against formation conduct,and the right to enforce contracts did not extend beyond conduct by an employer which impairs an employee ability to enforce through legal process his or her established contract rights.id.at.under patterson,jones claims did not state violations of as originally enacted.jones,at.in,however,congress responded to patterson by adding a new subsection to that defines the term make and enforce contracts to include the making,performance,modification,and termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.see civil rights act of,stat.it was undisputed that jones alleged violations of the amended statute.jones,at.the critical question,therefore,was whether the claims ar ose under the act or under as originally enacted for purposes of.id.
the supreme court concluded that a cause of action aris es under an act of congress enacted after december,and therefore is governed by statute of limitations if the plaintiff claim against the defendant was made possible by a post enactment.id.at.jones claims ar ose under the amended because the civil rights act of overturned patterson by defining the key make and enforce contracts language in to include the termination of contracts,and the enjoyment of all benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of the contractual relationship.id.at quoting b.
johnson alleges retaliation in violation of.prior to patterson,federal appeals courts but not the supreme court held,by analogizing to and relying on sullivan little hunting park,holding that covers retaliation claims,that encompassed retaliation claims.see cbocs west,humphries.patterson,however,seems in practice to have foreclosed retaliation claims a result consistent with the fact that victims of an employer retaliation often have opposed discriminatory conduct taking place after the formation of the employment contract.id.at.after the enactment of b in,federal appellate courts again reached a broad consensus that,as amended,encompasses retaliation claims.id.at.the supreme court agreed with this last proposition.id.at.to so hold,the court rejected,among others,the argument that the amendment did not include an explicit antiretaliation provision or the word retaliation in the new statutory language,although congress has included explicit antiretaliation language in other civil rights statutes.see id.at.in that context,the court said 
we believe,however,that the circumstances to which cbocs points find a far more plausible explanation in the fact that,given sullivan and the new statutory language nullifying patterson,there was no need for congress to include explicit language about retaliation.after all,the amendments themselves make clear that congress intended to supersede the result in patterson and embrace law.and law included sullivan.nothing in the statute text or in the surrounding circumstances suggests any congressional effort to supersede sullivan or the interpretation that courts have subsequently given that case.to the contrary,the amendments history indicates that congress intended to restore that interpretation.
seizing on this language,lucent argues that,in humphries,the supreme court found the source of a retaliation claim in the original,and not in the amended version.therefore,lucent argues,statute of limitations does not apply to retaliation claims.
we disagree.regardless of whether encompassed retaliation claims before patterson,it certainly did not do so.see id.at.the civil rights act of made retaliation claims once again possible.under jones,then,retaliation claims now ar ise under an act of congress enacted after,and the statute of limitations in a applies.
taylor regents of university of california,cir,on which lucent relies,is not to the contrary.taylor held that california statute of limitations for personal injury actions governed claims brought under.id.at.although it was decided three years after was enacted,taylor does not mention that statute.moreover,taylor does not specify what kind of claims were at issue there and it is incontestable that some claims continue to be subject to the most analogous state statute of limitations.see lukovsky city and county of san francisco,cir claim not subject to statute of limitations in because it was cognizable under the pre version of.taylor,therefore,does not provide precedent for the applicability of to retaliation claims.
we hold that johnson retaliation claim is subject to the statute of limitations in and not the statute of limitations applicable to personal injury actions pursuant to civ.pro.johnson retaliation claim is therefore timely.
intentional infliction of emotional distress claim 
although johnson did not specify whether his iied claim was brought under california law or pennsylvania law,the district court noted that the statute of limitations under either is two years.the court then held that the claim was because it accrued on the date when lucent filed its petition to terminate benefits june,whereas johnson filed his suit on august.
because we sit in diversity as to the iied claim,we must apply california choice of law rules to determine the controlling substantive law,including the applicable statute of limitations.see patton cox,cir holding that federal courts sitting in diversity must apply the forum state choice of law rules to determine the controlling substantive law nevada power monsanto,cir holding that a federal court sitting in diversity applies the substantive law of the state,including the state statute of limitations.
where,as here,parties do not address issues,california courts presumptively apply california law.mut.bank,fa superior court,cal.under california law,an iied claim accrues when the harm is inflicted.eisenberg ins.of,cir citing murphy allstate ins.such harm must be severe.id.johnson claims that lucent cessation of benefits constituted an intentional infliction of emotional distress.
johnson could have experienced severe harm when lucent filed its petition to terminate benefits,when the pennsylvania district court granted the petition,or when lucent actually stopped payment.the question of when a continuing harm grows severe enough to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress is one of fact.id.in this case the alleged harm could have become acutely severe in december,when the pennsylvania district court granted lucent petition,or in january,when lucent stopped paying disability benefits.because both these events occurred less than two years before johnson filed his complaint,we can not conclude
