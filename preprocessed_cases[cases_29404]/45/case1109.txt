ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.minadeo ici paints,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
b.the district court did not err in concluding that mcgowan alleged negligence was an occurrence that took place during the policy period 
with subject matter jurisdiction being based entirely upon diversity of citizenship,the parties do not dispute that tennessee law applies to this case.see erie tompkins.tennessee caselaw requires that insurance policies be construed in the same manner as any other contract.am.justice ins.reciprocal hutchison.although the language of the policy should be understood in its plain,ordinary and popular sense,bob pearsall motors,regal,any ambiguous language that purports to limit the coverage of the policy must be construed against the insurance company and in favor of the insured.hutchison,at.
an insurance company duty to defend its insured is largely determined by the allegations in the complaint filed against the insured.paul fire marine ins.torpoco.if the allegations in the complaint are within the risk insured against and there is a potential basis for recovery,the insurance company is obligated to defend its policyholder.id.the insurance policy in question in the present case is an occurrence policy.see state ex rel.mcreynolds united physicians ins.risk retention group,a n occurrence policy is a policy in which the coverage is effective if the negligent act or omitted act occurs within the policy period,regardless of the date of discovery.it provides coverage for bodily injury caused by an occurrence which takes place during the policy period.emphasis added.none of the parties dispute that amy dutton suffered a bodily injury as defined by the policy.the question,therefore,is whether her injury was caused by an occurrence that took place during the policy period.mcgowan contends that his failure to inspect and remove the decaying tree while he owned the apartment building was an occurrence within the meaning of the policy,but state farm argues that the occurrence did not take place until the tree actually fell onto the building and killed amy.
the insurance policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions which result in bodily injury.as the district court noted,n o party addressed the aspect of the policy definition for occurrence,so the issue is whether the alleged negligence constitutes an accident.
the tennessee supreme court addressed the meaning of the term accident as used in an insurance policy in gassaway travelers insurance.gassaway involved an insurance policy that was issued to the developer of a residential subdivision.the policy provided coverage for property damage caused by accident.id.at.an underground storm sewer,not disclosed by the developer to the purchasers of the lots,caused serious damage to a subdivision house when the foundation began to settle as a result of discharge from the sewer.although the court acknowledged that the developer did not intend the damage,it held that such settling was reasonably foreseeable and thus not an accident as used in liability insurance policies.the court defined an accident as an event not reasonably to be foreseen,unexpected and fortuitous.id.at.it stated that a determination of w hether the damages suffered resulted from an accident so as to make the insurer liable requires the examination of the entire factual situation.id.at.
the gassaway court cited a number of cases in which an insured negligence qualified as an accident under policies containing similar language.among the cases cited were american employers insurance equipment,holding an insurer liable for damage caused when a contractor used drill bits that were too big because the supplier the insured did not know that the manufacturer had changed the size of
