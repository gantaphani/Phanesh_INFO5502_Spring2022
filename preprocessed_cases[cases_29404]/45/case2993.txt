centennial insurance company centennial appeals from a judgment entered in favor of respondent united states fire insurance company using the time on the risk method to apportion the parties respective defense costs accrued in defending their mutual insured.centennial contends the trial court choice of a method of allocation based on the carriers respective time on the risk resulted in an inequitable allocation of defense costs it asks this court to establish a single bright line rule mandating the equal apportionment of defense costs among multiple insurers in all cases.centennial arguments are unsupported by established law and its position is undermined by the facts of the case.we therefore affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying facts are not in dispute.lincoln associates lincoln was a joint venture responsible for developing,constructing and marketing a residential condominium project known as pacific plaza,located in san leandro.fire insured lincoln under a general liability insurance policy for a period of approximately five and months from january,through july,centennial insured lincoln under a general liability insurance policy for a period of three years from february,through february.lincoln was subsequently insured by travelers insurance group,travelers for the year from february,through february.
in november,the pacific plaza homeowners association filed an action against lincoln and others in alameda county superior court,alleging liability for construction defects and property damage to pacific plaza units.centennial and travelers assumed the defense of lincoln under a reservation of rights.believing that their reservation of rights created a possible conflict of interest,centennial and travelers permitted lincoln to select independent counsel pursuant to civil code section.after american builders was joined in the homeowners action by way of a,fire was placed on notice of the claim against lincoln.in march,lincoln attorney tendered its defense to fire.in december,fire accepted the tender of defense,under a reservation of rights.fire retained its own attorney to defend lincoln interests.
in july,the homeowners action against lincoln was settled for approximately million.centennial,travelers and fire each contributed to the settlement,with centennial and travelers paying a combined total of,and fire paying in defending lincoln in the homeowners suit,centennial and travelers paid approximately in attorney fees and other costs toward the defense of lincoln in the underlying homeowners action.fire reimbursed centennial and travelers in an amount of approximately toward the amounts expended in lincoln defense.
a disagreement arose between the parties concerning whether fire had contributed sufficiently toward the defense of lincoln.specifically,the parties disputed whether the insurers respective shares of the defense costs should be apportioned using a time on the risk method,or instead on an equal basis with each insurer paying of the costs.on march,pursuant to traveler assignment of rights,centennial filed its complaint on behalf of both itself and travelers against fire,contending that defense costs should be allocated equally rather than on the basis of a time on the risk method of allocation and alleging that fire contribution to defense costs was insufficient.fire subsequently filed a for equitable subrogation,contribution and declaratory relief,arguing that defense costs were properly allocated on a time on the risk basis.
the parties filed for summary adjudication,alleging that judgment should be granted in accordance with their respective positions.after oral argument on the,the trial court denied centennial motion and granted that of fire.the trial court entered a stipulated judgment apportioning lincoln defense costs on a time on the risk basis,and thereupon ruling that fire was obligated to contribute of the total defense costs incurred based on the actual time period fire policy covered lincoln relative to the time period of the respective policies of centennial and travelers.this appeal timely followed.
discussion 
the sole issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in allocating defense costs among the several insurance carriers responsible for the defense of a mutual insured on the basis of the relative amount of time each insurer was on the risk,rather than on an equal shares basis.appellant centennial contends the trial court was required both by appellate precedent and by considerations of equity to allocate the costs of defense equally among itself,travelers and fire,despite the undeniable fact the duration fire insurance coverage of lincoln was a relatively small fraction of the overall period of coverage compared to that provided by centennial and travelers.we conclude that centennial is wrong both on the law and as a matter of equity.
we start with the standard of review.centennial asserts that because the question before this court is a pure question of law,the trial court decision is subject to de novo review.it is of course true that,in general,appellate review of a trial court decision to grant or deny a summary judgment motion is on the basis of a de novo examination of the evidence before the trial court and an independent determination of its effect as a matter of law.sangster paetkau th,d.this rule is applicable in the usual case,in which the questions presented upon the motion for summary judgment are matters of law not involving the exercise of judicial discretion.krieger nick alexander imports,d,fn.barisich lewis d,fn.however,in the limited and exceptional circumstances where a trial court is required to exercise its discretion in passing on a code of civil procedure section motion for summary judgment,and grants or denies such a motion on the basis of its equitable determination of a question as to which the exercise of judicial discretion is proper,the standard of review on appeal necessarily is whether the trial court decision amounted to an abuse of discretion.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d fireman fund krieger nick alexander imports,supra,d at,fn.danieley goldmine ski associates,d.overland plumbing,transamerica ins.d.
this is such a case.in choosing the appropriate method of allocating defense costs among multiple liability insurance carriers,each insuring the same insured,a trial court must determine which method of allocation will most equitably distribute the obligation among the insurers pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk,as a matter of distributive justice and equity.fireman fund,supra,th at,d.as such,the trial court determination of which method of allocation will produce the most equitable results is necessarily a matter of its equitable judicial discretion.signal companies,harbor ins.cal d,relative obligations of multiple insurers to participate in defense costs is subject to varying equitable considerations fireman fund,supra,th at,d trial court allocation of defense costs was well within the trial court equitable discretion stonewall ins.city of palos verdes estates th,fn,d stonewall the trial court has discretion to select a method or formula to be used in apportioning defense liability among insurers that will produce the most equitable results armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d armstrong trial court has discretion to determine proper method of allocating defense costs among multiple insurers in light of varying equitable considerations which may arise in particular cases cna casualty of california seaboard surety d.trial court employed fair and reasonable method of apportioning defense costs equitably among multiple insurers,and therefore did not abuse its discretion in the allocation it made.
thus,the issue on this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the time on the risk method of allocating defense costs among multiple insurance carriers was the most equitable way of apportioning defense costs under the circumstances presented by this case,or whether it instead should be required to adopt an equal shares approach.stonewall,supra,th at,f
