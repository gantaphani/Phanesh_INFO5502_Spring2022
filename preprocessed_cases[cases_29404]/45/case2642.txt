ii.insurers do not have standing to recover an insured unpaid deductible in a subrogation lawsuit 
standing in a lawsuit is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.
it is that,pursuant to principles of equitable subrogation,an insured retains a right to sue for uncompensated loss.subrogation is the right of an insurer to take the place of its insured to pursue recovery from legally responsible third parties for losses paid to the insured by the insurer.citation.kardly state farm mut.auto.ins.d,italics added.both the subrogee insurer and the subrogor insured have a right of action against the tortfeasor.basin construction department of water power d.
subrogation can also arise out of the contractual language of the insurance policy conventional subrogation.progressive west ins.superior court th,d.however,american has not pled that its insurance policy allows it to recover its insured deductible,and it makes no such claim in this court.
american claims it became subrogated to all sic rights and remedies against all those responsible for this loss.however,it admits that this loss is only the it has actually paid to to date,and deducting the deductible from the gross claim of.hence,under the general law of subrogation,american has a right to sue only for its subrogated loss,what it paid its insured.
iii.the california fair claims settlement practices regulations govern the settlement of insurance claims

we begin with the regulatory context in which section appears.
section is part of a larger regulatory scheme designed to curtail unfair business practices in the insurance business enumerated in insurance code section,subdivision h.section is a part of article of subchapter of title of the california code of regulations.the preamble to article is found in section of title as follows 
a section h of the california insurance code enumerates sixteen claims settlement practices that,when either knowingly committed on a single occasion,or performed with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice,are considered to be unfair claims settlement practices and are,thus,prohibited by this section of the california insurance code.the insurance commissioner has promulgated these regulations in order to accomplish the following objectives 
to delineate certain minimum standards for the settlement of claims which,when violated knowingly on a single occasion or performed with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice shall constitute an unfair claims settlement practice within the meaning of insurance code section h 
to promote the good faith,prompt,efficient and equitable settlement of claims on a cost effective basis 
to discourage and monitor the presentation to insurers of false or fraudulent claims and,
to encourage the prompt and thorough investigation of suspected fraudulent claims and ensure the prompt and comprehensive reporting of suspected fraudulent claims as required by insurance code section,italics added.
this preamble leaves no doubt that the regulations to which it refers including section concern the settlement of claims,not the pursuit of claims in litigation.this conclusion is bolstered by a reading of section in its entirety section is entitled,standards for prompt,fair and equitable settlements.italics added.the numerous references in section to the settlement of claims see appendix,post,at leave no doubt that the aim of section is to govern the settlement of claims,not the pursuit of litigation.
american focuses on the use of the term subrogation demand in section,subdivision q.contrary to american argument,the plain meaning of the term subrogation demand in this administrative regulation does not contradict standing and subrogation law.it addresses another subject settlement of claims and the pursuit of a subrogation claim short of litigation.thus,in ordinary parlance,a demand is something that occurs short of litigation.indeed,it is the refusal of a demand that may trigger litigation.the plain meaning of this phrase in context is that an insurer seeking settlement from a tortfeasor must seek recovery of its insured deductible.however,a subrogation demand in a settlement context is not the same as standing to sue in litigation.a subrogation demand does not authorize substitution of one party for the lawful party in a lawsuit
