plaintiffs trinity homes and beazer homes investments collectively referred to as beazer were general contractors tasked with the construction of multiple residences throughout indiana.rather than build the homes itself,beazer employed a bevy of subcontractors to handle the home that turned out to be defective.after beazer incurred significant liability related to the defective work and its insurers failed to provide coverage,it brought a claim against both its primary insurers and its umbrella insurer in district court alleging breach of contract and seeking a declaration that all of the insurers had a duty to provide coverage.
while most of the primary insurers settled with beazer,ohio casualty insurance company stood resolute,claiming its policy did not cover faulty subcontractor work.the umbrella policy holder,cincinnati insurance company,also argued that its coverage was not triggered because all of beazer underlying policies were not unavailable,as required by the umbrella policy.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers.we disagree with the district court construction of both insurance policies and reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the insurers and remand for further proceedings.
background 
beazer was in the business of new home construction.to that end,it entered into thousands of contracts with purchasers who wanted the classic american dream a home to call their own.each contract provided that beazer would serve as general contractor and warranted that the homes would be free of defects caused by shoddy workmanship.rather than build the homes itself,beazer used a number of subcontractors to take care of the actual home construction.
to many homeowners disappointment,their dream homes turned out to be lemons.due to faulty work by beazer subcontractors,a number of the homes were plagued with structural problems.these defects allowed water to enter the homes,which in turn resulted in physical damage to the residences and health problems for the occupants.beginning in,the homeowners sued beazer in indiana state court for the costs associated with remedying the subcontractors deficient work.in all,beazer faced thirteen lawsuits,including multiple class actions.
confronted with significant liability,beazer sought coverage for the liability associated with the underlying lawsuits.beazer had multiple primary commercial general liability cgl policies,which covered beazer liability resulting from property damage caused by an occurrence,as those terms were defined in the policies.beazer also had an umbrella policy with cincinnati insurance company that covered liability in excess of or not covered by its cgl policies.none of the insurers recognized a duty to defend or indemnify beazer.
to compel coverage,beazer brought a diversity suit in the united states district court for the southern district of indiana against the insurers.beazer claimed that the insurers breached the insurance contracts when they denied coverage,and it also sought a declaration that the insurance companies must provide coverage for the liability incurred.during the pendency of beazer suit,nearly all of the cgl insurers settled.each of those insurers settled for at least percent of the relevant policy limit,and each settlement agreement provided that beazer would be responsible for the remainder of the limit,functionally exhausting the cgl policy.but one of the providers,ohio casualty insurance company,held its ground,claiming that damage to a home arising from faulty subcontractor work was not property damage caused by an occurrence within the meaning of the policy.the umbrella insurer,cincinnati insurance company,also argued that its policy was not triggered,as a number of the cgl policies were neither completely exhausted nor otherwise unavailable.
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ohio casualty on the grounds that the policy language did not cover the underlying home damage,and in favor of cincinnati because some of beazer cgl policies were still available.beazer timely appealed the grants of summary judgment in favor of both insurers.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment,along with its construction of an insurance policy,de novo.ace am.ins,cir.we view the record in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.abstract title guar.chicago ins,cir.
as the parties correctly agree,our inquiry is governed by indiana law.as such,we must apply indiana law as we predict the indiana supreme court would apply it.clark state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.under indiana law,the interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law.tate secura.to determine whether an insurance policy provides coverage,we must first determine whether the policy is clear or ambiguous.if the grant of coverage is clear,we assign to it its plain and ordinary meaning and enforce it accordingly.reuille brandenberger.if the language is ambiguous,however,we must construe it in favor of the insured.tate,at.keeping these principles in mind,we proceed to evaluate each grant of summary judgment in turn.
a.the ohio casualty cgl policy 
beazer sought coverage under the ohio casualty policy for the liability from one of its thirteen lawsuits.as part of that suit settlement,beazer agreed to repair water damage to a number of homes caused by faulty subcontractor work.ohio casualty denied beazer claim,stating that the policy does not cover liability stemming from that type of damage.
ohio casualty policy is a cgl policy.in relevant part,the policy provides that ohio casualty will cover those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages due to property damage caused by an occurrence.the policy goes on to define property damage as p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property and l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.the policy states that an occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.notably,the policy does not define the word accident.
in granting summary judgment in favor of ohio casualty,the district court held that the faulty subcontractor work was not property damage caused by an occurrence.the district court first held that the term property damage did not include damage done to the home itself.relying on indiana state court decisions,including sheehan constr.cont l cas,the court drew a distinction between two types of damage caused by a subcontractor work damage to property distinct from the home,which would typically be covered by a standard cgl policy,and damage to the home structure itself,which would not be covered.the district court went on to hold that,even if there was property damage,it was not caused by an occurrence.to be an occurrence under the policy,the event must be an accident.again citing to indiana case law,the district court ruled that the ordinary consequences of faulty workmanship did not constitute an accident within the policy coverage.
after the district court granted summary judgment for ohio casualty,the indiana supreme court authoritatively weighed in on the sheehan case.sheehan constr.cont l cas.similar to the case at bar,sheehan involved a homebuilder who was sued for damages caused by faulty subcontractor work and sought coverage under his cgl policy identical in all relevant respects to ohio casualty.the indiana supreme court vacated the opinion of the indiana court of appeals and clarified that a standard cgl policy does cover damage to a home structure resulting from shoddy subcontractor work unless the subcontractor work was intentionally faulty.id.at.
because the precedential landscape has changed,the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of ohio casualty must be reversed,and the case remanded for reconsideration in light of sheehan.we leave the application of any exclusions or limitations in the policy,as well as any other state law doctrines,for the district court on remand.
b.the cincinnati ins
