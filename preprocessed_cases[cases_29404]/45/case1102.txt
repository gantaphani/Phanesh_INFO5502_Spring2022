the card shop,along with all of the other tenants of the minges brook mall,was also required by the lease to pay a proportionate share of minges creek cost of maintaining and insuring the common areas of the mall.minges creek insurance policy covering the common areas was issued by chubb.
the underlying accident that gave rise to the insurance dispute in this case occurred in march of when peggy lampert,a customer of the card shop,slipped and fell on ice while walking to her car from the store.lampert sued minges creek,the card shop,and a snow removal contractor in michigan state court.her complaint alleged as follows

the state trial court dismissed the card shop from lampert suit because the card shop did not legally possess the sidewalk area where the fall occurred.minges creek was found to have exclusive dominion and control over maintaining the entire parking area including the sidewalks in front of the off card shop.following the card shop dismissal,minges creek settled the lawsuit with lampert for.chubb,as minges creek insurer,covered this cost as well as the expense of defending against lampert claim.
