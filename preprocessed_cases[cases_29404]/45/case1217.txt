on february,ryan bemis,an illinois chiropractor,filed a class action in the illinois state court.on february,seven days later,the class action fairness act of became effective.four years later,on march,the state court granted class certification.on april,the safeco insurance company of america sica and safeco insurance company of illinois sici collectively hereinafter referred to as safeco or petitioners removed the action to the district court,but the district court granted bemis motion to remand the action to the state court.safeco then filed this petition for permission to appeal under c.we grant the petition for leave to appeal and,for the following reasons,affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.the parties and the allegations 
bemis filed this action in illinois state court,alleging that safeco had employed a computerized bill payment program to underpay systematically claims made under automobile insurance policies.the introductory paragraph of the complaint established the gravamen of the action this is a case about a scheme by sica and sici collectively,defendants or safeco and its safeco insurer affiliates such as american states to mislead and improperly reduce payouts under medical payments coverage by using biased third party bill audit software programs to adjust those medical expense claims.the complaint alleged three causes of action based on state law breach of contract violation of various illinois consumer fraud statutes and unjust enrichment.the only named defendants were sica and sici.the complaint further explained that the suit was brought as a class action on behalf of 
all insured persons and licensed medical providers who a submitted medical claims to a safeco member company pursuant to a safeco insurance policy b had their claim submitted to computer review,sic c received or were tendered an amount less than the submitted medical expenses and sic d received or were tendered an amount less than the stated policy limits.
sica and sici are both wholly owned subsidiaries of safeco corporation,which,in turn,is wholly owned by a holding company.the ultimate owner is liberty mutual group.sica adjusts claims for some other companies owned by safeco.sici only adjusts its own claims.it appears that,at all relevant times,sica adjusted claims for at least five other safeco corporation companies 
in october,safeco corporation acquired american states financial corporation,the corporate parent of six other insurance companies prior to the acquisition,the american states companies were competitors of the safeco companies.sica did not begin to adjust claims made under policies issued by the american states companies until december at the earliest.
proceedings in the state and federal courts 
the state court initially dismissed count i of the complaint breach of contract because of insufficient evidence that the rights under the contract had been assigned to bemis,but granted leave to amend.bemis then filed a first amended complaint that contained the required assignment as an exhibit,but safeco concedes that,in all other material respects,this pleading was identical to the initial complaint.later,bemis voluntarily dismissed the consumer fraud and unjust enrichment causes of action only the breach of contract claim remains.
on march,long after the effective date of the class action fairness act of,stat.cafa,bemis sought,and was granted,class certification.the state court certified a class of 
all persons insured by safeco property and casualty insurance companies in states and their assignee medical providers,who 
a during the period from january,to the date of this order,submitted one or more claims for payment of medical expenses pursuant to an automobile policy medical payments coverage 
b had their claim s adjusted and reviewed by computer bill review software incorporating ingenix mdr modules and 
c received or were tendered payment in an amount less than the submitted medical expenses due to charges purportedly exceeding the usual,customary or reasonable amount based on the ingenix mdr modules.
safeco then removed the action to the district court.the notice of removal explained that removal was premised on our decision in knudsen liberty mutual insurance,cir knudsen ii,which had held that a certified class definition that adds new claims which do not relate back to the original complaint may commence a new action for purposes of removal jurisdiction under cafa.bemis moved to remand,maintaining that no new action was commenced because the class definition related back to the initial complaint.he contended that the original complaint had provided notice that the claims were based on safeco role in adjusting the policies of the safeco affiliates.
the district court granted the motion to remand.noting that cafa grant of subject matter jurisdiction is available only for actions commenced after cafa effective date,february,the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction in its view,the certified class definition related back to the complaint.applying illinois rule,ilcs b,the court concluded that sica and sici were on notice that bemis intended to hold them liable for their role in the adjustment of claims based on the policies of affiliate companies prior to the effective date of cafa.in ruling that the new claims commenced by the class certification related back to the original complaint,the court pointed to the language of the complaint and to several instances in the state court record.the district court concluded that it is disingenuous for safeco to pretend that prior to the state court grant of class certification it had no reason to believe that bemis intended to try to hold it liable for the acts of affiliated companies.bemis safeco ins.of america,civil,wl,at.july.accordingly,the district court remanded the action to the state court.
safeco then sought leave to appeal the district court remand ruling under c.
discussion 
we review remands based on jurisdictional defects de novo the burden of persuasion rests with the party asserting federal jurisdiction.see hart fedex ground package,cir boyd phoenix funding,cir.
safeco contends that this action is removable under cafa because the class certification definition adds claims that do not relate back to the original complaint,see knudsen ii,and the class certification changed the scope of safeco potential liability from what it had been.see marshall h r block tax,cir.
removal of actions from state to federal court is governed by.that statute provides that,except as otherwise provided,any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction,may be removed by the defendant or the defendants,to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.a.under cafa,federal courts have jurisdiction over cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds million,the class contains at least members,and,as relevant here,any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d a,d b.the district court found that there are more than class members,that the amount in controversy exceeds million exclusive of interest and costs and that bemis is a citizen of illinois,while sica is a citizen of the state of washington.neither party suggests that the district court clearly erred in finding these jurisdictional facts,and our own examination of the record has not revealed any reason to question these findings.
as the district court recognized,cafa is not retroactive.exxon mobil allapattah,d see also,stat.the amendments made by this act shall apply to any civil action commenced on or after february.oshana,cir.this action was filed before its effective date.therefore,removal under cafa is permissible only if the class certification order constitutes the commencement of a new action for cafa purposes.
we have held,in consonance with all other circuits to have addressed the question,save one,that events occurring after a complaint is filed may constitute the commencement of a new action for cafa purposes
