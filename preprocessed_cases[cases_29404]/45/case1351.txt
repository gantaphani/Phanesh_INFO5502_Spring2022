this diversity suit for breach of a suretyship contract,decided in favor of the defendants after a bench trial,presents questions primarily relating to the doctrine of novation,but more broadly to principles of contract interpretation all the questions are governed by the common law of indiana.
in defendant vigo purchased buck creek coal,which operated a coal mine and was required by both federal and state law to post reclamation bonds as a condition of being permitted to operate the mine.a.in connection with the purchase,vigo,joined by defendant atlas and by the owners of vigo and atlas the koesters and the piepers,respectively,who are also defendants and by buck creek coal,signed a general indemnity agreement.in it they agreed to indemnify utica insurance company for any losses that utica might incur from issuing reclamation bonds to the indiana state government on behalf of buck creek.the following year another general indemnity agreement was signed,identical to the first,except that the only signers were defendant schulties,who had not signed the previous agreement,and the piepers who,remember,are atlas owners.pieper signed both individually and as president and because of his having thus signed in his official capacity,as it were,as an agent apparently authorized to bind his principal,the district judge ruled that atlas was bound by the second agreement,winkler reed sons,city of gary conat,dfs secured healthcare receivables trust caregivers great lakes,cir indiana law.atlas has not challenged that ruling,even though it appears from the agreement that pieper actually was signing in his capacity as president of buck creek,not of atlas.so atlas is bound and to simplify our opinion we shall assume that atlas and schulties were the signers of the second agreement and vigo and atlas the signers of the first in other words,we ignore not only the district court unchallenged error but also the companies owners.with this simplification,the case becomes utica versus vigo.
the surety bonds were later forfeited that is,buck creek proving unable to fulfill its reclamation obligations,the state required the surety,utica,to do the reclamation.utica then brought this suit,against all the signers of either agreement,for reimbursement of the the reclamation.
the district court concluded that the signers of the indemnity agreement were off the hook except atlas,since it had signed the second agreement as well because the second agreement was a novation,that is,a replacement of the first agreement,which therefore released the obligors in that agreement.ssd control technology breakthrough technologies,rose acre farms,cone,t n pennsylvania ins.guaranty ass n,cir restatement second of contracts,comment b,supp.allan farnsworth,farnsworth on contracts,ed williston on contracts ed,richard lord ed.but the judge also turned down these defendants counterclaim,in which they sought to recover the attorneys fees that they had incurred in defending against utica claim.
unable to recover its entire loss from the signers of the agreement atlas and latter now bankrupt,and seeking therefore to enforce the agreement against vigo,utica challenges the finding that the agreement was a novation.
the agreement does not describe itself as a novation or a substitute,or purport to release the signers of the first agreement.the only clue in the agreements themselves that the second one might be a novation is that atlas signed both,and if the only purpose of the second was to add an indemnitor,namely schulties,why did atlas sign it,having signed the identical first agreement,unless that was the purpose,and the second agreement replaced rather than supplemented the first additional evidence,that is,evidence beyond the two agreements themselves,was presented at the trial,and that evidence,together with the anomaly we just noted,persuaded the judge that the second agreement was indeed a novation.
that evidence revealed the following.in,vigo sold the coal mine to atlas and schulties and they agreed to use their best efforts to replace the existing reclamation bonds and obtain a release of vigo liability under those bonds.they failed to do so,but an insurance agent named jones submitted a reclamation bonding application to utica,proposing to transfer these bonds over and have new indemnity agreements signed by chuck schulties.there was no mention of vigo.the agent testified that the reason vigo was left off the second agreement was that it and its owners,who had signed the agreement,had no ownership,they had no control,they were not party to running the company.asked at trial whether vigo omission from the agreement was confirmatory of the conversations that you had with utica gerald swarthout,who handled the negotiations leading up to the agreement that they would not be indemnitors,the agent replied of course,they were selling.
swarthout gave contrary testimony,but the district judge disbelieved it,in part because schulties had at the time substantial assets.that fact,together with his substantial expertise in coal mining,suggested that an indemnity agreement signed by him as well as by atlas would provide sufficient security to persuade utica or some other insurance company to issue new reclamation bonds to replace those that utica had issued.for although the general indemnity agreement whether the or the version,since they were identical except for the signers embraced replacement bonds,it was terminable by an indemnitor on days notice.and therefore as part of vigo sale of the coal mine to atlas and schulties,atlas and vigo could have withdrawn from the agreement and atlas and schulties,with a net worth between them of million,could have persuaded utica or some other insurance company to issue new surety bonds that vigo,having withdrawn from the agreement,would not have been a guarantor of.utica does not deny that its bonds could have been replaced in this fashion.
the consequence of replacing the bonds would have been to release vigo.but given schulties financial wherewithal and mining expertise,and vigo natural reluctance to remain a guarantor of performance over which,as a result of the sale,it would no longer have any control,the judge was on solid ground in finding that utica would have agreed to an express novation rather than lose to another insurance company a business relationship that yielded it significant premiums a year in exchange for assuming what seemed at the time a modest risk.modest because underground coal mines buck creek mine was an underground mine tend to require less expense to restore the surface after the mine is exhausted than strip mines and because two parties,atlas and schulties,had agreed to indemnify utica for any loss.
the judge reconstruction of the parties conclusion that they intended the second agreement to substitute for rather than supplement the not clearly erroneous.on the contrary,it makes commercial,economic,and common sense and good sense,or such synonyms as commercial reasonableness,provides sound guidance for interpreting ambiguous contracts,in indiana as elsewhere.soames young oil,gates,beanstalk group,am general,cir indiana law morin building products,baystone construction,cir ditto xco int l pacific scientific,cir outlet embroidery derwent mills,cardozo.as judge boudin explained recently,agreements,especially commercial arrangements,are designed to make sense.if one reading produces a plausible result for which parties might be expected to bargain,that reading has a strong presumption in its favor as against another reading producing an unlikely result,windfall gains,conditions that can not be satisfied,dubious incentives.national tax institute,topnotch at stowe resort spa,cir.
the difficult question is whether the district judge was entitled to take mine underground,as it than to stay on the semantic surface of the two agreements.a finding of novation is dynamite,as this case illustrates.instead of supplementing a previous contract,it wipes it out.parties that enter into multiple contracts with one another want protection against a trial that may convert a contract that says nothing about novation or release into a release of the
