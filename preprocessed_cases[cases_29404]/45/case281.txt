background 
cichocki,who has a high school education,was years old when she filed for disability insurance benefits on april.after the commissioner denied her application,she filed a written request for a hearing,which was held on january,and at which cichocki,represented by counsel,testified.cichocki worked from to as a nurse aide or home health aide but stated at the hearing that she could no longer lawfully work in this capacity from to,cichocki held various positions,working as a supermarket cashier and bakery clerk,and also working for a janitorial company and a temporary employment agency.cichocki has no record of employment since october,when she suffered a seizure at her buffalo,new york home and received emergency care at buffalo mercy hospital before returning home later that day.
based on his determination that cichocki was not disabled,as defined in the ssa,the alj issued a decision denying cichocki claim in may.employing the evaluation process set out in a,the alj found at step one that cichocki was not engaged in substantial gainful activity and,at step two,that she suffered from impairments,including a seizure disorder,back pain,and bipolar disorder.the alj determined that cichocki had severe impairments,as defined in the act,consisting of a history of seizure activity and mild degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and mild facet arthropathy.he determined that cichocki bipolar disorder did not constitute a severe impairment under the ssa because cichocki had experienced no episodes of decompensation of extended duration and had only mild limitations as to her activities of daily living and social functioning,as well as concentration,persistence,or pace.see a d.
as relevant here,the alj found at step three that cichocki impairments did not meet or medically equal the specified criteria of any listed impairment,so that a finding of disability was not permitted at step three.as a result,the alj undertook a step four assessment,which focuses on whether,despite a disability claimant severe impairments,the claimant possesses the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work.perez,at.
at step four,the alj determined that cichocki was able to perform light work as defined in b,that she could occasionally be exposed to extreme heat or cold,but that she could never work at unprotected heights or around mechanical parts,and never operate a motor vehicle in a work environment.the alj assessment did not explicitly analyze cichocki abilities on a basis.see ssr,wl,at july.discussing the limitations relied upon by cichocki,however,the alj noted that cichocki seizures are transient in nature and by november were considered nearly completely controlled by medication.the alj referenced the report of one of cichocki treating physicians,mclean,who found the claimant able to pounds continuously and up to pounds occasionally,sit for six hours,stand for four hours and walk for three hours in an workday,as well as occasionally climb stairs and ramps,stoop,kneel,and crouch.the alj also recited cichocki own observations as to her daily activities 
in a daily activities questionnaire the claimant said that her typical activities included doing whatever chores needed to be done that day,walking her dogs,going to scheduled appointments,watching television,reading,preparing meals,cleaning her house,doing laundry,and weeding and other yard work.she enjoyed bird watching.she said she got out often,but did not drive due to seizure activity that was still under investigation.with regard to exertional ability,the claimant stated that she had no difficulties kneeling,climbing stairs,standing,walking or sitting.
given the alj conclusion that cichocki could perform light work with the restrictions he specified,the alj found that cichocki would be capable of performing two of her past jobs including,as relevant here,the job of bakery clerk,and was thus not disabled.
the appeals council denied cichocki request for review on august.on september,cichocki commenced this action.in granting the commissioner motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing the case,the district court held that substantial evidence supports the alj determination that cichocki is not disabled within the meaning of the act.cichocki astrue,civ,wl july.relevant here,the district court held that remand was not required even though the alj did not conduct a analysis as part of his step four rfc determination.cichocki subsequently filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
when deciding an appeal from a denial of disability benefits,we focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court opinion.kohler astrue,cir quoting curry apfel,cir.we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine if there is substantial evidence,considering the record as a whole,to support the commissioner decision and if the correct legal standards have been applied.id.at quoting shaw carter,cir see also g the findings of the commissioner of social security as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.the claimant has the general burden of proving that he or she has a disability within the meaning of the act,and bears the burden of proving his or her case at steps one through four of the sequential framework established in the ssa regulations.burgess astrue,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
as relevant here,cichocki argues that the alj failure to conduct an explicit analysis in concluding,at step four,that she was able to return to her past work as a bakery clerk is a per se error requiring remand.for the following reasons,we disagree.
a claimant is disabled and entitled to disability insurance benefits if she is unable to to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.if a claimant has a severe impairment limiting her mental or physical ability to do basic work activities but not constituting a listed impairment in appendix of the social security regulations,the commissioner asks,at step four,whether,despite the claimant severe impairment,he or she has residual functional capacity to perform her past work.shaw chater,cir citing dechirico callahan,cir.social security ruling provides that an individual rfc is an assessment of an individual ability to do sustained physical and mental activities in a work setting on a regular and continuing basis.ssr,wl,at july.
