procedural history 
in its action against steadfast and liberty,federal asserted causes of action for declaratory relief,equitable subrogation,and indemnity.federal alleged that steadfast and liberty issued the insured defendants in the sterling action primary insurance policies that required a defense in that action whereas federal issued the defendants excess and umbrella insurance policies and owed no duty until the steadfast and liberty policy limits were exhausted steadfast and liberty respective policies defined personal injury to include wrongful eviction,wrongful entry,and the invasion of the right of private occupancy the allegations in the sterling action gave rise to a potential for personal injury coverage under steadfast and liberty policies thus,it was steadfast and liberty duty to defend the insured defendants in the sterling action.when steadfast and liberty failed to defend the insured defendants in the sterling action,federal provided a defense under a reservation of rights.federal sought from steadfast and liberty recovery of the it expended in defense costs.
steadfast brought a against federal and liberty for declaratory relief,equitable indemnity,equitable contribution,and equitable subrogation.steadfast contended that it did not owe insurance coverage to the insured defendants in the sterling action and that federal had a duty to defend and indemnify the sterling defendants.steadfast asserted that federal was obligated to indemnify and reimburse steadfast for amounts it spent in defending and indemnifying the sterling defendants.steadfast further alleged that if it had a duty to defend,liberty also had a duty to defend and that defense costs should be apportioned among the insurers.
steadfast filed a motion for summary adjudication seeking a determination that federal and liberty had a duty to defend the insured defendants in the sterling action steadfast was entitled to judgment on its equitable subrogation and equitable contribution causes of action and steadfast did not owe damages to federal,but steadfast was entitled to damages from federal.steadfast contended that federal had a duty to defend in the sterling action because the sterling action consisted of a single cause of action for discrimination federal policies defined personal injury as including discrimination,harassment or segregation based on a person age,color,national origin,race,religion or sex and steadfast policy did not provide coverage for discrimination claims.with respect to liberty duty to defend,steadfast argued that it and liberty had issued insurance policies with near identical terms,and thus,if liberty did not have a duty to defend in the sterling action,then steadfast also did not have a duty to defend,but,if steadfast had a duty to defend in the sterling action,then liberty also had a duty to defend.if all three insurers had a duty to defend,steadfast argued,then the trial court should apportion the defense costs among the insurers taking into consideration each insurer policy limits and the period for which each insurer provided coverage.
federal filed a motion for summary judgment.federal asserted that the government contentions that the sterling defendants created a hostile environment for some of their tenants amounted to a claim of constructive eviction,thus falling under the coverages for wrongful eviction,wrongful entry,and invasion of the right of private occupancy in the steadfast and liberty policies.accordingly,federal argued,as primary insurers,steadfast and liberty had a duty to defend in the sterling action,and federal did not have a duty to defend under its excess coverage because neither steadfast nor liberty had informed federal that steadfast or liberty had exhausted its policy limits.federal contended that it did not have a duty to defend under its umbrella coverage because its duty to defend did not attach where,as here,another insurer had a duty to defend.liberty also filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication,contending that it had no duty to provide a defense in the sterling action because the sterling action concerned discrimination claims,its policies did not provide discrimination coverage,and there was no coverage for an intentional act.
the trial court ruled that neither steadfast nor liberty had a duty to defend in the sterling action because the complaint in that action did not create a potential for covered liability as all allegations concerned discrimination and no allegations concerned wrongful eviction,wrongful entry,or invasion of the right to private occupancy.the trial court reasoned that the action by the united states against the sterling defendants was specifically framed under the statutory provisions of section and federal failed to show how claims for wrongful eviction or invasion of the right of private occupancy were potential claims the united states could have asserted in the sterling action.accordingly,the trial court denied federal motion for summary judgment.it granted liberty motion for summary judgment and found moot liberty motion for summary adjudication.the trial court partially granted steadfast motion for summary adjudication.the trial court held that federal and not steadfast or liberty had a duty to defend in the sterling action,that steadfast was entitled to judgment against federal on its equitable subrogation and equitable contribution causes of action,and that steadfast not only had no obligation to federal but was entitled to damages from federal.the trial court found moot steadfast claims that liberty had a duty to defend in the sterling action and that steadfast was entitled to damages from liberty.as for damages,the trial court found a triable issue of fact concerning the amount steadfast expended in defending the sterling defendants.pursuant to a stipulated judgment,the parties agreed that steadfast expended in defense fees and costs and paid to settle the sterling action.
discussion 
federal contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment,partially granting steadfast motion for summary adjudication,and granting liberty motion for summary judgment.federal argues that the housing discrimination allegations in the sterling action,in effect,constituted claims for wrongful eviction,wrongful entry,and invasion of the right of private occupancy and thus gave rise
