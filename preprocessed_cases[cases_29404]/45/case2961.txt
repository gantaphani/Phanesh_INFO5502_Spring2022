the panduro action

rosa and jocelyn panduro sued santa marta,county,and others in october for medical malpractice relating to the prenatal care,delivery,and postnatal care the panduro action.county initially retained counsel who filed an answer on santa marta behalf,but county then declined to provide a further defense based on its contention that it had not referred panduro to santa marta and therefore had no duty to indemnify or defend santa marta under the agreement.santa marta then tendered its defense to truck under the policy.truck accepted the tender and provided a defense.during the panduro action,truck sought reimbursement from county for santa marta defense costs,but county refused.county paid its own defense costs in panduro and did not tender its defense to truck under the policy at any time before the entry of judgment.

county and truck subsequently both moved for summary judgment on the complaint.county moved,inter alia,on the grounds that it was an additional insured under the policy and that truck was not entitled to subrogation against its own insured.county argued that the policy potentially covered its liability in panduro,that truck therefore had a duty to defend county in panduro,and that truck was not entitled to reimbursement from county of santa marta defense costs in the same action.according to county,for truck to obtain reimbursement from county for the defense costs of another insured in the same action would be inequitable.county maintained that the fact that it did not tender its defense to truck before the entry of judgment in panduro did not alter its status as truck insured or negate truck duty to defend county.
truck moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it had paid for santa marta defense costs in panduro,that county was primarily liable for santa marta defense costs as indemnitor under the agreement and as the wrongdoer with respect to the panduros,and that county status as an additional insured did not defeat truck right to subrogation.truck argued that the panduro jury had found that county was directly liable to the panduros for its own negligence and that santa marta was not negligent,county negligence had caused santa marta to incur defense costs in panduro,the additional insured endorsement did not extend coverage to county liability for its own negligence,and county status as an additional insured did not defeat its right to subrogation because county liability for santa marta defense costs was not a liability within county coverage.it argued further that the duty to defend does not arise until a tender is made,and that at the time that county tendered its defense to truck there was no potential for coverage because the panduro jury had found that county was directly liable and not vicariously liable.since a duty to defend or indemnify county never arose,truck argued,it owed no duty to county in connection with panduro and therefore was entitled to subrogation against county.
the trial court determined that the plaintiffs allegations in the panduro action were within the scope of county coverage under the truck policy.it stated that truck would have had the duty to defend county if county had tendered its defense during the panduro action,that county therefore had the status of an additional insured regardless of the ultimate result at trial,and that truck may not sue its own insured for subrogation.paul fire marine ins.murray plumbing heating d.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment for county,denied truck summary judgment motion,and entered judgment in favor of county.truck appeals.
contentions 
truck contends county is liable for santa marta defense costs under the agreement and equitably should bear all of those defense costs because county caused santa marta to incur them.truck also contends county status as an additional insured under the truck policy does not defeat truck right to equitable subrogation because county liability for santa marta defense costs was not a liability within county coverage under the policy.truck maintains that the court erroneously granted summary judgment for county and that truck is entitled to summary judgment.
county contends truck is not entitled to equitable subrogation because the equities do not favor truck and county did not cause santa marta to incur the defense costs.county also contends county liability for santa marta defense costs was a liability within county coverage,and even if that liability was not within county coverage,truck had a duty to defend county in panduro based on the plaintiffs other allegations in that action.in either circumstance,county argues,truck has no subrogation right against its own insured.

equitable subrogation 
the essential elements of an insurer cause of action for equitable subrogation are as follows a the insured suffered a loss for which the defendant is liable,either as the wrongdoer whose act or omission caused the loss or because the defendant is legally responsible to the insured for the loss caused by the wrongdoer b the claimed loss was one for which the insurer was not primarily liable c the insurer has compensated the insured in whole or in part for the same loss for which the defendant is primarily liable d the insurer has paid the claim of its insured to protect its own interest and not as a volunteer e the insured has an existing,assignable cause of action against the defendant which the insured could have asserted for its own benefit had it not been compensated for its loss by the insurer f the insurer has suffered damages caused by the act or omission upon which the liability of the defendant depends g justice requires that the loss be entirely shifted from the insurer to the defendant,whose equitable position is inferior to that of the insurer and h the insurer damages are in a liquidated sum,generally the amount paid to the insured.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.
equitable subrogation by an insurer against an insured 
an insurer has no right of equitable subrogation against its own insured with respect to a loss or liability for which the insured is covered under the policy because,as between the insurer and the insured,the insurer assumes responsibility for the loss or liability.for the insurer to recover from its insured for an insured loss or liability would undermine the insured coverage and would be inequitable.if the policy does not cover the insured for a particular loss or liability,however,it would neither undermine the insured coverage nor be inequitable to impose the loss or liability on the insured if the insured caused or was otherwise responsible for the loss or liability.although no prior california opinion clearly articulates this rule,the following cases illustrate our point.
home insurance company pinski brothers,involved two insurers who the parties agreed were one and the same entity insurer.the insurer had paid the insured hospital property damage claim arising from a boiler explosion and sought equitable subrogation against the architects based on negligence.the architects tendered their defense to their liability insurer,which was the same entity as the plaintiff insurer.the court had determined in another action that the alleged negligence was within the architects liability coverage.at.it now held that the insurer could not be subrogated to a claim against its insured,the architects,for a liability for which the insured was covered under the policy.id.at.it stated that to allow subrogation in those circumstances would be inequitable,undermine the insured coverage,and create a potential conflict of interest.ibid.
pennsylvania ins.austin powder,involved the explosion of a rented truck carrying dynamite and blasting caps.the rental company automobile insurance policy covered the renter and driver as additional insureds.the owner of another vehicle sued the rental company,renter,and driver for damages to his vehicle.the insurer settled the claim on behalf of the rental company and then,in the name of the rental company,against the renter and driver for equitable subrogation based on contractual indemnity,at.the court held that an insurer may not be subrogated to a claim against its own insured,at least when the claim arises from an incident for which the insurer policy covers that insured citations.id.at.it stated that an insurer can not be allowed to impose an insured loss on the insured,and noted a potential conflict of interest that may cause the insurer to defend a claim less vigorously if the insurer could impose liability for the claim on its insured.id.at.
paul fire marine ins.murray plumbing heating d.applied the same principle to first party property insurance.the court held that where a builder risk policy covered the contractor and subcontractors for damage to property used in the construction,the insurer could not be equitably subrogated to the contractor claims for damages against the subcontractors.id.at,citing home insurance company pinski brothers,supra.the insurer had paid an aggregate amount to the contractor,who had distributed part of that amount to the subcontractors to compensate each for its own property loss.in concluding that the subcontractors were insured under the policy for the loss in question,the court did not distinguish between each subcontractor coverage for loss to its own property and each subcontractor coverage for its liability for loss to the contractor property,such as a liability policy would provide.murray plumbing,supra,d at.the court apparently concluded that since the policy covered the contractor and subcontractors collectively for the same risks of lo
