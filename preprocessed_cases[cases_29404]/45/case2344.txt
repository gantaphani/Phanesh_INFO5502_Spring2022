introduction 
plaintiff tenet healthsystem desert,hospital appeals from a judgment entered in favor of defendants blue cross of california,doing business as anthem blue cross blue cross,anthem blue cross life and health insurance company bc life,and anthem um services,anthem um hospital sued anthem,as well as eisenhower medical center eisenhower and keenan associates keenan,when the defendants refused to pay approximately for the cost of medical services that hospital provided to an insured patient following extensive communications with anthem over a period of approximately days regarding authorization for the services.the defendants ultimately denied coverage for the medical services based on an exclusion in the patient policy for injuries sustained as a result of having a blood alcohol level over the legal limit.hospital alleged that anthem continuing to authorize medical services during the patient stay at hospital,even after anthem was made aware that the patient was admitted with a blood alcohol level far exceeding the legal limit,constituted a misrepresentation as to coverage,on which hospital relied in providing care to the patient.
the trial court entered judgment for anthem after sustaining,without leave to amend,anthem demurrer to hospital third amended complaint tac with respect to the causes of action alleged against anthem the trial court determined that the tac lacked the necessary specificity to survive a demurrer.
we conclude that the trial court erred.the tac alleges facts with sufficient particularity to overcome a demurrer.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
a patient patient x was treated in hospital acute care facility after an automobile accident that occurred in the days prior to may,patient x had a member identification card,which identifie d that the patient has health care coverage through a plan sponsored by eisenhower.patient x member identification card identified bc life and keenan as eisenhower authorized agent s and administrator s of eisenhower plan,and further identified blue cross as eisenhower and bc life authorized agent and administrator who administers claims under eisenhower plan on behalf of bc life.
according to the allegations of the tac,anthem,eisenhower and keenan had an agreement under which the anthem entities and keenan would act as eisenhower agent in order to perform all of the administrative services on behalf of eisenhower health plan erisa trust,which provides health care benefits for employees of eisenhower medical center and their family members,a group to which we infer,based on the allegations of the tac,patient x belonged.these administrative services are alleged to include all communications and direct dealings with providers,such as the hospital,including but not limited to verification of eligibility,benefits and authorization of services negotiating with providers,such as the hospital,concerning any matters including the entering into revisions to contracts pricing claims in accordance with the terms of the plan documents and summary plan description producing member identification cards conducting utilization review processing authorizations of services and responding to providers requests for such authorizations and coordination and management of medical care through case management.
hospital alleges that all of the defendants had actual knowledge of the terms of the plan coverage,including exclusions.further,hospital notes that it does not and could not possibly maintain information regarding all exclusions from coverage for the tens if not hundreds of thousands of health insurance plans that cover the patients the hospital treats each year 
hospital specifically alleges that there exists a trade custom and usage that,to the extent that a health plan and its administrators have information indicating that services are not covered under the plan,the health plan and its administrators do not authorize such services.according to the operative pleading,the trade usage and custom is that an authorization of services constitutes an affirmative representation that,based on all of the information the health plan has been provided to date,the services are covered.italics added.even more specifically,hospital alleges that there had been a course of dealing between the hospital and all the defendants such that,to the extent that the defendants have information indicating that services are not covered under the plan,the defendants do not authorize such services.accordingly,at all times mentioned there has existed a course of dealing between the hospital and the defendants that an authorization of services constitutes an affirmative representation that,based on all of the information the health plan has been provided to date,the services are covered.this course of dealing is,and at all times mentioned has been,certain and uniform,of general continuity and well known to the hospital and to the defendants.
the operative pleading alleges that a representative of hospital called,which is the telephone number that was provided on patient x member identification card as the number to call for pre authorization,and which is a number that hospital was informed and believes is answered by individuals who are the agents of eisenhower and the employees and agents of anthem and keenan.
on the morning of may,a hospital admissions assistant called the number and spoke with aileen to provide notice that patient x had been admitted to the acute care hospital within hospital for services.aileen gave the hospital admissions assistant reference number and requested that the hospital fax a clinical review of the patient medical condition to.aileen possessed certain private information about patient x,such as his name and date of birth,that she and anthem and keenan would not have had if they were not agents of eisenhower.in addition,hospital was informed and believed that anthem and keenan hold out fax number as a number they use to communicate with providers regarding information necessary to authorize care and make coverage determinations on behalf of eisenhower.
that afternoon,a hospital case manager faxed to the number aileen had provided a clinical review of the patient medical condition as of the date of service may.the clinical summary included information that patient x had been brought to the emergency room by ambulance after having been in a motor vehicle accident in which he was an unrestrained driver,and that he had tested positive for cannabis and a blood alcohol level etoh for ethyl alcohol of.
on the morning of may,hospital representatives attempted to verify patient x benefit summary through a web site maintained by anthem,on behalf of eisenhower.the web site did not disclose the existence of an exclusion for services for injuries sustained as a result of a participant driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.
anthem repeatedly requested clinical information pertaining to patient x over the course of a period.between may and june,anthem authorized patient x icu treatment,in writing,on at least occasions.many of the authorization letters included letterhead and documents containing the defendants trademarks.for example,on may,hospital received a telephone call and a letter via fax from an unnamed case manager employed by anthem.the case manager authoriz ed hospital to admit patient x and to provide medical services to him at the icu level of care.the letter identified the case manager as an employee of anthem,identified that the fax was sent on anthem behalf,and included private information about the patient that an individual would not have possessed if he or she were not an agent of anthem.the letter did not advise hospital that patient x plan excluded coverage for services provided to treat injuries sustained when a plan participant was driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit,nor did the case manager inform hospital of this fact over the telephone.
on or about may,hospital received a letter via fax from an unnamed case manager for anthem authorizing services for patient x through may in the icu.this letter failed to identify that the plan had any exclusion from coverage applicable to injuries caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the patient was driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.
on or about may,hospital received a letter via fax from an unnamed case manager for anthem authorizing medical services for patient x through may in the icu.this correspondence did not identify a potentially applicable exclusion from coverage for the services.
on or about may,dionne myers,a case manager for anthem,corresponded with hospital admissions assistant patricia west.myers requested additional clinical information regarding patient x health status in order to determine whether additional medical treatment would be authorized.
no later than may,patient x case was referred to a discharge planner for anthem,nell steele alvarez.steele alvarez was to make arrangements for where patient x would go for rehabilitation after being discharged from the acute care hospital.steele alvarez was provided with clinical information regarding patient x,which she reviewed,and was aware that patient x injuries had resulted from a vehicle accident that occurred while he was driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.steele alvarez informed hospital case manager janet sobleskie that she was investigating acute rehab facilities where the patient would go when the patient was discharged from hospital acute care hospital.
later that day,hospital received another letter via fax from an unnamed case manager for anthem authorizing medical services for patient x in the icu through may.this correspondence did not inform hospital of the coverage exclusion for injuries sustained as a result of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level.
on may,hospital documented that it was not reviewing the patient account for potential alternative health care coverage because the existence of patient insurance coverage had been confirmed.
hospital received additional faxed letters from representatives of anthem on may,may,may,may,may,june,june two letters,and june,authorizing medical care for patient x in the icu.none of these letters informed hospital of the relevant exclusion.
in the meantime,anthem discharge planner steele alvarez telephoned hospital from telephone number on may and may to discuss with hospital case manager sobleskie the plan for patient x rehabilitation care after his discharge from the icu steele alvarez discussed with sobleskie patient x medical condition,clinical information,and discharge planning.on june,steele alvarez called hospital from the same telephone number and spoke with a nurse case manager regarding facilities where patient x could be sent pursuant to the terms of his coverage following his discharge from the icu.steele alvarez discussed patient x medical condition,the basis for his admission,the nature of his injuries,and discharge plans.
on june,steele alvarez,again calling from,spoke with hospital rehabilitation case manager robyn angeli.steele alvarez requested that patient x be admitted to hospital acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital upon his discharge from the icu,and authorized the admission.the operative pleading alleges that in engaging in this communication with angeli,steele alvarez was acting as the agent and employee of anthem,and that she was acting as the agent of eisenhower as well.
on june,hospital discharged patient x from the acute care hospital and,based on the representations by steele alvarez regarding authorization for patient x treatment in hospital acute rehabilitation facility,transferred and admitted patient x as an inpatient at its acute rehabilitation hospital.
on june,an unnamed case manager for anthem sent hospital a letter on anthem letterhead authorizing the provision of acute rehabilitation services to patient x through june.that same date,dionne myers spoke with a representative of hospital and verbally indicated that hospital provision of acute rehabilitation services to patient x was authorized under the terms of his plan until june.
the operative pleading alleges that anthem and the other defendants made these communications when they knew or should have known the clinical information previously provided by hospital,which specifically indicated that the patient was injured while driving in an automobile accident with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit and positive for cannabis,and that they knew or should have known of the exclusions from coverage,including for injuries caused by a motor vehicle accident in which the patient was driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit.as a result of a contractual agreement between eisenhower and anthem,anthem knew of and was in possession of the terms of patient x plan,including the exclusions from coverage.
in addition,the operative pleading alleges that all of the defendants falsely represented that the hospital acute rehabilitation hospital services it had provided,was providing,and would provide to the patient were covered under the patient plan and that the plan is financially responsible for paying for such services.the pleading further alleges that the representations made by the defendants were false,and that at the time the representations were made,the defendants had no reasonable ground for believing them to be true.the operative pleading alleges that the defendants made these misrepresentations that the services were authorized and covered with the intent to induce the hospital to act in reliance on them,or with the expectation that the hospital would so act.
hospital alleges that it was ignorant of the falsity of the representations made by the defendants,believed them to be true,and acted in reliance on them in admitting patient x to its acute rehabilitation facility and providing services to him there.
hospital was not informed of the existence of the exclusion for coverage in patient x plan for injuries sustained while drinking and driving until october,hospital contends that,as a result,hospital was denied payment for the more than days of services that hospital rendered to patient x in its icu and acute rehabilitation facility.in addition,because hospital was not informed of the coverage exclusion until late october,hospital was unable to seek reimbursement via medi cal because claims for medi cal must be submitted within days from the date the services were rendered.
procedural background 
hospital filed a complaint against anthem,eisenhower,and keenan alleging causes of action in june.after demurrers and amendments,hospital filed a second amended complaint sac in november.
anthem filed a demurrer to the sac,in which eisenhower and keenan joined.the trial court sustained this demurrer,as well,and granted hospital days leave to amend.the trial court acknowledged that in the first,second and third causes of action,hospital had identified several people by name.however,the court faulted hospital for failing to allege specifically who the persons with whom plaintiff spoke,work for or were representing,to whom the phone numbers belonged or who assigned the claim number.
hospital filed the tac in january.the page pleading outlines hospital interaction with individuals,over a period of approximately days,who held themselves out as representing anthem for purposes of reviewing and authorizing the medical care provided to patient x.the allegations in the tac include dates,times,the manner of communication,including correspondence,faxes and telephone calls,together with telephone and fax numbers utilized,the names of individuals and their titles,if known,the companies these individuals represented,and the factual basis for hospital belief that an agency relationship existed.in the tac,hospital pled causes of action against anthem for negligent misrepresentation fraud and deceit based on suppression of facts intentional fraud and unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section 
anthem filed a demurrer to the tac,and the trial court again ruled that hospital had failed to plead with the requisite specificity,and failed to set forth a single actual specific misrepresentation that was made by anthem that the patient was covered.the court references pages through of the tac in support of its conclusion that the tac lacked an allegation of a misrepresentation.the trial court sustained anthem demurrer with respect to hospital causes of action for negligent misrepresentation causes of action and,fraud based on suppression of facts causes of action and,and intentional fraud causes of action and.this time,the court denied leave to amend,except with regard to the unfair business practices cause of action cause of action,for which the court granted hospital an additional days in which to amend to attempt to plead that cause of action 
hospital elected not to file another amended pleading with respect to the unfair business practices cause of action,instead reserving its right to appeal the ruling on the demurrer to the tac.as a result,the trial court filed an order dismissing the action against anthem with prejudice,and entered judgment in favor of anthem in april.
hospital filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussiona.legal standards on appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend 
we apply the following law in reviewing a trial court order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend we independently review the ruling on a demurrer and determine de novo whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action.citation.we assume the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations,facts that reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded,and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.citation.we construe the pleading in a reasonable manner and read the allegations in context.fremont indemnity fremont general th,fremont.
when the trial court sustains a demurrer without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.blank kirwan cal d,blank.
anthem improperly relies on evidence not in the record throughout its briefing 
as an initial matter,we must address the impropriety of anthem reliance on certain evidence,throughout its response brief,in attempting to demonstrate that the trial court ruled correctly in sustaining its demurrer.anthem repeatedly refers to the contents of letters that it alleges are letters that it sent to hospital with respect to patient x care.anthem asks this court to look at what the writings actually stated when they conveyed to hospital the allegedly actionable misrepresentations,in an effort to demonstrate that the writings referred to in the tac show something quite different from the misimpression hospital has created by its incomplete and vague pleading tactics.
anthem request that this court look at what the writings actually stated is inappropriate.because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint,it can refer to matters outside the pleading only if those matters are subject to judicial notice.blank,supra,cal d at.
the letters at issue were not incorporated into the operative pleading,and the trial court declined to take judicial notice of the letters and thus did not consider them in ruling on anthem demurrers anthem does not argue on appeal that the trial court erred in denying anthem request for judicial notice.the letters are therefore not properly before this court on the basis that the trial court judicially noticed them.further,anthem does not properly request that this court take judicial notice of the documents independently.although anthem argues in its briefing on appeal that the letters are relevant to hospital claims and that this court may evaluate and judicially notice them,an argument raised in a response brief is insufficient to permit this court to take judicial of the evidence that is the subject of such argument.formatting omitted.if a party wants this court to take judicial notice of a matter,that party must file a motion seeking judicial notice in this court,as required by california rules of court,rule 
to obtain judicial notice by a reviewing court under evidence code section,a party must serve and file a separate motion with a proposed order.
the motion must state 
a why the matter to be noticed is relevant to the appeal 
b whether the matter to be noticed was presented to the trial court and,if so,whether judicial notice was taken by that court 
c if judicial notice of the matter was not taken by the trial court,why the matter is subject to judicial notice under evidence code section,or and 
d whether the matter to be noticed relates to proceedings occurring after the order or judgment that is the subject of the appeal.
anthem has not filed a separate motion that complies with these requirements.this,alone,would be a sufficient reason to reject anthem request that this court consider the contents of the letters however,even if anthem had properly requested that this court take judicial notice of the letters,we would have ruled in the same way that the trial court did.the letters that anthem seeks to introduce are not matters that are properly subject to judicial notice.
judicial notice may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or required by law.evid.code.matters that are subject to judicial notice are listed in evidence code sections and.a matter ordinarily is subject to judicial notice only if the matter is reasonably beyond dispute.fremont,supra,th at.neither the existence of the letters that anthem is relying on,nor the content of such letters,falls within any of the matters identified as those as to which judicial notice must be taken pursuant to evidence code section or matters identified as those as to which judicial notice may be taken pursuant to section 
the only arguable matter identified in the relevant evidence code provisions under which these letters could fall would be those matters identified in subdivision h of evidence code section facts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.however,letters that were ostensibly created by a party to the litigation regarding the subject of the litigation would appear to be the very epitome of items subject to dispute,as opposed to not reasonably subject to dispute,italics added.further,although the existence of a document,such as a document recorded in the official records of a government body,may be judicially noticeable,the truth of statements contained in the document and their proper interpretation are not subject to judicial notice.stormedia superior court cal th,fn.in ruling on a demurrer,a court may consider facts of which it has taken judicial notice.code civ,subd.a.this includes the existence of a document.when judicial notice is taken of a document,however,the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable.as a result,even if we were to conclude that it would be proper to take judicial notice of the existence of the letters to which anthem repeatedly cites,the existence of the letters would offer anthem no assistance in supporting its position that hospital tac fails to state any valid causes of action,since anthem position is premised on its own interpretation of the meaning of the letters 
because the evidence regarding the contents of these letters is not properly the subject of judicial notice and,in fact,no judicial notice has been taken of these letters by either the trial court or this court,the letters are not properly before us we will therefore ignore any and all references to these letters in anthem briefing on appeal.such letters do not,and can not,provide a basis for affirming the trial court ruling with respect to anthem demurrer 
intentional fraud causes of action and 
the elements of fraud,which give rise to the tort action for deceit,are a misrepresentation false representation,concealment,or nondisclosure b knowledge of falsity or scienter c intent to defraud,to induce reliance d justifiable reliance and e resulting damage.lazar superior court cal th,lazar.
in california,fraud must be pled specifically general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.citations.thus the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.citation.this particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,when,where,to whom,and by what means the representations were tendered.lazar,supra,cal th at.in addition,a plaintiff is held to a higher standard in asserting a fraud claim against a corporate defendant.in such a case,the plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations,their authority to speak,to whom they spoke,what they said or wrote,and when it was said or written.ibid.
the specificity requirement serves two purposes.the first is notice to the defendant,to furnish the defendant with certain definite charges which can be intelligently met.citations.the pleading of fraud,however,is also the last remaining habitat of the common law notion that a complaint should be sufficiently specific that the court can weed out nonmeritorious actions on the basis of the pleadings.thus the pleading should be sufficient to enable the court to determine whether,on the facts pleaded,there is any foundation,prima facie at least,for the charge of fraud.committee on children television,general foods cal d,committee on children television.
there exist,however,certain exceptions which mitigate the rigor of the rule requiring specific pleading of fraud.committee on children television,supra,cal d at.for example,less specificity is required of a complaint when it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy,citation e ven under the strict rules of common law pleading,one of the canons was that less particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the opposite party,italics added.
hospital has sufficiently met the pleading requirements for intentional fraud.first,hospital identifies multiple written and oral communications,made by the anthem entities and expressed to hospital,in which anthem authorized the services that hospital provided to patient x.as to a large number of communications,hospital alleges the dates,times,and the names of the individuals who initiated these communications,which occurred over a period of approximately days.moreover,hospital identifies at least one conversation between anthem discharge planner steele alvarez and a hospital representative in which steele alvarez,alleged to be an employee agent of one or more of the anthem defendants,not only authorized but specifically requested that hospital admit patient x to its acute rehabilitation facility upon his discharge from hospital icu.hospital has thus clearly pled facts that show how the statements were made directly to agents of hospital through telephone calls and written letters faxed to hospital when the statements were made on the identified dates and the specified times where the statements were made at hospital,where its representatives received the communications to whom the statements were made to identified hospital employees and the means by which they were made by way of telephone calls placed and letters faxed from numbers that are alleged to belong to defendants.see lazar,supra,cal th at pleading with particularity necessitates pleading that show s how,when,where,to whom,and by what means the representations were tendered.further,hospital alleged the identities of certain individuals acting as the agents of anthem,and further provided the basis for the allegation that such individuals had the authority to act on anthem behalf,including the fact that these individuals were originally reached through hospital call to the number provided on patient x member identification card,and that these individuals possessed private health and identifying information about patient x that they would not have been in possession of absent their relationship with anthem.
given the specificity of these numerous alleged communications,and given the allegation that the provision of an authorization has a specific meaning in this context,that an authorization of services constitutes an affirmative representation that the services are covered,hospital has sufficiently alleged the existence of multiple affirmative misrepresentations that the care that hospital rendered to patient x would be covered by his insurance plan.
in addition,the trial court failed to consider that a cause of action based in fraud may arise from conduct that is designed to mislead,and not only from verbal or written statements.see thrifty tel,bezenek th,a misrepresentation need not be oral it may be implied by conduct.universal by products,city of modesto d,a misrepresentation need not be express but may be implied by or inferred from the circumstances.hospital has alleged repeated engagement by anthem concerning the treatment of patient x,over a period of approximately days,including the initiation of communications with hospital staff and requests for information that would imply that the services authorized by anthem and provided to patient x by hospital were not only medically necessary,but were covered by patient x health insurance plan.if the services were not covered,anthem would have had no reason to continue to inquire about the medical necessity of the services and,in fact,according to the allegations of the complaint,the defendants would have been legally barred from requesting information regarding the patient for health care services that were not covered.thus,to the extent that the trial court believed that hospital had to allege that the defendants made an oral or written statement informing hospital that the services in question were covered by patient x health insurance plan in order to sufficiently allege a cause of action for fraud,the trial court was in error.
anthem suggests that hospital tac is insufficient because it does not identify each individual and defendant entity who is alleged to have engaged in communications with hospital regarding patient x care.to the extent that hospital may be relying on the communications it received from unnamed case managers at anthem,hospital provided sufficient information to permit anthem,the party with superior knowledge of who was responsible for preparing the documents in question,to identify the specific individual or individuals hospital is relieved from having to plead that particular information with specificity under such circumstances.see west jpmorgan chase bank,th,plaintiff was not required to plead the identity of the preparer of a letter from the chase fulfillment center because that information was uniquely within chase bank knowledge see also committee on children television,supra,cal d at less specificity is required in pleading fraud when it appears from the nature of the allegations that the defendant must necessarily possess full information concerning the facts of the controversy,italics added boschma home loan center,th,while the precise identities of the employees responsible are not specified in the loan instrument,defendants possess the superior knowledge of who was responsible for crafting these loan documents.
for this same reason,we reject anthem contentions that the allegations are not sufficiently detailed as to which defendant entity employed aileen or any other individual identified in the complaint,or which defendant entity maintained each telephone number and fax number identified in the complaint.this information is uniquely within the defendants knowledge.patient x member identification card listed a single telephone number for care providers to contact for purposes of obtaining pre authorization for care.hospital used the number that was provided on patient x card to seek authorization for his care.the defendants are the entities who decided what information to place on patient x member identification card.the defendants are also the ones who have decided which entity is responsible for the different tasks that are required to administer eisenhower health insurance plan.the mere fact that the nature of defendants relationships with each other and each entity particular role in conducting and administering the health insurance plan at issue are unclear,does not necessitate that a court permit them to escape any responsibility at the pleading stage of a lawsuit.hospital has alleged a number of very specific facts that provide the defendant entities,who possess superior knowledge of the relationships between and among them,to be able to defend against the claims that hospital asserts in its tac.these specific factual allegations,including the times that various communications occurred and the telephone or fax numbers used,are also sufficient to demonstrate that there is a prima facie foundation for hospital allegation of fraud.see committee on children television,supra,cal d at.
anthem attempts to avoid the framing of the complaint by arguing that hospital allegations that anthem authorized particular services for the patient do not constitute misrepresentations that the services would be covered,and not excluded.however,anthem position is based on its argument,both in the trial court and on appeal,that it provides no coverage for eisenhower plan benefits,and that its role was limited to providing utilization management and administrative services.however,according to the allegations of the tac,anthem,eisenhower and keenan had an agreement under which the anthem entities and keenan would act as eisenhower agents,performing all of the administrative services on behalf of eisenhower health plan erisa trust,which provides health care benefits for employees of eisenhower medical center and their family members.these administrative services are alleged to include all communications and direct dealings with providers,such as the hospital,including but not limited to verification of eligibility,benefits and authorization of services negotiating with providers,such as the hospital,concerning any matters including the entering into revisions to contracts pricing claims in accordance with the terms of the plan documents and summary plan description producing member identification cards conducting utilization review processing authorizations of services and responding to providers requests for such authorizations and coordination and management of medical care through case management.italics added.thus,the tac alleges that anthem role was,essentially,to administer eisenhower health plan on behalf of eisenhower,anthem was to act as eisenhower agent in implementing all aspects of the health plan,and to be the sole contact for entities such as hospital.in addition,the tac alleges that patient x member identification card identified one of the anthem entities,bc life,and keenan,as eisenhower authorized agent and administrator of eisenhower plan.the card further identified another anthem entity,blue cross,as the agent and administrator for eisenhower and bc life who administers claims under patient x plan.italics added.
beyond these allegations,the tac alleges that there has existed a trade custom and usage that,to the extent that a health plan and its administrators have information indicating that services are not covered under the plan,the health plan and its administrators do not authorize such services.thus,there has existed a trade custom and usage that an authorization of services constitutes an affirmative representation that,based on all of the information the health plan has been provided to date,the services are covered.italics added.
anthem assertions as to the limitations of anthem role in administering eisenhower health plan may or may not be true.however,these are factual questions that can not be determined on a demurrer to a pleading that contains allegations that conflict with anthem assertions in briefing in this court.further,anthem attempts to rely on evidence that it contends contradicts the allegations of the operative complaint,the contents of letters that we have determined are not the proper subject of judicial notice is improper at this procedural juncture.again,this matter was decided on a demurrer,which exists as a procedural mechanism to determine whether,if the allegations of the operative complaint are presumed to be true,the plaintiff has sufficiently stated a cause of action.it is not the appropriate procedural vehicle to argue the merits of the plaintiff allegations.
anthem attempt to rely on tenet healthsystem desert,fortis,ins.d,to argue that hospital allegations regarding trade usage,custom,and course of dealing should be ignored,is misplaced.if anything,tenet supports this court conclusion that this case was not appropriately decided on demurrer.in tenet,the federal court was considering a motion for summary judgment as a result,the district court decision in tenet was decided based on uncontroverted evidence that had been presented to the trial court,including declarations from representatives of both the plaintiff and defendant about the communications between them regarding the patient care,an admission by the plaintiff that it knew of no false,misleading,or untrue statements made by defendant in connection with the calls or at any other time and that defendant did not fail to provide it with any information id.at,as well as expert testimony regarding industry custom id.at,capitalization and boldface omitted,involving emergency room admissions.id.at.the conclusions reached by the trial court in tenet on a motion for summary judgment are simply of no assistance to anthem with respect to the questions raised by its demurrer to hospital complaint.
the tac also sufficiently alleges facts to support the elements of defendants knowledge of the falsity of the alleged misrepresentations,their intent to induce hospital reliance,as well as hospital justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentations.the tac alleges that knowledge of the plan coverage,including the exclusions,was,as between the parties,exclusively in the defendants possession,and that hospital informed anthem that patient x was admitted to hospital as a result of being injured while driving in an automobile accident with a blood alcohol level in excess of the legal limit and positive for cannabis.the tac alleges that anthem knew this information because hospital provided it to anthem on may,and that anthem continued to monitor,discuss,and authorize patient x treatment at hospital on multiple occasions after having been informed about his blood alcohol level and positive test for cannabis.in addition,the tac alleges that anthem knew of the coverage exclusions.as a result,any representations anthem made that indicated to hospital that the services hospital was providing to patient x would be covered are alleged to have been made with the knowledge that those representations were false.
in addition,the tac alleges that the defendants made misrepresentations to hospital that the services were authorized and covered with the intent to induce the hospital to act in reliance on them or with the expectation that the hospital would so act.further,the tac includes allegations that hospital was ignorant of the falsity of the representations made by the defendants and believed them to be true,and that hospital acted in reliance on the representations when it,for example,admitted patient x to its acute rehabilitation facility.the tac also alleges that hospital refrained from seeking reimbursement from medi cal for services provided to patient x within medi cal time limits because,as a result of the representations made by anthem,hospital believed that the defendants would pay hospital for the services provided.these allegations sufficiently allege justifiable reliance.
in sum,the tac provides a detailed set of allegations of fraud against anthem.given the specificity of these numerous alleged communications,and given the allegation that the provision of an authorization has a specific meaning in this context,that an authorization of services constitutes an affirmative representation that the services are covered,hospital has sufficiently alleged the existence of multiple affirmative misrepresentations that patient x care would be covered by his insurance plan.
fraud based on suppression of facts causes of action and 
for similar reasons we conclude that the trial court erred in sustaining defendants demurrer to the tac causes of action for fraud based on the intentional suppression of material facts.the tort of concealment is simply another species of fraud or deceit.see civ.code,subd.fraud includes t he suppression of a fact,by one who is bound to disclose it,or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact lovejoy v.at t th.t he elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are the defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact,the defendant must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff,the defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the plaintiff,the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact,and as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact,the plaintiff must have sustained damage.marketing west,sanyo fisher usa th,marketing west.thus,the elements of fraud and deceit based on concealment are the same as for intentional fraud,with the additional requirement that the plaintiff allege that the defendant concealed or suppressed a material fact in a situation in which the defendant was under a duty to disclose that material fact.
in transactions which do not involve fiduciary or confidential relations,a cause of action for of material facts may arise in at least three instances the defendant makes representations but does not disclose facts which materially qualify the facts disclosed,or which render his disclosure likely to mislead the facts are known or accessible only to defendant,and defendant knows they are not known to or reasonably discoverable by the plaintiff or the defendant actively conceals discovery from the plaintiff.fns.omitted.marketing west,supra,th at,quoting warner constr.city of los angeles cal d.
