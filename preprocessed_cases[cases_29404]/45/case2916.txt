discussion 
introduction 
the court sustained ranger demurrer on the ground of misjoinder.the court reasoned the potential for conflict between the insurance company and the insured was too great and concluded it was improper for them both to remain as parties to the action.demurrers on the ground of misjoinder lie only when the defect appears on the face of the complaint or matters judicially noticed.weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
citing anaya superior court d,appellants contend ranger had no standing to assert misjoinder because it did not make a showing it was prejudiced by the alleged misjoinder.although the code seems to authorize the sustaining of a demurrer solely on such a technical objection of misjoinder,the authorities indicate that the defendant is entitled to a favorable ruling only when he can show some prejudice suffered or some interests affected by the misjoinder.in practical effect,this means that such a demurrer can be successfully used only by the persons improperly joined.a proper defendant is seldom injured by the joinder of unnecessary or improper parties plaintiff or defendant,and his demurrer ought to be overruled.emphasis deleted.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading.the issue here is,of course,whether ranger was improperly joined.

royal globe factors 
ranger contends royal globe ins.superior court cal d,disapproved on another point in fireman fund ins.companies cal d,and,and its progeny support the court decision.in royal globe,the court concluded a joint lawsuit against both the insured for negligence and the insurer for violating its duties under insurance code section,subdivision h,would be improper,at.the court held the third party claimant might not bring suit against the insurer until the action between the injured party and the insured was concluded,at.
appellants argue royal globe and its progeny are inapposite as this is a first party action brought by an insured of ranger ocean based on the contractual obligations of an insured ultimate and insurer ranger to defend and indemnify appellants in an underlying action that has been resolved.under royal globe,insureds are identified as first parties,and claimants are identified as third parties.witkin,summary of cal.law ed torts.
in fireman fund ins.companies,supra,cal d,the supreme court explained its reasoning in royal globe 
in royal globe,the third party claimant attempted to join the insurer as a defendant in her pending action against the insured on the underlying tort claim.we concluded that a joint lawsuit against both the insured for negligence and the insurer for violating its duties under section,subdivision h,would be improper,for three reasons.first,a joint trial would obviously violate both the letter and spirit of.that section provides that evidence that an alleged tortfeasor is insured is inadmissible to prove the insured negligence or wrongdoing.its obvious purpose is to prevent the prejudicial use of such evidence in a proceeding to determine the insured liability.
second,a joint trial would hamper the defense of the insured on the liability question.we stated,unless the trial against the insurer is postponed until the liability of the insured is first determined,the defense of the insured may be seriously hampered by discovery initiated by the injured claimant against the insurer.third,damages suffered by the injured party as a result of the insurer violation of may best be determined after the conclusion of the action by the third party claimant against the insured.citations emphasis omitted.
ranger,which argues appellants read royal globe too narrowly,seems to suggest an insured and an insurer should never be joined in the same action.on the other hand,appellants cite a number of cases in
