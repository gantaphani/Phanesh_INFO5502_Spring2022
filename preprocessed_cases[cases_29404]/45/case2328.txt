in response to the request of the ninth circuit court of appeals,we answer the following certified question whether an insurer defending a personal injury suit under a reservation of rights may recover settlement payments made over the objection of the insured when it is later determined that the underlying claims are not covered under the policy.blue ridge ins.jacobsen cir,blue ridge cal.rules of court,rule.here,at the time it accepted defense of the insureds,the insurer reserved its right to dispute coverage for any settlement contribution made to the injured third party.however,when a reasonable settlement offer was subsequently tendered,the insureds refused to agree the insurer could settle if the insureds would be liable for reimbursing the insurer for any noncovered claims.they also refused to either assume their own defense,or agree the settlement offer was unreasonable,and hence could not be the basis for a later bad faith action based on the failure to settle.under such circumstances,we conclude an insurer may be reimbursed for a reasonable settlement payment made over the objection of its insureds.
factual and procedural background 
the following statement of undisputed facts is derived in part from the ninth circuit opinion.blue ridge,supra,at.during the until late,defendants and insureds brigitte and john jacobsen operated a dog kennel business in sun valley,california.they specialized in importing champion german shepherd and rottweiler dogs from germany and reselling them in the united states.robert and bolognesi,plaintiffs in the underlying action,also operated a dog kennel business.the bolognesis had purchased several dogs from brigitte jacobsen,some directly from her kennel,and some specifically imported from germany by her at their request.
although brigitte jacobsen closed her kennel business in,in she assisted the bolognesis in purchasing a german schutzhund iii male rottweiler vom gelderland.approximately five months later,benno severely mauled bolognesi.was,and the mother of a young child.the bolognesis sued the jacobsens,alleging theories of product liability,negligence,and fraud.the jacobsens tendered the defense to their homeowner insurer,blue ridge insurance company blue ridge.
blue ridge disputed coverage on the grounds that the bolognesis claims fell within either the business pursuits or the professional services exclusion to the homeowner policy.blue ridge agreed to defend the jacobsens subject to a reservation of rights which provided b ecause it appears likely that your liability in this action,if any,will not be covered under the policy,blue ridge insurance company hereby reserves its rights to b refuse to indemnify you with respect to any judgment or settlement c initiate a separate action to determine our duty to defend or indemni f y you d obtain recovery from you of any costs or expenses,including fees for legal services e request your participation in any settlement of the action with the understanding that any contribution made by us is subject to the reservation of our right to dispute coverage,unless we expressly waive in writing all such reservations.blue ridge provided the jacobsens with independent counsel for defense in the underlying action.see,subd.a.
shortly thereafter,blue ridge brought a declaratory judgment action seeking adjudication of the coverage issue.in response to the jacobsens motion,the district court stayed the action pending resolution of the underlying state court proceeding.it was this federal declaratory relief action that ultimately led to the question certified to this court by the ninth circuit court of appeals.
on may,the bolognesis made a policy limits settlement demand of to the jacobsens.the p laintiff makes no secret of the purpose of this policy limits demand it is to open up or delimit the policy should blue ridge insurance fail to accept this offer and plaintiff later obtain an eight figure judgment.although plaintiffs would actively pursue the assets of the jacobsens after obtaining such a judgment,if the judgment was not satisfied,plaintiffs would also consider accepting from the jacobsens an assignment of rights against their insurance carriers for any possible bad faith and extracontractual liability which might have arisen as a result of blue ridge insurance company failure to settle this case within policy limits when presented with the opportunity.the letter further stated bolognesi medical bills to date totaled more than.she suffered fractures to her left arm,and both arms were torn apart with severe tissue loss.she required a venous transplantation from her leg to her arm,together with muscle and skin grafting,leaving her with terrible scarring.she had undergone separate surgeries.the attack was all the more devastating because it struck bolognesi young woman of as she was about to enter the prime of life.the offer was to expire on june.this date was subsequently extended to june.
a series of letters between blue ridge and counsel for the jacobsens ensued.on june,blue ridge informed the jacobsens that it had determined the settlement offer was reasonable.it proposed to accept the demand under a reservation of its right to seek recovery of the settlement amount from the jacobsens.it also gave the jacobsens the option to assume their own defense if they found the settlement offer unreasonable.if blue ridge did not hear from the jacobsens by june,it would assume they had no objection and would proceed to accept the settlement demand under a full and complete reservation of rights including the right to seek reimbursement from the jacobsens for the amounts so paid.
on june,the jacobsens responded.the simple answer to your letter is no.the jacobsens stated they contested liability and that there was substantial evidence bolognesi had voluntarily assumed the risk of her injury.under the terms of your client policy,it has the ability to settle claims without the consent of the jacobsens.should your client care to exercise its rights under the policy to settle the claim,then it may do so,pay the settlement and close its books on this matter.however,the jacobsens will not consent to settlement of this matter on the terms you suggest.moreover,to the extent that your client views the settlement demand as reasonable,then it has an obligation to accept that settlement demand or face the prospect of having blown its policy limits.to the extent that your client views the settlement demand as unreasonable,then there is further evidence that your client offer to the jacobsens has been made in bad faith.the fact that the jacobsens would not consent to your settlement will not be a defense in an action for a wrongful refusal to settle.counsel also noted the expiration date of the settlement offer had been extended to june.
on june,blue ridge responded,reiterating its proposal to accept the settlement under a reservation of rights,but first offering the jacobsens the opportunity to assume their own defense.in response to the jacobsens blown policy limits comment,blue ridge said the comment appears to constitute a statement of your clients position to the effect that since blue ridge has determined that the settlement demand is reasonable,your clients believe that it is blue ridge obligation to accept that settlement proposal.while blue ridge does not necessarily share your view of the law in this regard,blue ridge does propose to do exactly what you contend blue ridge is obligated to do namely,accept the settlement proposal but before doing so,it is offering your clients an opportunity to reassume their own defense.if we are incorrect in our interpretation of your june,letter in this regard,please advise.as to the question of liability,blue ridge stated while you assert that your clients contest liability and note the existence of evidence to support a claim that bolognesi voluntarily assumed the risk of her injury,you must candidly concede that there is likewise evidence to support a finding of liability on the part of the jacobsens as well as evidence negating the defense of assumption of risk.
the jacobsens responded later the same day.y our client blue ridge has no right to settle a claim,absent an agreement with its insured,and seek reimbursement from its insured for the amount of the settlement.the jacobsens are unwilling to give blue ridge that agreement.the jacobsens have advised you of the reasons why they believe that the defense of the claim is necessary and justified.if blue ridge desires to settle the underlying lawsuit,it may do so subject to the terms and conditions of the policy.but in pursuing such a course of conduct,it is protecting its own interests.as such,it is not entitled to reimbursement for payments made in settlement.
on june,blue ridge responded,stating,if your position,on behalf of the jacobsens,is that the case is one of no liability and that you are not and will not contend that blue ridge has an obligation to pay the settlement demand,then please so state in unequivocal terms.such a statement by you,on behalf of the jacobsens,would be considered by blue ridge as relieving blue ridge of any obligations to settle the case for what blue ridge considers to be a reasonable settlement figure within its policy limits,and would amount to a waiver by your clients of any claim of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing based upon the failure of blue ridge to accept the demand within the policy limits.blue ridge has evaluated and considers the settlement demand reasonable and thus,intends to pay the same under reservation of rights absent an unequivocal statement from you on behalf of the jacobsens that they wish to either assume their defense or that they consider the case one of no liability and will not contend that blue ridge has an obligation to pay the settlement demand.
on june,the jacobsens responded,essentially asserting that blue ridge was depriving its insureds of the opportunity to contest the personal injury action and driving them into bankruptcy.
on june,blue ridge responded,disputing these allegations,and reiterating comments made in earlier correspondence.on june,the jacobsens sent another letter,noting that the plaintiffs had agreed to extend the time to respond to the settlement offer to july.your client has the ability to accept this settlement offer.indeed,it has admitted that the settlement offer is reasonable.the jacobsens,on the other hand,do not have.t he jacobsens will never be in a position to meaningfully respond to any judgment that blue ridge might get.the jacobsens simply can not agree to any settlement outside the terms of the can not afford it.if blue ridge does not accept this settlement offer,it does so at its own risk.if it does accept this settlement offer,it should be in a position to close its books and walk away from this matter.
having failed to secure the jacobsens consent,blue ridge then sought to intervene in the underlying action for the purpose of obtaining the trial court permission to participate in the settlement under a reservation of rights.the motion to intervene was denied.blue ridge subsequently accepted the bolognesis settlement demand on behalf of the jacobsens,but over their objection.the trial court in the underlying action found the settlement to be in good faith.
after settlement of the state court action,the stay was lifted in the federal action,and blue ridge amended its complaint to assert a claim for reimbursement of the settlement payment.blue ridge did not seek reimbursement of defense fees and costs.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of blue ridge on the coverage and reimbursement claims,and found the settlement to be reasonable.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court findings regarding coverage and the reasonableness of the settlement.hence,these questions are not before us.the court was uncertain,however,whether california law provides blue ridge with a right to seek reimbursement of the settlement under these circumstances,particularly in light of the jacobsens express withholding of their consent to the settlement and their assertion of no liability in the underlying personal injury action.blue ridge,supra,at.specifically,it is unclear whether,under california law,an agreement is a prerequisite to reimbursement.id.at.
ii.discussion 
background 
an insurance policy is a contract in which the insurer agrees to pay up to a specified sum should certain losses occur.in exchange,the insured pays the insurer premiums for this coverage against risk of loss.buss superior court cal th,d,buss bank of the west superior court cal th,d.
an insurer has the right and broad duty to defend the insured against third party claims potentially within the policy coverage.see,montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,fn,d.the duty to indemnify is much narrower.buss,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the homeowner policy here provided,if a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies,we will pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable.italics added.as the language suggests,blue ridge was not obligated to indemnify the jacobsens for noncovered claims.montrose,at,fn,d.
an insurer may agree to defend a suit subject to a reservation of rights.truck ins.exchange superior court th,d.in this manner,an insurer meets its obligation to furnish a defense without waiving its right to assert coverage defenses against the insured at a later time.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.as we stated years ago,if the insurer adequately reserves its right to assert the noncoverage defense later,it will not be bound by the judgment.if the injured party prevails,that party or the insured will assert his claim against the insurer.at this time the insurer can raise the noncoverage defense previously reserved.gray zurich insurance cal d,fn.omitted.
an insurer can reserve its right to assert noncoverage unilaterally merely by giving notice to the insured.american motorists ins.food services,th,d,disapproved on other grounds in buss,supra,cal th at,fn,d.by accepting the insurer defense under these circumstances,the insured is deemed to have accepted this condition.american motorists ins,at,d val painting drywall,allstate ins.d.val painting see also walbrook ins.goshgarian goshgarian,applying california law to conclude reservation of right to recover defense costs effective even when an insured objects to the reservation but accepts the defense buss,at,fn,d,dicta regarding unilateral reservation of right to reimbursement for certain defense costs.
the issue in this case concerns the insurer ability to seek reimbursement for settlement of what are later determined to be noncovered claims when the insureds withhold consent to the settlement.two of our cases,johansen cal.state auto.bureau cal d,johansen,and buss,supra,cal th,d,are pertinent.in addition,while we may not agree with all of the reasoning in court of appeal cases interpreting johansen,they are useful in understanding why blue ridge offered the jacobsens the alternatives it did.
in johansen,supra,cal d,we held an insurer that fails to accept a reasonable settlement offer within the policy limits because it does not believe the policy provides coverage,assumes the risk it will be held liable for all resulting damages including a judgment that exceeds the policy limits.id.at.we further concluded that in determining whether a settlement offer is reasonable,an insurer may not consider the issue of coverage.id.at.rather the only permissible consideration in evaluating the reasonableness of the settlement offer is whether,in light of the victim injuries and the probable liability of the insured,the ultimate judgment is likely to exceed the amount of the settlement offer.ibid.
in so holding in johansen,we rejected the insurer argument that it was required to settle all cases regardless of whether the policy provided coverage a n insurer in defendant position retains the ability to enter an agreement with the insured reserving its right to assert a defense of noncoverage even if it accepts a settlement offer.if,having reserved such rights and having accepted a reasonable offer,the insurer subsequently establishes the noncoverage of its policy,it would be free to seek reimbursement of the settlement payment from its insured.johansen,supra,cal d at.
it is the single word agreement in this portion of johansen that has given rise to the issue in this case.in johansen,the insurer did not seek reimbursement of a settlement.hence,we were not in that case directly addressing the steps an insurer must take in order to obtain reimbursement of a settlement for a noncovered claim.nevertheless,as can be seen in court of appeal cases interpreting johansen,our use of the term agreement has caused uncertainty as to the precise nature of the prerequisites for obtaining reimbursement of reasonable settlement payments.
for example,in val painting,supra,d,allstate insurance company allstate agreed to defend val painting and drywall,under a reservation of rights.it subsequently settled the underlying actions and sought reimbursement from its insured.id.at.the court of appeal agreed allstate was,in general,entitled to recover settlement amounts paid for claims not covered by the policy.id.at.however,the court further concluded that allstate reservation of rights letter was insufficient,without more,to constitute the agreement contemplated by johansen.id.at.nowhere does the letter expressly state that if allstate settled the case it would look to val for reimbursement for any reasonable amounts paid.ibid.the statement that allstate did not waive any rights or admit any obligations under the policy can not,without more,reasonably be interpreted to mean that allstate was given carte blanche to settle the case with what will turn out to be the insured own money.furthermore,there is no allegation in allstate pleading that val was informed of the settlement offer,that val expressly or impliedly agreed that the claimants should be paid a total of as a reasonable settlement,that the settlement was reasonable,that val was given an opportunity to assume the defense if val did not think the settlement reasonable,or that val expressly or impliedly agreed that if such sum was paid the question of policy coverage should be left to future determination.ibid.the court stated absent an agreement by the or implied in the insurer may commit the insured own fund toward any reasonable settlement,the insurer is not permitted to seek reimbursement for a particular settlement unless it has secured specific authority to make that settlement or has notified the insured of a reasonable offer by the claimant and given the insured an opportunity to assume the defense.ibid.the court remanded to allow allstate the opportunity to amend its.id.at.
in maryland casualty imperial contracting d.maryland,imperial contracting company imperial refused to consent to maryland casualty company maryland participation in a proposed settlement under a reservation of rights.the trial court in the third party action issued an order allowing maryland to participate in the settlement without imperial consent and under a reservation of rights.id.at.the order was made expressly without prejudice to imperial rights to litigate all issues,including liability and the amount of damages,in any later action to recover amounts paid in the settlement.ibid.the order further provided that maryland did not waive its rights in the declaratory relief action and if it prevailed in that action it could seek to recover all sums expended in settlement from its insured.ibid.the settlement was subsequently found by the same trial court to be reasonable and in good faith.ibid.
the court of appeal held maryland was entitled to seek reimbursement of the settlement from its insured.maryland,supra,d at.maryland had obtained an order allowing it to participate in the settlement,and that settlement was subsequently found to be in good faith.id.at.in addition,maryland reserved its right to dispute coverage at the time it assumed the defense two years prior to settlement.id.at.moreover,imperial was notified of the settlement offer,and its failure to consent was tied solely to maryland failure to settle earlier for a more reasonable sum.in other words imperial did not tell maryland that it was not liable or that it wanted to take over the litigation.i n view of the insured refusal to agree,maryland properly sought and obtained trial court sanction to join in the settlement.id.at.under these circumstances,maryland satisfied the concerns underlying val painting,and was not required to offer imperial an opportunity to assume the defense.maryland,at.
in golden eagle ins.foremost ins.th,d,the trial court granted the insurer,golden eagle insurance company,authority to attempt to settle,found the resulting settlement to be reasonable and in good faith,but further found the insurer was not entitled to seek reimbursement.the court of appeal agreed,concluding the insurer was estopped from denying coverage because it accepted defense of the insured suit without a reservation of rights,failed to afford the insureds a reasonable opportunity to assume their own defense,and did not have the insured authority for the settlement made in the underlying action.id.at,d.the court of appeal distinguished maryland on the ground that in maryland,the insured knew from the outset it might be responsible for paying a judgment in the underlying action thus,when it appeared the case might be in a position to be settled,there was in fairness no need for the insurer to offer the defense to the insured.golden eagle,at,d.here,however,it was not until virtually the eve of trial that golden eagle first informed the insureds it was disputing coverage after all and it was not until trial was underway that golden eagle first informed the insureds of its intent to settle for an amount in excess of its alleged policy limits.ibid.
in buss,supra,cal th,d,we held an insurer may seek reimbursement from the insured for defense costs that can be allocated solely to claims not even potentially covered.id.at,d.we concluded reimbursement should be available because the insurer had not bargained to bear these costs and the insured had not paid the insurer premiums for the risk.id.at,d.the insurer therefore has a right of reimbursement that is implied in law as,whether or not it has one that is implied in fact in the policy as contractual.as stated,under the law of restitution such a right runs against the person who benefits from unjust enrichment and in favor of the person who suffers loss thereby.the enrichment of the insured by the insurer through the insurer bearing of defense costs is inconsistent with the insurer freedom under the policy and therefore must be deemed unjust.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
in addition,we stated in buss,we note that the court of appeal assumed that,in order to obtain reimbursement for defense costs,the insurer must reserve its right thereto.to the extent that this right is implied in law as,it must indeed be reserved.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts,stating that,i n an action in,a demand is ordinarily a necessary prerequisite original italics.through reservation,the insurer gives the insured notice of how the insurer will,or at least may,proceed and thereby provides the insured an opportunity to take any steps that it may deem reasonable or necessary in whether to accept defense at the insurer hands and under the insurer control citation or,instead,to defend itself as it chooses.to the extent that this right is implied in fact in the policy as contractual,it should be reserved.through reservation,the insurer avoids waiver.buss,supra,cal th at,fn,d.we further stated,in dicta we also note that the court of appeal was evidently of the view that the insurer can reserve its right of reimbursement for defense costs by itself,without the insured agreement.such a view is in accord with the modern trend.walbrook ins.goshgarian goshgarian,supra.at.more important,it is sound.because the right is the insurer alone,it may be reserved by it unilaterally.buss,at,fn,d.
as noted,the issue here is whether blue ridge may seek reimbursement for the settlement paid on the jacobsens behalf even in the absence of the jacobsens express agreement.we conclude it may.here,the jacobs
