this insurance case raises two issues.first,we consider our appellate jurisdiction.although we usually may not review voluntary dismissals of claims or denials of motions for summary judgment,this case presents the unusual situation in which we are asked to review the voluntary dismissal of a claim following the denial of a motion for summary judgment.our review is appropriate in these circumstances because the united states district court for the southern district of new york richard sullivan,judge rejected the legal basis for the appellants counterclaim the district court disposed of all claims with prejudice and the appellants consented to the final judgment solely to obtain immediate appeal of the prior adverse decision,without pursuing piecemeal appellate review.
second,we interpret several excess liability insurance policies,which provide insurance protection beyond the protection provided by underlying policies.each excess liability insurance policy at issue includes an exhaustion clause,which states that the excess insurance coverage attaches only after a certain amount of underlying insurance coverage is exhausted as a result of payment of losses thereunder.based on this language,the insured appellants argue that their liability must reach the attachment point in order to trigger the excess coverage.by contrast,the insurer appellees argue that the excess liability coverage is only triggered when liability payments reach the attachment point.we conclude that the plain language of the insurance policies supports the view of the insurer appellees.accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
background 
the appellants are the former directors and officers collectively,the directors of commodore international limited commodore,a computer technology company that in ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy by the time that commodore filed for bankruptcy,it had purchased a series of insurance policies designed to protect the directors from potential liability.the primary insurance policy covered the first million in liability,and each successive excess insurance policy provided a discrete level of coverage in excess of the coverage in the underlying agreements,thus creating a layered tower of liability protection for instance,the first excess policy provided million of protection in excess of million in liability payments the first excess policy attachment point,the second excess insurance policy provided million of protection in excess of million in liability payments,and so on.this suit arose because two of the underlying insurers reliance insurance company reliance and the home insurance company home have ceased operations and liquidated their assets 
appellee federal insurance company fic is the provider of the directors second and fifth excess insurance policies.see note,ante.anticipating that the directors would file claims relating to a suit pending in the supreme court of the commonwealth of the bahamas the bahamas litigation fic filed a declaratory relief action against the directors in the southern district of new york,seeking a declaration that,under the terms of the relevant insurance policies,fic is not required to drop down to cover liability that would have otherwise been covered by reliance and home.fic moved for judgment on the pleadings.the district court granted fic the requested declaratory relief in an order dated september.see fed.ins.estate of gould,civ.rjs,wl,at.the directors do not appeal this aspect of the district court order.
in the same proceedings,the directors filed a against fic and also sued travelers casualty and surety company of america travelers the provider of the seventh excess insurance policy in the tower.see note,ante.with respect to their counterclaim and suit,and in response to the fic declaratory action,the directors sought a declaration that federal and travelers coverage obligations are triggered once the total amount of the directors defense indemnity obligations exceeds the limits of any insurance policies underlying their respective policies,regardless of whether such amounts have actually been paid by those underlying insurance companies.joint app x at emphasis supplied.the directors then moved for partial summary judgment with respect to this request for declaratory relief.
in the same order granting fic motion on the drop down issue,the district court denied the directors motion for partial summary judgment.specifically,the court held that i n each policy,the excess coverage is not triggered until the underlying insurance is exhausted solely as a result of payment of losses thereunder,and therefore the excess coverage will not be triggered solely by the aggregation of the directors covered losses.fed.ins,wl,at.instead,the court explained,the excess policies expressly state that coverage does not attach until there is payment of the underlying losses.id.
following that decision,the parties submitted a letter to the district court agreeing that all remaining claims and claims should be dismissed with prejudice.fed.ins.estate of gould,civ.rjs filed,ecf quoting the parties letter of.pursuant to that agreement,the district court ordered that this case is dismissed with prejudice but without costs.see also.a 
the directors then appealed the judgment,contesting only the court denial of their motion for partial summary judgment with respect to their request for declaratory relief.
discussion 
this case comes to us in an unusual posture an appeal from a voluntary dismissal of a claim following the denial of a motion for partial summary judgment.we generally lack appellate jurisdiction to review voluntary dismissals of claims or denials of motions for summary judgment.see empire volkswagen,world wide volkswagen,cir voluntarily dismissed claims distiso cook,cir denials of motions for summary judgment see also steel citizens for a better env t,d reciting the familiar rule that jurisdiction must exist before reviewing the merits.nonetheless,for the reasons stated below,this case presents the unusual circumstances where we may review a final judgment that resulted from a voluntary dismissal following a denial of a motion for summary judgment.
orders granting rule a motions for voluntary dismissal are not usually appealable,since it is presumed that plaintiffs obtained that which they sought.coliseum square ass n,jackson,cir see also empire volkswagen,at.the rationale for this rule has little weight,however,where the appellant lost on the merits and is only seeking an expeditious review.united states procter gamble,d.in that situation,an appellant has not consent ed to a judgment,but only that,if there was to be such a judgment,it should be final in form instead of interlocutory,so that an appeal may be taken without further delay.id.quoting thomsen cayser.
for that reason,w hen the dismissal is with prejudice,plaintiffs have been allowed,in limited circumstances,to appeal from a voluntary dismissal when the plaintiffs solicitation of the formal dismissal was designed only to expedite review of a prior order which had in effect dismissed plaintiffs complaint.chappelle beacon commc ns,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted quoting empire volkswagen,at in order to qualify as an effective dismissal of the claim,empire volkswagen,at,the adverse ruling must have rejected the claim as a matter of law,palmieri defaria,cir because the invitation to dismiss must be designed only to secure immediate appellate review of an adverse decision,parties can not appeal a joint stipulation to voluntary dismissal,entered unconditionally by the court pursuant to a settlement agreement.concha london,cir.if claims unaffected by the adverse ruling are also pending,a party who loses on a dispositive issue that affects only a portion of his claims may elect to abandon the unaffected claims,invite a final judgment,and thereby secure review of the adverse ruling.rabbi jacob joseph sch.province of mendoza,cir quotation marks omitted.these strict requirements allow plaintiffs and to retain control of their own claims while also ensuring that voluntary dismissals are not used to obtain piecemeal appellate review.see smith half hollow hills cent.sch,cir t he federal policy against piecemeal appeals is not implicated where an entire case can be decided in a single appeal.citing cuoco moritsugu,cir.
the only claim at issue in this appeal is the directors request for a declaration that the relevant coverage obligations are triggered once the total amount of the directors defense indemnity obligations exceeds the limits of any insurance policies underlying their respective policies,regardless of whether such amounts have actually been paid by those underlying insurance companies.joint app x at.on september,the district court rejected this request as a matter of law the court held that the express language of the relevant contract terms establishes a clear condition precedent to the attachment of the excess policies,by expressly stat ing that coverage does not attach until there is payment of the underlying losses.fed.ins,wl,at.in sum,the court held,the relief sought by the directors contradicts the plain language of the excess policies.id.at.
although the court order denying the directors motion for summary judgment did not constitute a final decision appealable under see ortiz jordan,d ordinarily,orders denying summary judgment do not qualify as final decisions subject to appeal,the parties subsequently informed the district court that they wished to dismiss with prejudice all pending claims and pursuant to rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure in order to obtain immediate appellate review,see note,ante.the district court then issued an order to that effect.see fed.ins.estate of gould,civ.rjs filed,ecf.
once the district court dismissed all pending claims and with prejudice,an appeal became appropriate because the district court order denying the directors motion for summary judgment plainly rejected the legal basis for the directors the district court had disposed of all claims with prejudice and the directors consent to the final judgment was designed solely to obtain immediate appeal of the prior adverse decision,without pursuing piecemeal appellate review.in these circumstances,we may review the district court judgment dismissing the director see chappelle,at citing empire volkswagen,at.
turning to the merits,we review de novo a grant or denial of summary judgment,construing the record in the light most favorable to the party.mullins city of new york,cir.as in other contract disputes,insurance policies are interpreted according to their plain terms.see fieldston prop.owners ass n,hermitage ins,harleysville ins.aetna cas.sur.ins,because the plain meaning of contractual terms can depend on context,see int l multifoods commercial union ins,cir,we begin with a brief,general overview of excess liability policies,and then turn to the particular contractual language at issue.
in this context,primary insurance refers to the first layer of insurance coverage that attaches immediately upon the occurrence of a liability or loss.see horace mann ins.star ins,cir.excess liability policies,by contrast,provide an additional layer of coverage for losses that exceed the limits of a primary liability policy.coverage under an excess policy thus is triggered when the liability limits of the underlying primary insurance policy have been exhausted.see also olin am.home assurance,cir describing how excess liability policies operate.and,as illustrated by this case,e xcess insurance may also be designed to operate above another excess policy,with coverage under the excess policies triggered once the excess policies are exhausted.horace mann ins,at n.accordingly,the very nature of excess insurance coverage is such that a predetermined amount of underlying primary coverage must be paid before the excess coverage is activated.gabarick laurin am,cir alteration and quotation marks omitted.because coverage is only triggered after the primary insurance limit has been exhausted,excess insurance is generally available at a lesser cost than the primary policy since the risk of loss is less than for the primary insurer.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
we now turn to the relevant language in the excess policies.both fic policies state that excess liability coverage shall attach only after all underlying insurance has been exhausted by payment of claim s,joint app x at,emphasis supplied,and that exhaustion of the underlying insurance occurs solely as a result of payment of losses thereunder.id.at,emphasis supplied.similarly,the travelers policy states that excess liability coverage shall attach only after all such underlying insurance has been exhausted,and that exhaustion occurs solely as a result of payment of losses thereunder.id.at emphasis supplied.
the directors sought a declaration that these excess liability coverage obligations are triggered when defense indemnity obligations reach the attachment point.but obligations are not synonymous with payments on those obligations.to hold otherwise would make the payment of language in these excess liability contracts superfluous.accordingly,we agree with the district court conclusion that the express language of the relevant contract terms establishes a clear condition precedent to the attachment of the excess policies,by expressly stat ing that coverage does not attach until there is payment of the underlying losses.fed.ins,wl,at.because the plain language of the contracts specifies that the coverage obligation is not triggered until payments reach the respective attachment points,the district court properly denied the directors request for a declaration that coverage obligations are triggered once the directors defense and indemnity obligations reach the relevant attachment point.
the directors make several arguments attacking the reasoning of the district court,but their arguments are not persuasive.in fact,most of their arguments are inapposite because they are based on a misunderstanding of the district court order.the directors view is summarized in their reply brief 
given that the directors sought a declaration as to whether the excess policies attach once liability exceeds the underlying limits regardless of whether those amounts have actually been paid by those underlying insurance companies,implicit in the district court denial of the relief sought by the directors is that exhaustion must occur as a result of actual payment by the underlying insurance companies,not the directors.
reply br.this argument ignores the language and context of the district court order.the district court never held that the underlying insurers must make payments before the obligations under the relevant excess policies are triggered.rather,the district court echoing the terms of the relevant insurance policies described the exhaustion requirement in the passive voice and did not specify which party was obligated to make the requisite payments.see fed.ins,wl,at t he excess policies expressly state that coverage does not attach until there is payment of the underlying losses.
the district court did not err in doing so.denying the directors request did not require ruling on whether the underlying insurers,in particular,were required to make payments the directors simply sought a declaration that the excess policies coverages are triggered once the respective attachment points are reached,once the amount of defense indemnity obligations exceeds the limits of any insurance policies underlying their respective policies.
