this insurance coverage dispute arises from efforts by the environmental protection agency epa to remediate contamination at the centredale manor superfund site the site in north providence,rhode island.
in,the epa designated appellant emhart industries,emhart a potentially responsible party prp for the cleanup costs of the site under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act cercla,et.consequently,emhart made a demand for coverage on its insurers,which include century indemnity company century,and the north river insurance company north river and onebeacon america insurance company onebeacon.emhart later sued century,onebeacon,and north river,among others,to cover its cleanup and defense costs.
after trial,a jury found that century,onebeacon,and north river did not owe emhart coverage for cleanup costs.however,the district court awarded summary judgment for emhart on its claim that century owed it a duty to defend in the epa matter.the district court later found that century breached that duty and assessed the total costs of defense of the underlying epa action as damages,but only up to the date of the jury finding that century did not owe a duty to indemnify.
century appeals the allowance of summary judgment in emhart favor as to century duty to defend.in the alternative,century contends that it should not be saddled with the entirety of the defense costs incurred up to the jury finding.emhart,contending that the duty to defend continues,that it is entitled to total indemnity costs for century breach of the duty to defend,and that the district court committed various errors with respect to the jury verdict.
after careful consideration,we affirm the district court with respect to all issues on appeal.
background 
the following derives from the extensive record,which includes the parties stipulations,trial testimony,and other evidence submitted at trial and at a evidentiary hearing.
factual background 
the contamination of the site 
the site totals a little over nine acres.it is bordered on the west by the woonasquatucket river and on the east by a drainage swale that empties into a wooded wetland to the south.the site is a flood plain for the river.
from to,atlantic chemical company,which later became,leased a portion of the site,where it operated a chemical plant.beginning in,and for a period of less than one year,manufactured hexachlorophene,a substance used in phisohex disinfecting soap.dioxin is a byproduct of the hexachlorophene manufacturing process.even at very low levels,dioxin poses significant risks to human and ecological health.
during this time,from to,an unrelated company,new england container corporation necc,operated a steel drum reconditioning facility on a portion of the site.necc refurbished drums from at least two companies that manufactured and sold,which yields dioxin when combusted.refurbishing of the drums requires the dumping of the chemical residue inside the drums and then incinerating the insides.other fires and incineration at the necc facility may have contributed to the dioxin contamination.flooding also may have dispersed dioxin onto the site from other areas.
in,merged with crown chemical corporation to form,and thereafter ceased operations at the site as of the merger date.through a series of mergers and acquisitions,emhart became the corporate successor to and.
the epa action 
the epa first discovered dioxin on the site in.on june,the epa issued a request for information to emhart concerning the site pursuant to e of cercla,e,and pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra.
on february,after preliminary studies and investigations,the epa sent emhart a notice of potential liability under cercla for the site the prp letter,identifying emhart as a prp.among other things,the prp letter required emhart to pay costs of incurred to date,as well as future costs,and mandated such actions as constructing a soil cap,implementing flood control measures,and removing contaminated soil and river sediments.the prp letter also identified five other prps,including necc,but emhart remains the only prp that is financially viable.liability under cercla is strict as well as joint and several.
on april,the epa issued to emhart and others a unilateral administrative order for removal action the uao requiring that certain remedial work be performed on the site.the epa has also issued a second and third unilateral administrative order for removal action the second uao and third uao,respectively.the anticipated cost of remediation is likely to exceed million.
century and emhart 
from the beginning of the epa action,emhart and century scuffled over coverage.some of this scuffling is relevant to this appeal.
on july,shortly after issuance of the request for information,emhart broker sent a letter giving notice of the request for information to century and other interested underwriters,seventeen in all.the letter demanded that each recipient provide defense and indemnification and advised the insurers that emhart had already secured outside counsel,swidler berlin,to provide a prompt and proper defense.the letter identified four excess policies issued by century,but did not list the century policies at issue in this case.the broker also forwarded,along with the request for information,a memorandum detailing the various mergers and transactions that resulted in emhart succession to the rights of under the policies.as with the request for information,on march,emhart forwarded copies of the prp letter to the same group of insurers.on april,emhart sent copies of the uao to the same group.emhart has also engaged in individual communications with one of its insurers,liberty mutual.liberty mutual would later settle with emhart for.
on november,after issuance of the uao,emhart attorney wrote century seeking information,for the first time,regarding policies issued to.the letter attached a excess policy which emhart had recently located,and requested that century conduct a review of its records for any other policies it may have issued to.the policy attached to that letter is the century excess policy the century excess policy at issue in this case.
initially,by letter dated december,century refused to perform a broad search and denied coverage on the century excess policy,stating that,because had merged into emhart after the expiration of the century excess policy,emhart was not entitled to coverage.on january,emhart responded by reiterating its request for a broad search.emhart also reiterated facts facts previously provided in the memorandum accompanying its mass notices that it was a corporate successor to,and asked century to reconsider its position on corporate succession.
on january,century informed emhart that it reversed its position,and stated that emhart may have succeeded to insurance policies.however,century insisted that emhart had to provide proof of exhaustion of the underlying policy which neither party had located yet in order to obtain the benefits of the century excess policy.
emhart subsequently filed this lawsuit on january.on august,century commenced a new search for possible policies,prior to any discovery requests made by emhart.during this second search,in october,emhart served document requests and interrogatories relating to,among other things,any century policies insuring.
the second search finally identified the century primary policy the century primary policy sometime around january,but it was not disclosed to emhart until july.consequently,on january,century moved to amend its answer to add a counterclaim seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify under the century primary policy.century then denied coverage two days later,on january.emhart sought a declaration that century owed duties to defend and indemnify under the century primary policy.
b.the policies 
there are four policies at issue in this appeal the century primary policy,the century excess policy,an umbrella excess policy issued by onebeacon the onebeacon policy,and an excess policy issued by north river the north river policy.
the century primary policy 
century issued the primary policy to in february,two months after merger with and concurrent termination of all operations at the site.the century primary policy was in effect from february,to january,with a coverage limit of.the insuring agreement of the primary policy provides 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage,even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent but the company shall not be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any suit after the applicable limit of the company liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.
the policy provides that t his insurance applies only to property damage which occurs during the policy period.property damage is defined as injury to or destruction of tangible property.
the policy defines occurrence as an accident,including injurious exposure to conditions,which results,during the policy period,in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
the century excess policy 
the century excess policy was in effect during the period from december,to january.the limits of liability are million in excess of the of coverage provided under the century primary policy.
the excess policy,which is substantially similar to the century primary policy,provides that it will indemnify the insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit.moreover,it provides that 
if limits of liability of the underlying insurance are exhausted because of property damage during the period of this policy century will have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as it deems expedient.
unlike the century primary policy,the century excess policy contains a waste products exclusion,providing that the policy shall not apply to i njury to or destruction of property caused by intentional or willful introduction of waste products,fluids or materials into any soil or inland or tidal waters,irrespective of whether the insured possessed knowledge of the harmful effects of such acts.
the onebeacon policy 
the onebeacon policy,issued to under the name of the employers surplus lines insurance company,was an umbrella policy with limits of million in excess of the million coverage provided by the century primary and excess policies.this policy was in effect from april,to january.the onebeacon policy incorporates the terms and conditions of the century excess policy with respect to the duty to defend and duty to indemnify.however,unlike the century excess policy,there is no exclusion for waste products.
the north river policy 
the north river policy,a commercial comprehensive catastrophe liability policy,insures emhart and its predecessor.the policy period ran from january,to december.the north river policy provided million of property damage coverage in excess of million.under the policy,north river 
agrees to pay on behalf of the insured the ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit hereinafter stated,which the insured may sustain by reason of the liability imposed upon the insured by law or assumed by the insured under contract,for property damage liability arising out of an occurrence.
similarly to the century and onebeacon policies,an occurrence is defined as i njurious exposure to conditions which results in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.the north river policy also contains a pollution exclusion.of significance to this appeal,the pollution exclusion contains a standard exception for releases or dispersals that are sudden and accidental.
procedural history 
after the filing of the suit and the various counterclaims,emhart moved twice for summary judgment with respect to century duty to defend.the district court denied both of emhart motions,in orders dated may,and august.
the may,order resulted from an extensive report and recommendation by a magistrate judge issued on february.that report,which the district court adopted in full,focused on the century excess policy,and denied summary judgment as to indemnification and defense costs u ntil a determination of century obligation under the century primary policy has been made.the report also found separately that new york law applied to the north river policy.
the august,order resulted from rulings made on the bench by the district court the previous day.with respect to century duty to defend,the district court ruled from the bench that such a duty turns on century duty to indemnify,and subsequently denied summary judgment because of factual disputes regarding the duty to indemnify.
in the fall of,the district court conducted a trial on the issue of indemnity.on october,the jury returned a verdict,responding to questions concerning issues pertinent to whether century,onebeacon,and north river owed a duty to indemnify.with respect to century and onebeacon,the jury found that the dioxin contamination was not discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence during the relevant policy periods.with respect to north river,the jury found that the pollution exclusion barred coverage.the effective result of the verdict,which the district court would memorialize in a later final judgment,was to find that century,onebeacon,and north river owed no duty to indemnify.
after trial,the district court returned to the issue of whether century owed a duty to defend,ordering the parties to file supplemental briefing.in an order dated may,the district court awarded summary judgment in emhart favor,holding that century owed emhart a duty to defend under both the century primary policy and century excess policy.the district court further held that century duty to defend ceased as of the date of the october,jury verdict.in the same order,the district court found that emhart had not shown that onebeacon owed a duty to defend,as it had not shown that the century excess policy was exhausted.the district court then scheduled an evidentiary hearing to determine the extent of emhart defense costs,the amount of those costs that century should bear,whether century breached its duty to defend under either or both policies,and the appropriate damages if century did breach its duty.
in june and july,the district court conducted a evidentiary hearing on the issues identified in its may,order.on september,the district court issued a memorandum and order that addressed these issues,provided its reasoning for its rulings in the may,order,and addressed other pre and motions.see emhart,home ins,d.
in its memorandum and order,the district court explained,in an early footnote,its reluctance to address the duty to defend issue until after the trial on the duty to indemnify.it stated 
this odd chronology is in great part due to the complexities of this case,and in some small measure to this writer reluctance to find a duty to defend at all.as the reader will see below,the rhode island supreme court has not had occasion to apply its relevant precedents to circumstances quite like these.
id.at.nevertheless,the district court held that century owed a duty to defend under both policies because they satisfy the pleadings test under rhode island law,since the charging documents,in this case the prp letter,the uao,the second uao,and the third uao,alleged claims that were potentially within the risk of coverage.id.at primary policy id.at excess policy.in so ruling,the district court noted that t he application of the pleadings test here may seem unduly burdensome on century,but rhode island precedents are clear.id.at.
ruling that century had a duty to defend,the district court further found that century had,in fact,breached its duty,and that century owed damages in the amount of approximately million,the total costs of defense of the underlying epa action and related proceedings up to the date of the jury verdict finding no coverage.id.at.of significance to this appeal,the district court also held that emhart was not entitled to total indemnity costs as damages for century duty to defend.id.at.
the september,memorandum and order also addressed other issues pertinent to this appeal.the district court rejected onebeacon claim that it was entitled to reformation of the onebeacon policy to include the waste products exclusion found in the century excess policy,but,in any event,found no coverage since the century policies had not been exhausted.id.at.the district court also explained its prior rejection of emhart request for a continuous trigger jury instruction,rather than a trigger instruction,holding that such a continuous trigger instruction had not yet been adopted by rhode island courts.id.at.the district court likewise rejected emhart request to certify the instruction issue to the rhode island supreme court.id.the district court further rejected emhart claim that it failed to use an objective standard in its trigger jury instruction.id.with respect to the north river policy,the district court rejected emhart claim that rhode island law applied to the policy,instead relying on the magistrate judge report to hold that new york law applied.id.at.the district court further rejected emhart claim that the court erred in its instruction concerning the sudden and accidental exclusion in the north river policy.id.at.
on november,the district court issued a final judgment that consolidated and memorialized its various findings and rulings.this appeal and followed.
ii.discussion 
the parties present several issues in this appeal and.we address each in turn.
century duty to defend 
application of the pleadings test 
in its appeal,century challenges the district court allowance of summary judgment in emhart favor,holding that century owed a duty to defend to emhart under both the century primary policy and the century excess policy.we review a district court award of summary judgment de novo.first marblehead house,cir.we may affirm summary judgment on any ground manifest in the record.see cmi capital mkt,llc,cir.
century contends that the district court erred in applying the pleadings test to both policies to determine whether century owed a duty to defend.the pleadings test under rhode island law requires the trial court to look at the allegations contained in the complaint,and if the pleadings recite facts bringing the injury complained of within the coverage of the insurance policy,the insurer must defend irrespective of the insured ultimate liability to the plaintiff.shelby ins.ne.structures,internal quotation omitted see also employers fire ins.beals.i n other words,when a complaint contains a statement of facts which bring the case within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy,the insurer has an unequivocal duty to defend.beals,at.
as background,the district court,despite some reluctance,addressed whether century owed a duty to defend by applying the pleadings test to the charging documents in this case,which the district court identified as the prp letter and the first,second,and third uaos.emhart,d at.the documents alleged that h azardous substances were disposed of at the site as part of the former operations of several chemical companies,and that emhart is a successor to liability of several chemical companies which operated at the site from approximately to approximately.id.quoting the uao,and noting that the other charging documents echo these allegations.although the charging documents alleged hazardous substances were disposed of during the relevant policy periods,they were silent as to whether such substances were discoverable at the site in,which the district court found to be a requirement to allege an occurrence under the century policies.see id.at see also cpc,int l,northbrook excess surplus ins,holding that an occurrence under a general liability policy takes place when property damage,which includes property loss,manifests itself or is discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence,is discoverable.the charging documents were silent on the issue of discoverability because it is irrelevant for purposes of determining cercla liability.see generally a.
the district court construed such silence against century,and found a duty to defend because of century failure to establish the absence of any such potential for coverage.emhart,d at.moreover,the district court rejected century plea to look at extrinsic evidence outside the charging documents to show the absence of coverage,noting that the duty to defend exists,if at all,regardless of the actual details of the injury or the ultimate grounds on which the insured liability to the injured party may be predicated.id.at quoting beals,at.
on appeal,century does not contend that the district court misapplied the pleadings test.rather,it argues that the district court decision to use the pleadings test was error.in essence,century builds upon the district court rumination that the rhode island supreme court has not had occasion to apply its relevant precedents to circumstances quite like these,id.at emphasis added,to argue that the rhode island supreme court would not apply its relevant precedents to a case like this.
century argues that extending the application of the pleadings test to this case would contravene the purposes of the test,which century maintains are twofold to ensure a prompt defense of the suit and to avoid litigating in the coverage case an issue to be decided in the merits case.for support,century relies on beals,a rhode island supreme court case that provided one of the first articulations of the pleadings test.see at.beals involved a declaratory judgment action brought by the insurer over whether it owed a duty to defend and indemnify to an insured,a child who caused injuries to a schoolmate with a pencil.id.at.noting that a declaratory judgment action is o ftentimes the most expeditious and fairest method by which to determine coverage,the court nevertheless upheld the trial court dismissal of the action to avoid a dress rehearsal of an important issue to be tried in the injury suit.id.at.
as to a prompt defense of the suit,century points out that emhart was able to select its own counsel,swidler berlin,well before it sent any notice to any insurer,that it incurred approximately eighteen months worth of expenses prior to locating the century policies at issue in this case,and that,rather than having to rely on a single insurer,emhart had multiple insurers to choose from to provide a defense.according to century,emhart did not require a prompt defense,but reimbursement.as to avoidance of litigation of merits issues,century argues that there was no risk of litigating in the coverage case an issue to be decided in the epa action,since,as noted by the district court,the charging documents were silent with respect to whether dioxin was discoverable at the site in,the determinative fact for purposes of coverage.emhart,d at.with neither purpose met,century argues that the rhode island supreme court,per beals,would not apply the pleadings test to this case.
century reads too much into beals.in beals,the rhode island supreme court addressed whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the declaratory judgment action,since,under rhode island law,the granting of a declaratory judgment is purely discretionary.at.as put by the rhode island supreme court,t he narrow issue raised by this appeal is whether or not the trial justice in denying insurer request for a declaratory judgment so abused his discretion as to warrant a reversal of his actions.id.at.it was in the context of this narrow issue that the rhode island supreme court discussed its concern with expeditious resolution of the coverage issue and the need to avoid a dress rehearsal of any merits issues.only after finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion did the rhode island supreme court make a comment relative to the duty owed by an insurer to the insured and discussed the pleading test.id.at.thus,the purposes that century identifies go to the appropriateness of declaratory relief,not the appropriateness of applying the pleadings test.
in fact,in beals and subsequent case law,the pleadings test has only been circumscribed in very narrow circumstances not applicable here.as articulated in beals,the pleadings test applies when the policy provides coverage even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false or fraudulent.see id.at quoting language of policy at issue see also id.at as a general rule,where the particular policy requires insurer to defend even if the suit is groundless,false or fraudulent,the insurer duty to defend is ascertained by laying the tort complaint alongside the policy emphasis added.both century policies contain this groundless,false or fraudulent language verbatim.
the one exception,identified by both parties,peerless ins.viegas,is inapposite.in peerless,which involved allegations of sexual molestation of a minor,the rhode island supreme court looked beyond the pleadings,which alleged negligence,to infer as a matter of law that the alleged conduct was intentional,and thus subject to the intentional act exclusion of the homeowners policy at issue in the case.id.at a plaintiff,by describing his or her cat to be a dog,can not simply by that descriptive designation cause the cat to bark.unlike in peerless,the charging documents in this case did not contain a misstated cause of action or similar allegations,which would have required that the district court find a potential for coverage as a matter of law.
nevertheless,century argues that the case law does not support imposition of the pleadings test here.century points out that the rhode island supreme court has only applied the pleadings test in tort cases involving a single insurer admittedly,the circumstances of this case bear little resemblance to the tort cases that century inventories.likewise,the rhode island supreme court has not explicitly applied the pleadings test to the cercla context with multiple insurers.nevertheless,we agree with the district court that the precedents are clear,emhart,d at,that the pleadings test applies to the century policies at issue.
however,century maintains that the rhode island supreme court has,in fact,refused to extend the pleadings test to environmental proceedings when it had the opportunity to do so,citing three cases of rhode island,aetna cas.sur,textron,aetna cas.sur,textron,aetna cas.sur.
in,which arose from an epa cercla action relating to contamination of a landfill,the insurers moved for summary judgment on both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify.at.with respect to the duty to defend,the insurers contended that the epa order did not contain any allegations of loss that occurred during the effective periods of the policies.id.at.the trial court allowed the insurers motions for summary judgment as to the insured claims on the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend.id.at.on appeal,the rhode island supreme court affirmed the trial court,and held that a careful review of the pleadings,memoranda,and affidavits reveals to us,as it apparently did for the trial justice,that the plaintiffs merely discuss the existence of general solid waste disposal at the site between and,but no occurrence within the relevant policy periods to trigger coverage.id.at emphasis added.century relies on this affidavits language to assert that,in,the rhode island supreme court eschewed the pleadings test and engaged in fact finding to resolve the duty to defend issue.
century also claims that the court similarly did not apply the pleadings test in and.century claims that in,the rhode island supreme court purportedly resolved the duty to defend issue on the basis of affidavits and deposition testimony relating to discoverability.see at.in,century claims that the court reversed and remanded the suit without specific direction to apply the pleadings test to the duty to defend issue.see at.
century reliance on,and is unavailing.as to,century asks us to read the rhode island supreme court reliance on a careful review of the pleadings,memoranda,and affidavits,at,in disposing of both the duty to defend and duty to indemnify to mean that the court looked at outside materials to determine the insurer duty to defend.this is too strained a reading.more plausibly,the rhode island supreme court found no evidence of an occurrence within the relevant policies coverage periods anywhere,including the affidavits,but also the pleadings.in fact,the rhode island supreme court described the defendant insurers motion for partial summary judgment as to the duty to defend this way t he defendants asserted that they had no present duty to defend the plaintiffs because the epa order did not contain any allegations of loss that occurred during the effective periods of their policies.id.at emphasis added.this language in strongly suggests that both the defendant insurers and the rhode island supreme court anticipated the application of the pleadings test to determine the insurers duty to defend,since this language frames the duty to defend issue as turning on the allegations contained in the charging documents,in that case the epa order.
century attempts to rehabilitate by arguing that the epa charging documents there were only silent as to whether there was an occurrence,since there was some evidence of general solid waste disposal at the site within the relevant policy periods.see id.at.according to century,had the rhode island supreme court in applied the pleadings test,then the court would have construed this silence against the insurers in that case,and at least found a duty to defend up to the allowance of summary judgment in the insurers favor as to the duty to indemnify,essentially adopting the approach taken by the district court in this case.
again century reads too much into.in,the rhode island supreme court did not just find silence.instead,the court found that even if such disposal was reasonably discoverable during the policy period,i t is clear that the epa order was concerned exclusively with contamination outside the relevant policy periods.see id.at emphasis added.accordingly,the charging documents in were not only silent as to coverage,but contained no potential for coverage whatsoever.
century also reads too much into and.in the rhode island supreme court did not apply the pleadings test because the duty to defend was not at issue.instead,the case concerned recovery for costs incurred in a voluntary cleanup,and,thus,there was no suit to defend.see,at instituting voluntary cleanup effort at gastonia site upon discovery of contamination of soil.likewise,in,the rhode island supreme court did not address the duty to defend at all.see at discussing issues on appeal as whether the court incorrectly applied the doctrine under rhode island law and whether the trial court erred in holding that the clauses precluded coverage.century points to pleadings in both and that suggest that the duty to defend was one of the issues presented to the rhode island supreme court.even if true,the rhode island supreme court never discussed the duty to defend issue in either case.such silence does not sufficiently support century claim that the rhode island supreme court would not apply the pleadings test in the cercla context.
century also asserts a number of policy arguments against the imposition of the pleadings test to this case.for example,century argues that,in the multiple insurer context,the pleadings test can be used as a weapon to be wielded at will against an individual insurer,essentially allowing an insured to pick its insurer for defense purposes.we need not address these concerns here,since the doctrine is clear,and this court,sitting in diversity,will not overrule the rhode island supreme court based on policy arguments alone.it was not error for the district court to apply the pleadings test to this case.
allocation of defense costs 
century contends in the alternative that the district court erred,as a matter of law,in allocating to century the total defense costs incurred prior to the jury verdict.we review this ruling of law de novo.see salve regina coll.russell,d holding that courts of appeals must review de novo district courts determinations of state law.
as background,the district court,in awarding total defense costs for century breach of the duty to defend,rejected century claim that century was only responsible for a pro rata share of the underlying defense costs.emhart,d at.in particular,the district court declined to adopt an alternative scheme of allocation proposed by century based upon the,which,according to century,would limit the defense costs based on the ratio between the periods of century coverage approximately a year and the period of dioxin exposure alleged by the epa years.id.at.
in rejecting the scheme,the court relied upon the all sums language in the century primary policy,which obligated century to pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage,and which further provided that century shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage.id.at.the district court also relied upon language in the century excess policy that provided that century will indemnify the insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit,further providing,mirroring the language in the primary policy,that century will have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such property damage.id.taken together,the district court interpreted the all sums and ultimate net loss language contained in the policies as placing no limit on the amount of defense costs that could be allocated to century.see id.at nothing in this language limits century defense obligation.
for further support of this all sums approach,the district court relied upon the rhode island supreme court decision in ins.of am.in,the rhode island supreme court imposed most of the indemnity costs on the breaching insurer despite the existence of other insurance.see id.at see also emhart,d at applying for all sums method,although noting that the rhode island supreme court did not endorse this approach in direct terms.
based on this authority in,the clear and unambiguous terms of the all sums and ultimate net loss language of the policies,and the rule that any ambiguities should be strictly construed against the insurer,see sentry ins.grenga,the district court adopted this all sums approach.according to the district court,the clear and ambiguous terms of the policies,combined with the rhode island case law,is enough to defeat century complex and,based on its ultimate result here,ridiculous allocation scheme.emhart,d at.
century argues that the district court committed error in using an all sums approach to allocate defense costs.century first contends that the district court,in relying on the all sums and ultimate net loss language,ignored the language stating that the policies appl y only to property damage which occurs during the policy period.century argues that this during the policy language limited the amount of defense costs recoverable.
we do not agree that the during the policy period language in the policies limits the amount of recovery.century relies on textron,aetna cas.sur,for the proposition that such language does limit recovery.there,textron,a named insured,acquired a company after the relevant policy period.id.at.textron sought coverage for the acquired company conduct during the policy period,arguing that textron insurance should cover the acquired entity conduct.id.at.the rhode island supreme court rejected textron claim,interpreting the during the policy period language of the policy at issue to exclude the acquired company from the named insureds since,during the policy period,textron had no relationship to the site or to the polluter.id.at.in so holding,the rhode island supreme court viewed the policies in their entirety and us ed the plain,ordinary,and usual meaning of the words to refuse to extend coverage to textron when,during the policy period,it had no relationship or connection to the party that actually caused the damage during the policy period.id.at.century contends that the during the policy period language in the policies similarly restricts the extent of coverage when reading the policies as a whole.
we view the matter differently.only addressed whether the during the policy period language prevented textron from recovering for damage caused by a party not named as an insured.it did not address the issue of whether such during the policy period language limited the amount recoverable for a breach of the duty to defend.
even if the during the policy period somehow could be extended to limit the total amount recoverable,such an interpretation would contravene the clear and unambiguous terms of the policies and lead to absurd results.the rhode island supreme court has eschewed engag ing in mental or verbal gymnastics to hurdle over the plain meaning of the policy language.am.commerce ins.porto.as stressed by the court in,both the rules of contract and the rules of common sense apply in construing an insurance policy.see,at.
the all sums and ultimate net loss language of both policies do not admit to any limitation,temporal or otherwise.instead,under the century primary policy,the during the policy period language is employed to define an occurrence under the policy.similarly,although the century excess policy does not have a separate occurrence definition,the during the policy period language is used within the conditional clause defining an occurrence that triggers coverage if the limits of liability of the underlying insurance are exhausted because of property damage during the policy period.emphasis added.while the rhode island supreme court has not addressed this precise issue,the massachusetts appeals court has taken the above trigger interpretation as the more reasonable one under illinois and massachusetts law.see chi.bridge iron certain underwriters at lloyd london,holding that property damage taking place during the policy period is what triggered the insurer obligation to indemnify,but the policy did not confine the extent of coverage to the policy period in which the property damage occurred.
construing the language in the way that century proposes would also lead to absurd results.it would require the court to divide the defense costs incurred in this case in such a way as to limit century share to the damage caused by during the brief period it purportedly contaminated the site.century proposed before the district court an allocation scheme based on the ratio of time covered by the policies approximately one year as compared to the total time covered by the epa action approximately years,greatly diminishing century coverage.such an allocative mechanism borders on the arbitrary,since other schemes could be proposed.tellingly,century does not propose such a scheme or any scheme in this appeal but more importantly,there is no connection between limiting coverage by the policy period and the amount of defense costs,which weighs strongly against reading the policies in the way that century proposes.
century also argues that the district court failed to follow rhode island precedent by refusing to allocate damages on a pro rata basis,which would involve dividing emhart total defense costs among emhart multiple insurers.century contends that this approach,which it dubs proportionate share setoff,is mandated by two rhode island supreme court decisions.the first,peloso imperatore,involved the breach of a duty to defend by two concurrent insurers.the insured subsequently brought suit against those two insurers for reimbursement of defense costs.the trial court allocated damages proportionally among both insurers,and the rhode island supreme court affirmed,holding that it is proper to prorate defense costs between concurrent insurers when both insurers have wrongfully refused to defend an insured.id.at.it noted that failure to prorate would promote a rule whereby t he insurer who wrongfully breached its duty to defend would be awarded a bonus for having done so,by having another company bear the cost.id.quoting marwell,underwriters at lloyd,london,alaska.
the second case is.century emphasizes the fact that the court discussed with approval a third circuit case,koppers aetna cas.sur,cir.in koppers,the third circuit reversed and remanded the trial court imposition of the total costs of defense on an excess insurer without reducing it by the amount of the insured settlements with other insurers.id.at.reviewing pennsylvania precedent,the third circuit held that 
excess insurers are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the loss in excess of the sum of the policy limits of the directly underlying,exhausted primary policies,and the combined pro rata shares of other settling primary and excess insurers.
koppers,at emphasis added see also,at quoting this language.although the court did not apply this koppers rule,it noted that a setoff may be applied in an appropriate case.at.century contends that peloso and compel the use of a proportionate share approach to this appropriate case.
we disagree.unlike in peloso,there is only one breaching party in this case,century.accordingly,the concern with a breaching party receiving a bonus for having done so is not implicated in this case.peloso,at.moreover,for whatever reason,century did not implead other possible breaching insurers to split the defense costs.
as to,we disagree with century reading of the case.in the rhode island supreme court addressed the narrow issue of whether a insurer who breached both the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify,was entitled to a based on settlements reached by other insurers.see at.the trial court allowed a narrow based on a known settlement,but precluded first state from introducing evidence of other insurers who could have covered losses,in part because the proffered documents had no probative value,and in part because first state was precluded from obtaining settlement documents due to alleged discovery misconduct.see id.at.although the rhode island supreme court discussed the rule in koppers,it relied upon the two different principles that koppers was based on contract principles and equitable principles.see id.at.applying these principles,the rhode island supreme court affirmed the district court imposition of the near total costs to first state because of the lack of evidence of other and considerations of policy not pertinent here.id.at.
thus,it is difficult to see how supports century claim that the district court erred.in fact,the opposite is true.as in,the district court applied contract principles by imposing the total defense costs to century,a breaching insurer,due in this case to the all sums language of the policies.see id.at noting with approval that,in koppers,the third circuit applied the same approach due to the all sums language in policies at issue.moreover,as in,the district court applied equitable principles in giving century a for the liberty mutual settlement,the only known settlement.see emhart,d at.
century argues that,unlike in,there was no misconduct committed by century that would have precluded century from proving other.accordingly,century argues,it is at least entitled to a remand to prove those.we disagree.as an initial matter,century had such an opportunity to prove additional and failed to do so.moreover,because there is no evidence in the record that other insurers had a duty to defend,any evidence proposed by century would only consist of possible insurers,and thus would be too general to provide a basis for a.see,at rejecting evidence of other potential in part because proffered documents had no probative value.finally,both and koppers focus on based on prior settlements,not just possibilities of coverage.in fact,the koppers language quoted by,and highlighted by century,states that the insurer is entitled to a based on the combined pro rata shares of other settling primary and excess insurers.koppers,at emphasis added see also,at quoting this language.this is exactly what the district court did in this case.
in sum,we find no error in the district court allocation of defense costs.
b.the duty to defend and its breach 
limitation of duty to defend and damages up to jury verdict 
in its,emhart argues that the duty to defend continues.accordingly,emhart contends that the district court erred in limiting the damages from century breach of the duty to defend to only those costs accrued as of the date of the jury verdict.emhart also contends that the district court erred by holding that onebeacon did not have a duty to defend under the onebeacon policy.as with all rulings of law,we review de novo.
the district court held that a ny duty to defend emhart in the present case ceased as of the date the jury found in favor of the insurers on the issue of indemnity.emhart,d at.the district court acknowledged that,generally,a n indemnity finding favorable to an insurer does not erase that insurer defense obligations,as long as the pleadings test has been satisfied.id.at.however,the district court held that such a duty ends upon a finding that the claims do not fall within the risk of coverage here,the date of the jury verdict.id.citing shelby,at see also id.at citing a number of cases supporting the proposition that a duty to defend ends when it is shown that there is no potential for coverage.
we agree with the district court analysis.emhart argues that the duty to defend continues because the risk of coverage contained in the epa charging documents remains.in particular,emhart asserts without pointing to anything in the record that the epa has not decided the scope of cercla liability for the site,and,consequently,the epa remains free to make additional allegations and findings that may affect the insurers duties to indemnify.according to emhart,the possibility for coverage,and the resultant duty to defend,remains.
we reject emhart claim.under rhode island law,questions of coverage,including the duty to defend,may be addressed in a separate declaratory judgment action.see conanicut marine,ins.of.the parties brought such a declaratory action in this case,and the jury findings of fact proved that indemnification coverage was not possible,thereby negating any duty to defend.see,shelby,at the plaintiff has a duty to defend the underlying action at trial until there has been a finding of fact that the cause of the collapse was excluded from coverage under the policy or until settlement has been reached.
emhart attempts to distinguish this case law.it claims that although,as a general proposition,a duty to defend can be determined through a separate declaratory judgment action,in this case the epa is not bound by the district court findings.according to emhart,t his is not a case where a declaratory judgment was used to negate coverage on grounds completely unrelated to the underlying allegations,such as late notice to the insurer.
however,this case is closer to a late notice situation than emhart asserts.although the epa is not bound by the district court findings,the epa will not make any determination with respect to the discoverability of the pollutants at issue in this case,because such a determination is completely unrelated to cercla liability.see emhart,d at noting that o f course the charging documents are silent with respect to whether dioxin was discoverable at the site in see also a indicating that liability is strict.as in a late notice declaratory judgment action,the only way to resolve the issue of discoverability is through a separate declaratory judgment action,which is exactly what happened in this case.
even so,emhart contends that the jury verdict did not preclude coverage.emhart maintains that is not responsible for the pollutants.necc is.consequently,the jury may have determined that the pollutants were not discoverable in the exercise of reasonable diligence during the policy periods because was not responsible for those pollutants,as it would have no reason to test for pollution unless it had contributed to the pollution itself.
emhart misstates the basis for the duty to defend.the century policies do not provide an defense.instead,the duty to defend under the policies only arises when,under the pleadings test,the charging documents allege claims that fall within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy.beals,at.here,the charging documents in the epa action provided such a potential until the jury verdict showed that any dioxin contamination was not reasonably discoverable,thereby removing all doubt.the fact that emhart may be innocent of that dioxin contamination is completely irrelevant to discoverability.
onebeacon duty to defend 
in its,emhart also contends that onebeacon owes a prospective duty to defend,that the duty to defend continues and that the limits of the century policies are likely to be reached.because emhart claim is premised on its prior claim that the duty to defend continues,we reject it.for the same reasons,we do not address onebeacon claim that the onebeacon policy is entitled to reformation.
indemnity as damages 
emhart also argues in its that it is entitled to full indemnity costs as damages.it relies on conanicut marine,ins.of,in which the rhode island supreme court awarded total indemnity costs as damages for a breach of the duty to defend.we review de novo.
conanicut was a case where a customer injured herself at a marina and sued for damages.the marina unsuccessfully sought a defense from its insurer.the marina later settled the claim for,and then sued the insurer to recover the settlement amount.in affirming judgment for the marina,the insured,the rhode island supreme court held that 
where an insurer refuses to defend an insured pursuant to a policy,the insurer will be obligated to pay,in addition to the costs of defense and attorneys fees,the award of damages or settlement assessed against the insured.
id.at emphasis added.the conanicut court noted that indemnity as damages would apply even if the judgment or settlement exceeds the policy limits.id.at see also asermely allstate ins,insurer who refuses to settle a claim within policy limits is liable for excess judgments.
emhart pressed its claim for indemnity as damages under conanicut to the district court,but the court refused.the district court engaged in a lengthy discussion of possible exceptions century could claim to avoid indemnity as damages,rejecting all and noting that t his leaves century standing on a precipice.see emhart,d at 
the district court,however,ultimately refused to apply conanicut on two grounds.first,the district court predicted that rhode island courts would not apply conanicut in circumstances like these,relying on case law that allows a court to overrule an outmoded decision by predicting that the state highest court would,if presented with the opportunity,do the same.see id.at citing,among other cases,quint staley,cir.the district court based that prediction on a number of grounds.it noted that a number of courts have rejected the use of estoppel in this context that is,estopping an insurer from disclaiming a duty to indemnify where the insurer has breached the duty to defend.id.citing cases.moreover,rhode island state courts have similarly rejected the use of estoppel to extend the scope of insurance coverage.see id.at citing cases.rhode island state courts have not applied conanicut since it was promulgated,and courts in other jurisdictions have rejected applying a similar conanicut rule in the cercla context.id.at citing cases.taken together,the district court concluded that it was unlikely that the rhode island courts would apply conanicut on an estoppel rationale to this context.id.at.
second,the district court ruled that,under rhode island law,the proper measure of damages for breach of contract is that which the injured party can tie to the breach itself.id.at.since emhart has not proven any contract damages beyond the costs of defense,the district court held that emhart was not entitled to indemnity.id.
we agree with the second ground.both parties spill a lot of ink on the first ground,arguing back and forth over whether rhode island courts would extend conanicut to this case,citing numerous authorities.however,in its briefing emhart contends that conanicut is not based on principles of estoppel or waiver,and,accordingly,it is only entitled to the full amount which will compensate the insured for all the detriment caused by the insurer breach of the express and implied obligations of the contract.conanicut,at quoting comunale traders ins,cal d,emphasis added.thus,emhart argues that conanicut is entirely consistent with existing rhode island precedent,and does not require this court to address whether it is outmoded in the least.
of course,emhart can not,and does not,show that the entire cost of the cleanup was caused by the breach.to get around this,emhart conceives of conanicut as implicitly promulgating a bright line rule that applies given the inherent difficulty in determining the damages caused by a breach of the duty to defend.as emhart admits,conanicut itself does not contain any such bright line language.emhart only points to an unpublished opinion that rationalizes a similar rule in this way.see total petroleum,hartford acc.indem,wl,at cir,unpublished decision one basis for this rule seems to lie in the law reluctance to allow the insurer to benefit from the uncertainty created when it renounces its duty.
even if conanicut could be read as imposing a bright line rule for the imposition of damages,which we doubt,at a minimum emhart would still have to provide some showing that century failure to defend caused it damage with respect to its liability in the epa proceedings.as with all breaches of contract,the burden is on the breached party to prove damages.see george george berkander,affirming trial court determination that the complainant had failed to sustain the burden of proving that he had incurred any damage by reason of the breach.emphasis added.there is nothing in the record to suggest that emhart incurred any damages from century breach beyond its defense costs,thus triggering such a bright line rule.
moreover,in the absence of some showing of damage,applying conanicut mechanical ly,see emhart,d at,would risk conflicting with rhode island and supreme court precedent,since the only remaining rationale for imposition of damages would be estoppel or punitive.as noted earlier,rhode island courts have refused the application of estoppel to extend insurance coverage.see,zarrella.mut.life ins,holding,without discussing conanicut,that the doctrine of equitable estoppel shall not apply to enlarge the scope of insurance benefits.it would also put this court in the thorny position of determining whether such an award,to the tune of close to million,would violate the due process clause.bmw of,gore,d noting that one indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award under the due process clause is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff,citing cases.
the district court was therefore correct to demand some evidence of a relationship between century breach and emhart damages,thus avoiding significant issues concerning rhode island precedent,not to mention constitutional law.united states,cir the maxim that courts should not decide constitutional issues when this can be avoided is as old as the rocky mountains and embedded in our legal culture for about as long.we accordingly find no error.
c.the jury verdict 
in its,emhart also raises various challenges to the jury verdict.
continuous trigger or instruction 
emhart challenges the district court jury instruction with respect to the appropriate trigger of coverage for the duty to indemnify under the century policies and the onebeacon policy.emhart contends that the district court should have instructed the jury using a continuous trigger or standard.a continuous trigger standard charges a loss to policies in effect from the time of exposure to manifestation,and,thus,presumes injury from the time of exposure through manifestation.emhart,d at.in contrast,an standard triggers coverage only when an injury occurs during the policy period.
a refusal to give an instruction is reversible error only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporat
