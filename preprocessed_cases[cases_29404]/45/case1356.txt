taco bell has sued two insurance companies,zurich and continental,each of which had issued it a policy.the basis of federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship,and the substantive issues are governed,the parties tacitly agree,by illinois law.the suit seeks a declaration that the insurance companies have a duty to pay for taco bell defense against a diversity lawsuit that has been brought against it in a federal district court in michigan by a design agency named wrench.that suit has already given rise to nine judicial opinions,beginning with wrench llc taco bell,wl,and is still going strong.taco bell settled with continental.the district court,on summary judgment,awarded the declaratory relief sought by taco despite the settlement awarded it against continental as well as zurich.the court also ordered zurich to pay taco bell for defense costs already incurred by the latter in the wrench litigation and an additional for the cost to taco bell of litigating this suit against zurich.finally,the court ordered zurich to pay continental million,representing the taco bell defense costs that continental had paid.we have rounded off the dollar figures.zurich appeals,as does continental,which would like the judgment against it vacated and also would like zurich to be ordered to pay a larger share of taco bell defense costs.
the amended complaint in wrench suit now on appeal to the sixth circuit after the award of substantial damages to wrench alleges the following in wrench developed a marketing gimmick that it called psycho chihuahua,which involved the image of a clever,feisty chihuahua dog with an attitude,the idea being to use the humor of seeing a small dog character with a big dog attitude.at a trade show the following year,taco bell expressed interest in using the design to promote its restaurants.wrench proposed to taco bell an advertising campaign based on a chihuahua with an attitude obsessed with taco bell food,describing the chihuahua to be used in the campaign as edgy and feisty,with a spicy mexican personality and an insatiable craving for taco bell food.beginning in the summer of,taco bell,without obtaining permission from wrench,began running television commercials on the theme of a chihuahua obsessed with the thought of taco bell food to the exclusion of anything else,including a female chihuahua.what is more,the next year taco bell based its entire national advertising campaign on the same basic idea of a chihuahua with an attitude that is obsessed with taco bell food.taco bell has also used several of the specific commercial ideas provided by wrench in its campaign,including the idea of using a live dog manipulated by computer graphic imaging,the idea of having a boy chihuahua passing up a girl chihuahua for taco bell food,the idea of using a bobbing head doll in a commercial,the idea of having a chihuahua sneaking into the rear window of a car to obtain taco bell food,the idea of a chihuahua popping his head out through a hole at the end of a commercial,and the idea of using a consistent tag line at the end of every commercial to keep the chihuahua as a consistent icon for taco bell.these alleged appropriations of wrench design ideas are,so far as bears on our case,charged as misappropriation in violation of the common law of michigan.
the insurance policies that continental and zurich issued to taco bell were similar but covered occurrences in different periods.continental covered the period january,to october,and zurich ran from october,to the end of.both policies covered advertising injury,defined in both as injury arising out of paid announcements in the broadcast media resulting from misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.it is apparent that wrench complaint charges advertising injury.but zurich appeals to the policy exclusion for advertising injury arising out of oral or written publication of material whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.the first chihuahua ads ran before the coverage under zurich policy began,and zurich argues that therefore taco bell entire advertising campaign,most of which occurred later,had first been published before the policy took effect if so,zurich is off the hook.
the purpose of the prior publication exclusion a common clause in contracts,though rarely litigated can be illustrated most clearly with reference to liability insurance for copyright infringement.suppose a few months before insurance coverage began on october,the insured published an infringing book that it continued selling after october.the prior publication exclusion would bar coverage because the wrongful behavior had begun prior to the effective date of the insurance policy.the purpose of insurance is to spread as the risk that an advertising campaign might be deemed if the risk has already materialized,what is there to insure matagorda ventures,travelers lloyds ins,d.the risk has become a certainty.that would be true in this case had taco bell during the period covered by zurich policy just rebroadcast the commercials it had broadcast before october.
the later commercials were different from the earlier ones,however,though that in itself need not be decisive.suppose a magazine article that infringed copyright and was published before the policy period began was republished later as part of an anthology.the anthology would be a different,probably a much different,work from the magazine,but the wrongful copying of the copyrighted article without be the same and so the exclusion would,we believe we can find no reported cases on the question,click in.zurich argues in like vein that while the commercials broadcast after october were different from the earlier ones,they used the same misappropriated design,namely the idea of the chihuahua with attitude.
zurich is wrong.wrench complaint the duty of an insurance company to defend against a suit against its insured is determined by the allegations of the complaint in that suit rather than by what is actually proved,dixon distributing hanover ins,american alliance ins.restaurant group,d,roman catholic diocese maryland casualty,cir illinois law that those later commercials appropriated not only the basic idea psycho chihuahua but other ideas as well that are protected by michigan common law of misappropriation,like the idea of the chihuahua poking its head through a hole at the end of the commercial.this is a modest idea.who knows whether it really protected by michigan law there are no cases on point other than the district court decision in wrench suit,which as we said is currently on appeal yet not preempted by federal copyright law.but that is not the issue.the charge of misappropriation of the idea of the chihuahua head popping out of a hole is a claim of advertising injury,meritorious or not and taco bell bought insurance against having to pay the entire expense of defending against such claims.
at some point a difference between the republished version of an unlawful work and the original version would be so slight as to be immaterial.see ringler associates maryland casualty,th,d,noyes american motorists ins.but that observation can not save the insurer when the republication contains new matter that the plaintiff in the liability suit against the insured alleges as fresh wrongs.wrench complaint claims that taco bell stole the basic idea before october,and used it in its earliest commercials,which predated zurich coverage,but that it stole additional,subordinate but still protected,ideas as well and incorporated them into the later commercials.
the only thing that gives the slightest color to zurich invocation of the prior publication exclusion is a certain vagueness in the misappropriation tort compared to copyright infringement.the copyright infringer copies an expressive work or a significant part of it that is fixed in any tangible medium of expression,a erickson trinity theatre,cir martha graham school dance foundation,martha graham center of contemporary dance,cir,and that therefore has pretty definite metes and bounds.the misappropriator,or at least this alleged misappropriator,takes an idea and the boundaries of an idea can be quite uncertain.if wrench idea of a psycho chihuahua advertising campaign is defined broadly enough,it encompasses all the subordinate ideas embodied in the later commercials.but this possibility is irrelevant.we repeat that the duty to defend is determined by what is charged in the complaint.wrench complaint charges the misappropriation of the subordinate ideas as separate torts,and those torts occurred during the period covered by zurich policy.
zurich has other strings to its bow,however.its policy requires the insured to notify it promptly of an event that might trigger liability under the policy an occurrence,in,and adds that in the event of noncompliance with the requirement zurich shall not be required to establish prejudice resulting from noncompliance but shall be automatically relieved of liability with respect to the claim.wrench filed its suit against taco bell on january,taco bell did notify zurich of the suit until june,four and a half months later.
an insurer wants to be notified of a suit against its insured as soon as possible,to give it ample time to investigate the case,determine whether its duty to defend has been triggered,and if so prepare the defense of the case hence promptly.and it does want to have to prove prejudice,and need do so even if the policy does explicitly excuse such proof,as it did here.northbrook property casualty ins.applied systems,d,american country ins.bruhn,d,hartford accident indemnity.luke medical center,d,highlands ins.lewis rail service,cir illinois law.yet these cases are explicit that illinois law,albeit rather in the teeth of the wording of the notice clauses in insurance policies,makes the prejudice to the insurer from late notice a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the notice,unless the delay is extreme,as in northbrook property casualty ins.applied systems,supra,at months,and general casualty juhl,d,months see also highlands ins.lewis rail service,cir years.this result can be defended by reference to the general principle of contract law that breaches that are technical,harmless,and therefore immaterial do not allow the victim of the breach to walk away from the contract to the great harm of the party that committed the harmless breach,elda arnhold byzantio,ocean atlantic woodland,cir illinois law arrow master,unique forming,cir illinois law jacob youngs,kent,cardozo.for that would be a disproportionate sanction contrary to commercial custom and unlikely to have been actually intended by the parties.so,since the delay here was modest,zurich can invoke the notice clause only if there is some evidence that it suffered at least some prejudice from taco bell delay.
it argues that it did because the commercials continued to run during the four and a half months that elapsed between wrench suit and the notification of the suit to zurich,and if only it had known about the suit it would have taken steps to prevent taco bell from continuing to run the commercials.but what steps could it have taken the insurance policy did authorize it to review taco bell commercials and if it thought them tortious force taco bell to yank them.if taco bell was willing to assume the risk of liability to wrench by continuing to run the commercials after wrench it would it have desisted at zurich urging maybe it would have done so had zurich said it would defend the suit otherwise,though we know that this would have been an empty threat.but the decisive fact is that that when zurich did receive notice of the litigation,it took no steps to try to make taco bell cancel the commercials even though they were continuing to run and thus increasing wrench damages and therefore also zurich potential liability to taco bell on the insurance policy.there is no reason to suppose that if zurich had received notice earlier it would have taken such steps its incentive would not have been much greater,though a little greater because more of the injury to wrench and the resulting liability of taco bell and derivately of zurich would have lain in the future.
we conclude that zurich defenses to its duty to defend fail.but zurich has three complaints that we have now to consider about the amount of defense costs that it has been ordered to pay taco bell and continental.the first has to do with a retention clause in zurich policy.only after taco bell paid the first million of defense costs would zurich duty to pay kick in.there was no similar provision in continental policy.taco bell has incurred defense costs of some million,of which more than million have been paid by continental,and the district court ordered zurich to reimburse continental for of the excess of those costs over the million retention,or roughly,for remember that we rounding off dollar figures million.zurich argues that what the court should have done was to divide the total defense costs in half this on the assumption,which we examine later,that is the proper method of allocating defense costs between the two insurers and then subtract the retention from zurich share.that would yield a figure for reimbursement to continental not of but of million million million,which would require an adjustment in zurich favor of million.
zurich is right.taco bell agreed that it would pay the first million of any defense costs for which zurich would otherwise be responsible.were there no retention provision,zurich would be responsible,under the district court method of allocation,for million in defense costs.but the retention provision cut this by million.continental did not negotiate a provision and is not entitled to benefit from zurich provision.
next zurich complains about the amount of defense costs incurred by taco bell.zurich submitted an affidavit by a firm that hires itself out to review lawyers bills and that opined that taco bell had overpaid the lawyers who represented it in the wrench litigation.we are unimpressed,as was the district court.when taco bell hired its lawyers,and indeed at all times since,zurich was vigorously denying that it had any duty to duty,therefore,to reimburse taco bell.because of the resulting uncertainty about reimbursement,taco bell had an incentive to minimize its legal expenses for it might not be able to shift them and where there are market incentives to economize,there is no occasion for a painstaking judicial review.kallman radioshack,cir medcom holding baxter travenol laboratories,cir balcor real estate holdings,cir blum stenson,d.the affidavit of the firm that picked through taco bell legal bills is excruciatingly detailed.the amount of time and money that went into its preparation and would be incurred in adjudicating its accuracy probably exceeds the potential excesses that it identifies.
although the cases that we have just cited are all diversity cases arising in illinois,none discusses illinois law and zurich points us to kaiser mepc american properties,d,which holds that even in a case in which fee shifting is specified in a contract that does not in so many words limit the entitlement to reasonable fees,not only must the party asking for an award of fees prove that they are reasonable but in addition the petition for fees must specify the services performed,by whom they were performed,the time expended thereon and the hourly rate charged therefor.because of the importance of these factors,it is incumbent upon the petitioner to present detailed records maintained during the course of the litigation containing facts and computations upon which the charges are predicated.this was said in general,rather than with specific reference to a case in which there is an adequate market test of the fees.but what is more important is that even in a diversity suit the requirements of proof are governed by federal rather than state law.the decision to hold an evidentiary hearing when making an attorney fee award is a matter of procedure,and is therefore governed by federal law under the erie doctrine.shakey,covalt,cir see also mangold california public utilities comm n,cir karl,sunrise computers,cir schafler fairway park condominium ass n,d,but see security mutual life ins.of new york contemporary real estate ass
