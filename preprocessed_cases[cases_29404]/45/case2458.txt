introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants rose,austin,and logan are the heirs of a motorcyclist who died in an accident caused by an employee,juan bibinz bibinz,of sinco,sinco.sinco had an automobile liability policy issued by general insurance company of america general,an excess and umbrella policy issued by fireman fund insurance company fireman fund,and a commercial general liability cgl policy issued by fireman fund plaintiffs partially settled with sinco and bibinz for the full policy limits under the automobile policy and the excess and umbrella policy.fireman fund denied coverage under the cgl policy and,under that policy,refused to defend an action by plaintiffs against sinco.in the partial settlement,plaintiffs,sinco,and bibinz agreed to arbitrate plaintiffs claims,and plaintiffs took an assignment of sinco claims under the cgl policy against fireman fund.
after the arbitrator award to plaintiffs of more than million,plaintiffs filed this bad faith action against fireman fund.before the trial court on a demurrer to the complaint,fireman fund contended that bibinz was an insured under the cgl policy,and therefore the exclusion in the policy for automobile accidents applied.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,holding that the cgl policy provided no coverage for the automobile accident that caused plaintiffs damages.
plaintiffs assert,inter alia,that the policy definition of insured is not equivalent to vicarious tort liability bibinz was not an insured,and therefore the automobile accident exclusion did not apply and fireman fund had a duty to defend the claim under the cgl policy because there is a potential for coverage due to the possibility that bibinz was not an insured under the policy definition.in affirming the order of dismissal,we hold under the complaint and matters judicially noticed that bibinz was an insured,rendering the automobile exclusion in the cgl policy applicable,and that fireman fund had no duty to defend sinco.
background 
as this case arises from a demurrer,we set forth the following allegations in the complaint and matters of which the trial court took judicial notice.
michael sprinkles,the husband of rose sprinkles and father of austin and logan sprinkles,died as a result of a motorcycle accident caused by bibinz,an employee of sinco.plaintiffs filed an action against sinco and bibinz the sinco action alleging that sinco negligently hired bibinz,an uninsured and undocumented alien with a lengthy criminal record,who negligently drove his vehicle causing the death of michael sprinkles.plaintiffs also alleged that each of the defendants was an employee and agent of the other acting within the scope of his or its authority.
at the time of the accident,sinco had a commercial automobile policy issued by general with a limit,an excess and umbrella policy issued by fireman fund with a limit,and a cgl policy issued by fireman fund with a limit.general,the auto insurer,and fireman fund,the insurer of the excess over the automobile policy,agreed to provide coverage.fireman fund separately denied coverage under the cgl policy.
plaintiffs partially settled the sinco action,with general paying its primary limit and with fireman fund paying its excess limit.the settlement agreement included an assignment to plaintiffs of rights that sinco may have against fireman fund,and a provision that the plaintiffs would not execute on or record any judgment they obtained against sinco or bibinz in excess of the million combined policy limits that the insurers agreed to pay.the settlement agreement also provided for an arbitration on the merits of plaintiffs claims and that the defendants in the sinco action had neither the obligation nor the right to present a defense or to witnesses,but that the parties and their counsel would do everything necessary to ensure a full,fair and complete assessment and resolution of liability and damages.plaintiff rose sparkles petitioned to approve the partial settlement of the sinco action on behalf of the minor plaintiffs.
the arbitration conducted by judge diane wayne,superior court judge ret,resulted in an award to plaintiffs that exceeded and a finding that bibinz was,at the time of the accident,acting within the course and scope of his employment under the required vehicle exception to the going and coming rule and that sinco had been negligent in hiring and retaining bibinz.the arbitrator stated that at the time of the accident,bibinz was employed by sinco,a property management company,to service various properties in a single day and therefore needed his automobile to visit job sites he was on his way to work in the vehicle he used to go to the job sites and he was under the influence of drugs and driving erratically.the arbitration award was confirmed by the superior court,and a judgment was entered on that award.
plaintiffs then filed this action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,wrongful refusal to settle,wrongful failure to defend,and breach of the insurance contract.plaintiffs also asserted a claim under insurance code section direct right of judgment creditor against an insurer shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th.plaintiffs alleged that bibinz was not an insured under the policy.they alleged,at the time of the accident,bibinz was not performing duties related to the conduct of sinco business and there was a potential for a finding that bibinz was not acting in the scope of his employment with sinco.the complaint included as exhibits pertinent portions of the fireman fund cgl policy,plaintiffs complaint in the sinco action,and the judgment confirming the arbitration award.the trial court took judicial notice of other filings by plaintiffs the minors compromise petitions for austin and logan sprinkles and the petition to confirm the arbitration award,which included the settlement agreement and the arbitration award.
fireman fund demurred,asserting that the complaint failed to state a cause of action.the trial court sustained fireman fund demurrer without leave to amend and entered its order of dismissal.plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal.

duty to defend

an authority stated with regard to cgl policies as follows the standard commercial general liability insurance policy was originally promulgated in under the title of comprehensive general liability.since that time,the standard form has undergone five principal revisions,the most recent of which came into use in at which time the name of the policy was changed from comprehensive to commercial.most modern commercial general liability insurance policies in the united states are written on standardized forms which are developed by the insurance services office,commercial general liability policies are designed to protect the insured against losses to third parties arising out of the operation of the insured business.consequently,a loss must arise out of the insured business operations in order to be covered under the policy issued to the insured.risks incidentally related to the operation of the insured business will generally fall within coverage.commercial general liability policies are not,however,strictly confined to operations performed on the insured business premises.couch on insurance,to.generally,cgl policies exclude bodily injury arising out of the use of automobiles.see stempel,assessing the coverage carnage asbestos liability and insurance after three decades of dispute.ins.couch on insurance ed.iso properties.commercial general liability cg,form policy,section g miller and lefebvre,miller standard insurance policies annot.ed.
interpretation and application of the policy 
plaintiffs contentions 
under the cgl policy,the definition of insured includes employees,but only for acts within the scope of their employment while performing duties related to the conduct of your business.plaintiffs assert that this provision is unusual,as most cgl policies separate with a disjunctive the two of employment and performing duties.see iso properties,commercial general liability cg,supra,section ii a miller and lefebvre,miller standard insurance policies annot,supra,at.here,the policy only covers acts of employees within the scope of their employment while performing duties related to the conduct of sinco business.plaintiffs assert that the latter phrase limits or is an added condition to the within the scope of employment condition.according to plaintiffs,the two conditions are not identical.thus,according to plaintiffs,fireman fund narrowed the definition of insured,it thereby narrowed the scope of its automobile exclusion.although the arbitrator concluded that sinco was liable under a respondeat superior theory because bibinz was acting within the scope of his employment,the insurance policy language is different than the requirement for establishing respondeat superior.accordingly,plaintiffs contend that there is a potential for finding that bibinz was not an,was not an employee acting within the scope of his employment while performing duties related to the conduct of sinco business when he was driving to work.
the arbitrator found that bibinz was on his way to work in a vehicle that was used to transport him from job to job in a single day at the direction of his employer,sinco while working in maintenance for sinco,bibinz visited
