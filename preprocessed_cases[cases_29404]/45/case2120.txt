the issue in this appeal is whether the district court erred when it granted a surety motion for new trial after the jury found the surety settled a claim in bad faith.the surety,insurance company,issued a bond in favor of rivermar contracting company rivermar securing the performance of southeast floating docks,and its president,alan simpson collectively southeast.in connection with the bond,southeast executed an indemnity agreement in favor of.rivermar made a claim on southeast bond,and subsequently settled with rivermar and paid the full amount of the bond.filed suit against southeast for indemnification for its losses resulting from what it maintained was a good faith payment of the bond to rivermar.southeast defended on the ground it was not required to indemnify because had settled with rivermar in bad faith.the jury returned a verdict in favor of southeast,finding by a preponderance of the evidence that did not settle rivermar claim against the bond in good faith.the district court subsequently granted motion for a new trial,concluding southeast failed to produce any credible evidence contradicting evidence that it acted in good faith and the jury conclusion on the issue of bad faith was against the great weight of the evidence we reverse and reinstate the jury verdict because it is supported by the evidence.
standard of review 
our review of a district court grant of a new trial is extremely stringent when the district court discards the verdict on the ground it is against the great weight of the evidence.redd city of phenix city,cir.while it is within a district court discretion to grant a new trial if it finds a jury verdict is against the great,not merely the greater weight of the evidence,our application of this more rigorous standard of review ensures the district court does not simply substitute its own credibility choices and inferences for the reasonable choices and inferences made by the jury.id.at see also hardin hayes,cir noting the scope of discretion is narrower when the district court concludes the jury verdict was contrary to the great weight of the evidence if the jury verdict is supported by the evidence,then it is immaterial that we or the district judge would have arrived at the same verdict because it is not our place to substitute our judgment for that of the jury.see redd,at griffin,cir the question is whether or not reasonable jurors could have concluded as this jury did based upon the evidence presented.
in our extremely stringent review,we will examine the legal standard by which the jury was instructed to evaluate duty of good faith in handling and settling of the claim,along with southeast theory of bad faith in the subsequent sections of this opinion,we will consider the evidence the jury heard at trial and then determine whether reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence support the jury verdict.
ii.background 
a.the legal standard 
the jury was instructed that for southeast to prove settled the claim with rivermar in bad faith,southeast had the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence acted with an improper motive or with a dishonest purpose the jury was also instructed to analyze whether conduct was reasonable under the circumstances,because unreasonable conduct can be evidence of an improper motive.both parties and the district court relied on a factually analogous case,pse consulting,frank mercede sons,which addressed a surety duty of good faith in handling a bond claim we agree with the pse consulting court conclusion that a surety failure to conduct an adequate investigation of a claim upon a bond,when accompanied by other evidence,reflecting an improper motive,properly may be considered as evidence of the surety bad faith.id.at.
we draw from pse consulting that bad faith requires an improper motive or dishonest purpose on the part of the surety.id.at.moreover,improper motive can be evidenced by unreasonable conduct on the part of the surety.id.at.however,unreasonable conduct,including a negligent investigation of a claim,does not by itself constitute bad faith rather,to give rise to an inference of bad faith,such conduct must be accompanied by other evidence of improper motive,such as a settlement.id.at see also engbrock fed.ins,cir n either lack of diligence nor negligence is the equivalent of bad faith and improper motive,which is not alleged,is an essential element of bad faith.fid.guar.feibus,d,a lack of diligence or negligence is not the equivalent of bad faith,indeed even gross negligence can not support a finding of bad faith.while neither evidence of an inadequate and unreasonable investigation nor a settlement standing alone would be sufficient to support a finding of bad faith,when coupled together a jury could reasonably infer a surety improper motive.see pse consulting,at.
southeast theory of bad faith 
a bad faith settlement requires an improper motive on the part of,which can be shown by unreasonable conduct coupled with a settlement.southeast argued to the jury paid rivermar the full amount of the bond,after performing an inadequate and unreasonable investigation of rivermar claim,with the motive of releasing itself from rivermar bad faith claim.southeast demonstrated that for more than three years supported southeast defenses to rivermar claim that the concrete floating dock system was defective.abruptly shifted its assessment of the dock system after an attorney of,who was previously unfamiliar with the case,became aware of rivermar bad faith claim against.then hired an attorney,who had previously represented rivermar parent company,to the rivermar claim.with only an incomplete,secretly met with rivermar and settled the claim for the full amount of the bond.received a release of all claims against it,including a withdrawal of rivermar bad faith claim,whereas the settlement for which seeks indemnification from southeast did not release southeast from any of rivermar claims.southeast argued this settlement,accompanied by an unreasonable handling of rivermar claim,is evidence did not settle in good faith.
before turning to whether the jury reasonably could have inferred settled the claim with rivermar in bad faith,we will review the evidence presented at trial.
iii.facts presented at trial 
southeast manufactured and sold concrete floating docks.in august,southeast and rivermar contracted for a concrete floating dock system for a marina project at harbour village marina in ponce inlet,florida the marina,for which southeast was bonded by a performance bond from.the concrete floating dock system was composed of billets of styrofoam encased in a concrete shell.the billets had connecting wood walers that would rise up and down on pilings as the tide ebbed and flowed.southeast contract with rivermar was only for the manufacture and delivery of the dock system,not its installation.southeast submitted a proposal to install the dock system for,but rivermar gave the job to another installer for.
after the dock segments were delivered and while installation was underway,rivermar produced to southeast a punch list of items that it claimed were defects with the dock system.items on the punch list included improper alignment of the billets,cracking in the billets,and an insufficient amount of dock floating above the water level insufficient free board.southeast concluded the punch list items were installation issues and recommended rivermar contact the installer.southeast also attempted to show the installer how to remedy some of the installation issues,but the installer failed to do so because it was already paid by rivermar and had another job opportunity elsewhere.citing the unresolved problems mentioned in the punch list,rivermar refused to pay southeast the unpaid balance of its materials,totaling.southeast filed suit in state court for the unpaid balance in july.rivermar counterclaimed against southeast for breach of contract and added as an additional counterclaim defendant by virtue of southeast performance bond.
southeast attorney in the state court litigation was rosemary hayes,who had a relationship with southeast.stan smith,claims manager,hired tim traster to represent in the state court litigation.smith later agreed to allow hayes to also represent,with traster assuming a monitoring role and reporting to smith and bob kamp,an attorney at.
according to hayes,the litigation with rivermar was extremely contentious with rivermar fighting tooth and nail over every single piece of paper.over pleadings were filed in the state court action,and hayes explained she had to obtain a court order basically to do anything.for example,rivermar steadfastly refused southeast access to the marina to inspect the allegedly defective docks,and after southeast obtained a court order for access,it discovered upon arrival at the marina the specific finger pier that featured prominently in rivermar case against southeast had been moved offsite.hayes also stated that,in addition to requiring court orders to do anything,rivermar would not cooperate in scheduling the hearings held in the case.hayes testified that in her twenty years of experience,she had never seen a case with so many hearings or amended counterclaims.
traster and hayes discussed the litigation often.of the thirty hearings,traster attended all but one of them.traster was also present for mediation and joined in southeast private caucus.traster was seated behind southeast counsel table the day trial was set to begin.in traster status reports to smith he never indicated hayes was inappropriately handling the litigation.in fact,traster reports stated there was nothing he would do differently.traster agreed with hayes that there was no merit to rivermar claim and informed smith and kamp in september that he did not see any exposure on the part of southeast or.in april,traster reported to smith there had been settlement talks between southeast and rivermar.consistent with traster and hayes impressions of the weakness of rivermar case,did not require collateral from southeast and maintained an internal reserve of only through more than three years of litigation.indeed,did not raise its reserve or demand collateral even after rivermar,in july,filed a civil remedy notice with the florida department of insurance claiming was acting in bad faith in refusing to settle its bond claim.
with respect to the factual strength of southeast defense,alan simpson,southeast president,testified regarding other likely causes for rivermar claimed defects in the dock system simpson testified the floating dock system must be maintained for the life of the marina.the rods and bolts connecting the dock segments must be periodically retightened,as the treated lumber of the walers on top of the concrete floats would often shrink.the rods should be tightened with hand pressure rather than an air gun because overtightening the bolts could cause the concrete to crack.simpson testified the dock system at the marina was not properly installed,was left incomplete,and was not properly maintained.in response to opposing counsel questioning about a dock report in that found excessive cracking,simpson testified i would doubt it if it had been sitting there without any maintenance or ever being installed,through hurricanes and all that.they lucky they got it at all.
the trial of the state court action was set to begin may.hayes testified she was prepared to try the case for southeast.however,as the jury was being selected,rivermar requested a continuance.hayes opposed the continuance arguing it was not necessary.nonetheless,the trial was continued.
shifted its position on the rivermar claim in september.tom froman,assistant vice president in legal department,received a call from fred pinckney,general counsel for rivermar parent company,asi,regarding rivermar claim.pinckney criticized hayes handling of the state court case and warned froman that faced a significant bad faith claim from rivermar.froman had not been involved in the litigation between rivermar and southeast and was unaware of the matter,even though southeast bond was a construction bond and froman was involved in most of construction bond litigation.in fact,froman testified he first learned of the rivermar claim from pinckney.after the initial phone call,pinckney and froman began communicating with each other via letter.pinckney continued to complain to froman about hayes handling of the case on october,four days after receiving additional correspondence from pinckney and without performing an investigation of his own,froman raised the reserve from to.
from his discussions with pinckney,froman became concerned about rivermar bad faith claim.froman hired tom crafton,an attorney with expertise in bad faith litigation,to investigate rivermar claim.crafton,however,had substantial connections with asi.he represented asi in litigation in and.for years,crafton had been with an attorney who litigated for asi in federal court around the country.a partner in crafton law firm represented a company owned by fred treadway,the largest shareholder of asi,in asbestos litigation.another of crafton law partners represented a company owned by mark mueller,the president of rivermar and asi second largest shareholder,in more than twenty cases.
in october,kamp called hayes to tell her would be sending someone to her office to review her case file.hayes agreed,but she testified she was curious why would be sending someone to review her files at this time,because rivermar had been offering to pay southeast to settle the case.kamp told hayes that pinckney at asi contacted about the bad faith claim and wanted to send someone to review hayes files.
crafton arrived at hayes office in.hayes had assembled her case files,including depositions,transcripts,notebooks,pleading clips,and correspondence.hayes talked with crafton for about an hour,explaining southeast theory of the case as well as the case history.during the discussion,hayes asked crafton if he had ever heard of asi,rivermar parent company.hayes testified that in response,crafton shook his head no.
hayes left crafton alone in the conference room to review the materials and determine what files he wanted to have copied.hayes believed it would have taken someone two or three days to go through all of the materials however,crafton emerged from the room thirty minutes later,after flagging several items,including deposition transcripts and pleadings,he wanted copied.crafton also wanted a copy of southeast current financial statements,which indicated to hayes that was assessing southeast ability to indemnify if it paid on the bond.hayes testified she was convinced the entire reason crafton came to my office was because there was a claim potential by rivermar.
hayes meanwhile continued her representation in the state court case.she had obtained a court order,over rivermar objections,allowing her to depose rivermar engineer who had knowledge of the maintenance and remedial work performed on the docks.hayes testified the engineer deposition was important because rivermar had completely denied southeast any access to the dock site and southeast had not seen any of the repairs that were allegedly performed on the docks or their current condition.on december,in preparing for the deposition,hayes reviewed the engineer log on the daily activities at the dock site,which hayes received pursuant to a court order.she was surprised to learn that a week earlier,on december,crafton and an engineer,greg mclellan,had visited the dock site.hayes was surprised because she did not know anything about the meeting and she never could get anywhere near the site.the engineer log also revealed the inspection was attended by mueller,treadway,and asi new york attorney,ken bloom.hayes asked rivermar engineer about the inspection.he said he could not tell hayes anything about the inspection,including what occurred,what was discussed,or if any tests had been performed,because those in attendance had signed confidentiality agreements.hayes attempted to contact crafton and froman about the december meeting,but they did not return her phone calls.
after learning about the december site visit and the confidentiality agreement,and because of the difficulty hayes experienced in contacting,hayes started to become deeply concerned about crafton.based on the connections between asi,crafton,and others in crafton firm,hayes testified she was deeply concerned that crafton had ulterior motives and was concerned that had brought crafton in this in an attempt to settle the case.hayes sent a letter to traster alerting him to her concerns with crafton.
hayes later learned rivermar had listed mclellan,engineer who accompanied crafton to the dock site inspection,as an expert and lay witness for rivermar in the state court case.hayes was never able to obtain mclellan opinions or findings.she subpoenaed mclellan to appear for deposition,but counsel for instructed him not to answer her questions.southeast first learned mclellan opinions at trial on the indemnity claim,at which time he testified he neither performed any calculations or evaluations of the free board the distance between the top of the floating dock segment and the water level of his own on the docks nor reviewed any of rivermar dock maintenance records.rather,he reviewed the calculations in another engineering report,and he inspected the docks while walking around the marina with crafton and representatives from rivermar and asi on december.
mclellan visited the dock site three years after the docks were installed by another contractor and after three hurricanes had come through florida.during his site visit mclellan noted an unspecified amount of the dock had been renovated or replaced because he saw another manufacturer name on a pier segment.his only structural analysis of the dock was performed on one cross section of what rivermar told him was a southeast floating dock,which had been removed from the water and dissected by rivermar under unspecified conditions.
a month after the site visit,in january,mclellan gave crafton his preliminary opinions based on the documents he had reviewed,but he said he had wanted more information.mclellan preliminary opinion was that the problems with the docks were manufacturing defects.moreover,based on his review of the other engineering report,mclellan concluded the docks were not constructed to the contract specifications and thus were defective.
froman,in january,again raised the reserves,this time to,the full amount of southeast bond.also,for the first time,froman demanded collateral from southeast in the amount of the bond.according to the indemnity agreement between and southeast,could settle any claim against the bond unless southeast requested in writing that litigate the claim and southeast,simultaneously with the request,deposited collateral with when made a written demand for collateral in january,hayes and traster discussed a number of options for posting collateral southeast offered to post a bond,offered a letter of credit,offered to deposit monies in traster trust account,and offered to give a lien on property.the collateral discussions continued over several months,and did not accept any of these options.meanwhile,pinckney continued to correspond with froman about the state court action and about the bad faith claim.less than a week after one such communication,froman instructed kamp and smith not to talk with hayes.
thereafter,attorney crafton and asi attorney bloom coordinated a meeting between representatives from and representatives from rivermar and its parent company,asi,at crafton office in louisville,kentucky,on march.this meeting between and rivermar was kept secret from hayes and southeast.exchanges between crafton and bloom prior to this meeting suggest hayes was excluded from the meeting so she did not throw a monkey wrench into it.froman indicated the meeting in louisville was a civil meeting between the parties.the day after the meeting,mclellan made a note regarding his upcoming review of the mooring analysis and calculations on the dock system that stated discussed with tom crafton.not needed at this time.
on april,hayes sent a letter to requesting,pursuant to the indemnity agreement,that not settle with rivermar and continue defending the state court action.at the time of hayes april letter,collateral demand from january stood at,the full amount of the bond,and southeast offered to put the full amount into escrow in traster trust account.three days later,on april,froman responded by increasing the demand for collateral from to million.
settled with rivermar the following month by paying rivermar the full amount of the bond.according to froman,the settlement with rivermar was motivated mainly by the claim on the docks and the claim for attorneys fees,but also by rivermar bad faith claim.received a release of all claims against it,including a withdrawal of the bad faith claim rivermar had asserted with the florida department of insurance.the settlement,for which sought indemnification from southeast,did not release southeast from any of rivermar claims.froman testified he was not aware rivermar had offered to pay to southeast to settle the case,and testified it would not necessarily have made any difference to him.asi attorney,bloom,testified rivermar had indeed offered to pay southeast to settle the dispute 
iv.discussion 
based on these facts the jury heard,we next consider the reasonable inferences the jury could have drawn that would support the jury verdict.in determining whether or not reasonable jurors could have concluded settled with rivermar in bad faith,we consider whether the evidence supports an inference of an unreasonable and inadequate investigation,as well as a settlement of the claim.
we begin by observing southeast presented no smoking gun evidence settled with rivermar in bad faith.southeast presented only circumstantial evidence of bad faith.nevertheless,the jury could reasonably have aggregated inferences from this circumstantial evidence to find by a preponderance of the evidence did not settle with rivermar in good faith.
reasonableness of investigation and handling of the rivermar claim 
the jury heard evidence from which it could have concluded performed an unreasonable and inadequate investigation.froman ignored the assessment of those who had been involved with the claim for more than three years,including independent monitoring attorney traster,attorney kamp,and claims manager smith.the collective impression of those who had been involved in the case since its inception was that there was no exposure on the bond.froman disregarded the investigation performed by representatives and credited rivermar investigation and assessment of the case.
also,the rivermar claim against the bond was not likely to succeed,and it was unreasonable for to settle for the full amount of the bond when was advised rivermar would end all of the litigation for the payment of money to southeast.on the eve of trial that was scheduled for may,but was continued at the last minute,rivermar offered to pay money to southeast to settle the case.southeast attorney and asi attorney both testified rivermar had offered to pay southeast to settle the dispute.southeast attorney and monitoring attorney both concluded there was no exposure on the part of southeast or from rivermar claim.
the jury could reasonably have concluded that it was not only unreasonable for to summarily disregard its own initial investigation that indicated the rivermar claim was not likely to succeed,but also unreasonable for to conduct an inadequate investigation before settling with rivermar.first,the attorney froman enlisted in november to investigate the claim was tainted by a conflict of interest and therefore unreliable.hayes testified crafton himself,as well as other partners in his law firm,had a preexisting relationship with asi or its principal shareholders.hayes also testified crafton indicated to her he had never heard of asi.crafton attended trial before the district court as counsel for rivermar,but did not testify in rebuttal of hayes testimony.the jury reasonably could have concluded hayes testimony was true and crafton disingenuously denied familiarity with asi.
second,crafton investigation was cursory.in november crafton and hayes talked about the case for about an hour,and then crafton reviewed hayes files for half an hour.hayes testified it would have taken someon
