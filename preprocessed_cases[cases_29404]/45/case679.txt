appellants,south carolina medical association,physicians care network,and several individual doctors,filed suit seeking to have declared unconstitutional several provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,stat.because congress laid out an intelligible principle in hipaa to guide agency action,we reject appellants claim that the statute impermissibly delegates the legislative function.we also conclude that regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa are not beyond the scope of the congressional grant of authority,and that neither the statute nor the regulations are impermissibly vague.accordingly,we affirm.
recognizing the importance of protecting the privacy of health information in the midst of the rapid evolution of health information systems,congress passed hipaa in august.hipaa administrative simplification provisions sections through of the statute,were designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the exchange of information with respect to financial and administrative transactions carried out by health plans,health care clearinghouses,and health care providers who transmit information in connection with such transactions.the preamble to the administrative simplification provisions clarifies this goal 
it is the purpose of this subtitle to improve the medicare program,the medicaid program,and the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system,by encouraging the development of a health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information.
hipaa,stat.
to this end,congress instructed the united states department of health and human services hhs to adopt uniform standards to enable health information to be exchanged electronically.a.congress directed hhs to adopt standards for unique identifiers to distinguish individuals,employers,health care plans,and health care providers across the nation,see b,as well as standards for transactions and data elements relating to health information,see a,c f,the security of that information,see d,and verification of electronic signatures,see e.
within the administrative simplification section,congress included another a process to address the need to afford certain protections to the privacy of health information maintained under hipaa.first,section a directed hhs to submit to congress within twelve months of hipaa enactment detailed recommendations on standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information.hipaa a,stat.second,if congress did not enact further legislation pursuant to these recommendations within months of the enactment of hipaa,hhs was to promulgate final regulations containing such standards.specifically,section c provided 
if legislation governing standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information transmitted in connection with the transactions described in section a of the social security act as added by section is not enacted by august,the secretary of health and human services shall promulgate final regulations containing such standards not later than february.such regulations shall address at least the subjects described in subsection b.
hipaa c,stat.the subjects congress directed hhs to cover in promulgating privacy regulations included the following the rights that an individual who is a subject of individually identifiable health information should have.the procedures that should be established for the exercise of such rights.the uses and disclosures of such information that should be authorized or required.hipaa b,stat.through individual provisions of hipaa,congress outlined whom the regulations were to cover,see a what information was to be covered,see defining individually identifiable health information what types of transactions were to be covered,see a what penalties would accrue for violations of hipaa,see,and what time lines and standards would govern compliance with the act,see.
finally,section c provided that the privacy regulations promulgated by hhs shall not supercede a contrary provision of state law,if the provision of state law imposes requirements,standards,or implementation specifications that are more stringent than the requirements,standards,or implementation specifications imposed under the regulation.hipaa c,emphasis added.
pursuant to congress mandate,hhs submitted recommendations for protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information in september.several detailed and comprehensive medical privacy bills were thereafter introduced however,congress did not pass any additional legislation.for its part,hhs followed congress directive and drafted regulations that appeared in a november notice of proposed rulemaking.the proposed regulations drew more than comments from affected parties.after several further proposals and amendments were published,hhs promulgated final regulations in february,collectively the privacy rule.although the effective date of the privacy rule was set for april,entities covered by the regulations were given until april,to comply,while some smaller entities were granted an additional year.
appellants sought declaratory relief from provisions of hipaa and the accompanying privacy rule promulgated by hhs.the district court dismissed the action and this appeal followed.appellants argue that hipaa violates the doctrine by authorizing hhs to promulgate the regulations at issue in the absence of an intelligible principle from congress the privacy rule exceeds the scope of authority granted to hhs under hipaa and hipaa of more stringent state privacy laws is unconstitutionally vague,in violation of the due process clause of the fifth amendment.we address each of these issues in turn.
the first issue is whether hipaa violates the doctrine.in a delegation challenge,the constitutional question is whether the statute has delegated legislative power to an agency of the executive branch.whitman american trucking ass ns,d.the doctrine is rooted in the principle of separation of powers that underlies our tripartite system of government.mistretta united states,d.the first lines of the constitution set forth that a ll legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states.const.art.i.thus,from our nation earliest days,the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution has mandate d that congress generally can not delegate its legislative power to another branch.mistretta,at.citation omitted.
in tension with this constitutional directive is the practical requirement that congress turn to the other branches of government for assistance in carrying out its general legislative policies o ur jurisprudence has been driven by a practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society,replete with ever changing and more technical problems,congress simply can not do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.id.at.see also american power light.acknowledging that the legislative process would frequently bog down if congress were constitutionally required to appraise beforehand the myriad situations to which it wishes a particular policy to be applied and to formulate specific rules for each situation.
the supreme court has outlined an approach to determining the difference between prohibited delegation and necessary cooperation between coordinate branches in determining what congress may do in seeking assistance from another branch,the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental coordination.hampton,united states.this approach dictates that where congress lay s down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to exercise the assigned duty is directed to conform,such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.id.at.emphasis added.the court has held that a delegation of legislative power will be found constitutionally sufficient if congress clearly delineates the general policy,the public agency which is to apply it,and the boundaries of this delegated authority.mistretta,at.internal quotation marks omitted.these three factors make up the test for determining whether an intelligible principle lies behind the conferral of authority from congress to an agency.
the government does not bear an onerous burden in demonstrating the existence of an intelligible principle.since schechter poultry united states,and panama refining ryan,the supreme court has not struck down a statute for an impermissible delegation.see american trucking ass ns,at.in the history of the court we have found the requisite intelligible principle lacking in only two statutes,one of which panama refining provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion,and the other of which schechter conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring fair competition.rather,congress has been able to delegate authority under broad standards.mistretta,at.see,lichter united states.upholding delegation of authority to determine excessive profits american power,at.upholding delegation to sec to prevent unfair or inequitable distribution of voting power among security holders yakus united states.upholding delegation to price administrator to fix commodity prices that would be fair and equitable national broadcasting united states.upholding delegation to fcc to regulate broadcast licensing as public interest,convenience,or necessity require.the only limiting factor in each case has been the presence of an intelligible principle behind the congressional delegation.
in light of this guidance,we conclude that hipaa also contains the requisite intelligible principle necessary to survive a challenge.specifically,there are at least three sources within hipaa that provide intelligible principles outlining and limiting the congressional conferral of authority on hhs.first,the language of the statute mandates that hhs implement regulations addressing three particular subjects t he rights that an individual who is a subject of individually identifiable health information should have t he procedures that should be established for the exercise of such rights and t he uses and disclosures of such information that should be authorized or required.hipaa,stat.the question is whether these amount to a statement of general policy by congress.we believe that they do,particularly when read in connection with the second section,the preamble to the sets forth the general purpose of hipaa as improv ing the medicare program,the medicaid program,and the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system,by encouraging the development of a health information system through the establishment of standards and requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information.hipaa,stat.section further refines this goal by requiring that the privacy rule be consistent with the objective of reducing the administrative costs of providing and paying for health care.hipaa,stat codified at b.the third source of an intelligible principle is congress limitation of the privacy rule to communications of listed information by particular covered entities.as noted above,individual provisions of hipaa outline whom the privacy rule was to cover,see a what information was to be covered,see defining individually identifiable health information what types of transactions were to be covered,see a what penalties would accrue for violations of hipaa,see,and what time lines and standards would govern compliance with hipaa,see.we agree with the district court that,taken together,the provisions of hipaa provide a general policy,describe the agency in charge of applying that policy,and set boundaries for the reach of that agency in keeping with the intelligible principle test.see american power,at.holding a statute is constitutionally sufficient if it meets these three requirements.thus,we conclude that hipaa is well within the outer limits of our nondelegation precedents.american trucking ass ns,at.
although appellants argue that the present case is indistinguishable from panama refining,one of only two cases in which the supreme court has invalidated a statute on the basis of an unconstitutional delegation,we disagree.in panama refining,the court found that the challenged portion of the statute at issue,section c of the national industrial recovery act nira,did not provide the president with any mandate,but rather authorized him to pass a prohibitory law.see panama refining,at.that is,the court found that congress had offered no guidance in nira as to whether the president should or should not prohibit the transportation of excess petroleum and petroleum products,hot oil,in interstate commerce.rather,the court noted that s o far as this section is concerned,it gives to the president an unlimited authority to determine the policy and to lay down the prohibition,or not to lay it down,as he may see fit.id.at.finding no limit on executive discretion in this substantive provision of nira,the court also looked to the preamble of the statute and,once again,found no guidance as to whether hot oil was good or bad.see id.at.thus,nira provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion.american trucking ass ns,at.by contrast,in the case before us we have a clear mandate from congress directing hhs to act in accordance with the intelligible principles set forth in hipaa.further,there are clear limits upon the scope of that authority and the type of entities whose actions are to be regulated.
finally,we find unavailing appellants position that congress unconstitutionally relinquished its lawmaking function by mandating that final regulations governing standards with respect to the privacy of individually identifiable health information be promulgated within months of hipaa enactment if no further legislation on the subject were enacted.we do not agree that this approach amounts to an abdication.rather,the procedures outlined by congress establish a more explicit oversight mechanism than usually accompanies a rulemaking mandate imposed upon an agency.in conveying rulemaking authority,congress always reserves the,never relinquishes the engage in further lawmaking.as described above,congress did not abdicate its legislative responsibility in passing hipaa,but outlined a broad set of principles to guide hhs action.see yakus,at.only if we could say that there is an absence of standards for the guidance of the administrator action would we be justified in overriding its choice of means for effecting its declared purpose.animated by these principles,hhs was directed first to offer recommendations within a year of hipaa enactment.that congress did not enact additional measures in light of these recommendations indicates the legislature satisfaction with hhs proposed approach to protecting the privacy of individually identifiable health information.this decision did not,and does not,limit congress ability to revisit the issue,change the direction or scope of the statute or rules,or wholly undo the regulatory scheme hhs has established pursuant to hipaa.
for these reasons,we conclude that hipaa does not violate the doctrine.
appellants second argument is that section c of hipaa limits hhs to regulating only electronic records transmitted in connection with section a of the social security act,see a,yet hhs impermissibly expanded hipaa scope to cover not only electronic transactions,but every form of information for all americans held by covered entities.appellants brief at.the government responds that neither section c,nor other portions of the administrative simplification section to which it refers,limits hhs authority to regulating purely electronic information.the government also contends that during the rulemaking process hhs decided that protecting only electronic information would not adequately safeguard patient privacy and that it would be burdensome and ultimately unworkable to distinguish the same information in various stages and formats that could be kept in electronic or form.
