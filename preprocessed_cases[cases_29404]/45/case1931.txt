in response to a query about why he wanted to climb the world tallest mountain,british explorer george mallory responded,because it is there.as mallory and others have learned,the lure and mystique of mountain climbing are not without risk of injury,including death.the controversy in this case is whether a climbing death on kilimanjaro falls within the meaning of the terms accidental injury and disease as used in a life insurance policy.although this inquiry is seemingly straightforward,it turns out that,in the context of insurance law,unraveling the meaning of these simple words is no easy task.
luanne chale brought this breach of contract suit against allstate life insurance company allstate after it declined to pay her a accidental death benefit under her husband life insurance policy.because her husband death from high altitude edema falls within the definition of accidental injury and does not fit with the disease exclusion of the policy,chale was entitled to summary judgment.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of allstate.
background 
the dispute between chale and allstate arises from the tragic mountain climbing death of her husband,bernard chale chale.each year,thousands of adventurers like chale ascend kilimanjaro,hoping to reach the summit of africa tallest mountain.
although there are many risks in climbing,ranging from avalanches to crevasses,high altitude itself presents a risk.at elevations above,decreased atmospheric pressure reduces the concentration of oxygen in the air enough to make it noticeably difficult to breathe.medicine for mountaineering other wilderness activities james wilkerson,ed.at these heights,experienced climbers allow themselves time to acclimatize because altitude sickness can set in when a person ascends faster than the body can adjust.mountaineering the freedom of the hills don graydon,ed.rapid ascent upsets the body chemistry,and can result in headaches,nausea,fatigue,dizziness,loss of appetite,and vomiting.medicine for mountaineering at.as the syndrome progresses in severity,a climber may develop high altitude pulmonary edema hape,characterized by fluid in the lungs,and high altitude cerebral edema hace,characterized by swelling of the brain.id.at.
victims of hape often experience extreme fatigue,breathlessness,coughing,rattling breaths,chest tightness,congestion,and may turn blue.id.at.hace causes confusion and lethargy.id.at.hape and hace are an exceptionally dangerous duo when they attack together.id.at.unless a decompression chamber or pressurized oxygen is available,descent to lower altitudes is the only way to treat these conditions.norbert voelkel,pulmonary edema,the new england journal of medicine may.recovery following descent is usually rapid and complete.medicine for mountaineering at.left untreated,hape and hace can cause death in a matter of hours.death from hape and hace is relatively rare and not a common or expected outcome of a high altitude adventure.see id.at describing the risk of developing hape after rapid ascent to as.
despite these risks,many climbers find the allure of the mountains irresistible.kilimanjaro,whose summit straddles the border of tanzania and kenya,is an especially popular destination because its ascent requires no technical skills.see,harald lange,kilimanjaro the white roof of africa.even novice peak baggers can hire professional outfitters to guide them along the trek,as chale did in december.
chale began his climb on december,at over the next four days,he and his climbing party ascended to their final camp at,where the air is about half as dense as it is at sea level.see michael ward,mountain medicine a clinical study of cold and high altitude.just after midnight on december,the party set out for the summit,splitting up into a faster and slower group.at am,on its way down,the faster group passed chale,who was headed for the top.up to that point,chale had experienced some fatigue and breathing problems,but no other symptoms of hape or hace.a few hours later,chale died,after having reached the summit.a report revealed that chale had been afflicted with severe edema and congestion of the lungs and brain in other words,hape and hace.
before his death,chale held a life insurance policy issued by allstate.under the policy,his wife was to receive upon his death and an additional if his death was solely from accidental injury and not due to disease or infirmity of the body or mind.neither accidental nor disease or infirmity were defined in the insurance policy.
after chale death,his wife notified allstate and demanded payment.allstate paid her in straight death benefits under the policy but not the additional accidental death benefit.chale then filed suit in oregon state court,and allstate successfully removed to federal court.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted allstate motion,denied chale motion as moot,and entered a judgment of dismissal with prejudice.
discussion 
applicable law and standard of review 
oregon law governs this inquiry if no oregon supreme court decision is directly on point,our task is to predict how the court would decide the case.myers,city and county of san francisco,cir.we invoke the traditional standard of review on summary judgment the district court dismissal on summary judgment is reviewed de novo and the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party.see padfield aig life ins,cir.
ii.the accidental injury provision 
we first consider the parties dispute over the interpretation of the term accidental injury in the life insurance policy.as with any contract,our goal is to ascertain the intention of the parties.hoffman constr.fred james,or,quoting totten new york life ins,or.
initially,we look to the policy as a whole.see id.as the drafter of the contract,allstate could have explicitly defined accidental or accident any way it wished.botts hartford accident indem,or.because it did not,and because the rest of the contract sheds no additional light on the parties intent,allstate must accept the common understanding of the term by the ordinary member of the purchasing public.see also pope benefit trust life ins,or,finley prudential life cas.ins,or.
the next step,oregon law instructs,is to seek clarification from the plain meaning of the term.see hoffman constr,at.this inquiry is equally unavailing,as we do not presume to discover a workable definition of accident where the oregon supreme court found none.see paul fire marine ins,mccormick baxter creosoting,or,finding the dictionary definition of accident broad enough to encompass the definitions offered by both parties.
the lack of a commonly accepted,singular meaning of accident has given oregon courts a number of occasions to grapple with the task before us today.carving out a universally applicable definition is no mean feat.botts,at there are probably not many words which have caused courts as much trouble as accident and accidental.notably,the oregon supreme court has acknowledged the futility of such an undertaking.the court approach in botts treats the legal interpretation of accident as malleable to the facts of a given case.thus,i n situations in which accident or accidental are not defined in the policy,it is for the court to decide the definition which is properly applicable to the particular factual situation.id.at.
although botts makes clear that ours is a moving target,we are not entirely without guidance.it is well established that the proper focus of the inquiry is the injurious result,not the conduct leading to that result.see fox country mut.ins,or,where the insured was a voluntary passenger in a friend car when the friend intentionally drove it off a cliff in order to collect insurance money,the court focused on the insured state of mind with respect to sustaining the injury death,not his state of mind with respect to placing himself in a position where he risked the injury getting in the car see also north clackamas sch.dist.oregon sch.bds.prop.cas.trust,reaffirming that the meaning and determination of accident focuses not on conduct,but on result.hence,we must focus on whether c
