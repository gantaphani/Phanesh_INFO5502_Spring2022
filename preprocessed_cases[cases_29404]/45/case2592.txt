in this opinion we consider an appeal by darcie bjork from the trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of state farm fire and casualty company and state farm general insurance company collectively,state farm.bjork sued state farm to recover under the terms of homeowner insurance policies issued to bjork mother,against whom bjork obtained a stipulated judgment in the amount of million for negligence in failing to prevent sexual molestation by bjork father.
as we will explain,we agree with state farm that because bjork was a resident of her mother home at the time she was injured by the alleged molestation,the terms of the applicable policies exclude coverage for her mother personal liability.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in the underlying action,bjork sued her mother,carol fergerson carol,alleging that carol was liable for negligence because she did not prevent bjork from being molested by bjork father and carol husband,melvin fergerson melvin 
bjork,who was born in and resided in california with carol and melvin until at least,alleged that she was sexually molested by melvin from the age of approximately two until she was a teenager in or in the underlying action,she alleged that melvin had a long standing history of sexual abuse of children,and carol knew or should have known that bjork was being sexually molested,yet failed to take appropriate steps to protect bjork from being molested.bjork alleged that because of carol negligence,she suffered damages including emotional distress,anxiety,including physical related symptoms such as panic attacks,and suffered other physical injuries due to the molestation,including physical trauma and offensive touching.
state farm issued a series of homeowner insurance policies to melvin and carol from to for their successive homes in california state farm also issued a series of homeowner insurance policies to carol individually from to for her home in the state of washington,where she lived after she separated from and divorced melvin 
after bjork filed the underlying lawsuit,carol requested that state farm provide her with a defense in the underlying action and indemnify her from any liability pursuant to the personal liability coverage in the homeowner insurance policies that covered melvin and carol homes in california and carol home in washington.
state farm denied coverage.with respect to the policies it issued to carol in the state of washington from to,state farm claim representative in washington denied coverage because the molestations,which,according to bjork,had ceased in or,occurred prior to the applicable policy period in.with respect to the policies in effect between to,state farm claim representative in california denied coverage based on an exclusion in the applicable policies stating that personal liability coverage does not apply to bodily injury to you or any insured within the meaning of part or of the definition of insured.the applicable policies,which identified melvin and carol as the named insureds,defined insured as follows 
insured means you and,if residents of your household 
your relatives and 
any other person under the age of who is in the care of a person described above.
state farm stated that because bjork was carol daughter and resided with her when the alleged molestation occurred,bjork was considered an insured under the definition contained in the applicable policies,and the exclusion for injury to any insured accordingly applied.the exclusion relied on by state farm to deny coverage to carol is commonly known as the resident relative exclusion.see,afrasiabi state farm fire casualty th,d kibbee blue ridge ins.th,d utley allstate ins.th,d.
bjork and carol subsequently entered into a stipulated judgment in the underlying action in the amount of million,and bjork agreed not to execute the judgment against carol assets.in the stipulated judgment,carol stated that she was assigning to bjork any claims that she had against insurance companies for failing to provide her with a defense or indemnity in connection with the underlying lawsuit.
bjork then filed this lawsuit against state farm,alleging that state farm improperly denied coverage to carol for the underlying lawsuit.attempting to recover from state farm the amount of the stipulated judgment,bjork asserted causes of action for payment of the stipulated judgment based on the insurance policies provisions for direct claims brought by judgment creditors of the insured breach of contract breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.
state farm filed a motion for summary judgment,relying on the resident relative exclusion to establish that it was not obligated to provide coverage to carol for the claims made against her by bjork in the underlying lawsuit the trial court ruled that the resident relative exclusion applied,and it entered judgment in favor of state farm.bjork filed this appeal.
discussiona.standards governing our review of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment 
we review a summary judgment ruling de novo to determine whether there is a triable issue as to any material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d.in practical effect,we assume the role of a trial court and apply the same rules and standards which govern a trial court determination of a motion for summary judgment.lenane continental maritime of san diego,th,d.thus,on appeal we apply the same analysis used by the trial court.we identify the issues framed by the pleadings,determine whether the moving party has negated the opponent claims,and determine whether the opposition has demonstrated the existence of a triable,material factual issue.silva lucky stores,th,d.
this appeal narrowly concerns the application of the provisions of the applicable insurance policies to undisputed facts.the interpretation of an insurance policy as applied to undisputed facts is a question of law for the appellate court,which is not bound by the trial court construction.quan truck ins.exchange th,d.
applicability of the resident relative exclusion 
the sole issue presented for our resolution is whether the resident relative exclusion bars coverage for carol liability to bjork in the underlying action.a resident relative exclusion,such as the exclusion at issue here,has long been held to be an enforceable exclusion.see state farm fire cas.alstadt d.state farm fire cas.clendening d.lumbermens mut.cas.vaughn d.lumbermens.as our supreme court has explained,the concept of a household exclusion is a common one which has long enjoyed judicial support.farmers ins.exchange cocking cal d,cocking.the exclusion is premised on the principle that an insurance carrier need not insure risks arising from intrafamily torts unless it chooses to do so.clendening,at.
bjork presents several arguments for the inapplicability of the resident relative exclusion to this case.first,she argues that the resident relative exclusion should not apply because the reasons behind the exclusion are not implicated in this case.second,she argues that because the applicable insurance policies do not contain an exclusion for sexual molestation,the resident relative exclusion should not apply.third,she argues that application of the resident relative exclusion violates public policy.fourth,she argues that the severability clause in the applicable insurance policies makes the exclusion inapplicable.finally,she argues that the insurance policies in effect after,when she ceased to reside with carol and melvin in,provide coverage despite the resident relative exclusion because she ceased to be a resident relative of an insured,and she allegedly continued,after,to incur physical injuries from the molestation.we now turn to an analysis of each of bjork arguments.
the exclusion applies regardless of evidence of collusion 
we first evaluate bjork argument that the resident relative exclusion should not apply in this case because the reasons behind the exclusion are not implicated in this case.as bjork points out,case law has explained that an insurance carrier may choose to include a resident relative exclusion in an insurance policy to prevent suspect legal actions which may not be truly adversary and over which the insurer has little or no control.such an exclusion is a natural target for the insurer protection from collusive assertions of liability.cocking,supra,cal d at.bjork argues that there is no evidence of collusion in this case,and thus the exclusion should not apply.
we reject this argument because the plain language of the applicable insurance policies does not limit the exclusion to instances in which collusion between family members is present.instead,the applicable policies clearly and unambiguously exclude coverage for every personal liability claim involving injury to a relative who resides with a named insured see lumbermens,supra,d at.applying the resident relative exclusion although expressly declining to decide whether actual collusion occurred.
although bjork relies on cocking discussion of collusion to support her argument cocking,supra,cal d at,cocking does not advance bjork position.cocking does not purport to interpret the resident relative exclusion to apply only in cases where collusion actually exists.instead,it merely explains that insurance carriers choose to exclude liability coverage for claims made by resident relatives because such claims might be collusive.
the absence of a sexual molestation exclusion does not make the resident relative exclusion inapplicable 
bjork argues that t he failure of the homeowner policies to have a sexual molestation exclusion suggest s that the policies did not intend to exclude such a risk from coverage.in support of her argument,bjork cites a decision of the utah supreme court,holding that a personal excess liability policy provided coverage for personal injury stemming from sexual assaults when the policy did not include an exclusion for sexual molestation in the definition of personal injury.benjamin amica mutual ins.utah,benjamin.
bjork argument lacks merit,and the case that she cites is inapplicable.because the resident relative exclusion applies,it is irrelevant that the policies lack an express exclusion for sexual molestation.the resident relative exclusion is clear and unambiguous.it applies whenever an insured seeks coverage for personal liability caused by physical injury to the resident relative of a named insured.the language of the exclusion plainly contains no exception for injuries to a resident relative caused by sexual molestation.the utah supreme court decision in benjamin is inapplicable because the victims of the sexual assaults in that case were the insured coworkers,not resident relatives.benjamin,supra,at.thus,the relative resident exclusion was not at issue in benjamin,and benjamin has no bearing on the issue of whether a resident relative exclusion applies when an insurance policy lacks an express exclusion for sexual molestation.
public policy does not prevent the application of the resident relative exclusion in this case 
bjork argues that applying the resident relative exclusion in this case would violate public policy because the legislature enacted a law reviving,for a period of one year,claims against individuals who negligently failed to stop childhood sexual abuse,when the statute of limitations otherwise already would have expired.code civ,subd.c.bjork argues that this statute expresses a legislative intent to provide financial redress for victims of such childhood sexual abuse,and thus we should not apply the relative resident exclusion to deny carol insurance coverage for her liability to bjork.
we reject bjork argument.code of civil procedure section,subdivision c expresses an intent to allow victims of childhood sexual abuse to bring otherwise expired claims.it does not deal with the subject of insurance coverage.accordingly,we perceive nothing in the statute that would indicate a legislative policy against the application of the resident relative exclusion to instances of sexual molestation.
the severability clause in the policies does not preclude application of the resident relative exclusion 
each of the state farm policies contain a severability clause which states,this insurance applies separately to each insured bjork claims that the severability clause creates an ambiguity with respect to whether the resident relative exclusion applies,and that we should resolve the ambiguity in favor of coverage.see aiu ins.superior court cal d,in the insurance context,we generally resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.
bjork argues that because of the severability clause,we should disregard the fact that she is an insured under the policy definition of that term,and consequently find that the resident relative exclusion does not apply.to understand bjork argument,we must first focus on the language of the policy provisions that comprise the resident relative exclusion.as we have explained,the policies exclude personal liability coverage for bodily injury to you or any insured within the meaning of part or of the definition of insured.as we have also explained,the term insured as used in this exclusion has the following meaning.insured means you,and if residents of your household your relatives and any other person under the age of who is in the care of a person described above.together,these provisions make up the resident relative exclusion.accordingly,to find that the relative resident exclusion applies in this case,we must find that bjork satisfies the definition of an insured under the policy.bjork argues that if,relying on the severability clause,we were to disregard the fact that bjork satisfies the definition of an insured,then the resident relative exclusion would be inapplicable.
we reject bjork argument because,as we will explain,the severability clause does not allow us to disregard the fact that bjork satisfies the definition of an insured under the policy.for her interpretation of the severability clause,bjork relies on justice baxter concurring and dissenting opinion in safeco ins.robert cal th,d,safeco.safeco did not involve a resident relative exclusion,but instead involved an exclusion for claims arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.id.at,d,opn.of kennard.justice baxter took the position that because of the policy severability clause,the exclusion should be evaluated separately as to each insured,so that coverage would be afforded to an insured who did not commit an illegal act although another insured did commit an illegal act.id.at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter.
as support for his position,justice baxter explained that some cases have concluded that when a multiparty liability insurance policy contains a severability provision,the effect is to extend both the policy coverage,and its exclusions,individually,to each insured,as if he or she were the only insured,subject to policy limits.under this rule,exclusions from coverage are personal and may not be imputed from one insured to another,even where language internal to an exclusionary clause,viewed in isolation,could be read to withdraw coverage from all insureds for the excludable conduct of one.safeco,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter.under the cases cited by justice baxter,an exclusion must be considered solely from the standpoint of the insured seeking coverage,so that facts which would preclude coverage of a particular insured do not necessarily preclude coverage for the related liability of another.id.at,d.
justice baxter cites several cases from other jurisdictions as examples,including two cases involving the interplay of a severability clause and the resident relative exclusion,and bjork relies on those cases for her argument safeco,supra,cal th at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter.in fournelle,supra,a husband who was a named insured under a homeowner policy together with his wife,but who did not reside in the family home,shot and killed his two teenage sons and himself in the wife house.id.at.the wife sued the husband estate for wrongful death.ibid.the insurer contended that because the homeowner policy contained a resident relative exclusion,it did not provide c
