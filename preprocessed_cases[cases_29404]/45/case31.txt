this case arises from appellee middlesex mutual assurance company middlesex mutual denial of appellant jacob matusevich flood loss claim following a flood that damaged the lower level of his home and numerous belongings.after the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,the district court granted middlesex mutual motion and denied matusevich.matusevich now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in holding that the lower level of his home qualified as a basement under the standard flood insurance policy sfip issued by middlesex mutual and authorized by the federal emergency management agency fema as part of the national flood insurance program nfip.finding no error with the district court interpretation of the sfip,we affirm.
background 
a.the national flood insurance program 
in the,there was a concern that,due to the high costs and damages associated with floods,private insurers were not providing adequate flood insurance in many areas prone to flooding.see b.to address this growing problem,congress enacted the national flood insurance act of nfia.see id.the nfia,in turn,created the nfip,which is administered by fema and backed by the federal treasury.id.a,a.the purpose of the nfip is,in part,to remedy the lack of flood insurance in areas by offering subsidized flood insurance,thus increasing its availability.id.b.the nfip is also intended to change building practices in order to deter future flood risk and thus hopefully reduce future losses to life and property due to floods through the adoption of floodplain management and mitigation initiatives.id.e,b.
the nfip is administered by fema,which,in turn,is authorized to prescribe regulations establishing the general method or methods by which proved and approved claims for losses may be adjusted and paid.accordingly,in,fema created the write your own wyo program,which allowed private insurance companies,such as middlesex mutual,to issue flood insurance policies as part of the nfip.under the wyo program,the companies are essentially administrators of the federal program who act as fiscal agents of the united states they are not general agents.mcgair am.bankers ins.of,cir quoting palmieri allstate ins,cir.indeed,i t is the government,not the companies,that pays the claims.id.quoting palmieri,at.
private insurance companies participating in the wyo program are required to issue sfips containing the terms and conditions prescribed by fema and subject to interpretation by the federal insurance administrator as to scope of coverage.see also id.pt,app.a providing the sfip.the regulations provide that no provision of the policy shall be altered,varied,or waived other than by the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.id.d.
matusevich claim 
the parties do not dispute the material facts.since,matusevich has owned a house in swampscott,massachusetts.the floor of the lower level,which consists of several finished rooms,is subgrade on three sides.the fourth side of the lower level is located at the rear of the house and contains a doorway which directly opens out into a backyard.the backyard contains an swimming pool built by the prior owners in surrounded by a concrete apron which slopes down from the edge of the pool to the rear of the house.though there are neither steps nor a ramp,one must step up slightly to exit the house onto the concrete apron.
in november,matusevich obtained an sfip from middlesex mutual the policy.the policy afforded coverage for direct physical loss by or from flood to matusevich insured property so long as matusevich paid the correct premium compl ied with all terms and conditions of the policy and furnished accurate information and statements.the policy excluded for damage occurring in a basement,which the policy defined as a ny area of the building,including any sunken room or sunken portion of a room,having its floor below ground level subgrade on all sides.the policy term was for one year but was renewed for successive terms in november and november.throughout the three years of coverage,matusevich paid his premiums on time and in full.
on october,swampscott was hit with torrential rain and flash flooding.between and fifty inches of water flooded the lower level of matusevich home,causing damage to the lower level and its contents.matusevich filed two flood loss claims to colonial claims the adjuster retained by middlesex mutual in the amounts of and.middlesex mutual paid the smaller claim but rejected the larger claim because it concluded that the lower level of his home was a basement under the policy matusevich appealed the decision to fema federal insurance administrator,but the decision was upheld.
following this denial,matusevich filed suit in the district court.as part of discovery,the parties representatives inspected matusevich home and took field measurements.the floor of the lower level of the house was found to be higher than the underneath the concrete apron.the concrete apron,meanwhile,is thick,so the lower level of the house was found to be lower than the surface of the concrete apron.as a result,if the underneath the concrete apron is the proper measuring point for determining if the fourth side of the lower level is below ground level subgrade,then all four sides of the lower level are not below ground level subgrade,the lower level is not a basement,and the damage caused by the flood is covered under the policy.if,however,the proper measuring point is the top of the concrete apron,then all four sides of the lower level are below ground level subgrade,the lower level is a basement,and the damage from the flood is excluded under the policy.
given these stipulated measurements,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the proper measuring point is the top of the concrete apron,and therefore the lower level of matusevich home qualifies as a basement under the policy.accordingly,the district court granted middlesex mutual motion and denied matusevich motion.matusevich timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo.see decosta allstate ins,cir mcgair,at.summary judgment is warranted where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mcgair,at quoting.a.where,as here,there are cross motions for summary judgment,we evaluate each motion independently and determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed.barnes fleet bank,cir quoting wightman springfield terminal ry,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because this is a dispute over the coverage of insurance policies under the nfip,federal common law controls.atlas pallet,gallagher,cir.
b.the lower level of matusevich home is a basement 
in the insurance context,if the facts upon which liability is claimed or denied are undisputed,then the existence or amount of liability depends solely upon a construction of the policy,and the question presented is one of law for the court to decide.id.at.that is the precise scenario currently before us the parties do not dispute that the fourth side of the lower level of matusevich home is lower than the surface of the concrete apron and higher than the underneath it.rather,the debate is over which measurement is applicable in deciding whether this fourth side is below ground level subgrade,and thus whether the lower level falls under the policy basement exclusion.after careful consideration,we conclude that the proper measuring point is the surface of the concrete apron.
the policy defines a basement as a ny area of the building,including any sunken room or sunken portion of a room,having its floor below ground level subgrade on all sides.as the third circuit succinctly stated in linder associates,aetna casualty surety,
c overage under a flood insurance policy is predicated upon the occurrence of a flood.there can not be a flood unless water rises above and flows over the existing ground level.it only makes sense,therefore,to equate ground level in the flood insurance policy as the ground level
