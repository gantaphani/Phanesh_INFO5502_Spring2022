amex assurance company amex brought this interpleader action pursuant to to determine the rightful beneficiaries of two million insurance policies covering accidental death during airline travel for william william and gabriella gabriella caripides,husband and wife,who perished in the swissair crash off nova scotia on september.the rival contenders for the proceeds of the policies were their daughter cristina caripides william siblings ted caripides,helen agabides,and vera grozdav the siblings with respect to the policy covering william,and gabriella parents peter and rita catar the parents with respect to the policy covering gabriella and the estates of william and gabriella the estates.because the insured had made no designation of beneficiaries,the proceeds were payable under the default schedule of beneficiaries listed in the policies.that schedule listed dependent children after spouse,and thereafter listed siblings and parents it made no provision whatsoever for children.the court therefore granted summary judgment to the siblings and the parents,rejecting the claim of the insureds independent daughter cristina.
background 
william and gabriella caripides,together with their son peter,died september,when swissair flight crashed off nova scotia.their only surviving child was cristina,then age.at the time,william and gabriella were each covered by two separate accidental death insurance policies issued by amex.the first,which is not involved in this appeal,was a policy,hereinafter,under which william and gabriella were each automatically covered because they purchased their airline tickets with a standard american express card.because no beneficiary had been designated under this policy,the proceeds were payable pursuant to the default provisions of the policy.the default provisions specified that in the absence of a designation the proceeds would go to a surviving spouse,and in the absence of a surviving spouse to the insured children.no party contested cristina entitlement as a surviving child to the payable under these two policies.
in addition,william had subscribed for himself and gabriella to a million automatic flight insurance policy issued by amex.once again,william had designated no beneficiary payment of the million is accordingly governed by the default provisions of the policy.the proper disposition of these benefits under the default provisions of the policy is the subject of this appeal.the evolution of these default provisions is significant.
william original enrollment in amex program of automatic flight insurance was in march under a policy designated as ga hereinafter,sponsored by the fireman fund insurance company.under this policy,in exchange for a fee per covered person per trip charged each time airline tickets were purchased with an american express card,the holder of this policy could choose,or of coverage.william selected coverage at the million level for both himself and gabriella.
such a policy invites the subscriber to designate who will be the beneficiary of the proceeds,but goes on to specify a hierarchy of default beneficiaries who will take in the event no designation is made.under,in the absence of a designation,the benefits were to be paid first to the surviving spouse,and if there was no surviving spouse,to the covered person children.the list went on to name other categories that would take in the absence of surviving spouse or surviving children.from through may,william maintained coverage under that policy,without ever making a designation of beneficiary.
in may,amex replaced the policy.for all insureds other than residents of the state of new york,the replacing policy was designated ax hereinafter.this policy provided for default beneficiaries in a manner similar to its predecessor,naming first the spouse,and in the absence of a surviving spouse,any surviving children.
as to new york residents,was replaced with a different policy designated as ax hereinafter.new york resident subscribers to were solicited to enroll under.william enrolled,again choosing the million level of protection,covering both himself and gabriella.
the enrollment was by means of a summary form,which did not reveal the detailed terms of the policy,including the schedule of default beneficiaries.it was only after sending the enrollment form that the subscriber would receive the full policy.the form that william signed in order to subscribe to coverage stated,i understand that this coverage will replace any coverage previously in effect under the policy.
the default provisions of,however,were significantly different from the predecessor policy and from.the new default hierarchy of begins like the predecessor policy by giving the proceeds to the surviving spouse.if there is no surviving spouse,the proceeds go not to the covered person children,but to dependent children.dependent children is defined to include primarily unmarried children under who are dependent on the covered card member if the deceased covered person is survived by neither a spouse nor dependent children,the next takers are the decedent parents or,if none of them survives,brothers and sisters,and finally,if there is no survivor among any of those categories,the decedent estate.thus,for a covered person who has not designated a beneficiary,the default provisions of completely exclude children who are not dependent.cristina,who was years old at the time of her parents death,was not a dependent child.
approximately six years after subscribing to the replacement policy,on march,william and gabriella executed wills.each of william and gabriella,in subparagraph third of their respective wills,made a conditional bequest of to cristina,which was payable only if the testator spouse had predeceased.each will went on to specify,i intentionally make no provisions,other than those set forth in this subparagraph,for my daughter,cristina caripides.
after the swissair disaster that killed her parents,cristina filed claims with amex,asserting that she was the beneficiary of the two policies and the two million policies.as to the latter,cristina incorrectly believed the pertinent policy was,the policy issued to replace the original,for residents of all states other than new york.under the terms of,in the absence of a surviving spouse,the children were the default beneficiaries.
thereafter,the estates of william and gabriella each filed a claim as the beneficiary of the other policy.the estate of gabriella claimed that gabriella was the default beneficiary of the policy covering william.the estate pointed to subparagraph tenth of william will,which provided that if william and his wife died simultaneously or under such circumstances as to render it impossible or difficult to determine who predeceased the other,then william shall be deemed to have predeceased gabriella.giving effect to that provision,gabriella estate argued that gabriella was william surviving spouse and was therefore the prime default beneficiary.
william estate asserted that gabriella will contained a similar provision,deeming william to be the survivor if he and gabriella died in circumstances making it difficult to determine which one predeceased on that basis,william estate argued that william should be deemed to have survived gabriella and to have been the default taker under gabriella policy.
proceedings below 
on may,faced with competing claims for the proceeds of the two policies,amex commenced this interpleader action to determine whether cristina or the estates were the proper beneficiaries of the policies.it deposited the proceeds of the pertinent policies into the court.in its interpleader complaint,amex incorrectly asserted that the pertinent million policies were,and attached a copy of.the parties agreed to a stipulation discharging amex as a party in the suit with the proviso that it would make itself amenable to the court jurisdiction,discovery demands,and subpoenas as though it remained a party to the litigation.
within the next year apparently,amex discovered its error as to which million policy was involved.in february,eric marhoun,vice president and general counsel of amex,submitted an affidavit in which he revealed that amex had been incorrect in its assertion that william and gabriella were covered by the policy when in fact,because they were residents of new york state,they were covered by.the recognition that william and gabriella were covered not by but substantially undermined cristina claim because,as noted above,while under the second place default beneficiary after surviving spouse is children,in the case of that place is occupied by dependent children,and children alone does not appear on the default schedule.
in june,the district court became aware that at the time of the crash william was survived by three siblings,ted caripides,helen agabides and vera grozdav,and gabriella was survived by her parents rita and peter catar.because the default provisions of provided for siblings and parents,the court ordered that william siblings and gabriella parents be joined as parties to the action 
the district court appointed an expert witness on insurance,alexander chernoff,to report on the issues presented.in his report filed january,chernoff stated that he had never encountered a beneficiary default provision which differentiates dependent and children as in.
cristina retained her own expert,martin minkowitz.minkowitz asserted the concept dependent children was pertinent only in the area of health insurance it is a defined term in new york insurance law which regulates health coverage and that its use in the amex life insurance policy was an error and was inconsistent with the necessary and appropriate use of the term.although minkowitz acknowledged that the dependent children language in had been ratified by the new york insurance department along with the rest of the policy consistent with statutory requirements,he maintained that that had been an oversight.minkowitz appended an affidavit of frederic bodner,former chief of the life and health bureau of the department of insurance,to the effect that the approval of the term dependent children in the context of this policy was a mistake.minkowitz opined that the court should reform the policy,substituting children for dependent children,bringing it in line with,the policy it had replaced.
on july,cristina filed an amended answer to the amex complaint,asserting various counterclaims and.among her claims,she asserted that the default beneficiary provision of is unenforceable under new york estates,powers,and trusts law eptl,which stipulates that all beneficiary designations under life insurance policies must be made in writing and signed by the person making the designation.she also claimed that the default provision in favor of children to the exclusion of children violates the public policy espoused in eptl,which provides that the property of a decedent,if not covered by a will,go to a spouse and children,indicating that children are given priority in inheritance over the siblings and parents of the decedent.cristina also sought reformation of the contract under the teaching of hay star fire insurance,on the grounds that the substitution of dependent children in for children under the predecessor policy was a mistake on amex part,and that william had enrolled in the policy believing that its default beneficiary provision still included children.
on october,the district court directed the parties to show cause why summary judgment should not be awarded on the two million policies to the siblings and the parents,respectively.on january,the district court granted summary judgment,awarding the proceeds of william policy to the siblings,and the proceeds of gabriella policy to the parents.the court rejected cristina claims and those of the estates.cristina appealed.the estates have not.
discussion 
cristina raises three principal arguments on appeal the district court erred in determining that the contract was unambiguous,because when william signed the generic enrollment card in december,he probably believed that he was subscribing to a policy with terms similar,at least as to default beneficiaries,to the previous policy the default beneficiary provisions are unenforceable because they do not satisfy the writing requirement of eptl policy should be reformed under the doctrine of hay and its progeny.
is the contract ambiguous 
cristina first argument on appeal is that the court should not have granted summary judgment under the default provisions because the insurance contract was ambiguous.we do not agree.
to be sure,as discussed below,the circumstances under which an insured subscribed to the policy created a significant risk of confusion as to who would take in the absence of a designation of beneficiary.but the potential for confusion resulted from the piecemeal disclosure of terms,not from inherent ambiguity in the terms.if one reads the listing of default beneficiaries provided in,there is no doubt that the second slot after surviving spouse is occupied by dependent children and not by children.the policy is not ambiguous on its face.
do the beneficiary default provisions violate eptl 
cristina next argues that the default beneficiary provisions of are unenforceable because they do not comply with the requirement under new york law that all designations of beneficiaries of life insurance policies be attested in writing.new york estates,powers,and trusts law e provides 
a designation of a beneficiary or payee to receive payment upon death of the person making the designation or another must be made in writing and signed by the person making the designation 
cristina relies on two cases,androvette treadwell,and mohawk airlines,peach,dep t.they stand for the general proposition that the writing requirement in e will be interpreted strictly,but do not address the application of that provision to default terms.we agree with the district court that william reliance on the default beneficiary provision of the underlying contract was not a designation of a beneficiary within the meaning of the statute.it was the opposite.
william had the option of either designating his beneficiaries,or,in the absence of an adequate designation,relying on the default list provided by the policy.he chose the latter course.cristina argument depends on a distortion of the literal meaning of designation it reads a failure to designate as a designation.second,her argument would have the effect of undermining and distorting the reasonable expectations of countless subscribers to such insurance.we can see no reason to believe that new york intended its statute to be construed in such a capricious fashion.
should the schedule of default beneficiaries be reformed 
cristina argues that william and gabriella policies should be reformed so that they conform to the default beneficiary provision of the policy they replaced.she contends that authority for such reformation can be found in the decision of the new york court of appeals in hay.in hay,the plaintiff was insured against fire by defendant star fire insurance on her interest as a mortgagee in property.at.after increasing the size of the mortgage from to,plaintiff applied to star for a renewal of the policy,to which star agreed.without advising the plaintiff,however,star inserted into the renewal a subrogation clause,providing that in the event of a loss,plaintiff would assign to defendant her right to be compensated by other parties,and defendant would be liable on the policy only to the extent she had not already been adequately compensated for her loss by those other parties.
the court of appeals granted plaintiff application for reformation of the policy.the court observed,
it was bad faith on the part of the defendant to change so radically the terms of the policy,and deliver it as a policy simply renewing the old one,without notice of the change.a party,whose duty it is to prepare a written contract,in pursuance of a previous agreement,to prepare one materially changing the terms of such previous agreement and deliver it as in accordance therewith,commits a fraud which entitles the other party to relief according to the circumstances presented.equity will reform a written instrument in cases of mutual mistake,and also in cases of fraud,and also w
