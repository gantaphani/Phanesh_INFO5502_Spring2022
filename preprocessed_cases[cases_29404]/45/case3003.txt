ii.the appeal from the order sustaining the demurrer as to the implied covenant claim 
a.the pleadings 
gulf appeal concerns the cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the original complaint,which was brought against tig and american international specialty lines insurance,on december.in reviewing the dismissal,all factual allegations must be assumed as true.haggis city of los angeles cal th,d,aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,blank kirwan cal d.the complaint alleged the following facts.on november,santa susana entered into a contract with the county.santa susana agreed to construct and replace pipe culverts and other work on las flores heights road.on october,gulf executed public works performance and payment bonds no.for santa susana as principal and the county as obligee.during the course of the construction work,santa susana damaged adjacent real property belonging to louis hill.the damage consisted of the erosion of a ditch backfilled by santa susana,which washed out retaining walls,a greenhouse,and an access road located on the hill property.
on march,the county declared santa susana in default under the construction contract.the county demanded that gulf perform santa susana remaining obligations under its october,performance bond.it was alleged that the remaining obligations,as required by the county,included the repair and restoration of the damage caused to hill property.gulf retained dorfman construction dorfman to complete santa susana contractual obligations.
it was alleged that,at times pertinent to this action,santa susana maintained commercial general liability insurance written by tig.it was further alleged that the insurance was primary and covered the type of loss or damage to hill property and the county was an additional insured under the policy.in addition,gulf performance bond was not a commercial general liability policy and was not intended to cover the type of damage done to hill property.in january,gulf paid dorfman the sum of to repair and restore the damage caused to hill property,which had been caused by santa susana.as a result of the payment to dorfman,gulf,it was alleged,became subrogated to santa susana and the county rights as insureds under the tig policy.gulf alleged that tig failed to undertake the necessary repairs or to reimburse it delayed in acknowledging the claim refused to provide a copy of the policy refused to conduct any investigation requested documentation that had already been provided refused to accept or deny coverage within a reasonable amount of time refused to provide reasons for denying coverage and failed to provide information upon request.gulf asserted causes of action for contract breach first declaratory relief second and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing third.
on march,tig filed a demurrer to the causes of action for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith the only issue raised on appeal relates to the third cause of action in the original complaint for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.tig argued that gulf lacked standing to pursue the contract breach causes of action because tig had no contractual relationship with gulf gulf did not qualify as a third party beneficiary under the law and as a party,gulf could not pursue claims for tort and punitive damages in what was essentially an action for equitable indemnity or contribution.tig further argued that the gulf remedy was in equity and not tort.accordingly,tig argued relief including punitive damages claims and attorney fees under brandt superior court cal d,were not recoverable by gulf,a third party.
gulf opposed the demurrer on the ground that it was subrogated to the rights of santa susana,which was a tig policyholder and to those rights of the county as an additional insured.gulf argued that,as a subrogee or assignee of santa susana,it possessed an insured right to state causes of action for breach of contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
in reply,tig argued that gulf was only an equitable subrogee,not a first party to any insurance contract with tig and,as such,was only entitled to assignable rights.it was further argued the complaint did not allege an assignment of rights the right to punitive damages was personal and not assignable under california law the cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing was personal and was not assigned to gulf and gulf and tig were not in privity of contract.
the trial court sustained the demurrers with leave to amend.gulf amended the complaint to allege causes of action for declaratory relief first,equitable indemnity second,and contribution third.these three causes of action in the first amended complaint were the subject of a trial,judgment,and the.
b.the demurrer to the implied covenant claim in the original complaint was properly sustained 
gulf argues on the appeal that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to its claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the third cause of action in the original complaint an appellate court only task in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.people ex.rel.lungren.superior court cal th,d,moore regents of university of california cal d.the reviewing court assumes the truth of allegations in the complaint which have been properly pleaded and gives it a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and with all its parts in their context.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,people ex.rel.lungren superior court,supra,cal th at,d,aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.however,the assumption of truth does not apply to contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law and fact.moore regents of university of california supra,cal d at.furthermore,any allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact of which judicial notice may be taken will be treated as a nullity.interinsurance exchange narula th,d fundin chicago pneumatic tool d.for the reasons stated below,we conclude the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer to gulf claim for bad faith.
as gulf concedes in its opening brief,there is no authority which supports its claim that a surety may bring a bad faith action against a general liability carrier.rather,gulf asks us to extrapolate from other general insurance law principles to conclude that a surety can plead a cause of action against a commercial general liability carrier for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in every insurance contract,including claims for punitive damages and attorney fees the general rule is that parties who are not entitled to benefits under the policy can not maintain a cause of action for an implied covenant.murphy allstate ins.cal d,see also coleman gulf ins.group cal d,seretti superior nat.ins.th,d.as the supreme court explained in murphy allstate ins,supra,cal d at page,a third party should not be permitted to enforce covenants made not for his benefit,but rather for others claims for bad faith violation of an insurance contract are strictly tied to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,which arises out of an underlying contractual relationship.seretti superior nat.ins,supra,th at,d austero national cas.d.in the absence of such a relationship,no recovery for bad faith may be had.seretti superior nat.ins,supra,th at,d austero national cas,supra,d at.accordingly,the insurer duty of good faith and fair dealing is owed only to its insured and any express beneficiary of the policy.seretti superior nat.ins,supra,th at,d austero national cas,supra,d at.there is no contractual relationship between gulf and tig.in the absence of a contractual relationship,no implied covenant claims may be stated.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d love fire ins.exchange d.see gruenberg aetna ins.cal d.
gulf nevertheless claims that it was entitled to pursue claims against tig for bad faith under a subrogation theory because as a subrogee,it possessed all of santa susana rights.as noted previously,santa susana was an insured under a commercial general liability policy issued by tig.tig asserts the implied covenant claims were more properly characterized as causes of action for contribution or indemnification.the court of appeal in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d,explained the concepts and confusion surrounding the theories of subrogation and contribution at length as follows as one california appellate court has opined,i t is hard to imagine another set of legal terms with more soporific effect than indemnity,subrogation,contribution,and joint tortfeasorship.citation.it is also difficult to think of two legal concepts that have caused more confusion and headache for both courts and litigants than have contribution and subrogation.citation.although the concepts of contribution and subrogation are both equitable in nature,they are nevertheless distinct.citations.subrogation is defined as the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.by undertaking to indemnify or pay the principal debtor obligation to the creditor or claimant,the subrogee is equitably subrogated to the claimant or subrogor,and succeeds the subrogor rights against the obligor.citation.in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid.citations.as now applied the doctrine of equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.citations.citation.the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have.citations,original italics.the court of appeal continued equitable contribution is entirely different.it is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.id.at,d,original italics.here,the record shows that gulf,the surety on the performance bond for completion of the contract,and tig,the commercial general liability carrier,were not obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss.thus,gulf has properly asserted that this case was more properly characterized as one for equitable subrogation.
however,gulf has incorrectly asserted that its complaint alleged a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the theory that as the surety it was equitably subrogated to the rights of the insured.an insurer cause of action for equitable subrogation contains six elements the insured has suffered a loss for which the party to be charged is liable the insurer has compensated for the loss the insured has existing,assignable causes of action against the party to be charged,which the insured could have pursued had the insurer not compensated the loss the insurer has suffered damages caused by the act or omission which triggers the liability of the party to be charged justice requires that the loss be shifted entirely from the insurer to the party to be charged and the insurer damages are in a stated sum,which is usually the amount paid to the insured,assuming the payment was not voluntary and was reasonable.state farm fire casualty east bay municipal utility dist.th,d fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.equitable subrogation permits a party who has been required to satisfy the loss created by a party wrongful act to stand in the shoes of the injured party and pursue the wrongdoer.here,there is simply no allegation that the insured was injured by any conduct for which tig was liable and that gulf paid.as the court in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at page,d,stated in the insurance context,the doctrine permits the paying insurer to be placed in the shoes of the insured and to pursue recovery from third parties responsible to the insured for the loss for which the insurer was liable and paid.citation.italics added.here,there is no allegation concerning any conduct which resulted in an injury to the insured for which gulf paid such that tig should be held liable.gulf allegedly paid a claim for the property damage to hill property.however,there is no indication that there was an amount in excess of that claim for which the insured was liable and for which gulf paid.in other words,gulf could not pursue claims that it was equitably subrogated to the insured rights for bad faith against tig.this is because tig alleged wrongful conduct did not result in any injury to the insured.id.at,d.
for that reason,we disagree with gulf that it may pursue the breach of the covenant claim under the authority of commercial union assurance companies safeway stores,cal d,and northwestern mut.ins.farmers ins.group d.there is a critical distinction between commercial union and northwestern mutual and this case.in commercial union and northwestern mutual the bad faith of the insurers had caused a judgment against the insured for an amount in excess of the relevant policies.in these cases,which involved equitable subrogation between primary and excess carriers,recovery for breach of the implied covenant was allowed because the wrongful refusal to settle had caused judgments in excess of policy limits against the insured,the insured was damaged.commercial union assurance companies safeway stores,supra,at,northwestern mut.ins.farmers ins.group,supra,at.in other words,the insured suffered damages because of a failure to settle.here,there is no allegation that the insurer bad faith resulted in any injury to the insured.the only basis for gulf claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is through equitable subrogation to the rights of the insured.there are no allegations the insured,santa susana,was injured by tig conduct.hence,the trial court properly sustained the demurrer to gulf breach of the implied covenant claim.
for similar reasons,we disagree with gulf contention that it has achieved the status of a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract by virtue of being subrogated to the rights of the county of los angeles,the general contractor and the obligee on gulf performance bond,and an additional insured under the tig policy.see also hand farmers ins.exchange th,d judgment creditor seeking to recover under policy pursuant to insurance code section permitted to allege bad faith claim against insurer as third party beneficiary of policy compare hughes mid century ins.th,d judgment creditor was not entitled to third party beneficiary status and rights under the policy to bring bad faith claim because action was brought before time for appeal of judgment expired and was not final.gulf is not a judgment creditor of the insured,santa susana,or the county as an additional insured.there was no allegation that either santa susana or the county were sued and that gulf was required to pay a judgment against either party.accordingly,gulf has not achieved the status of a third party beneficiary of the insurance policy issued by tig to santa susana and the county.
iii.the from the judgment after the court trial 
a.the trial 
the matter proceeded to a court trial on the first amended complaint.the evidence produced at trial established the following facts.tig issued liability insurance policy to santa susana.the policy was in effect from september,to september,when it expired.section i of the policy provides that tig agreed to provide coverage as follows we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage sustained during the policy period up to the limit stated in the certificate,to which this insurance applies.the bodily injury or property damage must be caused by an occurrence.the occurrence must take place during the policy period and be the direct result of your operations conducted after the effective date of your certificate and within the coverage territory.we will have the right and duty to defend any claim or suit seeking those damages.we do not have any duty to defend any claim or suit seeking damages for which we have determined there is no coverage.we may,at our discretion investigate any occurrence and settle any covered claim or suit that may result this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if claim for damages because of the bodily injury or property damage is first made in writing against any insured and reported to us in writing during the policy period or applicable extended reporting period for operations performed during the policy period.
section v of the policy contained a mandatory reporting period as follows any occurrence offense must be reported to us,in writing,within days of the policy termination date.all claims made against any insured for an occurrence offense so reported to us within the day period stated above,must be reported in writing to us within the policy period or one year after termination of the policy period.if any claim is made against any insured after days following the policy termination date which arises out of an occurrence offense that was not reported in writing to us within days of the policy termination date we will have no duty to defend or indemnify any insured for such claim.it is this reporting requirement which is at issue in the.
as noted above,the first amended complaint alleged that gulf was entitled to recover from tig the amount of damages paid to restore hill property.gulf alleged it was entitled to recover pursuant to tig commercial liability policy.the controversy in the case centered around whether gulf gave tig timely notice of the claim within the required reporting period under section v of the policy.the trial court implicitly determined that the claim was timely and entered judgment in gulf favor and against tig in the amount of.
although there was only one issue at trial,the facts surrounding the notice given the claim are somewhat complex because there are a number of entities,who are not parties to the action,but which were involved in the issuance of the tig insurance policy and in the reporting procedures.we begin our analysis by listing the various entities involved in the transaction as established by the evidence introduced at trial.the type of policy issued in this case was a part of an insurance program called the caic.the caic insurance program catered to small general contractors,artisans,and contractors.eve insurance brokerage eve was the underwriting entity for the whole insurance program.certified bond and insurance services certified was santa susana insurance agent or broker in through.prior to september,certified obtained insurance for santa susana under the caic program.the insurer was a captive company.the actual carriers were tig and american international specialty lines insurance company american.from september through september the actual carrier was american.
the following year the policy was renewed through the brokerage firm of eve and tig was the carrier.the effective dates under the tig policy were from september,through september.the underwriting forms were supplied to certified by its wholesaler pledge international insurance brokers pledge or pinnacle insurance services pinnacle.this company was known as pledge or pinnacle throughout the relevant time periods.hereinafter,the company is referred to as pinnacle for purposes of clarity.pinnacle had received the underwriting forms from eve which produced and distributed the forms to all the different wholesalers.after completing the forms for santa susana,the insured,certified transmitted them back to pinnacle.as noted previously,certified was the insurance agent for santa susana.thereupon,pinnacle communicated the premium and confirmed the coverage for the tig policy.apparently,at the time of the renewal process,eve was still operating the insurance program.nonetheless,the program was changing carriers.the wholesalers did not know who would be the ultimate carrier.eve initially indicated the carrier would be american.later,eve determined that tig would be the carrier.when pinnacle communicated the uncertainty of the carrier,certified initially prepared the certificate of insurance and listed two insurance companies as providing coverage,american and golden eagle insurance company.this certificate shows certified as the producer and names the county as an additional insured.when the policy was actually issued to santa susana by tig,pinnacle was listed as the account exec and as the account broker.the certificate of insurance lists pledge as the producer.
at the trial,lynda schultz testified that she was employed by insurance services group,llc,which was the claims management company for gulf on various bonds.insurances services group was previously known as viceroy management and for a short time as viceroy.since,either viceroy or insurance services group was the managing claims agent for gulf.viceroy investigated the claim at issue.
on august,viceroy sent a letter to american in care of certified regarding the county claims against santa susana for the damage to hill property.the letter was sent
