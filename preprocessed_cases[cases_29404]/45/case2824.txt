plaintiff and appellant sergio brizuela brizuela appeals from the trial court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant and respondent calfarm insurance company calfarm in brizuela action against calfarm for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in affirming the judgment we hold,as a matter of law,that brizuela violated the requirement of the insurance policy that he submit to an examination under oath that the insurer could on that basis deny his claim without a showing of prejudice that the availability of a deposition in litigation does not excuse his breach of the examination under oath requirement that he had no valid bad faith claim and that the court properly dismissed his action.
factual and procedural background 
in july,brizuela entered escrow to purchase the el toro de san juan market el toro.during escrow,brizuela obtained a business owner insurance policy from calfarm insurance company calfarm with limits of on personal property.his wife,karina brizuela,was also an insured under the policy.escrow closed on february.just over one month later,on march,a fire destroyed the market.brizuela hired a public adjuster to assist with his insurance claim.
brizuela reported the loss to calfarm,and calfarm assigned one of its employees,jack hosford,to investigate the claim.the calfarm investigator took recorded statements from brizuela,his wife,and an el toro employee.calfarm subsequently learned that brizuela had a felony conviction for receipt of stolen property that brizuela had been denied transfer of the alcohol license for el toro that beer and wine sales had accounted for a substantial portion of el toro business that the purchase price for the business was less than the amount brizuela claimed and that laboratory tests of the premises showed the presence of gasoline,an accelerant commonly used in arson fires.
calfarm submitted a suspected fraud claim referral to the department of insurance and a request to the district attorney that criminal charges for arson and insurance fraud be filed against brizuela.the department of insurance concluded there was insufficient information to support a criminal investigation,and the record contains no evidence that any criminal charges were filed against brizuela.there is no indication in the record as to when brizuela became aware of calfarm submissions to the department of insurance and district attorney.
on april,brizuela adjuster faxed calfarm pages of documents,including alarm company information,checks and checking account statements,and documents related to the purchase of the business.on may,calfarm counsel sent a letter to brizuela adjuster advising him that calfarm had scheduled examinations under oath for brizuela and brizuela wife on june,at that counsel offices in marina del rey,california.the insurance policy calfarm issued to brizuela included a provision allowing calfarm to examine any insured under oath in the event of a claim.in the may,letter,calfarm counsel asked that brizuela produce certain documents by june,and confirm the examination date by june.brizuela adjuster responded by requesting copies of recorded statements that brizuela and his wife had given to calfarm shortly after reporting the claim.calfarm counsel denied this request.
neither brizuela nor his adjuster confirmed the proposed examination date,and on june,calfarm counsel offered to reschedule the examination and extend the time to produce documents.brizuela adjuster responded by reiterating the request for copies of the recorded statements,and calfarm counsel again denied the request.
on june,calfarm counsel wrote to brizuela adjuster stating we understand that you have counseled brizuela to appear for the examination under oath without additional delay,but he has elected instead to draw out the claims investigation by insisting on receiving documentation which the insurance code clearly and unambiguously indicates he has no entitlement at this stage of the proceedings if brizuela final position on this matter is that he is unwilling to come to an examination under oath without first receipt and review of his recorded statement testimony and that of his wife,please confirm same to our offices,in writing,on or before june.at that time we will make our recommendations to calfarm based upon the information contained in the claim file and the lack of cooperation to date.the letter further stated,if brizuela withdraws this request and agrees to appear for the examination under oath,please submit available dates for his examination under oath and that of his wife.
brizuela then retained counsel,who wrote to calfarm counsel on june,complaining at length about calfarm refusal to provide the brizuelas previously recorded statements.brizuela counsel wrote that t he only purpose served by refusing to provide the transcripts would be the interest of the insurance carrier and its counsel to trick and confuse the insured to establish a basis for denial.brizuela counsel offered no dates for the examination under oath instead he wrote that w e will contact you directly to discuss time,dates and places for proceeding with the examination under oath as demanded.
on july,calfarm counsel sent brizuela counsel a letter reiterating calfarm denial of brizuela request for the previously recorded statements and requesting proposed dates for the examination under oath.brizuela counsel responded by letter the next day accusing calfarm of having no interest to act fairly in this matter by putting brizuela through an exercise to allow calfarm to take advantage of its insured and subsequently deny the claim.but in that letter,brizuela counsel proposed no dates for the examination.on july,calfarm counsel sent another request for examination dates and asked brizuela counsel to respond by july.brizuela counsel then sent two letters,dated july,and july,suggesting no dates for the examination but instead asking calfarm counsel to provide dates.
shortly thereafter,counsel for brizuela and calfarm had a telephone conversation during which calfarm counsel said he would be unavailable for three weeks in august,and the parties discussed proposed dates for the examination.on august,calfarm counsel sent a letter to brizuela counsel stating,w hen we last spoke,several weeks ago,several proposed dates for your client examination under oath were exchanged we have heard nothing from your offices since that time.calfarm counsel requested that a date certain for the examination and the production of documents requested in our initial letter be supplied to our offices on or before the close of business on wednesday,august,noting that calfarm would reach a decision on the claim based on the available information to date if no examination under oath occurred.on august,brizuela counsel responded by stating that his client had been available during the first three weeks of august and that w e will contact you with available dates now that we know you have surfaced from your trial matter.there is no suggestion in this letter as to brizuela availability for an examination under oath at any particular date or period of time.
on october,brizuela counsel wrote another letter to calfarm counsel,criticizing calfarm conduct but offering no dates for the now examination.instead,brizuela counsel suggested that calfarm counsel contact my office regarding proposed examination under oath dates.brizuela counsel further advised calfarm that he had a trial set to commence on november.calfarm counsel responded by letter dated october,again requesting documents and asking brizuela counsel to respond to our office in writing with dates certain for the examination under oath of brizuela and we will clear the dates with both the undersigned and hosford calendar.on november,brizuela counsel responded by letter stating he and his client had been available in october that counsel was now unavailable because of the november,trial and when we have a clearer picture as to our trial schedule,we will contact you for a date.
on november,brizuela counsel wrote calfarm counsel requesting proposed dates immediately inasmuch as we are set to commence to trial on december.there was no indication of the length of the trial.on november,calfarm counsel responded by noting that he had himself had been involved in answering ready for trial and appearing for trial and that he would continue to be so involved into the new year.calfarm counsel then stated as a result,we have the following available dates for the completion of the examination under oath of brizuela the available dates include december,and.it was not until january,that brizuela counsel communicated his complaint that he received calfarm letter after thanksgiving and determined that the proposed dates were neither reasonable nor practical.the next day,brizuela counsel received a letter from calfarm denying the claim.the letter stated,sergio and karina brizuela have failed to cooperate in the scheduling of an examination under oath.as such,this constitutes a breach of not only the contract provisions,but also of a condition precedent to coverage.calfarm also reserved the right to assert other terms and provisions contained in the policy as necessary,due to the insureds refusal to cooperate and appear for their examinations under oath and to produce supporting documentation.brizuela had never proposed a date for the examination under oath,and no examination ever occurred.
brizuela sued calfarm for breach of contract and for tortious bad faith breach of an insurance contract.calfarm filed a motion for summary judgment,and the trial court granted the motion.in so doing,the trial court concluded that brizuela attendance at an examination under oath requested by calfarm was a condition precedent to obtaining benefits under the policy that brizuela had the burden of satisfying a condition precedent to the insurance contract before attempting to sue on the contract that brizuela was obligated to attend the examination under oath calfarm had initially scheduled in june and that brizuela failure to attend the examination precluded his action on the contract.the trial court ruled that brizuela had no valid contract claim against calfarm and that absent a valid contract claim,brizuela could not maintain a bad faith claim against calfarm.brizuela timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment meets its burden of showing that there is no merit to a cause of action if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o.once the defendant has made such a showing,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or as to a defense to the cause of action.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.if the plaintiff does not make such a showing,summary judgment in favor of the defendant is appropriate.in order to obtain a summary judgment,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action t he defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such element id.at,d.
on appeal from a summary judgment,an appellate court makes an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d.
b.the breach of contract cause of action 
policy requirement of examination under oath 
calfarm insurance policy issued to brizuela imposed certain requirements on the insureds,including the duty to submit to an examination under oath.the policy also imposed upon the insureds the separate requirement to c ooperate with us in the investigation or settlement of the claim.
an insured compliance with a policy requirement to submit to an examination under oath is a prerequisite to the right to receive benefits under the policy.hickman london assurance cal,hickman.in hickman,an insurer investigating a loss under a fire policy demanded that the claimant attend an examination under oath,as required by the claimant policy.the claimant attended the examination,but refused to answer the insurer questions,invoking his fifth amendment right against because of pending criminal charges against him for arson.at the examination,the claimant offered to comply with the demand for an examination under oath after the arson charge was dismissed,or at any time if the insurer would cause the charge to be dismissed.the court held that the claimant refusal to submit to an examination was not justified and that by refusing to submit to an examination,the claimant forfeited the right to benefits under the policy if the insured can not bring himself within the terms and conditions of the policy he can not recover.the terms of the policy constitute the measure of the insurer liability.if it appears that the contract has been violated,and thus terminated by the assured,he can not recover.he seeks to recover by reason of a contract,and he must show that he has complied with such contract on his part.hickman,supra,cal.at,see also california fair plan association superior court th,d globe indemnity superior court th,d robinson national auto.ins.d,west state farm fire casualty cir.
insured did not comply with requirement for examination under oath 
brizuela contends he never refused to submit to an examination under oath.he does not dispute,however,that he failed to appear at the examination initially scheduled for june.brizuela only response was a request sent by his adjuster on june,for copies of recorded statements brizuela and his wife had given calfarm shortly after brizuela made his claim.
after brizuela failed to comply with calfarm initial demand for an examination under oath,it became incumbent upon him to fulfill the requirement of being examined by offering to submit to such an examination at a later time.bergeron employers fire ins.he did not submit,or agree to submit to an examination under oath,on any specific date after june.calfarm had done all that it was required to do to set in motion the policy provisions for an examination of the insured under oath.ibid.although calfarm reiterated its demand numerous times thereafter by asking brizuela to provide dates for the examination,brizuela failed to do so.
brizuela contends that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether calfarm conduct in scheduling the examination was unreasonable so as to excuse his failure to submit to an examination.hickman,supra,cal.at,right to demand the performance of the condition precedent must be exercised in a reasonable manner gruenberg aetna ins.cal d,gruenberg.the reasonableness of an insurer conduct in processing a claim may be a question of fact.but when the evidence is undisputed and only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence,the issue of reasonableness is a question of law.west state farm fire casualty,supra,applying california law and affirming summary judgment in favor of insurer that its demand for an examination under oath was reasonable as a matter of law globe indemnity superior court,supra,th at,d reasonable minds can not differ in determining that insurer delay was due to refusal of insured to submit to examination under oath see also aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,there is a genuine issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.
here,the facts are undisputed that brizuela failed to attend an examination under oath scheduled by calfarm in june.brizuela did not contend that illness or some other incapacity excused his attendance on june,nor did he object at that time on the ground that calfarm scheduling of the examination was unreasonable.hickman,supra,cal.at,insured claim that his nonattendance at examination under oath was excused because insurer did not exercise right to demand examination in a reasonable manner rejected because insured made no objection to reasonableness of time,place or mode of examination.brizuela neither submitted nor agreed to submit to an examination on any particular date at any time thereafter,notwithstanding calfarm repeated requests over a period that brizuela make himself available for such an examination.brizuela did not respond in a timely manner to calfarm proposal offering six alternative dates in december.
brizuela complained at length about the alleged unreasonableness of calfarm conduct without ever agreeing to submit to examination on any date.calfarm refusal to provide brizuela with copies of statements was not justification for his actions.it was not unreasonable for calfarm to reject brizuela request for copies of his previously recorded statement.there is no authority for the proposition that an insurer is under a legal obligation to provide an insured with a copy of the insured previously recorded statements taken before a civil action has been filed and discovery commenced.if an insured seeks the statement to refresh a recollection at an examination under oath,the insurer refusal to provide the statement may affect the insured ability to provide information at the examination.but that normally is the insurer choice.even if there might be circumstances when it might be unfair or unreasonable for an insurer to demand an examination under oath without complying with an insured request for an earlier recorded statement,here,brizuela has given no reason why calfarm refusal to provide the statement was unfair or unreasonable.
brizuela failure,six months after calfarm initial request for the examination,to propose any dates for an examination,to respond in a timely manner to calfarm proposed dates,and to submit to an examination constituted a refusal to submit to examination under oath.see,rosenthal prudential property casualty cir applying new york law and granting summary judgment in favor of insurer after concluding that purported scheduling conflicts did not justify delay of examination under oath that included six adjournments gould investors,general ins.applying new york law,insured unexcused failure to attend examination under oath was material breach of policy upon insured unilateral cancellation of a scheduled examination,burden is on insured to offer alternative future date for the examination home ins.olmstead so d insured refusal to submit to examination under oath as scheduled,and subsequent failure to offer to submit to examination for months caused insured to forfeit rights under policy.
brizuela contends that what is in effect a forfeiture of policy benefits is too severe a sanction to impose for his failure to schedule an examination under oath during the six months following calfarm initial demand.he analogizes his inability to agree with calfarm upon a date certain for the examination to a discovery dispute and claims that the trial court imposition of the equivalent of terminating sanctions was inappropriate.this is not,however,a discovery dispute,and the range of sanctions that may be imposed in discovery disputes is not available here.both the terms of the policy and the relevant case authority make clear that a claim for policy benefits may be denied as a consequence of failing to submit to a policy condition for examination under oath.hickman,supra,cal.at,california fair plan association superior court,supra,th at,d see also couch on insurance ed,pp.generally,in the absence of a reasonable excuse,when an insured fails to comply with the insurance policy provisions requiring an examination under oath and the production of documents,the breach generally results in a forfeiture of coverage,thereby relieving the insurer of its liability to pay,and provides the insurer an absolute defense to an action on the policy.
no showing of prejudice was required 
brizuela argues that calfarm was not entitled to deny his claim based on the failure to cooperate in the scheduling of an examination under oath unless calfarm demonstrated that it was prejudiced by that failure an insurer must demonstrate that it has been substantially prejudiced by an insured breach of the contractual duty to cooperate in the investigation of a claim,when the insurer is asserting such breach as a defense to an action on the policy.campbell allstate ins.cal d,campbell.there is no california authority,however,that requires an insurer to show prejudice before denying policy benefits to an insured who has violated a policy provision requiring submission to an examination under oath.the cases do provide that compliance with the policy requirement for an examination under oath is a condition precedent to any claim,and the refusal to submit to such an examination causes a forfeiture of any rights under the policy.hickman,supra,cal.at,bergeron employers fire ins,supra.at.
in robinson national auto.ins,supra,d,which involved the insured breach of a policy provision requiring both the insured cooperation and submission to an examination under oath,the court held that the insured failure to submit to examination was a breach of both the duty to cooperate and the duty to submit to examination.although not specifically discussed,the court required no showing of prejudice by the insurer.see also california fair plan association superior court,supra,th,d globe indemnity superior court,supra,th at,d the right to require the insured to submit to an examination under oath concerning all proper subjects of inquiry is reasonable as a matter of law.the insurer is entitled to investigate fully and fairly the claims.if an examination under oath is reasonably required towards this end its denial would necessarily be prejudicial to the insurer.at no time did brizuela contend that the requested examination under oath was not reasonably required for calfarm investigation of the claim.
campbell,supra,cal d,is distinguishable from the instant case campbell did not involve an examination under oath policy provision but rather a claim by a third party invoking a statutory right to recover on the insured liability insurance policy after obtaining a judgment against the insured.in campbell,the court said that a n insurer may assert defenses based upon a breach by the insured of a condition of the policy such as a cooperation clause,but the breach can not be a valid defense unless the insurer was substantially prejudiced thereby the burden of proving that a breach of a cooperation clause resulted in prejudice is on the insurer.campbell,supra,cal d at.there is a distinction,however,between a breach of a duty of cooperation and a breach of the duty to submit to an examination under oath.lack of cooperation can be ascribed to many acts or of significance and some trivial.it makes sense to require an insurer to demonstrate prejudice before denying a claim based on breach of the duty to cooperate because not every failure by an insured to cooperate should result in a forfeiture of policy benefits.in contrast,an insured refusal to submit to an examination under oath generally does not involve the subjective evaluation that exists with regard to whether or not there was cooperation by the insured.either the insured refused to submit to the examination under oath,or complied with the requirement for an examination under oath.
the purpose of the examination under oath is to enable the insurer to obtain the information necessary to process the claim as the facts with respect to the amount and circumstances of a loss are almost entirely within the sole knowledge of the insured,it is necessary that it the insurer have some means of,as it were,upon the written statement and proofs of the insured,for the purpose of getting at the exact facts before paying the sum claimed of it.such considerations justify the provisio
