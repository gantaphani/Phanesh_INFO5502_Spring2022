factual background and procedural history 
gdc entered a contract with rubicon,rubicon to incinerate hazardous materials at the rubicon plant located in geismar,louisiana.to facilitate this contract,gdc and its sole shareholders hameed elnaggar and kathleen elnaggar entered a sales and service agreement with terratech and tpst whereby tpst agreed to design,develop,manufacture,and deliver a portable hazardous waste incinerator for the rubicon plant.the sales agreement also required tpst to provide two lead operators,the primary duty of whom was to train the employees of gdc to operate the incinerator.ron waligora waligora,a mechanical engineer,was one of the lead operators assigned to the rubicon plant pursuant to the sales agreement.
the liquid waste incinerator provided by tpst for the rubicon plant was equipped with three redundant systems,the purpose of which was to provide an emergency flow of water to cool the system in the event that temperatures in the incinerator exceeded normal,a power failure occurred,or the main induce draft fan was not functioning.in january of,a problem developed with one of the variable speed control drivers driver,an electrical component of the incinerator.gdc contacted controls of baton rouge,louisiana,to repair the driver.at the request of gdc,controls dispatched one of its field technicians,dan lee lee who disconnected power to the control panel in which the driver was housed,removed the driver,and transported it to baton rouge for repair.upon completion of the repairs,the driver was returned to the rubicon plant and reinstalled by lee.
on february,gdc discovered a problem with another of the drivers in the control panel.was again contacted to repair the driver,but gdc decided to use its own employees to remove and transport the driver to baton rouge.gdc operator george daher contacted waligora,stated that he was going,and requested that waligora remove the driver the following morning.it is undisputed that other gdc operators had received training with regard to the procedure to be utilized when disconnecting the power supply to the control panel.it is further undisputed that several gdc employees had the training necessary to remove the damaged driver.
on february,waligora initially consulted the incinerator log book which indicated that cooling water was being supplied by the recirculating pumps.waligora then assessed the control panel and,upon finding that the recirculating pump light was not illuminated assumed that the recirculating pumps had been turned off and that one of the alternate water supply systems was cooling the incinerator.although waligora knew that two of the redundancies,the hale fire pump and john deere emergency diesel,were either not functioning or not enabled respectively,he was unaware that the third,the solenoid valve to the emergency supply,had been closed by the gdc operators because it had developed a leak.therefore,the only devices providing cooling water to the incinerator were the recirculating pumps which would cease to function at the time power to the control panel was disconnected to facilitate removal of the damaged driver.
christopher covert covert,an associate engineer employed by gdc to supervise construction of the primary furnace for the rubicon plant,was present at the process control panel of the incinerator.prior to the time waligora disconnected power to the control panel,he informed covert that the disruption would cause certain readings on the panel to remain constant while others would read zero.waligora then disrupted power to the control panel thereby disconnecting the recirculating pumps.although several alarms signaled on the control panel,they were silenced by covert as it was his belief,based on waligora statement,that abnormal readings were to be expected and could be ignored.a fire in the incinerator ensued shortly after power to the control panel was disconnected.
gdc and tpst entered an agreement of settlement,release,transaction and compromise to resolve all claims then existing between the parties including claims that arose because of the fire.gdc indicated that its primary purpose in entering the settlement was to obtain insurance proceeds to effectuate replacement of the damaged incinerator and to resume operations.thereafter,boston old colony,the fire insurer and subrogee of gdc,filed suit against tpst and its parent corporation terratech,in part to recover the insurance proceeds paid to gdc.the case was heard by united states chief district judge john parker who,after a trial and consideration of the briefs submitted by the parties,found that the sole cause of the fire was the negligence of waligora in removing the driver for the main induce fan without making sure that it was safe to do so,without making sure that the cooling water supply would not be interrupted.judge parker additionally found that under the terms of the sales agreement entered by tpst and gdc,the latter agreed to indemnify and hold tpst harmless from claims of the nature asserted in the complaint thereby precluding the ability of boston old colony,as subrogee of gdc,to recover on those claims judgment was entered in favor of tpst and terratech and the case was dismissed on january.the decision of the district court was affirmed on appeal 
on january,terratech and tpst appellants filed suit against gdc and kathleen elnaggar in her individual and representative capacities elnaggar to recover the attorneys fees and costs incurred in defending the boston old colony litigation during the period relevant to the underlying dispute,gdc and elnaggar had in effect a comprehensive general liability insurance policy cgl policy,the insurer of which was appellee scottsdale.on june,gdc and elnaggar filed a third party complaint against scottsdale after scottsdale refused their tender of defense.on december,appellants filed an amended complaint whereby scottsdale was named as a principal defendant in the case the parties consented to have the case heard by united states magistrate judge stephen riedlinger.
on may,appellants moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability against elnaggar and scottsdale.in response,scottsdale argued that the claims asserted by the appellants were excluded from coverage under the contractual liability coverage exclusion contractual liability exclusion the engineers,architects or surveyors professional liability exclusion professional liability exclusion the magistrate judge granted summary judgment in favor of appellants against elnaggar,and found that tpst could recover reasonable attorneys fees and costs from elnaggar pursuant to the indemnification clause and the personal guarantee clause contained in the sales agreement.with regard to scottsdale,the magistrate judge found that the contractual liability exclusion did not bar recovery but denied sum
