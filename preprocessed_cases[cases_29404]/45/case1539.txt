bradley hillstrom john kenefick and the law firm of briggs and morgan,collectively,kenefick and ge group life assurance company geglac are all parties having various roles in this appeal.hillstrom and kenefick,as appellant and,challenge decisions of the district court in this convoluted case that has its basis in hillstrom claim for disability benefits.we affirm.
hillstrom is a physiatrist a physician specializing in physical medicine or physical therapy who is seeking disability benefits under a policy issued by phoenix american life insurance company to an entity called rehab one,that policy is an employee benefit plan governed by erisa geglac is defending the suit as phoenix successor in interest.kenefick is an attorney and a shareholder in briggs and morgan.kenefick represented hillstrom in his initial attempt to collect disability benefits from phoenix.
on april,hillstrom and rehab one,of which hillstrom was part owner,executed a document captioned employment agreement.pursuant to that agreement,rehab one employed hillstrom as chief executive officer.hillstrom compensation was limited to stock options in rehab one until such time,if ever,that rehab one agrees,in its sole discretion,to provide additional compensation.employment agreement pt.iii.hillstrom duties were detailed in an exhibit attached to the agreement,and he was to commit such time and effort as is reasonably required for discharge of his responsibilities under the agreement.id.pt.
rehab one purchased a group disability policy from phoenix with an effective date of january,covering rehab one active officer employees whose earnings exceeded.the eligible employees were not listed by name in the policy,which was cancelled in as rehab one went out of business.
on january,rehab one and hca partners,entered into a management agreement.according to this agreement,hca was a wyoming limited liability company formed to provide directorship and management services to rehab one through hca principals bradley hillstrom,scott hillstrom bradley brother,and john clark,management agreement at.according to the agreement,the hca principals were all directors officers of rehab one and responsible for its general management.id.the parties agreed that the hca principals would perform all general management services for rehab one,except for those furnished by rehab one president.id.but the capacities in which the hca principals were to serve were not specified by the agreement.in return for the services of hca and its principals,rehab one was to pay hca a management fee of annually per month,but the agreement did not say how the fee was to be divided among the hca at all.id.at.the management fee was the entire consideration for all services to be rendered by hca by the hca principals,except that in addition to the management fee scott hillstrom shall be a payroll employee of rehab one and shall receive a monthly salary of.id.emphasis added.the employment agreement between rehab one and hillstrom individually was not mentioned in the management agreement.
on january,hillstrom fell while snowboarding and hit his head and back.the next day,an mri of hillstrom brain was read as normal,notwithstanding the severe headaches he was experiencing.by his own admission,hillstrom started with alcohol and vicodin,a prescription narcotic pain reliever.this continued until april,when he began inpatient treatment for chemical dependence.after treatment,hillstrom continued to complain of neurological difficulties,including memory problems and difficulty concentrating,and a psychiatrist declared him disabled as of the date of the snowboarding accident.it was about this time that hillstrom retained kenefick to represent him in his claims for disability benefits.kenefick prepared a claim for the phoenix benefits and submitted it on october.
there followed over the months a course of correspondence regarding phoenix review of hillstrom claim.generally,the issues included the source and amount of hillstrom income for his work for rehab one whether hillstrom was under the regular care of a physician during the claimed period of disability,as the policy required whether the alleged disability was the result of substance abuse and the onset date of the alleged disability.phoenix also sought the assistance of financial consultant coopers lybrand,who determined that hillstrom had no insurable income under the disability policy issued to rehab one.on january,phoenix sent a letter to kenefick noting that phoenix had yet to receive a response from kenefick regarding the employment,financial,medical and other income documentation previously requested.letter from murphy phoenix to kenefick briggs and morgan of.that letter said,based upon the information made available to us,hillstrom has not provided the required proof of eligibility,proof of disability and proof of loss as defined under this plan in order to qualify for payment of benefits id.on several occasions after that,kenefick submitted to phoenix additional information on behalf of hillstrom claim.phoenix responded employing the language of denial quoted above.kenefick filed an appeal in february,which phoenix denied by letter dated may,t he reasons for our denial of the claim have not changed and are as set forth in our prior correspondence.letter from kelleher phoenix to kenefick briggs and morgan of may.
in april,hillstrom filed suit against kenefick in minnesota state court claiming legal malpractice for,among other things,kenefick failure to correctly identify the applicable statute of limitations for mounting a court challenge to phoenix denial of benefits.hillstrom then filed an amended complaint adding geglac phoenix successor as a defendant and seeking a declaration of his rights regarding the statute of limitations applicable to his disability claim against phoenix life,or as an alternative to relief on his malpractice claim,an award of disability benefits directly from geglac.second amended complaint counts iii,iv.geglac removed the case to federal court in august.a few days later,kenefick filed his answer and included a counterclaim and for declarations that the statute of limitations on hillstrom claim against geglac for benefits had not run and in any event,hillstrom was not entitled to disability benefits under the terms of the policy that phoenix issued to rehab one.in september,geglac filed a motion to dismiss all of hillstrom claims against the company as.on december,the district court granted geglac motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds.after that,on december,the district court granted in part hillstrom motion to amend his complaint to add claims against geglac for breach of fiduciary duty for failure to provide plan documents.and in january,the district court granted kenefick motion to reconsider its december,order dismissing all claims against geglac,in light of the decision to allow hillstrom to amend his complaint to bring a claim against geglac for breach of fiduciary duty.
kenefick filed a motion for summary judgment on may.he argued that no genuine issues of material fact remained and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on hillstrom malpractice claim.kenefick maintained that hillstrom could not show that he,hillstrom,was entitled to disability benefits under rehab one policy,for the reasons set forth in the series of denial letters from phoenix.kenefick further contended that if hillstrom were indeed disabled,the disability was the result of mental illness substance abuse,and any benefits were therefore subject to a cap.finally,kenefick argued at some length that,in any event,the applicable statute of limitations would not bar hillstrom suit against geglac for disability benefits,so hillstrom could not prove his claim of legal malpractice.he asked the court to reconsider its december,order to the contrary.
geglac may,motion for summary judgment likewise argued no disability and no eligibility,or,at most,disability by reason of mental illness.geglac agreed with the district court decision that the statute of limitations had run.
also on may,hillstrom filed his own motion for summary judgment.his argument mirrored his amended complaint he was entitled to either summary judgment against geglac on his claim for disability benefits or,if that suit was,summary judgment against kenefick for the value of the disability benefits under the phoenix policy that he would have received but for kenefick alleged malpractice in handling hillstrom claim.
on june,the district court heard oral arguments on the motions for summary judgment and on kenefick motion to reconsider the decision on the statute of limitations.in september,the court granted kenefick and geglac motions for summary judgment,denied hillstrom motion for summary judgment,and dismissed hillstrom third amended complaint.kenefick motion for reconsideration was denied as moot.hillstrom appeals the denial of his summary judgment motion.kenefick on the statute of limitations question,continuing to argue that hillstrom filed suit against geglac within the time allowed.
we review the decision to grant summary judgment de novo and will affirm if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to hillstrom,we conclude there are no genuine issues of material fact and kenefick is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see sanders city of minneapolis,cir.in our review,we apply the same standard as the district court,which brings us to the first issue we must address what standard do we,the federal courts,apply in reviewing this particular denial of benefits we review de novo the district court determination of the appropriate standard.butts cont l cas,cir.
judicial review of a decision to deny benefits under an erisa for abuse of discretion or determined by the terms of the plan in question.if the plan administrator is vested with discretionary authority to interpret the plan or make decisions regarding eligibility for benefits,then the courts review only for an abuse of that discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.otherwise,we review the denial of benefits de novo.
there are in the record three versions of the disability policy that phoenix issued to rehab one on january.each is marked with a different last date printed on the face of the group certificate march,march,and november.and there are language discrepancies among the three versions.the policy is the one phoenix sent to kenefick after hillstrom engaged kenefick to represent him in filing claims for disability benefits.that version is missing every other page and apparently was used throughout much of the administrative claims process.later in that process,a colleague of kenefick from briggs and morgan requested a complete copy.it remains a disputed fact whether kenefick ever worked with a complete copy while he was representing hillstrom.
the policy was produced with geglac rule disclosures as the policy in effect on january,the date of hillstrom snowboarding accident.the version,also produced during discovery,was certified by a compliance analyst for geglac as the version in effect on january.one of the many conundrums we have encountered in this appeal is why language in the policy of which are for policyholder rehab one,number,with an effective date of january,changed upon each reprinting.in particular,why does the policy printed in,and certified to be the policy in effect on january,have different language from the policy printed in,when the policy was cancelled before the print date that is,how can a policy containing language that evolved between and,after the policy was cancelled,be the applicable policy but that is what is in the record before us.
the fact that the record contains multiple versions of the policy with different language is more than just a curiosity when it comes to the underlying standard of review in this case.the versions with the and print dates include this language under the heading benefits fiduciary w e phoenix are charged with the obligation,and possess discretionary authority to make claim,eligibility and other administrative determinations regarding the disability policy.policy printed,at policy printed,at.that is,the language in these versions gives discretion to the plan administrator to make decisions regarding eligibility.as we have said,the courts would therefore review any such determinations for an abuse of the plan administrator discretion.the certified policy has no such language,however,so the plan administrator decision regarding eligibility would be reviewed de novo under the terms of that version.the district court,while recognizing that identifying the operative version of the policy raises a genuine question of fact,nevertheless determined that the result would be the same under either standard of judicial review.that is,the question of fact,while genuine,is not material and does not preclude entering judgment as a matter of law admittedly,we were at first skeptical at that notion,but upon our de novo review of the district court de novo review of the plan administrator decision,we have to agree.as we explain infra,we conclude that phoenix made the correct determination under either standard of review.before we get to the legal analysis,however,there are other discrepancies among the three versions of the policy that we will address here while we are on the subject.
under the subsection headed proof of loss,the policy gives phoenix the right to require proof of other income benefits.policy printed,at.by the terms of the policy,phoenix may require,in addition to the other income benefits information,b usiness and financial records or any other pertinent financial documentation we may deem necessary.policy printed,at.as for the policy printed in,the proof of loss subsection would apparently be found on one of the missing pages since no such subsection appears in that version of the policy.the extra proof of loss language from the policy also appears in a january denial letter from phoenix,causing hillstrom to claim that phoenix was requiring more information that it was entitled to receive in order to determine proof of loss.again we agree with the district court that this difference is of no consequence,as both the and the versions of the policy permit phoenix to require additional proof of your claim at any reasonable time during the period of disability.policy printed,at.
the other difference of note among the printed versions of the policy concerns the crux of this case the description of persons eligible for benefits under the policy issued to rehab one.the versions printed in and contain this language 
coverage eligibility 
each employee 
eligible class 
each active officer whose basic annual earnings are more than 
policy printed,group certificate policy printed,group certificate.coverage eligibility in the policy printed in is described the same as in the earlier versions,but the eligible class is described as 
all active employees as listed below 
each officer whose basic annual earnings are greater than 
policy printed,at.although hillstrom believes the language found in the certified policy should apply to other aspects of the case,such as the standard of review and the proof of loss discussed above,here he prefers the language of the versions of the policy dated and.the district court noted hillstrom desire to pick and choose the most favorable policy language and decided the case accommodating his wishes,perhaps taking this approach as viewing the record in the light most favorable to hillstrom.mem.op.order at,wl.the court again determined that it would grant summary judgment to kenefick even applying the language that hillstrom sees as more helpful to him.frankly,we do not see a substantive difference when the eligibility provisions are read as a whole and not in isolation.we agree with the district court and conclude that the discrepancy on this matter is a question of fact but not a material one.
we come now to our legal analysis of the issues in this case.to begin,we sum up the positions of the parties on appeal 
hillstrom wants benefits,preferably directly from geglac on the merits of his disability claim.his desired outcome we hold that his suit against geglac is not,that he is an eligible rehab one employee,and that he is permanently disabled within the meaning of the policy si
