the issue on appeal in this diversity case is whether the district court erred in dismissing the complaint filed by an original defendant,cooper tire rubber company,against its insurance broker,marsh usa and marsh placements collectively referred to as marsh,after cooper tire voluntarily entered into a settlement with the parties to the original complaint.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants marsh,finding lack of an actual case or controversy between marsh and cooper tire.because we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint in light of the dismissal of the underlying action from which cooper tire complaint derived,we affirm the judgment of the district court.the complaint was filed under the district court supplemental jurisdiction and can go forward as an independent,nonindemnity action after settlement of the original action only within the discretion of the court,as we will explain below.
marsh has been the insurance broker for cooper tire since the.like most tire manufacturers,cooper tire maintains layered insurance coverage to defend and protect it from product liability claims.the first layer of insurance was a commercial umbrella policy issued by national union.the next layer of insurance was a commercial excess liability policy issued by american zurich.the coverage provided by american zurich policy with cooper tire is specifically in excess of the national union policy.a third layer policy,not at issue here,provided coverage in excess of the national union and american zurich policies.due to a sharp increase in the number of suits against cooper tire in the late,national union notified american zurich in november that the national union policy limits,as well as cooper tire,were near exhaustion for the period april to april.
a dispute arose because national union had applied approximately million of legal defense costs toward depletion of the aggregate policy limit but american zurich claimed that the national union policy required national union to pay defense costs in addition to the stated limits of the policy.under this interpretation of the national union policy,american zurich maintained that national union had not yet met its policy aggregate,thereby relieving american zurich from an obligation to begin paying out under its excess liability policy.in may,american zurich filed a declaratory judgment action against national union and cooper tire seeking a declaration that national union legal defense costs did not deplete the aggregate policy limit of the national union policy,but would have to be paid over and above the policy limits the american zurich policy would not be triggered until the national union policy limits are exhausted by the payments of settlements and claims only,excluding any defense costs in the policy aggregate any defense costs paid by american zurich would deplete the and aggregate limits of the american zurich policy it could recover any amounts already paid out under its excess liability policy and it was entitled to an accounting of all amounts paid by national union on cooper tire behalf.at american zurich complaint at american zurich amended complaint.
in response,cooper tire,as defendant,in addition to a counterclaim against american zurich and a against national union,filed a complaint on october,at amended on february,at,against its insurance broker,marsh,alleging that marsh executed an unauthorized retroactive modification of the american zurich policy in april known as endorsement.specifically,cooper tire claims that the american zurich excess liability policy expressly provided that american zurich would pay defense costs in addition to the and aggregate policy limits but that marsh had,through executing endorsement,authorized a change to the policy converting it to a defense within limits policy without the knowledge of or notice to cooper tire.cooper tire claims it did not,and continues not to,approve of the change to the policy effected by endorsement.
cooper tire complaint against marsh was brought pursuant to the district court supplemental jurisdiction under a it stated three causes of action against marsh in its first amended complaint at negligence breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.according to the complaint,liability on the part of marsh under each cause of action was predicated on a finding in the underlying action that endorsement was valid.count reads 
if the court finds endorsement to be valid and binding on cooper tire,marsh breached its duty in that event,cooper tire will be forced,as a direct and proximate result of marsh failure to act in cooper tire best interest and to procure an insurance program approved by cooper tire,to pay for the defense of underlying products liability claims from its own assets and fill in gaps in coverage between the layers of excess insurance coverage.
