this case,which involves a dispute over the proceeds of a life insurance policy,raises the following issue does the federal interpleader remedy shield a negligent stakeholder from tort liability for its creation of a conflict over entitlement to the interpleaded funds we hold that it does not,and that a claimant may seek to recover all damages directly and proximately caused by the negligent stakeholder conduct.
on march,west coast life insurance company west coast issued a life insurance policy with a death benefit of to the late steve lee.steve was the original owner of the policy.william lee,steve brother,was the original beneficiary.in the subsequent years,west coast received numerous change of ownership and beneficiary forms from members of the lee family.at issue is a policy change form signed and executed in july,purporting to change the ownership and beneficiaries of the policy to robert lee,bobbie bill lee,and steve lee.bobbie and steve are steve nephews.robert is steve grandson.
robert,bobbie,and steve executed the aforementioned change forms in west coast san francisco office with the help of west coast director of policy administration,james davis.davis erroneously instructed bobbie and robert to sign as the existing owners of the policy,when in fact steve was an existing owner and robert was not.davis also erroneously failed to ask steve to sign a change of beneficiary form which would have transferred a interest to robert as a beneficiary.nonetheless,davis witnessed bobbie and robert signatures and west coast approved and recorded a change of beneficiary as follows robert,steve jr,bobbie.relying on the validity of the july changes,robert paid premiums due on the policy until steve death approximately four years later.
the lee family members made several additional,subsequent changes to the policy ownership and beneficiaries.the final change occurred in december of when robert lee and gina stevens became the sole beneficiaries.steve died in january.robert and gina then submitted claim forms to west coast.in response,west coast informed robert and gina that the july changes were improperly executed,and therefore that they had no interest in the policy.in march,upon learning that he retained the interest in the policy that he held in,bobbie submitted a claim form to west coast.in april of,west coast responded by contacting all parties involved regarding the disputed claims,urging them to reach a mutual agreement regarding payment of the insurance policy benefits,and informing them that it would file an interpleader action if no agreement could be reached.the parties were unable to reach an agreement.
in august of,steve,bobbie,and william lee collectively,plaintiffs filed suit against west coast in the los angeles superior court alleging claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under california law.west coast removed the case to federal court invoking diversity jurisdiction,filed an answer and counterclaim in,deposited plus accrued interest with the district court,and added gina and laura as counterdefendants.robert,gina,and laura collectively,counterclaimants filed counterclaims for negligence and declaratory relief against west coast,and crossclaims against the plaintiffs.
west coast moved for partial summary judgment,which the district court granted in west coast favor as to its interpleader claim and on the claims sounding in contract.the plaintiffs and counterclaimants then reached a settlement to distribute the interpleaded funds amongst themselves,and the district court entered an order approving the distribution.the district court,without prompting by the parties,then amended its summary judgment order to grant summary judgment in west coast favor as to counterclaimants claim for attorney fees,ruling that west coast liability for attorney fees incurred in litigating over ownership of the stake was cut off by the interpleader action.the district court concluded that counterclaimants negligence claim against west coast was the only claim remaining to be tried 
at the pretrial conference,the district court asked the parties to brief what damages counterclaimants could recover should they succeed on the merits of their negligence claim.counterclaimants argued that their damages included the amount of the insurance proceeds allocated to the plaintiffs pursuant to their settlement and the attorney fees incurred in litigating their claims against the plaintiffs at a subsequent pretrial conference,the parties stipulated to a trial on a record consisting of written declarations and stipulated facts,and to west coast filing of a motion for a judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure c 
the district court subsequently granted west coast motion.the court did not address the merits of counterclaimants negligence claim,reasoning that they had failed to allege any cognizable damages flowing from west coast alleged negligent conduct 
counterclaimants timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse.

both rule and the interpleader statute allow a party to file a claim for interpleader if there is a possibility of exposure to double or multiple liability.a.the purpose of interpleader is for the stakeholder to protect itself against the problems posed by multiple claimants to a single fund.mack kuckenmeister,cir quoting.mut.life ins.ensley,cir see also michelman lincoln life ins,wl,at cir.this includes protecting against the possibility of liability to a second claimant where the stakeholder has already voluntarily paid a first claimant.but it also includes limiting litigation expenses,which is not dependent on the merits of adverse claims,only their existence.mack,at citation omitted.
an interpleader action typically involves two stages.in the first stage,the district court decides whether the requirements for a rule or statutory interpleader action have been met by determining if there is a single fund at issue and whether there are adverse claimants to that fund.id.at quoting rhoades casey,cir.if the district court finds that the interpleader action has been properly brought the district court will then make a determination of the respective rights of the claimants.id.at citation omitted.
the protection afforded by interpleader takes several forms.most significantly,it prevents the stakeholder from being obliged to determine at his peril which claimant has the better claim wright,supra,see also id.at i t is thought that the stakeholder should not be compelled to run the risk of guessing which claimants may recover from the fund.by contrast,interpleader protection generally does not extend to counterclaims that are not claims to the interpleaded funds.certainly when the stakeholder is an interested party and when one of the claimants asserts that the stakeholder is independently liable to him,the interposition of a counterclaim is appropriate.indeed,in most instances of this type,the counterclaim will be compulsory and the court will exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure civil footnote omitted see also d interpleader interpleader is a procedural device not intended to alter substantive rights.it is not the function of an interpleader rule to bestow upon the stakeholder immunity from liability for damages that are unrelated to the act of interpleading,such as negligence in preserving the fund.footnotes omitted.
the supreme court decision in state farm fire cas.tashire,d,aptly illustrates this point.there,the insurer of a truck driver whose vehicle had collided with a bus brought an interpleader action in federal court in oregon.many of the bus passengers had been injured and several suits had been filed against the drivers and owners of the two vehicles in california state courts.id.at.in its complaint in the oregon district court,the insurer asserted that,at the time of the collision,it had in force an insurance policy with respect to the driver of the truck providing for bodily injury liability up to per person and per occurrence,and for legal representation of the driver in actions covered by the policy.it asserted that the actions already filed in california and others which it anticipated would be filed far exceeded,in aggregate damages sought,the amount of its maximum liability under the policy.id.at.accordingly,the insurer paid into the court the sum of and asked the court to require all claimants to establish their claims against the driver and his insurer in that single proceeding and in no other,and to discharge it from all further obligations under its policy including its duty to defend the driver in lawsuits arising from the accident.id.
the district court issued an order requiring the to show cause why they should not be restrained from filing or prosecuting any proceeding in any state or united states court affecting the property or obligation involved in this interpleader action,and specifically against the plaintiff insurance company and the defendant driver.id.at.the district court then issued a temporary injunction along the lines that the insurance company sought.id.on appeal,we reversed,reasoning that the insurance company could not invoke federal interpleader until the claims against the insured,the alleged tortfeasor,had been reduced to judgment.id.at.
the supreme court reversed our judgment.it reasoned that,
were an insurance company required to await reduction of claims to judgment,the first claimant to obtain such a judgment or to negotiate a settlement might appropriate all or a disproportionate slice of the fund before his fellow claimants were able to establish their claims.the difficulties such a race to judgment pose for the insurer,and the unfairness which may result to some claimants,were among the principal evils the interpleader device was intended to remedy.
id.at footnote omitted.
nonetheless,the fact that the insurer had properly stated an interpleader claim did not entitle it to an order both enjoining prosecution of suits against it outside the confines of the interpleader proceeding and also extending such protection to its insured,the alleged tortfeasor.id.this was so,the court reasoned,because the scope of the litigation,in terms of parties and claims,was vastly more extensive than the confines of the fund,the deposited proceeds of the insurance policy.in these circumstances,the mere existence of such a fund can not,by use of interpleader,be employed to accomplish purposes that exceed the needs of orderly contest with respect to the fund.id.at.
the court contrasted the case before it with the typical interpleader action,explaining 
there are situations,of a type not present here,where the effect of interpleader is to confine the total litigation to a single forum and proceeding.one such case is where a stakeholder,faced with rival claims to the fund itself,acknowledges or denies his liability to one or the other of the claimants.in this situation,the fund itself is the target of the claimants.it marks the outer limits of the controversy.it is,therefore,reasonable and sensible that interpleader,in discharge of its office to protect the fund,should also protect the stakeholder from vexatious and multiple litigation.
id.at footnote omitted.the case before it,the court explained,was another matter.id.
here,an accident has happened.passengers or their representatives have claims which they wish to press against a variety of defendants the bus company,its driver,the owner of the truck,and the truck driver.the circumstance that one of the prospective defendants happens to have an insurance policy is a fortuitous event which should not of itself shape the nature of the ensuing litigation and an insurance company whose maximum interest in the case can not exceed and who in fact asserts that it has no interest at all,should not be allowed to determine that dozens of tort plaintiffs must be compelled to press their claims even those claims which are not against the insured and which in no event could be satisfied out of the meager insurance fund in a single forum of the insurance company choosing.
id.at.the court recognized that its view of interpleader means that it can not be used to solve all the vexing problems of multiparty litigation arising out of a mass tort.but interpleader was never intended to perform such a function,to be an bill of peace.id.at.
from this discussion,we distill certain fundamental principles the stake marks the outer limits of the stakeholder potential liability where the respective claimants entitlement to the stake is the sole contested issue however,where the stakeholder may be independently liable to one or more claimants,interpleader does not shield the stakeholder from tort liability,nor from liability in excess of the stake.see also new york life ins.lee,cir stating,in the context of statutory interpleader,w e think that congress in the enactment of the interpleader statute did not intend thus to wipe out the substantial claims of persons asserting rights against insurance companies.the purpose of the interpleader statute was to give the stakeholder protection,but in nowise to change the rights of the claimants by its operation we think congress had no intention to permit destruction of acquired rights under state law,if indeed it had power so to do.quoting sanders armour fertilizer works.
the district court recognized these principles,and applied them in its initial summary judgment ruling when it found that counterclaimants negligence claim survived the interpleader action.the district court nonetheless granted west coast rule c motion because it concluded that attorney fees are not recoverable in interpleader actions absent a showing of bad faith,and that counterclaimants attempt to recover the amount disbursed to the plaintiffs in settlement as damages would require relitigation of entitlement to the insurance benefits.this reasoning was in error.
it is generally recognized that interpleader developed in equity and is governed by equitable principles.aetna life ins.bayona,cir quoting lummis white,cir,rev on other grounds by cory white,d metro.life ins.marsh,cir i nterpleader is fundamentally equitable in nature.accordingly,many courts have held that those who have acted in bad faith to create a controversy over the stake may not claim the protection of interpleader.see,kent cal.reg l office of am.friends serv,cir interpleader,which is an equitable remedy,is not available to one who has voluntarily accepted funds knowing they are subject to competing claims.citations omitted farmers irrigating ditch reservoir kane,cir it is the general rule that a party seeking interpleader must be free from blame in causing the controversy,and where he stands as a wrongdoer with respect to the subject matter of the suit or any of the claimants,he can not have relief by interpleader.collecting cases see also d interpleader the equitable doctrine of clean hands applies to interpleader actions.the party seeking interpleader must do equity,not have caused the conflicting claims,and be free from blame in causing the controversy.footnotes omitted 
here,however,counterclaimants have not alleged that west coast acted in bad faith,nor do they contend that the interpleader remedy was,or should have been,unavailable.rather,they allege that west coast negligent actions in caused the instant controversy,and claim damages flowing from that negligence.as the supreme court discussion in tashire makes clear,interpleader was not intended to extinguish independent tort claims,nor intended to relieve the stakeholder from liability in excess of the stake.the district court conclusion that counterclaimants were required to show that west coast acted in bad faith in order
