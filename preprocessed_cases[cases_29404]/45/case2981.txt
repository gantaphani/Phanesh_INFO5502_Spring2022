alpha therapeutic corporation appeals the grant of summary judgment against it on claims to establish coverage for defense and indemnity obligations under successive excess general liability policies issued over a period.coverage was denied and summary judgment granted based on the trial court application of the principle,as enunciated in fmc plaisted companies th,d fmc,limiting recovery to a single year total policy limits,as well as application of the concept of qualified time on the risk,which resulted in the single year total limit being allocated over the seven years of coverage.
we conclude the rule was misapplied and the undisputed facts were insufficient to establish that the excess carriers could have no obligation to indemnify alpha.the judgments will be reversed,and the matter remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
alpha therapeutic corporation was in the business of processing and distributing blood factor concentrates,a substance separated from human plasma which provides reliable and measurable doses of clotting factors used in the treatment of hemophiliacs.alpha,along with other processors of the factor concentrates,was sued by thousands of hemophiliacs who had used the factor concentrates between and and claimed hiv infection from their use during that period 
the physiological phenomenon of hiv infection is that within a short period after infection,the body develops antibodies to the virus.the assault on the immune system is immediate.the victim suffers from a sudden and serious decline in the number of white blood cells.there is no latency period hiv infection has a constant and detrimental effect on the infected person hemic and lymphatic systems from the moment of infection.bragdon abbott,d.the disease process follows a predictable and,as of today,an unalterable course.id.at.
hemophiliacs became infected with hiv from the use of factor concentrates as early as,but there was no licensed test for the presence of antibodies before march.since it has been possible to diagnose hiv infection after seroconversion,the point at which antibodies reach a detectable level.still,there is no test for the actual date of infection and it has not been feasible to determine an individual claimant actual date of infection because generally no blood samples were retained which might provide evidence of that date and symptoms of infection are not always distinct from those of other illnesses,such as the flu.furthermore,an infected person may test negative for the presence of hiv antibodies for a period of time after infection.alpha contends,however,that epidemiological studies have been conducted which provide information concerning the approximate number of hiv seroconversions among the hemophiliac community at any given time between and 
the policies 
facing liability for thousands of claims,alpha sued its insurers to establish their respective defense and indemnity obligations under successive primary and excess general liability polices issued to alpha for the years to,sometimes referred to as policy years through.the respondents in these consolidated appeals are excess insurers that collectively provided over half of alpha total per occurrence limits.in general these excess insurers provided coverage for sums alpha became obligated to pay because of bodily injury during the policy period,caused by an occurrence,to the extent those sums exceeded the limits of the underlying primary and any excess liability coverage.
the parties stipulations 
alpha suit originally involved additional insurers and issues.after some parties were dismissed the remaining parties entered into a number of stipulations to facilitate a trial limited to the issue of the proper allocation of the excess insurers indemnity obligations.
it was stipulated that all of the policies were triggered,that is,potentially responsible to indemnify the insured,under the continuous injury coverage trigger theory adopted in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,montrose.
the parties further stipulated that alpha processing,marketing,and sale of factor concentrates allegedly contaminated with hiv constituted a single occurrence within the meaning of the policies,that the occurrence continued in each of the seven policy years and caused bodily injury during each of the policy years,and that each bodily injury continued from infection to the death of the individual or to the present.
the parties stipulated to the amount that alpha had already paid or agreed to pay for settlements or judgments of claims.the full amount of alpha liability to the bodily injury claimants could not at that time be determined because alpha faced liability as a defendant in a number of separate lawsuits and for additional contributions to a class action settlement 
the parties stipulated to the amount alpha had received in payments from its insurers.some insurers had agreed to make certain additional sums available as for claims.alpha primary insurance and retained limit had been exhausted.some excess insurers had paid their full policy limits,but others had settled for less than their limits or had become insolvent for purposes of the court allocation determination,alpha assumed responsibility for the difference,agreeing that the respondent excess insurers would not be liable for indemnifying alpha against liabilities which do not exceed the inception points of the policies issued by those carriers when those liabilities are properly allocated.
the summary judgment motion 
instead of a trial on the issue of allocation based on the stipulations,the excess insurers moved for summary judgment.they argued that although alpha had purchased seven consecutive years of primary and excess liability coverage with annual per occurrence limits,alpha could not recover up to the total per occurrence limits for all policy years because all the bodily injuries resulted from a single occurrence.the insurers contended that an rule adopted in fmc,supra,th,d precluded indemnification under successive policies for damages caused by a single occurrence.they argued that the highest total per occurrence limits available for any single policy year million was the most alpha could recover for damages for bodily injuries resulting from a single occurrence.the excess carriers argued they had no indemnification obligation because alpha should be deemed to have already received more than that amount by virtue of its settlements with other insurers.
the second prong of the excess insurers argument was that alpha million maximum recovery under the rule must then be allocated among all seven triggered policy years.all but one of the excess insurers argued that a qualified time on the risk allocation method was mandated under stonewall ins.city of palos verdes estates th,d stonewall,under which alpha maximum liability insurance recovery allocated to any given policy year was insufficient to reach their excess layers.
the trial court agreed with the excess carriers argument.it found that the rule limited alpha to indemnity in an amount no greater than the highest total per occurrence limits for any single policy year for all bodily injuries caused by the single continuing occurrence.the court found that the excess insurers that had argued for the qualified time on the risk allocation were entitled to summary judgment because after that sum was allocated over the seven years,the liability attributable to the years those excess insurers were on the risk was less than the limits of the underlying insurance.the single excess insurer whose excess layer would have been pierced by qualified time on the risk allocation was later found to be entitled to summary judgment on the ground that alpha had already effectively received more than a single year per occurrence limits from its other insurers.

discussion 
principles of policy interpretation.
insurance policies are contracts and,therefore,are governed in the first instance by the rules of construction applicable to contracts.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs its interpretation.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls judicial interpretation unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage.citations.if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to the language of a contract of insurance is clear and unambiguous,a court will apply that meaning.citations.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.i n the insurance context,we generally resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.citations.similarly,we generally interpret the coverage clauses of insurance policies broadly,in order to protect the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.citations.these rules stem from the fact that the insurer typically drafts policy language,leaving the insured little or no meaningful opportunity or ability to bargain for modifications.citations.because the insurer writes the policy,it is held responsible for ambiguous policy language,which is therefore construed in favor of coverage.citations.id.at,d.
the language of the policies,not abstract concerns about fairness,controls our interpretation beneath the court concern about fairness and justice is,apparently,a belief that,without an approach like the one it adopted,the insured might get a windfall from the insurers.that is not the case.we shall assume for argument sake that the insured has enjoyed great good luck over against the insurers.but the pertinent policies provide what they provide.the insured and the insurers were generally free to contract as they pleased.citation.they evidently did so.they thereby established what was fair and just inter se.we may not rewrite what they themselves wrote.citation.we must certainly resist the temptation to do so here simply in order to adjust for the benefits it has bestowed on one party without merit and for the burdens it has laid on others without desert.citations.as a general matter at least,we do not add to,take away from,or otherwise modify a contract for public policy considerations.citation.we shall therefore allow whatever gains and losses there may be to lie where they have fallen.transport indemnity cal th,d,fns.omitted.
policy provisions pertinent to the stacking issue.
under the policies the excess insurers agreed to indemnify alpha against ultimate net loss in excess of and arising out of the hazards covered and as defined and in excess of the underlying insurance,or to indemnify the insured for the amount of loss which is in excess of the applicable limits of liability of the underlying insurance.ultimate net loss or loss is generally defined as the sums paid in settlement of losses for which the insured is liable after making deductions for all recoveries,salvages and other insurances other than the underlying insurance or policies written to be excess of the excess insurance at issue.a majority of the excess policies either incorporate the insuring agreements of the underlying insurance or purport to follow form to that insurance 
bodily injury and occurrence 
the basic insuring agreement of the underlying primary policies for years through requires payment of all sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,caused by an occurrence.bodily injury is defined as bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period,including death at any time resulting therefrom.occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.italics added.
the year primary policy is slightly different,obligating the primary carrier to pay all sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury,including death at any time resulting therefrom personal injury is defined to include b odily injury,including death resulting therefrom,sustained by a natural person during the policy period.italics added.the year primary policy does not require that personal injury be caused by an occurrence,although for purposes of other types of covered liability the policy defines occurrence as an event,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in personal injury 
for year,the excess policy contains an agreement to pay all sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury caused by an occurrence the year policy defines personal injury to include bodily injury which occurs during the term of this policy including death at any time resulting therefrom occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results during the term of this policy in personal injury 
the policies consistently distinguish between the occurrence cause and the injury the effect and provide indemnification for damages,not from the occurrence but from the injury.and the parties have stipulated that the continuous injury trigger theory of montrose,supra,is applicable to this case.under montrose,successive general liability policies such as these are triggered by injury or damage during the policy period,not by an occurrence in the abstract that may or may not result in such injury or damage 
limits of liability provisions.
the primary policies contain limits of liability provisions detailing the application of the policies per occurrence limits.the year primary policies provide that regardless of the number of persons injured or claims brought,the per occurrence limit of each policy is the total limit of the company liability for all damages because of bodily injury sustained by one or more persons as the result of any one occurrence.in addition the policies provide,for the purpose of determining the limit of the company liability,all bodily injury arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.italics added.
the year primary policy does not contain a limits of liability provision deeming all injury arising from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially similar conditions to arise out of a single occurrence.the year policy limits of liability provision states for the purpose of determining the limit of the company liability,all personal injury arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general condition existing at or emanating from one location or source shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.italics added.
the limits of liability provisions make clear that if a single occurrence for example,an automobile accident or an explosion results in multiple bodily injuries during the policy period,the applicable policy limits are a single per occurrence limit.for purposes of determining whether multiple per occurrence limits might be at stake in other situations where there are multiple bodily injuries during the policy period,the policies make clear that all injuries arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions will be deemed to have arisen out of a single occurrence.under each policy,the per occurrence limit is the maximum amount the insurer will pay for damages covered by that policy arising out of a single occurrence.
principles do not justify summary judgment in favor of the excess carriers.
there is no dispute that alpha faces liability falling within the scope of coverage of each of the policies.these policies expressly limit the insurers obligation to pay no more than the per occurrence limit for covered damages arising from a single occurrence.it would appear that this is exactly what alpha seeks to be allowed to recover up to each policy per occurrence limits,depending on the evidence concerning the magnitude of alpha eventual liability and the timing of the injuries for which it is obligated to pay.
the excess carriers claim that regardless of the ultimate magnitude of alpha liability and the timing of the injuries on which that liability is based,because fmc rule prohibits recovery of more than a single year per occurrence limits for all injuries arising out of a single occurrence,alpha can never recover the full per occurrence limits of each policy.we disagree.
because insurance coverage depends on the particular terms of the policies at issue,indiscriminate application of rules and shorthand labels such as stacking are not always helpful.the policies in this case do not define stacking or even use the term.review of authorities from this and other jurisdictions indicates that the term stacking has different connotations.our supreme court has stated stacking is sometimes defined to mean the recovery by a claimant several times over for his injuries.citation.it has also been held to refer to the ability of the insured,when covered by more than one insurance policy,to obtain benefits from a second policy on the same claim when recovery from the first policy would alone be inadequate to compensate for the actual damages suffered.citation.wagner state farm mutual auto.ins.cal d,fn,italics added.
neither of these types of stacking is necessarily implicated here.alpha seeks only full indemnification.it does not seek to recover more from the insurers than it will eventually be found to owe to the bodily injury claimants.in moving for summary judgment,the insurers have not attempted to demonstrate that alpha is seeking to recover multiple policy limits on the same claim.alpha faced thousands of individual claims of bodily injury.the insurers have not shown that any single bodily injury claim exceeds the available per occurrence limits of any single policy year.
the rule of fmc has no application here 
the insurers argue that the trial court was correct in applying the rule enunciated in fmc.they argue the court correctly determined that where all the injuries for which the insured is liable arise out of a single occurrence,alpha can not look to the limits of successive polices but is limited to a single year insurance benefits for all losses caused by that single occurrence.we disagree.
it is clear that fmc did not purport to adopt an rule of broad general application.the outcome in fmc is based on the unique language of the fmc policies and the factual circumstances.the insurers in fmc,referred to as the london insurers,provided comprehensive or general liability umbrella and excess coverage to fmc corporation,a manufacturer of equipment and chemical compounds.the insured sought coverage for damages resulting from toxic contamination to soil,surface water and groundwater at numerous separate sites.fmc,supra,th at,d.
at issue in the case were policies for the seven years between and.the fmc policies obligated the london insurers to indemnify the insured for all sums it was obligated to pay as liability for damages on account of property damage caused by or arising out of each occurrence.fmc,supra,th at,d.
there was no dispute in fmc that montrose continuous injury trigger,under which property damage which is continuous or progressively deteriorating throughout successive policy periods would be covered by all policies in effect during those periods,was applicable to the gradual release of contaminants at the sites.fmc,supra,th at,d.the court noted that for each policy triggered under montrose the insurer obligation to the policyholder is to cover the policyholder liability in full up to the policy limits.it is irrelevant that only part of the injury or damage developed during any single policy period or during a period in which the manufacturer had no insurance.the logical consequence of this ruling is that the policyholder is covered up to the policy limits for the full extent of its liability citations.citation.id.at,d,quoting from armstrong world industries,supra,th at,d.
as a result,the fmc court perceived that a stacking issue was presented by the combination of the montrose continuous injury trigger and the all sums language of the policies as interpreted in armstrong world industries.the court noted,for example,that the successive london excess policies provided limits of million for each occurrence,and there was only one occurrence,based on a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,at any particular site.but by application of the continuous injury trigger identified and approved in montrose,that single occurrence could be deemed depending on the facts to have triggered coverage in more than one,or all,of the policy periods.by application of the stacking concept,at any particular site fmc might have aggregated up to million in liability coverage over and above underlying coverages,for a single occurrence,under london policies which specified a million limit.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
concluding that such a result would afford more coverage than the insured had bargained or paid for,the fmc court discussed the anti stacking concepts set forth in keene ins.of north america and discussed in armstrong world industries,supra,th,d.both armstrong and keene involved coverage issues resulting from asbestos related injuries,which by their nature are cumulative and progressive.as to any particular claim keene had determined that only one policy limits can apply to each injury and the insured may select the policy under which it is to be indemnified.keene at.armstrong world industries noted that in the case before it the trial court had ruled,consistent with keene,that only one policy limits can apply to each claim,and the policyholder may select the policy under which it is to be indemnified,citation.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the fmc court recognized that both armstrong and keene had interpreted stacking as an attempt to recover under multiple policies for a single injury or claim of injury.the california supreme court had described stacking in a similar manner in wagner,supra,cal d at page.but the fmc court description of stacking and was quite different,quoting from a treatise that employed a different definition and discussed a coverage trigger not adopted in montrose stacking policy limits means that when more than one policy is triggered by an occurrence,each policy can be called upon to respond to the claim up to the full limits of the policy.under the concept of stacking the limits of every policy triggered by an occurrence are added together to determine the amount of coverage available for the particular claim.thus,for example,if an insured could establish that each of four consecutive million policies were triggered by a particular claim,the insured could recover million for a single occurrence,rather than the million available under any single policy.ostrager newman,insurance coverage disputes ed.trigger and scope of coverage,c.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
looking at stacking from that angle,the fmc court stated this kind of stacking of the limits of an insurer policies for consecutive policy periods has been criticized as affording the insured substantially more coverage,for liability attributable to any particular single occurrence,than the insured bargained or paid for,ins.north america insulations cir,fn.a variant of stacking amounts to giving the insured much more insurance than it paid for uniroyal,home ins,stacking in this manner makes the aggregate limits and the separately negotiated premiums for each policy illusory by expanding coverage to the sum of both policies.insurers sometimes include provisions in their policies to avoid just this kind of result.where,as in this action,there is no provision,there is precedent,characteristically in asbestos cases,for judicial intervention.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
these introductory comments by the fmc court form the basis of the excess insurers argument in this case.but neither the facts nor the policy provisions at issue in fmc,nor the cases or treatise on which the fmc court relied,support the argument here.
in fmc it is clear that in the absence of an express provision,perceived unfairness in holding a single insurer responsible for multiple per occurrence limits in successive policies was a basis for judicial intervention.such considerations are not present here,where multiple insurers agreed to indemnify alpha for all sums it became legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury occurring during the policy period,caused by an occurrence.each insurer agreed that its per occurrence limits would apply to all damages because of bodily injury during the policy period caused by a single occurrence.no insurer stated in its policy that,in the event that a single occurrence caused injuries in more than one policy year,the insurer would only be liable for a share of the highest per occurrence limits the insured purchased perhaps from other insurers in a different policy year for any single policy year.
fmc discussion of the nature of stacking must also be assessed in light of the unique definition of occurrence in the fmc policies,which is different from that in the policies before us.there,occurrence was defined as an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally results in property damage during the policy period.all such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises location shall be deemed one occurrence.th at,d.the court recognized the general rule that,for the purpose of determining the number of occurrences under a liability insurance policy usually as a means of calculating policy limits occurrence has generally been held to mean the underlying cause of the injury,rather than the injury or claim itself citation.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.but the court recognized that this case law rule was modified by the fmc policies unique definition of occurrence.id.at,d.the fmc policies were thus susceptible to an interpretation that equated the injury with the occurrence that caused the injury.the fmc court therefore found that there was one occurrence at any particular site.
in concluding that judicial intervention was warranted to prevent the insured from recovering up to million at each site,rather than the million per occurrence limits under the policies,the fmc court relied on a number of precedents ins.north america insulations,supra,insulations,keene ins.of north america,supra,keene,and uniroyal,home ins,supra.uniroyal.these do not support intervention here.
insulations an injury case sought to avoid a unique stacking problem appellants are correct that the exposure theory a coverage trigger different than montrose continuous injury trigger we adopt has problems with stacking.from through,held twelve different insurance policies issued by five different companies.eleven of these policies had aggregate limits of from to per occurrence.the twelfth policy had an aggregate limit of.the combined aggregate limits of the twelve policies is million.the problem is that if the inhalation of each asbestos fiber is deemed to be a separate bodily injury,this results in the stacking of liability coverage to produce coverage that is many times the combined aggregate limits of million.this amounts to giving much more insurance than it paid for.insulations,supra,at,fn.
the court found the solution to the perceived problem to be that no insurer should be held liable in any one case to indemnify the insured for judgment liability for more than the highest single yearly limit in a policy that existed during the period of the claimant exposure for which judgment was obtained the initial exposure to asbestos fibers in any given year triggers coverage.however,under the terms of the policies,additional exposure to asbestos fibers is treated as arising out of the same occurrence.thus,on its face,the liability of each insurer is limited to maximum amount per occurrence provided by each policy.we have no problem with the district court extending the policy language so that each insurer would face no more liability per claim than the maximum limit it wrote during any applicable year of coverage.insulations,supra,at,fn.
insulations limited each insurer liability per claim,despite numerous potentially injurious exposures that resulted in that claim.it did not purport to limit an insured to a single year coverage for all claims on the ground that they were caused by a single occurrence,as the trial court did in this case.we agree with insulations that an insured should not get more insurance than it paid for.but making sure that an insured gets no more than it paid for is merely the logical result of applying the terms of the policy so that the gains and losses fall where they may,as the supreme court concluded in aerojet,supra.
keene was also an asbestos injury case upon which fmc relied.the court noted,keene dealt similarly with the stacking issue the insured claims that it is entitled to full indemnity for each injury up to the sum of the limits provided by the applicable policies.we do not agree.the principle of indemnity implicit in the policies requires that successive policies cover single injuries.that principle,however,does not require that the insured be entitled to stack applicable policies limits of liability.to the extent possible,we have tried to construe the policies in such a way that the insurers contractual obligations for diseases are the same as their obligations for other injuries.keene is entitled to nothing more.therefore,we hold that only one policy limits can apply to each injury.keene may select the policy under which it is to be indemnified.citation.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
although the fmc court concluded keene statement of such a rule is appropriate in the circumstances of this case for reasons well articulated in keene and cognate cases th at,d,italics added,the keene rule does not support summary judgment here.keene held that only one policy limits can apply to each injury.in other words,for any individual claimant continuing injury,a single policy limit sets the maximum recovery.adhering to keene in this case would not limit alpha to recovery of one year total coverage for thousands of injuries taking place over different times simply because they were all caused by a single occurrence,as the trial court here held.
in uniroyal,the insured faced liability for bodily injuries stemming from the manufacture,delivery and spraying of agent orange,and sought indemnification under two successive policies.applying new york law and its injury in fact coverage trigger distinct from montrose continuous injury trigger,the uniroyal court found that covered injuries took place in each policy period,and that all the injuries were caused by a single occurrence.nevertheless,the court did not confine recovery to a single year policy limits for all the injuries taking place during either policy period.
instead,the uniroyal court sought to devise an appropriate method to allocate losses from injuries from one continuous occurrence spanning two successive policy periods,with resulting injuries triggering both policies.uniroyal,supra.at.the uniroyal court rejected stacking as a method for allocating the losses,but nevertheless allowed the insured to recover under both policies 
stacking would permit the insured to add the two policies aggregate limits and deductibles together and apply that total to the net loss suffered by the insured.here,for each occurrence,the first policy triggered covers up to million with a deductible,and the second covers up to million with a deductible.stacked together the policies would cover million per occurrence with a deductible per occurrence.this method improperly divorces the coverage from the injuries triggering the coverage it simply lumps all the injuries into one large pool.in addition,it fails to distinguish what portion of the million would come from each policy if each were written by a different insurer.finally,even with the same insurer on both policies,stacking in this manner makes the aggregate limits and the separately negotiated premiums for each policy illusory by expanding coverage to the sum of both policies.in the usual case,where injuries are clearly assignable to one policy or the other,the insured might fall below its aggregate cap in one policy but exceed it in the other.in that event the insured would receive full indemnity in the first period and part in the second.by stacking,the insured could circumvent the maxima to demand full indemnity for all its losses.uniroyal,supra.at,italics added.
although both policies in uniroyal were issued by a single insurer and all injuries were caused by a single continuing occurrence,the uniroyal court determined that the insured was entitled to indemnity under each policy,without limiting the amount of indemnity to the limits of a single policy 
for each injury,a policy is triggered.each time a policy is triggered,the court must look to all the injuries triggering that policy and determine the number of occurrences from which those injuries result.here under each policy there will be one continuous occurrence.the court must then calculate the losses attributable to those injuries triggering each policy,and apply the per occurrence deductible and maximum once to each occurrence under each policy.this is exactly the method the court would apply if there were multiple occurrences.citation.no hardship should be imposed by this method on the insurer,since the insurer contracted for the per occurrence limits under each policy,with the understanding that a large continuous occurrence might cause many injuries under each of several policies.uniroyal,supra.at,italics added.
uniroyal does not support the trial court here,where under the same basic circumstances,alpha recovery was limited to a single policy year.
nor does the insurance treatise on which the fmc court relied to describe the concept of stacking support summary judgment here.notwithstanding the treatise general description of stacking as combining the limits of successive policies triggered by an occurrence,none of the opinions discussed expresses a rule against recovery of multiple policy limits where,a single continuing occurrence potentially causes distinct injuries or damages in different policy periods.ostrager newman,insurance coverage disputes,supra,c.
finally,the actual result in fmc does not support the trial court application of principles here.the fmc court announced that application of the keene rule was appropriate under the circumstances,but did not explain the method of application because in the case before us coverage is ultimately keyed to and limited by the concept of occurrence,and because the london defendants provided multiple layers of coverage,with varying effective dates,in each policy period,application of keene rule in this case is relatively complex.for clarity we shall modify the judgment herein to substitute for the trial court references to the qualifications of armstrong and keene a provision that only the policy limits of london umbrella and excess policies in effect as of july in one of the policy periods in which coverage is triggered for a single occurrence can apply to property damage attributable to that occurrence,but that if coverage for that occurrence is triggered in more than one policy period fmc may select the policy period in which the policy limits are to be fixed.fmc,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the fmc court did not discuss the impact of its decision on the upper level excess coverages,and left the reader uncertain as to the significance of the july date which was not explained.the court had already recognized that,under montrose,coverage was not triggered by an occurrence,but instead by property damage during the policy period.yet in summarizing its ruling the fmc court referred to coverage triggered for a single occurrence,and coverage for an occurrence.th at,d.out of context,fmc use of the term occurrence as a coverage trigger and as an element of damage or injury subject to keene rule would seem to conflict with its reliance on montrose and the authorities.
we conclude fmc reference to selecting a single policy period to fix the limits applicable to a particular occurrence must be taken together with the unique definition of occurrence in the fmc policies and the court earlier observations that there was at least one occurrence for each of the contaminated sites.for each such site occurrence,the insured was entitled to select a policy year in which the total limits of insurance would be fixed.in this light,the outcome of the application of the rule in fmc is essentially the same as that in the authorities on which it relied,one policy limit,not one policy limit as these excess carriers argue neither fmc nor the authorities on which it relied indicate that it is impermissible stacking to allow an insured to recover up to the per occurrence limits of a number of successive policies for multiple continuing bodily injuries commencing and continuing over different periods of time,merely because all such injuries were caused by a single continuing occurrence.
application of policy terms in this case.
the expressed concern of fmc and the cases on which it relied was that an insured might recover more insurance than it bargained for or render separately negotiated policy limits or premiums illusory.we therefore examine the actual terms of the policies in light of the facts before us.doing so will,by definition,ensure that alpha does not get more coverage than it bargained or paid for.
in each excess policy in this case the insurer basic agreement was to indemnify alpha for all sums it became liable to pay as damages because of bodily injury taking place during the policy period,so long as alpha liability for damages because of bodily injury during the policy period exceeded the applicable limits of the underlying insurance.the limits of liability provisions on which the insurers seek to rely do not alter that basic agreement,they merely define its monetary extent.the limits of liability provisions set per occurrence and aggregate caps on alpha recovery under a particular policy for covered damages because of bodily injury during the policy period,based on the number of occurrences that caused those injuries.
each insurer has an independent contractual obligation to the insured.each policy provides that for all bodily injuries during the policy period caused by a single occurrence,the applicable limit of the insurer liability under that policy for damages because of bodily injury during the policy period is a single per occurrence limit.the policies do not provide that if a single continuing occurrence also causes bodily injuries in other policy periods injuries which in this case may involve not only continuing injuries but also new infections of individual claimants during policy periods covered by different insurers the insurer will be liable for no more than a share of the highest per occurrence limits an insured purchased for any given policy year.
in summary,the significance of the parties stipulation that all bodily injuries were caused by a single occurrence is that,assuming proof of damages of such injuries during a given policy period,recovery under each policy is limited to a single per occurrence limit 
stacking,in the sense criticized by the above authorities as an impermissible attempt to recover more than the insured bargained for,or to recover under more than one policy for a single injury where the limits of a single policy would be insufficient,was not established by the excess carriers in moving for summary judgment.although the parties agreed alpha faced liability for multiple continuous and progressive bodily injuries,and that a single occurrence caused bodily injuries in all seven policy years,there is no indication that all the injuries taking place in any given policy year were identical or that they were continuations of injuries taking place in any other policy year.the record is also devoid of any indication that alpha seeks to stack the limits of
