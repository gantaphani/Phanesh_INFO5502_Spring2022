andrew hagerty hagerty brought a qui tam action against appellee cyberonics,cyberonics alleging,among other things,that cyberonics violated the false claims act fca,et,and related state statutes.specifically,hagerty alleged that cyberonics promoted medically unnecessary replacements of batteries in nerve stimulator devices used to treat epilepsy patients,which in turn resulted in patients and medical providers filing false claims for reimbursement from government health care programs.
the district court dismissed all but two of hagerty claims under federal rule of civil procedure b,including the fca allegations,holding that hagerty first amended complaint was not pled with the particularity required by federal rule of civil procedure b following this dismissal,the district court also denied hagerty request for leave to file a second amended complaint on the basis of undue delay.hagerty now challenges the district court ruling on both fronts,maintaining that his first amended complaint satisfies rule b and asserting that the district court abused its discretion when denying his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
we recite the relevant facts as they appear in hagerty first amended complaint.see hochendoner genzyme,cir.the vagus nerve stimulator vns is a medical device that is implanted in patients with refractory epilepsy,a severe form of the disease in which a patient seizures seriously interfere with their quality of life and do not respond to other medications or treatment.the vns works by delivering short electrical pulses to the vagus nerve through a wire.each vns system contains a battery,and the entire vns system must be surgically replaced when the battery nears the end of its life.
patients with refractory epilepsy often qualify for coverage under government healthcare programs like medicare and medicaid.some treatments for refractory epilepsy,including placement of the vns,are reimbursed by those programs.these programs impose certain requirements on healthcare providers,such as signing a provider agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.in these agreements,providers certify,among other things,that their claims for reimbursement relate to a reasonable and medically necessary treatment.a a.
on february,hagerty filed a qui tam complaint under seal against cyberonics,alleging that it engaged in a fraudulent scheme to encourage doctors and patients to prematurely and unnecessarily replace batteries in vns systems.hagerty,having gained knowledge of the scheme firsthand as a former sales representative of cyberonics,further alleged that this scheme caused significant monetary damages to government healthcare programs by inducing patients and medical providers to file false claims for reimbursement in violation of a.on october,the government filed a notice declining to intervene in the case,and on december,the complaint was unsealed and served on cyberonics.cyberonics then moved to dismiss the complaint on april,on several grounds,including under rule b for failure to state a claim and rule b for failure to allege instances of fraud with particularity.
hagerty amended his pleadings and filed his first amended complaint on may.the first amended complaint alleged that in,the fda approved the vns as a treatment for depression,and,anticipating that much of its future growth would come from this market,cyberonics hired new salespersons.cyberonics then allegedly began lobbying cms to approve medicare reimbursement for vns therapy in depressive patients,which cms ultimately declined to grant.facing a dire financial situation,cyberonics reportedly decided to refocus its sales efforts on epilepsy patients,with a particular interest in to already existing vns patients.
the first amended complaint emphasized that this new sales plan was driven by a carrot and stick approach,where sales representatives were rewarded for meeting aggressive sales quotas,were placed in a performance improvement program if they did not achieve of their revenue goals in a given quarter,and were terminated the following quarter if their performance did not improve.hagerty alleged that,under such conditions,cyberonics sales representatives resorted to fraudulent sales tactics,such as refusing to provide doctors and patients with accurate vns battery life calculations and encouraging doctors and patients to replace these batteries prematurely 
the first amended complaint further alleged that approximately of cyberonics revenue came from medicare and medicaid,with additional revenues coming from tricare,the department of defense,the department of veterans affairs,and the federal employee health benefits program.hagerty went on to list sixteen hospitals which he claimed had performed and billed for vns therapy implants in epileptic patients,and specifically named the southbury training school,monson development center,and wrentham development center as care facilities in which vulnerable patients were subjected to unnecessary surgeries to implant replacement devices.the first amended complaint further identified a pena,who had three patients undergo battery replacement procedures between september,and november.it also identified a thompson,who allegedly told hagerty that a cyberonics sales representative falsely told physicians to replace vns batteries prematurely.moreover,the first amended complaint alleged that hagerty reviewed an internal patient list and saw that several of thompson patients had received vns device replacements in.
by way of conclusion,the first amended complaint projected that at least medically unnecessary vns device replacements had occurred at these hospitals and centers since.coupled with an estimated cost of per procedure and an assumption that government healthcare programs covered approximately of these procedures,hagerty reasoned that government healthcare programs lost at least million as a result of cyberonics scheme.
cyberonics again moved to dismiss the case.on march,the district court granted the motion,finding that hagerty had not pled his allegations with the requisite particularity required by rule b.on august,hagerty moved for leave to file a second amended complaint.three months later,the district court denied hagerty motion on the basis of undue delay this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
hagerty insists that his first amended complaint satisfied rule b particularity requirement and,regardless of the district court view on that matter,that he should have been given leave to file a second amended complaint.we review the granting of a motion to dismiss de novo,united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir,and the denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion,united states ex rel.kelly novartis pharms,cir.citing united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir.
a.the fca and rule b 
the fca penalizes those who present,or cause to be presented,false or fraudulent claim s for payment or approval to the federal government.a.thus,fraud under the fca has two components the defendant must submit or cause the submission of a claim for payment to the government,and the claim for payment must itself be false or fraudulent.united states ex rel.ge takeda pharm,cir.because fca liability attaches only to false claims,merely alleging facts related to a defendant alleged misconduct is not enough.rather,a complaint based on the fca must sufficiently establish that false claims were submitted for government payment as a result of the defendant alleged misconduct.internal citations omitted.
federal rule of civil procedure b,meanwhile,requires that a complaint state these components with particularity,meaning relators like hagerty must allege the who,what,when,where,and how of the alleged fraud.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.still,we have repeatedly emphasized that there is no checklist of mandatory requirements that each allegation in a complaint must meet to satisfy rule b,united states ex rel.karvelas,cir,abrogated on other grounds by gagne,at,and that a somewhat more flexible standard applies in qui tam actions where the defendant is all
