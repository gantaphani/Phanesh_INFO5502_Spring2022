plaintiffs jose and maria arocho appeal from a judgment in favor of defendant california fair plan insurance company fair plan.the arochos contend the superior court misinterpreted code of civil procedure section,the northridge earthquake revival statute,which only applied to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.the arochos contacted their broker,james stovall of kosmos insurance agency,about earthquake damages shortly after the northridge earthquake occurred.the court concluded stovall was not a representative of the fair plan for the purposes of the revival statute.we reverse.
facts and proceedings below 
on january,two properties owned by the arochos the properties were insured by the fair plan,including earthquake coverage.the arochos purchased the insurance though their broker james stovall.the arochos alleged the northridge earthquake caused extensive damage to the properties.
the arochos first contacted stovall within a few days after the earthquake.stovall advised them that unless the properties were in rubbles,the arochos should effect their own repairs.during the conversation,the arochos asked stovall to have someone come out and inspect the properties.no one ever came out.the arochos again contacted stovall,who again advised the arochos they would need to make their own repairs,which they did as best they could.
pursuant to section,on december,the arochos filed a complaint against the fair plan asserting causes of action for breach of insurance contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the fair plan was served on march.
the fair plan moved for summary judgment on the ground the arochos were not eligible to benefit from section because they had failed to comply with the contact requirement of that statute.the fair plan adduced evidence stovall was the arochos broker and,even though he was a producer for the fair plan,producers were not authorized to act for the fair plan.stovall had not advised the fair plan of the arochos damages,and the arochos,relying on stovall,had not contacted the fair plan directly prior to january.
the fair plan adduced a document entitled producers manual,property insurance division,california fair plan association producers manual,which governed stovall dealings with the fair plan.the court agreed with the fair plan that stovall was not a representative of the fair plan and granted summary judgment in its favor.
the arochos filed a timely notice of appeal from the subsequently entered judgment.
discussion 
on appeal from a summary judgment,we independently examine the facts and determine their effect as a matter of law.it is the duty of an appellate court to make the final determination from the undisputed facts and the applicable principles of law.citation.thus,we interpret the challenged statute de novo as a matter of law.
appellants contend that in order to fulfill the objectives of the legislature in enacting section,stovall must be deemed a representative of the fair plan for purposes of the contact requirement because the fair plan does not utilize agents.appellants further contend that under the principles of statutory construction,the term representative must be interpreted according to its plain meaning,and,if the legislature had intended the insurer representative to be an actual agent,it would have said so.
section,subdivision a provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurer representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.
the primary purpose of the contact requirement would appear to be to prevent the submission of recently manufactured claims.
section is a special statute designed for a specific need perceived by the legislature the history of senate bill is replete with indications of its statutory purpose.the following excerpt from the legislative record is illustrative the author introduced this bill to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake.he states that the statute of limitations contained in insurance code section has unfairly barred victims from being compensated for their losses because many were tragically misled about the extent of damage suffered as a result of the earthquake.news accounts have asserted that many of the quake victims have yet to receive full and fair compensation from their insurance companies to cover the costs incurred as a result of the quake.many victims,the accounts state,have received only partial settlements for their earthquake claims,and others have received no compensation at all,having been improperly told that the damage they suffered was below policy deductibles.in subsequent years,families have discovered damage that either was ignored or missed by the original claims adjuster,yet some insurers,according to these news accounts,have stonewalled claims,leaving homes,condominiums and apartment buildings in shambles and homeowners without any recourse 
in construing a statute we begin with the fundamental rule that a court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.an equally basic rule of statutory construction is,however,that courts are bound to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citations.although a court may properly rely on extrinsic aids,it should first turn to the words of the statute to determine the intent of the legislature.citations.if the words of the statute are clear,the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citations.
however,if the statutory language is unclear or ambiguous,our task is to construe the statute a statute must be interpreted to avoid an absurd result that does not advance the legislative purpose.citation.we are not free to give the words of a statute a definition different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.to ascertain the common meaning of a word,a court typically looks to dictionaries.
as the two terms are defined in the insurance code,it is generally true an insurance agent acts on behalf of an insurer and an insurance broker acts on behalf of an insured an individual can not act as an insurance agent in california without a valid license issued by the commissioner of insurance and a notice of the agent appointment by the insurer filed with the department of insurance but it also is possible for an agent to represent both the insurer and the insured in connection with the same transaction furthermore,t he existence and scope of agency is a question of fact in each case.
the trial court determined there was no triable issue as to whether stovall was the fair plan representative.relying primarily on dictionary definitions of the term representative,the court reasoned a representative is a person authorized to act on another behalf and that stovall was the arochos representative rather than fair plan.thus he was not authorized to act on behalf of fair plan.but the definition the trial court used for a representative is indistinguishable from the definition of an agent.
in effect,the trial court equated the statutory term representative in with the statutory term agent as defined in insurance code section yet the legislature,clearly aware of the latter term and its meaning in the insurance context,studiously avoided using it in when defining the type of person insureds must have contacted before january,in order to qualify for a resurrection of the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit.if it wanted to require an insured
