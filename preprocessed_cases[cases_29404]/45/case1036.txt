total benefits planning agency and four of its insurance agents collectively total benefits appeal a dismissal of their amended complaint for failure to state a claim under b of the federal rules of civil procedure.total benefits maintained contracts with anthem blue cross and blue shield anthem life insurance company,anthem health plans of kentucky,anthem insurance company,collectively anthem and cornerstone broker insurance services agency cornerstone for the sale of group life and health insurance policies in ohio,indiana,and kentucky.total benefits allege anthem conspired to boycott and blacklist total benefits in violation of section of the sherman act.in addition to appealing the dismissal,total benefits also appeal the district court failure to sua sponte permit them to file a second amended complaint before dismissing their case.
the district court,after originally denying the motion to dismiss,dismissed the amended complaint after finding plaintiffs failed to allege a violation of section of the sherman act under either the per se analysis or the test.the court was persuaded in part by two supreme court decisions handed down after the district court original ruling leegin creative leather,psks,d and bell atlantic twombly,d.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the dismissal.
factual background 
total benefits developed an innovative strategy for controlling health care costs utiliz ing a old federal tax law to refinance costs by raising deductibles on existing group insurance policies and administering benefits through a medical expense reimbursement plan.total benefits claim the system is able to save businesses in ohio,indiana,and kentucky,or more on their health insurance costs,without cutting benefits.in september,anthem advised total benefits that the strategy was not in the best interest of anthem or the more traditional insurance agencies,and that anthem would not permit total benefits,or any other anthem agent,to engage in such practices and remain agents of anthem.in june,anthem severed its agency relationship with total benefits because they continued to promote the strategy.
total benefits allege anthem and its various agents conspired to blacklist and organize an industry boycott against total benefits in violation of the sherman act,because total benefits refused to relinquish the strategy.total benefits also allege defamation,libel,tortious interference with contract,conspiracy,and breach of contract under state law.
procedural background 
on august,total benefits filed suit to prevent and restrain continuing violations of the sherman antitrust act.on september,anthem filed a motion to dismiss,arguing dismissal was appropriate because total benefits failed to identify the subject,product and geographic markets that were at issue claimed harm only to themselves as opposed to harm to competition failed to adequately allege a contract,combination or conspiracy in sufficient detail and was barred from challenging the alleged conduct by the act,because total benefits could not demonstrate a boycott.cornerstone moved to dismiss on grounds identical to those set forth by anthem.
on september,the district court denied the motions to dismiss of anthem and cornerstone,finding anthem refusal to contract with total benefits to be a vertical boycott and that the complaint sufficiently alleged anthem unlawfully coerced insurance agents who did business with total benefits.the district court concluded from these allegations that total benefits sufficiently alleged a prima facie case of each element of the per se test for their sherman act claim.
anthem immediately filed a motion to reconsider,advancing the following arguments the district court erred by using per se principles for a vertical boycott and plaintiffs claims must be reviewed under the test,and plaintiffs failed to adequately plead a rule of reason case.cornerstone again joined anthem motion.
on november,total benefits filed an amended complaint,further defining their claims against anthem,cornerstone,and the newly added other defendants,claiming these defendants had conspired with anthem to boycott,coerce,and otherwise blacklist total benefits.
following the amended complaint,anthem again moved to dismiss,asserting total benefits failed to allege sufficient detail in connection with the participants,time,place and effect of the alleged conspiracy facts to support the conclusionary assertions that total benefits are the victims of a price fixing conspiracy and the applicable product and geographic markets,and the impact on competition.the other defendants filed motions to dismiss asserting these same grounds.
on july,following the leegin and twombly decisions,the district court reversed its earlier position and dismissed the recently amended complaint.the district court held 
total benefits failed to sufficiently allege there was a horizontal agreement between defendants and therefore failed to state a claim for a per se violation under the sherman act.
total benefits failed to set forth a prima facie case for a violation because it failed to plead a a set price or price level in order to support a claim of price fixing b plausible grounds to infer an agreement between the parties c an adverse effect on the marketplace and d the existence of market power.
total benefits appeal this decision.

dismissal for failure to state a claim 
plaintiffs allege the district court erred in failing to find the complaint adequately pled a violation of section of the sherman act based on a per se violation or the test.each argument will be addressed separately.
per se violation 
the per se standard recognizes there are some methods of restraint that are so inherently and facially that an elaborate and burdensome inquiry into a demonstrable economic impact on competition in a relevant market is not required.see soc y of prof l eng rs united states,d.when this case was originally filed,there were two possible grounds for the application of a per se antitrust claim a group boycott alleging a horizontal agreement among competitors,and a vertical price fixing conspiracy.see nynex discon,d ezzo,royal beauty supply,cir.however,between the motion for reconsideration and the district court decision,the supreme court decided leegin creative leather,psks,d,in which it overruled the vertical price fixing standard of miles med.john park sons.now,all vertical price restraints are to be judged under the standard.only a group
