le parc community association le parc seeks review of the decision by the workers compensation appeals board board granting tim curren petition for reconsideration,rescinding the workers compensation administrative law judge order dismissing curren workers compensation case against le parc and returning the matter to the hearing level for further proceedings.
the essential issue presented is whether curren dismissal with prejudice of his superior court action for negligence against le parc,pursuant to the terms of a settlement agreement that was not submitted to the board for approval,precludes further prosecution of his claim against le parc in the workers compensation forum.we hold that a civil action for negligence by an injured employee against an illegally uninsured employer pursuant to labor code section as a matter of law,is not based on the same cause of action as an application for compensation filed with the board pursuant to sections and and that principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel do not bar curren pursuit of his workers compensation remedy.accordingly,we affirm the board order.
factual and procedural background 
isaac martinez,doing business as advance property maintenance martinez was retained by le parc to perform roof repairs,tree trimming and other maintenance activities at le parc properties in simi valley.curren,an employee of martinez,was injured by a fall from a roof while cleaning gutters at one of the le parc properties on august.neither martinez nor le parc maintained workers compensation insurance.although it is conceded that martinez was not licensed as a general contractor,the parties dispute whether a contractor license was required for the work performed by martinez for le parc and whether martinez and derivatively curren was an independent contractor or an employee of le parc.
the application for workers compensation benefits 
curren filed an application for workers compensation benefits against martinez and le parc and thereafter joined the uninsured employers fund in the proceeding et le parc was named,pursuant to section on the theory that it was presumed to be curren employer because martinez was required to,but did not,have a contractor license to perform the repair and maintenance services for which he had been retained and was illegally uninsured for workers compensation.see,state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,unlicensed contractor injured during remodel is employee of homeowner under rinaldi workers comp.appeals bd.d.unlicensed subcontractor and subcontractor injured employee are employees of licensed general contractor.le parc has denied it was curren employer.
the personal injury action 
curren also filed through separate counsel a civil lawsuit against martinez and le parc in ventura county superior court pursuant to section,which authorizes an injured employee to file an action at law against an uninsured employer if any employer fails to secure the payment of compensation,any injured employee or his or her dependents may bring an action against such employer for damages,as if this division did not apply.the complaint,filed august,alleged a single cause of action for negligence and personal injury.in the complaint curren alleged that martinez and le parc were presumed negligent under section and,in addition,that martinez and le parc were negligent by virtue of their directions to curren to perform the roof work in an unsafe and dangerous manner,their failure to provide safety equipment and training and their failure to provide safe working conditions.
on july,curren and le parc,as well as le parc general liability insurance carrier,settled the civil action.in return for payment of,curren and his counsel signed a document entitled settlement agreement release of all claims,which released le parc from all claims in any way related to the injuries curren suffered on august.in addition to releasing le parc,curren agreed to indemnify le parc and hold it harmless against any action,claim or demand by curren himself or by any other person for damages or compensation resulting in any way from the august,incident.the indemnity provision specifically stated,t his includes,but is not limited to,any subrogation actions,claims or demands from any employer or workers compensation insurance carrier or agency,including,but not limited to,isaac martinez,wood ranch management,the uninsured employers fund the state compensation insurance fund.
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,curren filed a request for dismissal with prejudice in the ventura county superior court action on july.the dismissal was entered on august.
le parc motion to dismiss the workers compensation case 
on september,le parc moved to dismiss curren workers compensation claim on the ground the settlement agreement resolved all of curren claims against le parc,including the application for workers compensation benefits.in response,curren argued it had not been his intent to release his workers compensation rights and that the motion to dismiss should be denied or a hearing held to determine the true intent of the parties.the workers compensation administrative law judge granted the motion without a hearing and without opinion,ordering the case dismissed without prejudice,with jurisdiction reserved nevertheless with respect to lien claims on file as of the date hereof october.
curren petition for reconsideration and the board decision 
curren filed a petition for reconsideration with the board,arguing that the settlement agreement and release of claims did not bar the continued prosecution of his application for workers compensation because the agreement had not been approved by the board,as required by section in addition,curren contended his due process rights had been violated by the workers compensation administrative law judge issuance of a decision without conducting a hearing regarding the parties intent.
the workers compensation administrative law judge filed a report on the petition for reconsideration,recommending the petition be denied.his report explained that the issue whether le parc was curren employer was an essential element of both the superior court action and the workers compensation claim and asserted that curren voluntary dismissal with prejudice of the civil action constitutes a retraxit and a determination on merits involving principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel,which bar the litigation of those issues in any other proceeding.accordingly,the report concluded that under the holding of a similar case,ghanbar workers comp.appeals bd,curren was barred from proving the fact of employment in the workers compensation proceeding and,therefore,was not entitled to relief as a matter of law.
following the filing of the report from the workers compensation administrative law judge,le parc filed its own answer to the petition for rehearing.le parc now argued,the applicant position that the settlement can not resolve a workers compensation case without the appeals board approving a settlement is irrelevant.it is not the settlement itself which bars the applicant from proceeding against le parc as a claimed employer in the workers compensation matter,it is the voluntary dismissal with prejudice.retraxit means that any and all of the applicant claims against the defendant,le parc,are merged and that that dismissal bars any further action against the defendant.
the board granted curren petition for reconsideration and rescinded the order dismissing the action because it was not persuaded that the dismissal with prejudice in the civil action bars litigation of applicant workers compensation claim.the board noted that the parties in the two proceedings were not the same several of the parties to the workers compensation case were not named in the civil action and found that the issues in the two proceedings were not identical.in particular,the board held that the issue of employment was not an essential element in the civil action because common law negligence had been pleaded as an alternative theory of recovery.in addition,the board stated the issue of employment was not actually litigated and necessarily decided by the dismissal with prejudice.finally,the board noted that the settlement agreement had not be submitted to it for approval,as required by section.the board returned the matter to the trial level for further proceedings.
on le parc petition,we issued a writ of review.
contentions 
le parc contends that the dismissal of curren civil action operates as a retraxit and bars further litigation on the same subject matter between the parties and that curren is collaterally estopped from establishing that le parc was his employer,an essential element of a claim for workers compensation benefits.
discussion 
standard of review 
an appellate court is not bound by the board conclusions on questions of law.dimmig workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,save mart stores workers comp.appeals bd.th,d klee workers comp.appeals bd.d.because the issue in this case is the legal effect of the voluntary dismissal of a civil action filed pursuant to section,we review the question de novo.
the doctrine of retraxit and applicable principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel 
le parc concedes the settlement agreement upon which the dismissal of the civil action was based was not submitted to the board for approval as required by section and at least implicitly acknowledges that,absent board approval,the agreement itself can not validly release or otherwise bar curren claim for workers compensation benefits,regardless of the parties intent.a tort release is effective upon execution,but a workers compensation release is invalid until approved by the workers compensation judge.citations.this inquiry by the appeals board or referee should carry out the legislative objective of protecting workmen who might agree to unfortunate compromises because of economic pressure or lack of competent advice.citation.these safeguards against improvident releases place a workmen compensation release upon a higher plane than a private contractual release it is a judgment,with the same force and effect as an award made after a full hearing.citations.sumner workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,accord,jefferson department of youth authority cal th,d,requirement for board approval protects the interest of employees by ensuring fairness in settlement agreements.
nonetheless,le parc argues curren voluntary dismissal with prejudice of his civil action,independently of the settlement agreement,constitutes a retraxit that bars further litigation of the workers compensation claim.as explained by division one of our court,in the common law,a retraxit was a voluntary renunciation by plaintiff in open court of his suit and cause thereof,and by it plaintiff forever loses his action.citations.in california,the same effect is now accomplished by a dismissal with prejudice.citations.morris blank th,d.
a retraxit has always been deemed a judgment on the merits against the plaintiff,estopping him from subsequently maintaining an action for the cause renounced.citation.citation.a retraxit is equivalent to a judgment on the merits and as such bars further litigation on the same subject matter between the parties.torrey pines bank superior court d.accordingly,the determination whether curren dismissal of his civil action bars subsequent litigation of his workers compensation claim must be analyzed under traditional principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.morris blank,supra,th at,d following voluntary dismissal with prejudice,the question is whether plaintiff superior court action is barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel rice crow th,d a retraxit invokes the principles of res judicata.
res judicata 
under the doctrine of res judicata,a valid,final judgment on the merits precludes parties or their privies from relitigating the same cause of action in a subsequent suit.mycogen monsanto cal th,d,mycogen slater blackwood cal d.res judicata,or claim preclusion,prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit between the same parties or parties in privity with them under the doctrine of res judicata,if a plaintiff prevails in an action,the cause is merged into the judgment and may not be asserted in a subsequent lawsuit a judgment for the defendant serves as a bar to further litigation of the same cause of action.mycogen,at,d,citation and fn.omitted.
california law defines a cause of action for purposes of the res judicata doctrine by analyzing the primary right at stake a cause of action is comprised of a primary right of the plaintiff,a corresponding primary duty of the defendant,and a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.citation.the most salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible the violation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.citation.a pleading that states the violation of one primary right in two causes of action contravenes the rule against splitting a cause of action.citation.crowley katleman cal th,d.i f two actions involve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong by the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even if in the second suit the plaintiff pleads different theories of recovery,seeks different forms of relief adds new facts supporting recovery.citations.tensor group city of glendale th,d.on the other hand,different primary rights may be violated by the same wrongful conduct.branson growers th,d branson.
an important exception to the general rule of indivisibility of a primary right permits a second action on a different legal theory if the plaintiff was precluded from asserting that theory in the first action because of limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the first forum.branson,supra,th at,d roberts redlich d.when any of the following circumstances exists,the general rule of res judicata does not apply to extinguish the claim,and part or all of the claim subsists as a possible basis for a second action by the plaintiff against the defendant c the plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts or restrictions on their authority to entertain multiple theories or demands for multiple remedies or forms of relief in a single action,and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.rest d judgments,subds.a c.
a further exception to general res judicata and collateral estoppel principles applies when the legislature has specified exactly what preclusive effect a judicial determination has on a related administrative proceeding.gikas zolin cal th,d,traditional collateral estoppel principles did not govern where legislature had specified in vehicle code exactly what preclusive effect criminal proceeding had on administrative license suspension for drunk driving see branson,supra,th at,d.if the administrative and civil provisions afford cumulative remedies that can not all be sought in one proceeding,the statutory scheme plainly envisions that both an administrative proceeding and a civil action may be brought and res judicata does not apply.people damon th,d.
collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.mycogen,supra,cal th at,d.the doctrine applies only if the decision in the initial proceeding was final and on the merits and the issue sought to be precluded from relitigation is identical to that decided in the first action and was actually and necessarily litigated in that action.lucido superior court cal d.in addition,the party against whom preclusion is sought must be the same as,or in privity with,the party to the first action.ibid.although a second action between the parties on a different cause of action is not barred by res judicata,nevertheless the first judgment operates as an estoppel or conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.citations.citation.branson,supra,th at,d.
