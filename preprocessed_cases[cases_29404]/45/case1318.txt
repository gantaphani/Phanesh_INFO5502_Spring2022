the county of mchenry,illinois county purchased an insurance policy from the insurance company of the west icw.icw settled a million claim on behalf of the county under the policy,but reserved the right to seek reimbursement from the county if it was determined that the policy did not cover the claim.icw then sought to invoke the policy arbitration clause and resolve the issues of coverage and reimbursement before an arbitrator.in response,the county filed suit,seeking a declaration that icw can not require the county to arbitrate.the district court granted icw motion to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the county appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm the order of the district court.

in august,indeck,indeck sued the county for denying a special use permit to construct and operate an electrical generation facility the indeck claim.indeck sought declaratory and injunctive relief and million in damages.the county instructed its broker,marsh mclennon,to place icw on notice and ask icw to protect the county rights in the indeck suit.icw took the position that,due to an exclusion in the policy,it did not have a duty to defend or indemnify the county for the indeck claim.
between march and october,icw filed two suits in district court,each seeking a declaration that icw had no duty to defend or indemnify.at the time icw filed these suits,it had not made any payment for the indeck claim.although not relevant to this appeal,the county was successful in having both suits dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,under federal rule of civil procedure b.on november,icw paid its million indemnity limit on the indeck claim and obtained a release of all damages claims asserted by indeck against the county.
in august,icw formally demanded arbitration of the coverage issues and appointed an arbitrator.the county rejected icw arbitration demands,but selected and appointed john brechin as an arbitrator,in the event the county was forced to arbitrate.icw maintains that the county never provided contact information for brechin,even after icw requested the information multiple times.icw then appointed a second member not brechin to the arbitration panel and directed the two existing members to appoint a third member.
icw,over the county objections,directed the arbitration to begin,leading to the present suit.the county sued for declaratory judgment in march,arguing that the arbitration agreement in the policy does not apply to the indeck claim or,alternatively,that icw had waived its right to demand arbitration by previously filing suits related to coverage of the indeck claim waiver argument.icw moved to stay pursuant to and to dismiss pursuant to rule b.icw argued that the the district to determine whether the parties disputes are subject to the policy arbitration clause and that all disputes between the parties are subject to arbitration.the county responded to the rule b motion by arguing that the issues icw sought to arbitrate were not covered by the arbitration agreement and that illinois law does not allow an insurer to seek reimbursement from an insured.the county did not include its waiver argument in its response to icw motion to dismiss.
on october,the district court granted icw rule b motion and dismissed the suit.according to the district court,the central issues were whether the question of arbitrability should be made by an arbitrator,and alternately,whether the parties disputes are within the policy arbitration provision.the district court found that the court,not an arbitrator,should determine the issue of arbitrability.next,the district court explained that in the context of the arbitration provision,it is clear that the use of the term under this agreement was meant to cover disputes arising under any part of the insurance policy,including disputes over coverage and reimbursement.finally,the district court refused to consider whether the policy or illinois law allow icw to seek reimbursement,finding that to be a merits issue that must be resolved by the arbitrators.
the county filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure e to amend or alter the judgment.the county it did in its complaint but not in response to icw motion to icw had waived the issue of arbitrability by bringing two suits on the indeck claim.the district court denied the county motion.the district court found that although the county raised the waiver issue in its initial complaint,it should have made the waiver argument in response to icw motion to dismiss,and it was too late to raise the issue in a rule e motion.the county appeals.

when a district court grants a motion to dismiss under rule b,our review is de novo.stachowski town of cicero,cir.
we construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,taking as true all factual allegations and making all possible inferences from those allegations in his or her favor.we shall affirm the dismissal only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.

the county raises two main issues on appeal.first,the county argues that the district court erred by dismissing its complaint without considering its waiver argument,which was included in the county complaint but not its response to icw motion to dismiss.second,the county asserts that even if icw did not waive its right to compel arbitration,the policy arbitration clause does not cover the parties dispute over the indeck claim.
according to the county,dismissal at the pleadings stage was improper because the district court failed to consider its alternative grounds for declaratory relief,its waiver argument.the county maintains that icw waived its right to demand arbitration related to the indeck claim by filing two coverage suits that addressed the same coverage issues icw seeks to application of the condemnation exclusion and icw duties under the policy regarding the indeck claim.the county included the waiver argument in its complaint,but not in its response to icw motion to dismiss.
icw sole argument is that the county forfeited its waiver argument by failing to include the argument in its response to icw motion to dismiss.
the county disagrees.according to the county,the district court erred by failing to consider whether the complaint stated a claim under any possible theory,including the waiver theory,even if that theory was not presented in response to a motion to dismiss.additionally,the county implies,in a footnote of its brief,that the district court also erred by denying the county rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment and refusing to consider the merits of the county waiver argument.the county therefore urges this court to consider the waiver argument,even if we conclude it was not properly raised below.as a last resort,the county asks the court to exercise its discretion to consider new arguments and find that icw has waived its right to demand arbitration of the indeck claim.
although this case presents a close question,we agree with icw that the county has forfeited its waiver argument,and we decline to exercise our discretion to consider that argument now.the county raised two claims in its complaint that it was entitled to a declaration that icw does not have a right to arbitrate coverage or reimbursement issues and that it was entitled to a permanent injunction prohibiting icw from prosecuting any arbitration proceeding against the county.the declaratory judgment request was based on the county arguments that the arbitration clause did not cover the parties dispute and that the county had waived its right to arbitrate.the county discussed the waiver argument in several paragraphs of its complaint however,the argument was not presented as a separate count or supported by any legal analysis or authority.
under these circumstances,we can not say that the district court erred by granting icw motion to dismiss.federal rule of civil procedure a requires that a pleading contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.this rule simply specifies the conditions of the formal adequacy of a pleading.kirksey reynolds tobacco,cir.it does not specify the conditions of its substantive adequacy,that is,its legal merit.id.w hen presented with a motion to dismiss,the party must proffer some legal basis to support his cause of action.stransky cummins engine,cir.although the district court is required to consider whether a plaintiff could prevail under any legal theory or set of facts,sidney arst pipefitters welfare educ.fund,cir,it will not invent legal arguments for litigants,stransky,at,and is not obliged to accept as true legal conclusions or unsupported conclusions of fact,hickey,cir.
the county was on notice that icw sought to dismiss its entire complaint.icw stated in its motion to dismiss 
as the county entire action is predicated upon the erroneous notion that the question of arbitrability is left to the sole discretion of the court,as opposed to the arbitrator,the county can plead no set of facts which would entitle it to relief under the complaint.
the county was aware that icw viewed the issue of who is to decide arbitration as the pivotal issue on its motion to dismiss,and the issue that needed resolution before the district court should consider whether the parties dispute is covered by the arbitration clause.the county should have argued that the district court must decide the question of waiver before considering whether the issue of arbitrability is one for the arbitrator or the court.in this case,the issues of waiver and arbitrability are linked in such a way that the county should not have sat back and waited for the arbitrability issue to be decided on a rule b motion before presenting the waiver argument,and legal support for it,stransky,at,to the district court.see also mcleod arrow marine transport,cir court not obliged to accept as true conclusory statements of law northern.gun outdoor shows,city of bend,cir court not required to assign any weight to unsupported conclusions of law reed city of,cir court not compelled to accept conclusory allegations concerning the legal effect of facts set out in the complaint.the district court did not err by not addressing the waiver argument when considering icw motion to dismiss.
nor did the district court err by refusing to consider the waiver argument when the county included it in a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment.see fed.civ.e.a court may grant a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment if the movant presents newly discovered evidence that was not available at the time of trial or if the movant points to evidence in the record that clearly establishes a manifest error of law or fact.matter of prince,cir.but a rule e motion is not appropriately used to advance arguments or theories that could and should have been made before the district court rendered a judgment.lb credit resolution trust,cir.
under this standard,the district court properly denied the county rule e motion.there is no evidence in the record to establish a manifest error of law or fact.in deciding a motion to dismiss,the district court is required to consider whether it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts entitling it to relief under any legal theory.cleveland rotman,cir.in this case,the district court decided the motion based on a record that contained no legal support or analysis from the county demonstrating how icw actions prior to demanding arbitration waived icw contractual right to arbitrate.under these circumstances,it was not manifest error for the district court to grant icw motion.see kirksey,at our system of justice is adversarial,and our judges are busy people.if they are given plausible reasons for dismissing a complaint,they are not going to do the plaintiff research and try to discover whether there might be something to say against the defendants reasoning.
in another case,lekas briley,cir,we suggested in dicta that where a defendant in its motion to dismiss does not challenge one of plaintiff claims and the district court dismisses the unchallenged claim in error,a rule e motion may be an appropriate vehicle for correcting that error.in lekas,however,the plaintiff had a least made passing reference to the overlooked claim in his response to the motion to dismiss.id.in this case,the county makes no reference to the waiver argument in its response.it is reasonable that the district court did not scour the complaint for the argument,do its own investigation to determine if the argument had any legal merit,and then deny summary judgment on that ground.
the county asserts that even if it did not properly raise the waiver issue below,it should be able to present it on appeal.the county relies on a line of cases,including highsmith chrysler credit,cir,in which we have held that when reviewing rule b motions,we will consider new factual allegations raised for the first time on appeal provided they are consistent with the complaint.id.at see also veazey communications cable of,cir allowing plaintiff to present facts not asserted in opposition to defendant motion to dismiss under rule b.
that exception does not apply here.although we may consider factual allegations raised for the first time on appeal,we ordinarily will not address new issues raised for the first time on appeal.see kyle morton high,cir in reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,we will allow a plaintiff to make additional factual allegations for the first time on appeal,but we will not entertain new issues.internal citation omitted dawson motors,cir gm has filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs brief on the basis of these new facts as well as new arguments allegedly not made in the district court most of the arguments asserted to be new are merely permissible variations on issues that were clearly raised below the one true issue that the plaintiffs appear not to have raised below is the issue of misrepresentation,which we treat as waived.
the county is attempting to assert both facts and issues that were not raised in its response to icw motion to dismiss.the new facts include the two previous suits filed by icw and the length of time icw took to demand arbitration.the new issue is whether icw actions resulted in a waiver of icw legal right to demand arbitration of the indeck claim.neither the facts nor the issue flow naturally out of those raised in the county response to the motion to dismiss,which concerned only interpretation of the insurance contract.
according to the county,we should give special importance to the fact that the county raised the waiver argument in its original complaint,but icw did not address the argument in its motion to dismiss.the county cites stewart rca,cir,in support of this position.stewart,however,is inapposite.in that case,the court held that a plaintiff should have been allowed to amend his complaint,even though a motion to dismiss on the original complaint was pending,because the issue the plaintiff sought to clarify was not one that the defendant addressed in its motion to dismiss,and therefore the plaintiff was not required to raise the issue in its response to the motion to dismiss.id.at.in this case,the county did not attempt to amen
