this is an appeal from the trial court grant of summary judgment to several insurers.the court concluded the insurers had no duty to defend an insured,bechtel petroleum operations,against lawsuits brought by employees of bechtel subcontractors.the lawsuits sought damages for injuries caused by years of exposure to toxic substances at a work site,and included claims bechtel fraudulently concealed the existence,nature or extent of the toxic substances by failing to inform its subcontractors their workers would be exposed to conditions that were unsanitary,hazardous or dangerous to their health.the court found no potential for coverage under the general liability policies at issue,based upon absolute pollution exclusions in the policies,and refused to consider extrinsic evidence submitted to the insurers long after they had rejected bechtel tender of defense.the court also concluded there was no duty to defend based on the additional insured endorsements and employee exclusions in two of the policies.
after bechtel filed notices of appeal and its opening brief,royal insurance company of america filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.royal argues,based on statements by bechtel counsel,that bechtel defense in the underlying lawsuits was paid for by its own insurer and bechtel therefore is not an aggrieved party and has no standing to appeal.
we conclude that 
royal motion to dismiss is without merit.
the insurers had no duty to defend bechtel,because the absolute pollution exclusions in the insurance policies operate to exclude coverage for bodily injuries allegedly caused by toxic substances,which are pollutants within the meaning of the policies.
bechtel submission of extrinsic evidence,purporting to show underlying plaintiffs sought recovery for injuries from causes,does not raise a possibility of coverage under the policies.
bechtel argument that the pollution exclusion does not apply because the work site was not occupied by the named insured,as required under the terms of several of the exclusions,is without merit.
the trial court grant of summary judgment to the insurers is therefore affirmed 
factual and procedural background 
appellant bechtel petroleum operations,was a general contractor engaged in the production,storage and distribution of oil and gas at a square mile site known as the naval petroleum reserve in kern county,california.bechtel hired a number of subcontractors,including bob morton construction company,gilliam sons,and westside oilfield construction,to perform soil moving,drilling,excavation and other work at the reserve.in and,numerous plaintiffs who had worked at the reserve as employees of the subcontractors filed six different lawsuits against bechtel the lawsuits alleged the employees suffered bodily injuries as a result of years of exposure to toxic substances at the reserve.the complaints included allegations that bechtel allowed the discharge of toxic substances into onto the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve,and that chemicals and heavy metals,known to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity,were used,produced and found at the reserve,including hazardous concentrations of lead and arsenic the complaints asserted causes of action for negligence,fraud by concealment,and violation of health and safety code section 
bechtel tendered the complaints to its subcontractors insurance carriers,whose policies named bechtel as an additional insured.the insurers rejected the tender,denying they owed any duty to defend bechtel in the underlying actions,principally due to absolute pollution exclusions in their policies of insurance.
in september,bechtel filed this lawsuit against steadfast insurance company,royal insurance company of america,continental insurance company,and the home insurance company bechtel sought a declaration the insurers had a duty to defend bechtel in the underlying lawsuits and bechtel was entitled to reimbursement of defense costs,and asserted causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
steadfast and continental brought motions for summary judgment,asserting the absolute pollution exclusion clauses in their insurance contracts barred coverage for the underlying claims.royal joined in continental motion the policy exclusions differed in some respects,but generally excluded from coverage any liability for bodily injury arising out of the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants from any premises occupied by the insured.pollutants were generally defined as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant 
bechtel response to the steadfast and continental summary judgment motions argued that a pollution exclusions do not apply to bodily injury claims,and b the underlying lawsuits alleged injuries caused by acts or omissions other than exposure to toxic substances,thus raising a potential for coverage.bechtel also asserted that facts extrinsic to the underlying complaints revealed a possibility of coverage.these extrinsic facts consisted of verified questionnaires from underlying plaintiffs,their responses to bechtel contention interrogatories,an expert declaration,and a declaration from the attorney for the underlying plaintiffs.the extrinsic facts,provided to the insurers a year after this suit was filed or only after the insurers moved for summary judgment,consisted of assertions plaintiffs were injured by toxic exposure and harmful or unsanitary working conditions.bechtel argued these assertions were strong extrinsic evidence the underlying plaintiffs were seeking recovery from bechtel for injuries from causes unrelated to exposure to pollutants,and thus were potentially covered by the insurers policies.
the trial court refused to consider the extrinsic evidence offered by bechtel,concluding the insurers were entitled to make their decisions on potential coverage based on information available to them at the time of tender,citing gunderson fire ins.exchange th,d once an insurer determines,on the basis of the complaint and facts known to it at the time,that no potential exists for coverage,there is no continuing duty to investigate or monitor the lawsuit to see if the third party later made some new claim,not found in the original law suit 
the court concluded that all the theories of liability alleged in the underlying complaints arose out of exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants and were therefore barred by the pollution exclusions.a minute order granting steadfast motion for summary adjudication was entered on august,and the continental and royal motions for summary judgment were granted by minute order entered on november,
judgments were entered in favor of the insurers,and bechtel filed a timely notice of appeal after bechtel opening brief was filed,royal moved to dismiss the appeal,to take additional evidence,and to request judicial notice,and continental joined in royal motions.royal and continental claimed,based on recent statements by counsel for bechtel in a related case,that bechtel defense was provided by its own insurer and therefore bechtel had no standing to bring this suit.rulings on those motions were deferred 
discussion 
royal motion to dismiss bechtel appeal on the ground bechtel defense was provided by another insurer,depriving bechtel of standing to pursue its appeal,is without merit.
after bechtel opening brief was filed,royal filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.royal argues that bechtel has no standing to pursue its had no standing to sue in the first bechtel was fully defended in the underlying actions by its own insurer,industrial indemnity company.royal states bechtel lawyer,in conversations and opposition papers in connection with a related case,has admitted bechtel defense fees were paid by industrial royal concludes that bechtel therefore has no legally cognizable claim against royal or any other insurer,citing as authority fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d where several insurers cover the same risk and the insured has recovered the full amount of its loss from one of them,the insured has no further rights against the other insurers,and the liability of the other insurers to the insured likewise ceases 
we conclude royal is mistaken.first,while it is undisputed that industrial indemnity paid bechtel defense fees in the first instance,royal has not established bechtel has no liability for those fees.bechtel declaration in opposition to royal motion to dismiss states that under various agreements with industrial indemnity,bechtel is obligated to pay substantial defense fees to reimburse industrial indemnity for a portion of the defense fees for the defense of the lawsuits tendered to royal.the declaration further states industrial claims entitlement to percent reimbursement of the fees it paid for bechtel defense,and bechtel believes a final accounting will show bechtel has already paid industrial all or a substantial portion of the fees by virtue of having made over payments to industrial on other matters.
second,nothing in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,suggests that initial payment of an insured defense fees by an insurer who disclaims ultimate liability for payment deprives the insured of standing to seek those fees from other insurers on the risk.fireman fund correctly points out that,where several insurance policies cover the same risk,an insured who has recovered the full amount of its loss from one of the carriers has no further rights against the others.th at,d.however,an insured has not recovered the full amount of its loss if it is obligated to reimburse the insurer which initially paid the fees.indeed,fireman fund notes that,where several insurance policies cover the same risk,the fact the insured is only entitled to recover the actual amount of its loss does not bar it from demanding full coverage from each insurer,as long as its demand is made in good faith.id.at,d.
in sum,the evidence in connection with royal motion to dismiss demonstrates,at best,a contention by royal that bechtel has not yet paid any defense fees.bechtel disputes that contention.moreover,the very opposition papers cited by royal as bechtel admission that industrial indemnity paid its defense fees also specifically states that bechtel is responsible for those fees and must reimburse industrial indemnity under these circumstances,the principle cited in fireman fund does not apply to deprive bechtel of standing to seek defense fees from its other insurers.
ii.the absolute pollution exclusions in the policies of insurance operate to exclude coverage for bodily injuries allegedly caused by toxic substances,which are pollutants within the meaning of the policies.
the substance of bechtel argument on appeal is that the absolute pollution exclusions at issue should be interpreted to exclude coverage only for injuries caused by traditional environmental pollution,not for workplace or industrial injuries that do not relate to environmental contamination.the historical purpose of the pollution exclusion,bechtel says,limits its scope to environmental damage.moreover,bechtel contends,the exclusions are ambiguous as applied to the facts of this case.
similar questions have been extensively litigated in other jurisdictions,with conflicting results in this case,neither of bechtel arguments is persuasive.on the contrary,the exclusion clauses are clear and unambiguous as applied to the underlying claims,which allege a form of traditional environmental contamination.
first,we reject bechtel argument that the historical purpose of the pollution exclusion clause limits its scope to claims of environmental damage,and that personal injury claims or workplace injuries are therefore not within the scope of the exclusion.california courts are not at liberty to rewrite the plain terms of an insurance contract based on our view of a provision historical purpose the principles governing interpretation of insurance contracts in california are well established if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.thus,if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.aiu ins.superior court cal d.language in a contract is required to be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,quoting producers dairy delivery sentry ins.cal d,italics added in bank of the west.accordingly,if there is no ambiguity in the contract language,we do not consider the drafting history of the clause.see acl technologies northbrook property casualty ins,supra,th at,d reliance on extrinsic drafting history contradicts the basic rule that words in insurance policies should be interpreted as laypersons would interpret them.
the meaning a layperson would ascribe to the pollution exclusions at issue is not ambiguous.the exclusions specifically provide the insurance does not apply to bodily injury arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants.the term pollutants is defined broadly to include any noise,solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,mists,acids,alkalis,chemicals,biological and etiologic agents or materials,electromagnetic or ionizing radiation and energy,genetically engineered materials,teratogenic,carcinogenic and mutagenic materials,waste and any irritant or contaminant.
in this case,the bodily injuries alleged plainly arose out of the emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of toxic substances.the underlying complaints specifically assert bodily injury from bechtel purchase,delivery,manufacture,transportation,distribution,use,storage,release,spillage,discharge,loading,unloading,generation,disposal and dumping of harmful,dangerous,unsafe toxic substances into onto the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve,and allege bechtel caused,allowed and failed to prevent the contamination of the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve with said toxic substances.indeed,it is inconceivable how the underlying plaintiffs could be injured by exposure to toxic substances as alleged unless there were emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of such a substance,as described in the exclusion.see east quincy services dist.continental ins,similar terms of pollution exclusion covered every conceivable manner in which a person could experience exposure to a pollutant.the very assertion of contact by the underlying plaintiffs requires emission,release,dispersal,or escape.in short,we perceive no ambiguity in the pollution exclusions as applied to the facts of this case 
other courts have concluded,as bechtel points out,that the pollution exclusion does not bar coverage when events do not involve typical forms of environmental pollution.see nationwide mut.ins.richardson,supra,categorizing cases,and certifying to the district of columbia court of appeals the question whether the pollution exclusion clause applies to injuries arising from carbon monoxide poisoning.some courts have found,for example,an ordinarily intelligent insured could reasonably interpret the pollution exclusion clause as applying only to environmental pollution,and would not understand his policy did not cover injuries arising from the use of products associated with his business for the purpose for which the products were intended.nautilus ins.jabar cir,injuries caused by fumes from products used by the insured to repair roof at underlying plaintiff place of employment if clause were read literally,its scope would be virtually boundless such an interpretation would render policy virtually meaningless to the insured.other courts have found that the historical purpose shielding insurers from the costs of environmental cleanups prevents the clause from barring coverage for everyday industrial and residential accidents.see nationwide mut.ins.richardson,supra,at,citing stoney run commercial ins.cir,clause ambiguous in case involving residential carbon monoxide poisoning.still other courts have found a strictly literal reading of the provision could yield absurd results,and have refused to apply the clause to injuries resulting from everyday activities gone slightly,but not surprisingly,awry.the latter view is explained in a frequently quoted federal case from the seventh circuit 
the terms irritant and contaminant,when viewed in isolation,are virtually boundless,for there is virtually no substance or chemical in existence that would not irritate or damage some person or property.citation.without some limiting principle,the pollution exclusion clause would extend far beyond its intended scope,and lead to some absurd results.to take but two simple examples,reading the clause broadly would bar coverage for bodily injuries suffered by one who slips and falls on the spilled contents of a bottle of drano,and for bodily injury caused by an allergic reaction to chlorine in a public pool.although drano and chlorine are both irritants or contaminants that cause,under certain conditions,bodily injury or property damage,one would not ordinarily characterize these events as pollution.pipefitters welfare educ.fund westchester fire cir.
none of these theories of ambiguity,however,convinces us the pollution exclusions are ambiguous as applied in this case.the injuries alleged are not the result of a routine commercial hazard,everyday industrial and residential accidents,or everyday activities gone slightly,but not surprisingly,awry.the underlying plaintiffs allege injury and death from exposure to toxic substances at outdoor worksites over extended periods of akin to traditional environmental contamination.indeed,plaintiffs specifically allege bechtel contamination of the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve with toxic substances.
finally,it is an accepted principle of california insurance law that contract language is to be construed in the circumstances of the particular case,and can not be found ambiguous in the abstract.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d.in short,we need not be concerned with contemplating possible instances in which application of the clause would be absurd.this is not such a case we therefore align ourselves with the court in mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,th d,and with other jurisdictions which have found absolute pollution exclusions to bar coverage in a wide variety of circumstances.see,technical coating fidelity guaranty cir,absolute pollution exclusion unambiguously excluded coverage for bodily injuries sustained by breathing vapors emitted from insured roofing products,regardless of whether the insured used the products properly or negligently,applying florida law certain underwriters at lloyd turner const.cir,pollution exclusion unambiguously applies to bar coverage for workplace injuries to a welder caused by accidental release of cloud of phenol gas clause does not limit its application to only those discharges causing environmental harm applying texas law nat.elect.mfrs.gulf underwriters ins.cir,exclusion as written is not limited to atmospheric or environmental pollution only no duty to defend class action by welders for neurological injuries from exposure to manganese fumes while using welding products applying district of columbia law madison const.harleysville mut.ins,pollution exclusion clause relieves insurer of duty to defend insured in an action seeking damages for injuries when worker was overcome by fumes from a concrete curing agent and fell into an excavation site ambiguity or the lack thereof is to be determined by reference to a particular set of facts definition of pollutant including any irritant clearly and unambiguously applies to product which contained toxic chemicals,a suspected carcinogen and hazardous air pollutants exclusion encompassed discharges that do not leave the work site industries,home indem.cir,pollution exclusion bars coverage of claims by workers for injuries caused by defective furnaces which,in a rubber process,released products containing carcinogenic agents into the atmosphere which were breathed or otherwise ingested by the employees applying ohio law.
accordingly,we conclude the absolute pollution exclusions in the insurers policies operate to exclude coverage for bodily injuries allegedly caused by exposure to toxic substances at the reserve,and the insurers therefore had no duty to defend bechtel against lawsuits asserting damages from such exposure.
iii.neither the underlying complaints nor the additional evidence presented to the insurers after rejection of bechtel tender of defense raised any possibility of coverage under the policies.
bechtel argues that the underlying complaints,and particularly the extrinsic evidence presented to the insurers after the initial rejection of bechtel tender of defense,sufficiently allege plaintiffs injuries may have been due to causes,raising a potential for coverage under the policies.again,we disagree.
the principles governing determination of an insurer duty to defend are well established,and were reiterated in horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d,
a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.citation.as we said in gray zurich ins.cal d,the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.citation.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.citation.
accordingly,we examine first the allegations of the complaint,and then any facts known to the insurers extrinsic to the complaint,to determine whether there is any possibility of coverage under the policy.
the underlying complaints 
bechtel argues that the allegations in the complaints are sufficiently broad to include the possibility that any substances or conditions which may have caused the plaintiffs injuries were not toxic substances.bechtel says the complaints allege the plaintiffs were exposed to working conditions that were unsanitary,hazardous and dangerous to their health and that there was a failure to provide protective equipment.these claims,bechtel argues,trigger a potential for coverage which could not be absolutely barred by pollution exclusions 
we conclude it is not possible to read the underlying complaints to allege any claim of bodily injuries not arising out of exposure to toxic substances every paragraph of the those describing the parties,incorporating other allegations,or referring to the aforesaid wrongful acts attributes plaintiffs injuries to exposure to toxic substances the complaints repeatedly allege that as a direct legal result of bechtel wrongful acts,plaintiffs were exposed on virtually a daily basis to said toxic substances in the aforesaid contaminated air,land,soils and general environment at the reserve.the allegation plaintiffs were exposed to working conditions which were unsanitary,hazardous or dangerous to their health is no different it,too,is inextricably tied to exposure to toxic substances.indeed,that allegation appears only in the plaintiffs causes of action for fraudulent concealment.it is asserted as an example of the manner in which bechtel concealed the existence,nature extent of said toxic substances,namely,by giving no information to the subcontractors that would indicate that,in the course of providing the services called for in their contracts,the workers would be exposed to conditions which were unsanitary,hazardous or dangerous to their health.in short,the complaints allege no harmful working conditions that may reasonably be construed as different or separate from their claims of exposure to toxic substances.
bechtel also argues the plaintiffs allege they were not provided with protective safety equipment and their injuries were caused by bechtel failure to enforce policies and procedures regarding safety.again,however,these allegations appear only in connection with plaintiffs claims that bechtel fraudulently concealed the existence,nature and extent of the toxic substances to which plaintiffs were exposed.moreover,the assertion of varying theories of liability does not operate to change the fact that the injuries asserted aris e out of an excluded cause the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of toxic substances.see century transit systems,american empire surplus lines ins.th,d policy exclusion for any claim based on assault and battery precludes coverage for alleged negligent hiring,supervision and retention of cab driver who committed the assault exclusion bars coverage irrespective of the legal theory asserted against the insured.accordingly,the insurers initial refusal to defend was entirely proper because the underlying lawsuits did not even potentially seek damages for anything other than injuries arising from exposure to toxic substances.
extrinsic evidence 
as noted above,the allegations of the complaints are not conclusive.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.horace mann ins.barbara,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,we look not to whether noncovered acts predominate in the third party action,but rather to whether there is any potential for liability under the policy.id.at,d.
bechtel argues that after it filed this lawsuit on september,a variety of extrinsic evidence came to light in the underlying lawsuits this evidence made it clear,bechtel says,that the injuries alleged by the underlying plaintiffs may have been caused by something other than exposure to toxic substances.if that were so,and if that something were not an irritant,contaminant or pollutant within the meaning of the pollution exclusions,then the underlying lawsuits potentially sought damages within the coverage of the policy,and the insurers had a duty to defend the suits.the extrinsic facts cited by bechtel consisted of 
verified questionnaires,made available to the insurers in november,completed by the plaintiffs in the underlying actions.one of these,responding to the question how bechtel caused the death from cancer of plaintiff decedent,answered that bechtel caused,allowed and failed to prevent toxic exposure and harmful working conditions at the reserve.
an expert declaration filed in connection with the underlying sweaney lawsuit.the expert opined that an array of symptoms described to her,one of which was t hr owing up dust and dirt,can be indicative of physical deficits resulting from exposure to chemical substances allegedly present at the reserve.the expert concluded that decedent sweaney health was seriously injured by exposure to chemicals and heat in his workplace,and that but for that exposure,he most likely would have lived longer than he did 
responses from the underlying plaintiffs to contention interrogatories,provided to the insurers in august.these responses contended that bechtel caused,allowed and failed to prevent toxic substance exposure and harmful working conditions at the reserve.
the declaration of the lead attorney for the underlying plaintiffs,executed august,and filed with bechtel supplemental brief opposing the insurers summary judgment motions.the attorney stated the underlying plaintiffs were seeking recovery for injuries caused by toxic exposure for injuries caused by causes,such as harmful unsanitary working conditions.
we conclude the facts extrinsic to the complaints cited by bechtel add nothing to suggest the underlying plaintiffs were claiming injuries not arising from exposure to toxic substances.indeed,the extrinsic facts are no different in substance from the facts alleged in the complaints.the underlying plaintiffs identified no harmful working condition,except their exposure to toxic substances and bechtel failure to provide protective equipment or otherwise prevent that exposure.to the extent,if any,the extrinsic facts suggest plaintiffs or their decedents disabilities,illnesses deaths were caused by unsanitary working conditions,rather than by toxic substances,we fail to see how such conditions could arise from anything other than discharge or dispersal of waste or other pollutants,irritants or contaminants within the meaning of the pollution exclusions 
we recognize an insurer owes a duty to defend any claim that would be covered if true,even if the claim is groundless.thus,if plaintiffs complaints alleged only that they were injured by unidentified harmful working conditions,the insurers would be required to defend but that is not this case.plaintiffs plainly alleged their injuries arose from exposure to toxic substances,and identified no other harmful working conditions,except bechtel failure to protect them from such exposure.it is that the ultimate question is whether the facts alleged do fairly apprise the insurer that plaintiff is suing the insured upon an occurrence which,if his allegations are true,gives rise to liability of insurer to insured under the terms of the policy.gray zurich ins.cal d,quoting ritchie anchor casualty d,emphasis added in gray.neither the facts alleged in the complaints,nor the extrinsic facts asserted in the plaintiffs questionnaires and interrogatory responses,apprise the insurer of any facts which,if true,would give rise to coverage under the policy.as for the expert declaration,its purport is plainly that sweaney death was caused by chemical exposure,not,as bechtel claims,by heat.
finally,we give no credence to the eleventh hour declaration from the attorney for the underlying plaintiffs,stating plaintiffs sought recovery for injuries caused by toxic exposure for injuries caused by causes,such as harmful unsanitary working conditions.the declaration was executed several years after the underlying complaints were filed,but like the interrogatory answers and questionnaires,fails to allege the nature of any harmful working conditions other than toxic exposure.moreover,as gray zurich ins.stated,albeit in the opposite context,we should hardly designate the third party as the arbiter of the policy coverage.gray zurich ins,supra,cal d at,finding a duty to defend based on nonintentional conduct despite the third party pleading alleging only intentional conduct.the point applies here too.see hurley construction state farm fire casualty th,d a corollary to the rule that a third party is not the arbiter of the policy coverage is that the insured may not speculate about unpled third party claims to manufacture coverage no duty to defend action charging insured with participation in a conspiracy to engage in fraudulent billing practices under a policy limiting coverage to claims for bodily injury and damage to tangible property.
the duty to defend is broad,but an insurer is not obligated to defend its insured where the basis for claiming potential liability under the policy is tenuous and.giddings industrial indemnity d.the bottom line is that bechtel was entitled to a defense only if the third parties actions potentially sought recovery for bodily injuries not arising from exposure to toxic substances or other pollutants,contaminants or irritants.contrary to bechtel contention,neither the complaints nor the other information made available to the insurers reveals any claim that can reasonably be construed as seeking recovery for bodily injuries arising from any other cause.accordingly,no duty to defend arose,either at the time bechtel tendered the complaints or later.
iv.bechtel argument that the pollution exclusions in the royal and continental policies do not apply because the work sites were not occupied by either bechtel or the subcontractors is without merit.
the pollution exclusions in the royal and continental policies contain an occupancy limitation.some apply,for example,only when the dispersal or release of the pollutant occurs a t or from any premises,site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by,or rented or loaned to,any insured.bechtel argues the trial court erred in finding that bechtel the subcontractors the named insureds occupied the reserve.bechtel says that occupancy requires possession and control of property,and that neither bechtel nor the named insureds possessed or controlled the entire square mile reserve,which is owned by the federal government,and neither loaned nor rented to bechtel or any of the subcontractors.bechtel also says the terms premises,site,location and occupied are all ambiguous under the circumstances of this case.we disagree.
we are aware of no california cases specifically construing the term occupied in a pollution exclusion clause.however,we find no error in the trial court sensible conclusion that bechtel and its subcontractors occupied the site in that they controlled and did business in significant portions of the site for a significant period of time.under california law,terms in an insurance policy are read in their ordinary and popular sense.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th,d.the ordinary dictionary definition of the word occupy includes,for example,to take up a place or extent in space as well as to take or hold possession or control of webster new collegiate dictionary see also the oxford english dictionary ed.definition includes t o take up,use up,fill space or time also in weakened sense,t o be situated or stationed in,to be in or at a place or position.
we have no difficulty concluding that contractors and subcontractors continuously performing operations at various areas of a site over a period of years have occupied the premises,site or location within the ordinary meaning of the terms in the clause.see redevelopment agency superior court d.noting definitions of the term occupy as including to do business in.bechtel claim of ambiguity is without merit.
disposition 
the judgments are affirmed.respondent insurers are to recover their costs on appeal.
since we conclude no duty to defend existed because of the absolute pollution exclusions,we need not consider the trial court conclusions that royal had no duty to defend bechtel in three of the underlying lawsuits under the terms of the endorsements adding bechtel as an additional insured,and royal had no duty to defend three other underlying lawsuits because the plaintiffs in those suits were employees,or spouses of employees,of royal named insured subcontractor westside oilfield construction,and the policies exclude coverage for bodily injury to employees of the insured.
the six underlying lawsuits are denominated the trehern,johnson,fanska,sweaney,kight and montgomery lawsuits.the trehern and sweaney lawsuits were brought by the survivors of william trehern and randy sweaney.the fanska and montgomery suits each include numerous plaintiffs,both workers and family members.the kight suit likewise includes numerous plaintiffs,all of them family members of workers.
the allegations of the complaints include the following bechtel caused,allowed and failed to prevent the purchase,delivery,manufacture,transportation,distribution,use,storage,release,spillage,discharge,loading,unloading,generation,disposal and dumping of harmful,dangerous,unsafe toxic substances into onto the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve,and caused,allowed and failed to prevent the contamination of the air,land,soils and general environment of the reserve with said toxic substances.bechtel failed to timely and properly evaluate,test monitor the land,air,soils and general environment of the reserve failed to timely and properly adopt and enforce policies,procedures,protocols practices relative to the health and safety of the plaintiffs and others at the reserve failed to timely and properly provide communicate to the plaintiffs and others knowledge,information warnings about the existence,nature extent of said toxic substances or their use at the reserve actively and purposefully concealed from the plaintiffs and others the existence,nature extent of said toxic substances at the reserve purchased,delivered,manufactured,transported,distributed,used,stored,released,spilled,discharged,loaded,unloaded,generated,disposed and dumped said toxic substances into onto the land,air,soils and general environment of the reserve all of which caused allowed and failed to prevent exposure of the plaintiffs to said toxic substances.bechtel fraudulently concealed the existence,nature extent of the toxic substances by giving no information to the subcontractors that would indicate that in the course of providing the services called for in their contracts,the workers would be exposed to conditions which were unsanitary,hazardous or dangerous to their health no information was given to the subcontractors which would indicate that protective safety equipment was necessary to safely perform the services called for in the contract no information was given to the subcontractors which would indicate that in the course of providing the services called for in the contract,the workers would be exposed to hazardous or toxic substances.in fact,during the course of providing services called for under his employer the subcontractor contract,plaintiff was exposed to working conditions which were unsanitary,hazardous and dangerous to his health,was exposed to toxic substances,and was never provided with appropriate protective equipment,which would have prevented his injuries.the causes of action for fraudulent concealment included allegations that plaintiffs relied on bechtel to do surveys to determine if any hazardous or unsafe conditions existed,including the potential for exposure to toxic substances,in areas where plaintiffs would be bechtel allowed plaintiffs and plaintiffs decedents to work without any protective gear,plaintiffs and their clothing,at the end of their work days,were covered with toxic substances and dust and other residue from said toxic substances which were then unknowingly taken into plaintiffs homes,exposing their families to said toxic substances residue and dust 
section of the health and safety code provides n o person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual the sweaney and kight complaints also asserted causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and unfair business practices,and the fanska and kight lawsuits asserted claims for loss of consortium.
bechtel also sued superior national insurance company,americas insurance company,classic syndicate,and classic fire marine insurance company.litigation against superior national is stayed due to its insolvency,and the other insurers are not parties to this appeal.
royal joined in continental motion on the ground there were no material differences in the absolute pollution exclusion language in the continental policies and the two royal policies at issue.royal also brought a separate motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the additional insured endorsements and employee exclusions in the two royal policies precluded any potential for coverage of the underlying claims.as previously noted,we do not consider these issues in light of our interpretation of the pollution exclusions.
steadfast pollution exclusion reads as follows this insurance does not apply e to ultimate net loss arising out of or in connection with the discharge,dispersal,release,escape or seepage of oil,petroleum substances or derivatives including any oil,refuse or oil mixed with wastes,smoke,vapors,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,toxic chemicals,liquids or gases,waste materials or other irritants,contaminants or pollutants into or upon the land,the atmosphere,or any water course,body of water,bog,marsh,swamp or wetland and including but not limited to hazardous substances in the ground water,the subsoil or anything contained therein.this exclusion shall also apply to ultimate net loss arising from or in connection with the costs incurred with anything contained in the preceding sentence.continental issued three policies.the pollution exclusion in policy states in pertinent part this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants a at or from any premises,site or location which is or was at any time owned or occupied by,or rented or loaned to,any insured the term pollutants is defined as follows any noise,solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,mists,acids,alkalis,chemicals,biological and etiologic agents or materials,electromagnetic or ionizing radiation and energy,genetically engineered materials,teratogenic,carcinogenic and mutagenic materials,waste and any irritant or contaminant.the exclusion in continental policy is identical.the exclusion in continental third policy,reads in part as follows this insurance does not apply to bodily injury,property damage or injury or damage of any nature or kind to persons or property arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened emission,discharge,dispersal,seepage,release or escape of pollutants any loss,cost or expense incurred as a result of any of pollutants or the investigation,settlement or defense of any claim,suit or proceeding against the insured,including any payments,costs or expenses associated therewith,alleging such injury,damage,loss,cost or expense as described in and above.the definition of pollutants is substantially the same as in the other continental policy no.pyak provides,in pertinent part,that the policy does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants a at or from premises owned,rented or occupied by the named insured the term pollutants is defined as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes materials to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.royal policy no.contains substantially the same language.
the court said it may be that bechtel should retender because of what they learned later in answers to these interrogatories.but that another story.we have to look at the complaints.
on november,bechtel filed a second lawsuit against the insurers,seeking the same relief as in this case bechtel ii.the complaint in bechtel ii recites bechtel to the insurers,and their refusal to defend,based on the additional evidence that the trial court refused to consider in bechtel bechtel ii includes allegations that the underlying actions are pled in broad and general terms,identify no precise cause of the alleged injuries,and take no absolute position as to whether the cause of injury was from toxic exposure or nontoxic causes or which or whose operations were involved.the insurers advise bechtel ii has been stayed pending resolution of this appeal.
in addition to the judgments entered in favor of royal,continental and steadfast,bechtel appealed from judgments in favor of superior national insurance company,americas insurance company and the home insurance company.superior is insolvent and litigation against it is stayed.americas filed a,seeking review of an order denying its motion for summary adjudication of issues concerning a health hazard exclusion.americas did not pursue its,which was eventually dismissed,and has not filed a brief in bechtel appeal bechtel brief does not refer to any americas policies.bechtel and home entered into a stipulated judgment in favor of home,on the same basis as the judgment in favor of steadfast,since home pollution exclusion was virtually identical to steadfast exclusion.home joined in the brief filed by steadfast.at oral argument,the court was advised that home is no longer a party to this appeal.
the insurance environmental litigation association filed an application for leave to file an amicus brief in support of the insurers.that application was denied,as was the association motion for reconsideration of the court denial.
on december,bechtel counsel filed a complaint on behalf of chevron,against royal and the other insurers,seeking coverage for the same underlying claims at issue in this case.in the chevron case,royal issued a subpoena for the production of the industrial insurance policy,under which both bechtel and chevron were insured.bechtel and chevron objected to production of the policy by industrial on grounds it was a trade secret and irrelevant.according to a declaration from royal counsel,bechtel counsel admitted in conversations on this subject that all of bechtel defense fees were paid by industrial and that the bechtel suit was really in the nature of a action on behalf of industrial.royal also relies on bechtel opposition to royal motion to consolidate the chevron case with bechtel ii see footnote supra.in that opposition,bechtel stated that bechtel,while responsible for the defense payments of the litigation in bechtel i and ii,did not pay directly for its defense.it must reimburse an insurer which paid on its behalf.
royal claims the evidence presented with its motion to dismiss industrial payment of bechtel fees is dispositive however,royal asks this court to allow it to take additional evidence in the event this court disagrees.
royal argues bechtel has not provided any agreements which bechtel claims are confidential between it and industrial that demonstrate the nature of its reimbursement obligation.from this,royal says we should conclude bechtel was fully defended by industrial and therefore has no claim against royal.at best,royal evidence is merely that industrial paid the fees in the first instance royal submitted no evidence that bechtel is not,as it avers,liable for the fees.instead,royal essentially takes the position that bechtel must prove it is liable for the fees by producing the agreements it refers to in its declaration,and which are the subject of discovery disputes in the chevron case.however,it is royal burden to prove it is entitled to dismissal,and this it has not done.
bechtel argues the mere fact that different jurisdictions reached different conclusions on the scope of the exclusion establishes more than one reasonable construction of the exclusion.that notion has been rejected in california.acl technologies northbrook property casualty ins.th,d mere fact that judges of diverse jurisdictions disagree does not establish ambiguity under the particular principles which govern the interpretation of insurance contracts in california.
for a summary of the history of the pollution exclusion clause,see,nationwide mut.ins.richardson,and american states ins.koloms.according to nationwide mutual,before,standard comprehensive general liability policies provided coverage for property damage and bodily injury caused by accident,and were often interpreted to cover injuries related to environmental pollution.then the industry changed the policy language to cover occurrences,and tried to define occurrences to exclude environmental pollution.when courts continued to interpret the language to provide coverage,the insurers began to add an endorsement to the policy,excluding coverage for damage arising out of the discharge or escape of pollutants into or upon land,the atmosphere or any water course or body of water.the exclusion contained an exception for discharges that were sudden and accidental,and in was incorporated into the policy.the sudden and accidental exception spawned extensive litigation,and insurance companies adopted a new version of the exclusion in the.the new version,referred to as the absolute or total pollution exclusion,eliminated the sudden and accidental exception,and also eliminated the requirement that the discharge was into or upon land,the atmosphere or any water course.nationwide mut.ins.richardson,supra,at.some cases say the amended clause was intended by the insurance industry to bar coverage for the costs of environmental cleanups.ibid.citing cases.
acl technologies rejected the insureds contention the sudden and accidental exception to the pollution exclusion,contained in the version of the standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy,allowed for coverage for a claim for expenses to clean up pollutants which leaked gradually from underground storage tanks.the court rejected arguments that the drafting history showed the insurance industry intended only to restrict coverage to unintended and unexpected pollution,even if it occurred gradually.acl technologies northbrook property casualty ins,supra,th at,d.acl technologies also pointed out that the drafting history argument assumes that individual insurers should be bound by statements made by industry spokesmen years before.th at,d.
unlike the continental and royal exclusions,steadfast exclusion,although broad in its description of the substances subject to the exclusion,requires a discharge or dispersal of the irritants,contaminants or pollutants into or upon the land,the atmosphere,or any water course,body of water,bog,marsh,swamp or wetland.we see no substantive difference for purposes of this case,however,as the underlying claims of injury from exposure to toxic substances necessarily require a dispersal of the toxic substance into the atmosphere.
after this case was argued,the fourth appellate district concluded that a similar pollution exclusion applied to bar coverage.the court held the insurer had no duty to defend its insured in a lawsuit alleging that a tenant in an apartment building died as a result of exposure to insecticide sprayed at the building to exterminate yellow jackets.mackinnon truck ins.exchange th d.the court concluded,as we do,that the pollution exclusion was clear and unambiguous,and declined to consider the history of the exclusion.id.at d at.other california precedents cited by the insurers are not of particular assistance in resolving the applicability of the absolute pollution exclusion under the circumstances.however,the other cases,which involve typical forms of environmental contamination,also refer to the scope of the pollution exclusion in expansive terms.in the most pertinent of those cases,a federal district court granted summary judgment to the insurer,concluding the pollution exclusion endorsement barred coverage for claims of bodily injury and property damage arising from pollution and contamination of surface,soil or groundwater by fecal coliform and other bacteria.east quincy services dist.continental ins,supra.the court,referring to the clarity and expansiveness of the exclusion language,rejected the contention that the language was ambiguous as applied to the circumstances,and found that fecal coliform and other bacteria were pollutants.at see also legarra federated mutual ins.th,d finding the pollution exclusion applied and the insurer had no duty to defend the insureds in connection with a demand by the california regional water quality control board for certain response costs for groundwater contamination from fuel releases on the insureds property the court observed that the pollution exclusion does not limit pollutants to hazardous substances pollutants include any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant titan aetna casualty surety th,d absolute pollution exclusion unambiguously excluded coverage for costs associated with injuries from or cleanup of tce trichloroethylene,classified as a hazardous substance under federal law groundwater contamination lakeside metals,hanover ins.cir pollution exclusion clearly barred coverage for claims against the insured for contamination of land and surrounding waters nuisance and trespass claims in the underlying complaint were rooted in property damage,expressly excluded from coverage by the pollution exclusion hydro,continental ins.cir pollution exclusion unambiguously barred coverage for defense of the city actions against insured relating to emission of styrene gas in the manufacturing process on appeal insured did not deny emission fell within the pollution exclusion clause,but unsuccessfully relied on an exception to the pollution exclusion clause.
