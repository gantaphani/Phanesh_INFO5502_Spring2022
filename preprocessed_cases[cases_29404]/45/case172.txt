magdalena pomales worked as a sales consultant for celulares telefónica,cti,a puerto rico retailer of cellular telephone equipment and services.after pomales was fired by cti,she brought this action claiming sexual harassment and retaliation under title vii of the civil rights act,et,and puerto rico law.she also claimed that cti violated the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra,et,by not notifying her of the opportunity to purchase continuing health coverage under the company policy following her termination.the district court granted cti summary judgment.we affirm.
pomales failed to oppose cti statement of undisputed facts in support of its motion for summary judgment in accord with the puerto rico local rules.see.the district court,therefore,accepted the facts presented by cti as admitted.see id.we will do the same.see,cir.
pomales relationship with cti began when she was hired as a temporary employee in november.in august,cti converted pomales to permanent status and assigned her to work as a sales consultant in its store in bayamón,puerto rico.pomales was initially supervised by norma vargas.in,peter rodríguez joined vargas as another supervisor.peter rodríguez and vargas were themselves supervised by rodney rodríguez.
in april,pomales complained to rodney rodríguez that peter rodríguez had directed an inappropriate comment and gesture toward her.according to pomales,she invited peter rodríguez to come on a sales visit with her,and he responded by grabbing his crotch and stating that it would be great to come with you.
as a sales consultant,pomales was responsible for selling products and services to cti customers.cti sales consultants made and proactive sales.sales consultants were responsible for meeting a minimum sales quota and were paid based on an hourly rate plus commissions.
cti required sales consultants to verify each customer credit before consummating a sale.customers with poor credit were required to provide cti with a deposit before the sales consultant could complete the sale.the process for determining the customer credit rating and resulting deposit varied depending on whether the sale was an or proactive.
for sales,the consultant accessed,through cti computer system,a credit service and reported certain information about the customer.the credit service then provided a credit score which the computer automatically translated into a required deposit amount if any.for proactive sales,the consultant called cti credit department and provided customer information to the employee.that employee then determined the required deposit amount and entered the deposit amount manually into the computer.only employees could set the required deposit amount for proactive sales,and no sale could be completed until the customer had paid the required deposit.
during pomales employment,cti computer system malfunctioned in such a way that consultants could bypass the process and manually enter a deposit amount.cti eventually discovered this malfunction in its system,after learning that several consultants had entered inaccurate deposit information to register unauthorized sales.
in august,vargas received confidential information that pomales had failed to secure proper deposits from clients by manipulating the system.rodney rodríguez authorized vargas to investigate this accusation.
vargas investigation revealed that the credit department was unfamiliar with pomales and had no documentation that she had ever contacted it to register a proactive sale.at vargas request,the credit department reviewed more than of pomales sales.on each occasion,pomales had bypassed the process and manually entered into the system a notation stating that no deposit was required.
on august,vargas requested that pomales produce evidence that she had collected a deposit from one of her proactive customers.pomales failed to comply with this request by september,when she began a medical leave of absence.
while pomales was on leave,vargas discussed the results of her investigation with two members of the cti human resources department.a conclusion was reached that pomales had breached several company policies,including a policy against the falsification or malicious alteration of reports and records of interest to the company.vargas thereafter decided to terminate pomales employment.vargas arrived at this decision without knowledge that pomales had previously complained to cti management about peter rodríguez inappropriate conduct.
vargas informed pomales on the day that she returned from her leave of absence that her employment was terminated.pomales was one of several employees that cti discharged for breaching its credit verification and deposit policies.upon pomales termination,cti did not provide her with information concerning the option to purchase continuing health coverage under the company group health insurance policy.
three weeks after her termination,pomales filed an administrative charge of sexual harassment based on a hostile work environment and retaliation with the puerto rico unit of the puerto rico labor and human resources department.she eventually received a right to sue letter and filed the present action.
after a period for discovery,cti moved for summary judgment.the district court ruled that pomales title vii hostile work environment claim failed because,inter alia,no reasonable fact finder could conclude that the conduct alleged was sufficiently severe or pervasive.the court also rejected her title vii retaliation claim because there was no evidence establishing a causal connection between pomales protected activity and her termination.finally,the court determined that cti did not violate cobra notice requirements because the company dismissed pomales for gross misconduct.pomales timely appealed.
we review the district court order granting summary judgment de novo.see wolinetz berkshire life ins,cir.we will affirm the order if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and cti is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
we begin by considering pomales hostile work environment claim.this claim is limited to peter rodriguez comment and gesture to pomales suggesting that he wished to have sexual relations with her 
to succeed on her hostile work environment claim,pomales must demonstrate,inter alia,that the conduct was so severe or pervasive that it altered the terms or conditions of her employment.see del caribe,cir.there is no mathematically precise test to determine whether a plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that she was subjected to a severely or pervasively hostile work environment.kosereis rhode island,cir internal citations omitted.we examine all the attendant circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it was physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interfered with an employee work performance.see providence,cir.because this inquiry is fact specific,the determination is often reserved for a fact finder,see marrero goya of,cir,but summary judgment is an appropriate vehicle for polic ing the baseline for hostile environment claims,mendoza borden,cir en banc.
the record does not provide a sufficient basis from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that pomales was subjected to a hostile work environment.the alleged harassing conduct,while certainly crude,comprised only a single incident.see clark county sch.dist.breeden,d per curiam stating that isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment chamberlin realty,cir a n isolated sexual advance,without more,does not satisfy the requirement that an employee asserting a cause of action for hostile environment discrimination demonstrate an abusive workplace environment.there was no proof that peter rodríguez touched or physically threatened pomales.while we do not preclude the possibility of a hostile work environment claim based on exclusively verbal conduct,successful claims typically have involved unwanted physical contact.see barbara lindemann paul grossman,employ
