several north carolina medicaid beneficiaries commenced this class action under against north carolina state officials to obtain a declaratory judgment that dental screening and treatment services provided to minors in north carolina under the medicaid program are inadequate and fail to comply with the requirements of the medicaid act and an injunction requiring the state officials to comply with the medicaid act by making dental screening and treatment promptly available.the district court,relying on ex parte young,denied the north carolina state officials motion to dismiss based on eleventh amendment immunity.the court also rejected the officials other jurisdictional challenges.on this interlocutory appeal,we affirm the district court ruling on eleventh amendment immunity,and we decline to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the other grounds on which the state officials relied to support their motion to dismiss the complaint.
the plaintiffs,who are minors,allege in their complaint that they have been denied the dental care prescribed by title xix of the social security act,known as the medicaid act.noting that only of north carolina dentists participate in the medicaid program,they allege that they are unable to locate local dentists who are willing to treat them in exchange for medicaid reimbursement.they assert that medicaid beneficiaries in north carolina generally must conduct extensive searches and travel long distances to locate and utilize the services of a dentist who will accept medicaid reimbursement.
describing their own experiences,emani tatum,alleges that she has had to travel two hours each way to utilize the services of a dentist.while a dental clinic closer to her provided an initial screening,that clinic was unable to provide ongoing care.as a result of the inaccessibility of prompt and adequate care,she has had to have extensive dental care,including three fillings and two crowns.jeshod hughes,alleges that he has had similar difficulties in obtaining treatment.arielle mccree,alleges that her mother contacted the local department of social services to find a dentist,only to be referred to the public health clinic,which was unable to provide dental services.the department of social services then could not provide the name of any dentist for mccree who would accept medicaid reimbursement.mccree mother eventually located a dentist an hour away.austin brooks,alleges that his grandmother contacted numerous dentists in his area,but none would accept medicaid.because he could not locate a dentist in his area,he could not receive preventive dental treatment.when he began experiencing oral pain,his grandmother located a dentist three hours away.because of the lack of preventative dental care,brooks has had to have four of his front teeth pulled and several of his remaining teeth capped 
because of their inability to receive adequate dental care,these plaintiffs,through their parents,guardians,or next friends,commenced this action on behalf of themselves and on behalf of others similarly situated against carmen hooker buell,director of the north carolina department of health and human services,and nina yeager,director of the north carolina division of medicaid assistance,in their official capacities plaintiffs allege that the defendants have denied north carolina medicaid beneficiaries equal access and quality care,in violation of a a and failed to ensure statewide availability of dental services,in violation of a and denied north carolina medicaid beneficiaries timely dental care,in violation of a and denied medicaid beneficiaries a free choice of dental care providers,in violation of a and denied medicaid beneficiaries dental care that is comparable to the care available to patients,in violation of a b and,and denied medicaid beneficiaries proper access to early screening and treatment services,in violation of a a,a,a b,r,and et.
for relief,the plaintiffs request a judgment declaring that the defendants failure to insure the availability of dental services violates plaintiffs rights under the social security act and its implementing rules and regulations and an injunction requiring the defendants to make needed dental services immediately available to medicaid beneficiaries in their respective localities and requiring the defendants to comply with the federal statutes,rules,and regulations governing medicaid programs.
the north carolina officials filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint,asserting eleventh amendment immunity,a lack of standing,and the failure of the complaint to state a claim under upon which relief can be granted.from the district court order denying their motion,the north carolina officials filed this interlocutory appeal,challenging the district court ruling denying them eleventh amendment immunity.they also ask this court to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the other rulings made by the district court.
the district court order denying state officials eleventh amendment immunity is an immediately appealable order,see puerto rico aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d,and our review of this order is de novo,see csx,bd.of pub.works,cir.
the north carolina officials contend that,because they have been sued in their official capacities,they are entitled to sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment to the constitution.they argue that the exception to such immunity,described in ex parte young,is not applicable.
the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment immunity is designed to preserve the constitutional structure established by the supremacy clause.thus,it allows private citizens,in proper cases,to petition a federal court to enjoin state officials in their official capacities from engaging in future conduct that would violate the constitution or a federal statute.see ex parte young,at.enjoining enforcement of a state statute found to violate the constitution green mansour,d applying ex parte young to an action involving state violation of a federal statute.this exception to sovereign immunity is based on the notion,often referred to as a fiction,that a state officer who acts in violation of the constitution is stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.ex parte young,at.a state officer acting in violation of federal law thus loses the cloak of state immunity,bragg west virginia coal ass n,cir,cert.denied,d,because in such a situation,t he state has no power to impart to the official any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the united states.ex parte young,at.
but just because a private citizen federal suit seeks declaratory injunctive relief against state officials does not mean that it must automatically be allowed to proceed under an exception to the eleventh amendment protection.bell atlantic,mci worldcom,cir,cert.granted sub nom.verizon pub.serv.comm n,d june,and united states pub.serv.comm n,d.such empty formalism would improperly sacrifice the real interests served by the eleventh amendment.id.quoting idaho coeur tribe,d.as we explained in bell atlantic,in applying the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment immunity,we must evaluate the respective state and federal interests,applying ex parte young narrowly so as not unduly to erode the important underlying doctrine of sovereign immunity while still protecting the supremacy of federal law.bell atlantic,at.
arguing that this case traverses the narrow limits of the ex parte young exception in several respects,the north carolina officials assert that the exception does not apply because this suit requires expenditures of money from north carolina treasury and therefore the injunctive relief requested is not actually prospective the plaintiffs have not alleged an ongoing violation of federal law the law that plaintiffs allege has been violated is state law,not federal law the medicaid act was adopted under the spending clause and implemented through the voluntary participation of the states,making its prerequisites unenforceable under the supremacy fundamental reason for the ex parte young exception the plaintiffs action is actually against the state and not against the individuals and,in any event,violates the state special sovereignty interests application of the ex parte young exception would alter the remedial scheme explicitly selected by congress to enforce the medicaid act and the rights that plaintiffs seek to enforce are discretionary in nature,not ministerial,and therefore are not subject to the ex parte young exception.
we address,in turn,each of the reasons advanced by the north carolina officials for not applying the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment immunity.
the north carolina officials contend first that this action does not fall within the ex parte young exception because the type of relief sought is,at its core,not truly prospective.they assert that,while the plaintiffs phrase their request in terms of prospective injunctive relief,they actually seek an order directing the state to raise the medicaid reimbursement rates paid to participating dentists,thereby adversely affecting the state treasury.in response,plaintiffs point out that,although raising rates may be a method for inducing more dentists to participate in the medicaid program,the plaintiffs complaint does not demand a particular methodology.rather,it simply requests injunctive relief to require the state officials to take steps to comply with a number of separate and varied medicaid provisions.
we believe that the issue,as framed by the parties positions,does not properly focus on the relevant question.it is true,as both parties acknowledge,that,as an exception to eleventh amendment immunity,ex parte young actions must seek only prospective injunctive relief.but simply because the implementation of such prospective relief would require the expenditure of substantial sums of money does not remove a claim from the ex parte young exception.ex parte young permits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal law,notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury.milliken bradley,d edelman jordan,d reversing a retroactive award of monetary relief because it was in practical effect indistinguishable in many aspects from an award of damages against the state.thus,the focus on an injunction impact on the state treasury is misdirected.rather,the proper focus must be directed at whether the injunctive relief sought is prospective or retroactive in nature.
this distinction comes from the supreme court holdings in edelman and milliken.in edelman,the supreme court determined that the relief sought infringed on sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment because the plaintiffs sought a retroactive payment of benefits that were found to have been wrongfully withheld from proper recipients.at.in the milliken case,however,the court upheld an injunction entered in a school desegregation case that ordered the state to pay one half of the costs attributable to certain educational programs ordered as part of a desegregation decree.the court found that t he decree fit squarely within the exception reaffirmed by edelman.that exception permits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct to requirements of federal law,notwithstanding a direct and substantial impact on the state treasury.milliken,at.thus,our inquiry must focus,not on whether the injunctive relief sought would have an impact on the state treasury,but on the distinction as delineated by edelman and milliken.
we conclude that the relief sought in this case is prospective in nature and,therefore,is of the type that falls within the ex parte young exception.the plaintiffs requested an injunction mandating that in the future,state officials bring the north carolina medicaid program into compliance with the medicaid act.this mandate might potentially impact the state treasury,but it is nonetheless prospective.
the north carolina officials next contend that plaintiffs suit has failed to allege an ongoing or continuing violation of federal law,as is necessary to invoke the ex parte young exception.these officials maintain that e ach plaintiff,according to the complaint,is currently a medicaid recipient who is receiving dental treatment by a dentist or clinic that accepts medicaid patients at the current medicaid reimbursement rate and that,therefore,even though violations may have occurred in the past,they are not ongoing.
while the north carolina officials correctly note that the ex parte young exception requires the allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law,see idaho coeur tribe,d,their argument misreads the substance of the plaintiffs complaint.the plaintiffs do not rest their complaint on any claim that they have been entirely unable to find dentists in north carolina who will accept medicaid reimbursement or that they have not received some treatment.rather,they claim that north carolina has failed,and continues to fail,to operate a medicaid program under which beneficiaries can obtain prompt and adequate dental services on an ongoing basis,as would be available to the general population.they allege that because a large proportion of dentists do not participate in the medicaid program,beneficiaries,such as themselves,have to travel long distances to find dentists.if true,these claims allege ongoing violations of a a,requiring states to provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area emphasis added and a,requiring states to provide that all individuals wishing to make application for medical assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so,and that such assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals emphasis added.we thus conclude that the plaintiffs complaint is not defective for failing to allege ongoing violations of federal law.
in the same vein,the north carolina officials assert that this action seeks to enforce state law,not federal law.they contend that this action seeks to challenge the state participation in the medicaid program and not to vindicate the supremacy of federal law,arguing that m erely because a state enacts a program that complies with federal guidelines or requirements,the program requirements do not thereby become or constitute federal law for purposes of ex parte young.for support,the north carolina officials rely on our decision in bragg,where we held that private parties could not bring an ex parte young action against state officials seeking to compel their compliance with surface mining regulations because the directly applicable standards were supplied by west virginia law.
again,the north carolina officials correctly observe that the ex parte young exception does not apply to actions against state officials seeking to compel their compliance with state law.see pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d we conclude that young and edelman are inapplicable in a suit against state officials on the basis of state law bragg,at.in bragg,for instance,west virginia state officials were sued under the surface mining control and reclamation act of.that act permits states,such as west virginia,to enact their own laws and thus obtain primacy status.under the surface mining act,a state with primacy status has exclusive control over the regulation of surface mining,so long as the state law fulfills minimum national standards.at.we concluded that in that context any injunction against state officials to enforce this provision would command them to comport with the state own law,not federal law,because only the state law was operative and directly regulate d the issuance of mining permits.id.at.therefore,in that context,the ex parte young exception did not apply.
but the medicaid act is not analogous to the surface mining act.it does not grant to the states exclusive jurisdiction over their medicaid programs.rather,it requires states to have their plans approved by
