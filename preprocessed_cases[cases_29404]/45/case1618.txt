patrick torres appeals from the summary judgment order entered on behalf of unum life insurance company of america in this suit to enforce his rights under a disability plan issued and administered by unum.unum denied torres application for benefits.after exhausting his administrative remedies,torres brought this action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa.because the record reveals that unum abused its discretion in denying torres application,we reverse.
torres employment and medical condition 
torres worked as a clinical perfusionist for nineteen years.a perfusionist is a surgical room technologist who operates the machine during cardiopulmonary bypass.dorland illustrated medical dictionary ed.he spent the last six years at rapid city regional hospital where he practiced under the supervision of the primary surgeon in the operating room and,ultimately,under the hospital director of surgery.
in may,the hospital suspended torres from his job because he had suffered hearing loss.on may,torres was examined by an audiologist at mountain plains audiology associates.torres reported that he had been gradually losing his hearing since,and he was very concerned about the loss and the difficulty it caused in communicating.he had tried a hearing aid several years before but had returned it because it amplified unwanted sounds and did not improve his ability to hear in noisy settings.his examination revealed that he had a high frequency impairment of moderate to moderately severe for his left ear and severe for his right ear.the audiologist wrote,with this man type and degree of hearing loss,it would be typical for him to experience difficulty with speech discrimination ability in situations where background noise is present.he recommended that torres try a hearing aid again,and torres agreed.
one month later,torres was also examined by an otorhinolaryngologist,gary carlson.carlson agreed with the recommendation of a hearing aid.torres obtained two hearing aids but eventually settled on wearing only one of them to avoid white light noise but still be able to hear the doctors requests in the operating room.
the record does not indicate when or how torres job suspension ended.the next event of note occurred in march when torres was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy.he remained in the hospital for five days and,upon his discharge,was told not to return to work until further notice.he began seeing a cardiologist,drew purdy,on april.purdy adjusted his medication,directed him to continue with the exercise he had been doing,and discussed the benefits of getting torres returned to work at some point at a reduced number of hours and with realistic responsibilities.at his next appointment three weeks later,purdy opined that he should be able to return to his regular job but not be on call.the record does not reveal when he did return to work.
torres continued to see purdy throughout the time relevant to this appeal.in april,purdy noted that the medications prescribed for his heart problems intermittently caused torres to get somewhat lightheaded or dizzy.the following month,just after his discharge from employment,purdy adjusted torres medication and cautioned him that he may need to discontinue one type if he became hypotensive or progressively lethargic or fatigued.
on april,torres was called to a meeting with his department manager,marcia taylor,to discuss three items continuing concern over his performance,specifically with respect to keeping attention through the process of the case concern as to his overall safe clinical in crises times and a request by a surgeon that he not pump cases independently because of lack of response to patient status at any given moment and concern of safe and timely perfusion intervention during crises situations.taylor urged him to consider other employment opportunities.they met again on april,when she agreed to place him for two weeks in a perfusion assistant position with fewer responsibilities and at a lower salary.at the conclusion of that period,they were to meet again to sign torres termination papers.although the parties describe the termination of his employment in different terms,the record contains an executed copy of his notice of resignation which cites plans for other job opportunities as the reason for torres resignation.
torres application for benefits 
five days before he resigned his employment torres filed a claim for disability benefits under the unum policy in it,he stated that he was unable to work at his present job because he could not hear the surgeon correctly when he was surrounded by white noise in the operating room.he listed two audiologists and his cardiologist,purdy,as having provided medical attention for his disabling condition.one of the audiologists and purdy each completed a physician statement in connection with his claim.the audiologist reported findings of severe high frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears,and noted that torres may find it difficult to hear with noise going on around him.he also indicated that torres had reached maximum medical improvement for his hearing condition.purdy listed restrictions against lifting,pushing,or pulling anything over fifty pounds and noted that torres is limited by fatigue,drowsiness,and blurred vision.
the unum policy defines disability 
you are disabled when unum determines that due to sickness or injury 
you are unable to perform with reasonable continuity and in the usual and customary manner the substantial and material acts of your occupation,business or profession and 
you have a or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury.
unum denied torres claim on august,after determining that he was not disabled and unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his occupation as a perfusionist.the record documents the information unum reviewed in considering torres claim and its handling of that information.
bob callahan is the unum employee who was in charge of torres claim.on june,he sought review of the claim by diane case,another unum employee whose title is not identified.three days later,she responded.she found it difficult to assess whether the medical information would qualify him as disabled.she agreed that the clinical data supported a significant diagnosis of hearing loss but felt that a physician should address the level of impairment as related to his occupation.finally,she noted that she had not been provided with torres cardiac records and suggested that the cardiac unit review those.she referred the case to an doctor,horne,for her opinion as to whether torres hearing loss appeared significant enough to support the limitations listed by the audiologist.
horne did not reply,but instead the file contains a response from joseph sentef of the family and occupational medicine unit.although he does not list the documents he reviewed,his recitation suggests that he read the audiologists reports and a memo concerning torres april meeting with his supervisor.on june,sentef wrote 
the claimant hearing problems occur at high frequencies with a noisy background.the claimant was given two hearing aids to improve his hearing in his job.i do not know if he works in the operating room with a noisy background.it would appear that in most operating rooms the noise level would be low.he also noted in the medical records,that he only wore one hearing aid so he could hear the surgeons.from that statement alone,it appears he is able to hear the surgeons by using only one hearing aid.this would point more towards a performance issue.if his problems had been secondary to hearing,he would have worn both hearing aids for maximum auditory effect.the claimant had worked with his hearing aids during the past year.the issue of decreased hearing had not come up from the hospital personnel over the past year span.it would appear that his termination from his job was more of a performance issue,based on objective findings in the medical records along with audiogram analysis.it would appear the hearing loss is not enough to warrant the restrictions and limitations.
sentef was not asked to and did not address torres cardiac condition.based only on sentef assessment,bob callahan recommended on july that torres claim be denied for lack of medical evidence supporting disability.in his recommendation,he repeated sentef speculation that torres terminated employment was a performance issue not related to his condition but rather other issues.an unidentified unum consultant wrote on the same sheet that unum should obtain torres cardiac records and have them reviewed by the cardiac unit,and also get an occupational analysis to compare his restrictions and limitations with the occupational requirements.unum then ordered torres records from purdy and from his hospitalization,and they asked purdy to complete a physical capacities form.purdy did not complete that form until several months later.
bob callahan apparently reviewed the cardiac records and once again recommended that benefits be denied.on july,he wrote based on additional cardiac records received reviewed it does appear condition precludes him from performing own occ.recommend denial based on medical does not support disability.in the same handwriting as appeared on callahan july recommendation of denial,an unidentified unum employee recommended that the claim be walked in to a cardiac physician to confirm if any cardiac restrictions and limitations are supported,and again recommended that they obtain an occupational analysis if torres was restricted to lifting no more than fifty pounds.that same day,a medical review form was completed by unum employee shirley yeager.yeager wrote the file documentation does not support restrictions and limitations from a cardiac standpoint.
curtis,a unum doctor who is a certified consultant in occupational medicine,also reviewed torres claim in a july report.he stated that his report was based on a brief,selective review of documentation that appears to be the most relevant to the issue of his functional abilities to perform his occupation.in less than a page,he summarized the unidentified documents and concluded that torres had not firmly established the medical necessity for his continuing absence from work.based on curtis report,callahan once again recommended denial of torres claim.a unum consultant agreed with the recommendation,and callahan sent the denial letter on august.unum denied the claim because it found there was no medical evidence to support purdy restrictions and limitations,and no physical limitations had been imposed as a result of his hearing loss except if there is a lot of noise around you.
torres appealed the denial and submitted additional medical support for his claim,including reports from an ent doctor and purdy,drug information sheets concerning the medications prescribed to treat his heart condition,a description of his working conditions in the heart surgery operating room,and a denial letter for health insurance based on his cardiac problems.unum received these items on october 
the appeal documents included purdy completed physical capacities form in which he noted that the medications may lower torres blood pressure and cause lightheadedness,fainting,and dizziness.in a separate letter,purdy also noted that torres had experienced episodic confusion and prolonged fatigue.carlson,the ent who first saw torres in,examined him again in august.he opined that torres could have significant problems hearing and understanding because of the noise levels in the operating room,and he thought it no longer reasonable for torres to work as a perfusionist.
on october,callahan asked shirley yeager to review purdy letter and physical capacities form and determine if his restrictions and limitations were supported.in notes dated october,she erroneously concluded that the symptoms,restrictions,and limitations purdy described in his september documents were new.because she believed they were new,she concluded that they were not supported.at the bottom of yeager notes,thomas hashaway wrote three sentences,the third of which concluded that there was no cardiovascular basis for impairment.he also directed callahan to yeager summary in a note on the bottom of callahan october review request.
on november,unum also requested that laird caruthers,an family practitioner,review the new medical records and offer his opinion on the claim from a general medical standpoint and specifically answer whether torres hearing loss would preclude him from remaining in his occupation.before caruthers conducted that review,torres submitted an evaluation conducted by a certified vocational evaluator at the department of veteran affairs who expressed her professional opinion that torres employment as a perfusionist could have significant liability consequences to him and his employer based on the knowledge of his inability to hear directions clearly according to research,it is impossible to filter out the background sounds as the machines,are required for life sustaining of the patient.she also noted that torres had been diagnosed with sleep apnea and concluded that this condition,along with his hearing loss,physical limitations,and the side effects of his medications suggested that he was unable to meet the demands of a perfusionist because of his significantly compromised abilities.she concluded the assessment part of her report by writing 
based on total assessment including review of medical information,job requirements,it is this counselor opinion that return to employment as a perfusionist is not feasible.the degree of hearing loss and the significant consequences of inaccurate of directions in the surgical setting could result in legal issues.torres also does not meet the physical requirements of the job based on the limitations as documented by physician.also of concern are the side effects of his medications as described previously.
unum never conducted an review of this vocational report.
on january,family practitioner caruthers conducted the final unum medical review that he had been asked to complete two months earlier.caruthers summarized the history of unum consideration of the claim but did not review any of torres medical records.he acknowledged the vocational report and described it as concluding that torres could not continue in his occupation because of his hearing problems.he wrote 
there are performance issues and conflicts with the employer as well as reference to a problem with alcohol use on the job and a reference to an unspecified legal problem.it might be useful to explore these issues further with claimant employer.claimant was fired then put in a claim for disability.there does not appear to be medical documentation to support a work capacity impairment.there is no evidence of any change in his condition to warrant a sudden declaration of disability,but i will defer comments about claimant ability to do his particular occupation to our vocational consultant.
caruthers entry is remarkable for the innuendo,misstatements,and unsupported conclusions it contains.this ultimate medical review in unum consideration of torres appeal contains at least four red flags.first,torres claim file contains no evidence of conflicts with his employer.caruthers statement is completely unsupported.second,his speculation about torres using alcohol while at work is also unsupported.alcohol is mentioned once in torres medical records,in the march,history and physical taken upon his hospital admission which states he has used alcohol in the past but stopped in july.when purdy sent copies of his medical records to unum,the documents included a may,personal letter he wrote to a judge in rapid city.the letter is a character reference for torres.it concludes with purdy stating that he knows torres feels deep regret and considerable embarrassment over an episode which resulted in charges concerning his alcohol use.purdy did not explain his statement,and his description of torres medical condition makes no mention of alcohol use.
once in unum file,purdy letter was flagged with an arrow and given great attention.curtis,the unum occupational medicine doctor,apparently used it as the basis for a comment in his july,review.he wrote incidentally,as a matter of interest,in view of information in the chart concerning problems torres faces related to alcohol abuse,one wonders whether that may have been an element in the development of cardiomyopathy per se a factor in his performance difficulties.the record contains no mention of alcohol abuse by torres,and unum did nothing to investigate any possible relationship between alcohol use and torres heart problems.in her october,records review,yeager repeats the statements concerning alcohol use from purdy letter.at the bottom of yeager notes,family practitioner hashaway wrote the improving ejection fraction suggests that the claimant had a reversible etiology for his congestive cardiomyopathy alcohol.again,unum did nothing to try to determine if there was any causal relationship between torres alcohol use and his cardiac problems.
the third red flag in caruthers review is the sequence and description of torres application for benefits and end of his employment.caruthers states claimant was fired then put in a claim for disability.the record shows that torres filed his claim with his employer as directed on april.once the administrator received supporting documents such as torres release of records form,physicians statements,and the employer statement,it forwarded the entire package to unum.unum originally recorded torres date of disability as april,but,after learning that his employment continued until the end of the month,unum changed torres date of disability to may.moreover,unum received copies of torres notice of resignation and the hospital form acknowledging that act.there is no employment record in the file that suggests torres was fired.
the final problem area in caruthers summary concerns torres vocational prospects.in spite of caruthers inconclusiveness,unum did not refer torres appeal to its vocational consultant.unum conducted no review of torres vocational report.
following the caruthers report,unum did not seek any further medical evidence concerning torres cardiac problems.unum conducted one last inquiry concerning torres performance in a february,telephone call to the hospital human resources department.a handwritten note in the file reports that the hospital employee stated off the record there may have been a mental issue,and that torres blamed his performance on health issues but not on hearing problems.that is the extent of unum inquiry into torres job performance throughout their consideration of his claim and appeal.
that same day,unum sent torres a letter denying his appeal.the letter was devoted primarily to repeating unum handling of the claim,but its description of the review unum conducted when torres appealed the denial of benefits is inaccurate.the letter recited that unum received the new medical and drug information torres submitted on october as part of his appeal and that it was reviewed in conjunction with his entire claim file by a board certified on october.that was the review by hashaway.he did not review any of the new information,however,as unum did not begin processing the new documents until october.
unum denial letter continued with an excerpt from caruthers january medical review and concluded by informing torres that he did not meet the definition of disability because restrictions and limitations are not supported to the degree to preclude performing in his occupation.in addition,unum informed torres that he was not a covered employee and was thus ineligible for disability benefits because he had been fired and no restrictions and limitations were supported as of that date.
unum denial of torres appeal marked the end of his administrative review.torres filed this action two months later.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment while viewing the record in the light most favorable to torres.we also review de novo the district court determination of the appropriate standard of review of the administrator denial of benefits.barnhart unum life ins.of,cir.
the district court reviewed unum decision under the abuse of discretion standard that applies when the plan at issue allows the administrator the discretionary authority to determine a claimant eligibility for benefits.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.torres concedes that the unum plan grants such authority but argues that a less deferential standard is appropriate under woo deluxe,cir,because he presented evidence demonstrating that a palpable conflict of interest and a serious procedural irregularity existed which caused unum to deny torres benefits.the conflict of interest he asserts is a financial one because unum administers and funds the disability plan in which torres was enrolled.the procedural irregularity he alleges is unum failure to exercise proper judgment in its deliberations as demonstrated by the shortcomings in its medical and vocational review.
unum admits that it serves as both insurer and administrator of the disability plan at issue.we have held this to be palpable evidence of a conflict of interest.farfalla mut.of omaha ins,cir unum life ins.of,cir schatz mut.of omaha ins,cir.but see mcgarrah hartford life ins,cir wrong to assume financial conflict of interest from fact that plan administrator is also insurer.
torres also alleges substantial procedural irregularities in unum consideration of torres claim.torres points to several inadequacies unum sought no independent medical review,did not consider torres earlier suspension for hearing loss,did not evaluate the side effects of his heart medications,did not have a review performed by a vocational consultant,and provided no theory for why torres suddenly became unable to perform his job other than an alcohol abuse theory unsupported by the record.unum asserts that it conducted a complete and appropriate medical review and denies that its decision had anything to do with alcohol use 
the unum plan imposed no obligation on the administrator to obtain an independent medical review and case law contains no such absolute requirement.torres earlier suspension for hearing loss may have been of interest,but the medical issues underlying the suspension are the only relevant facts.unum was not required to articulate a theory for torres inability to perform his job,but rather was to consider the evidence torres submitted to determine whether it proved him disabled.
unum failure to acknowledge the side effects of the prescription drugs torres was taking for his cardiac condition and failure to obtain a vocational evaluation are significant omissions.as torres explained,his ejection fraction had improved because he was taking the medications,but the price he paid for improved heart function was that he suffered side effects including dizziness,fatigue,and lightheadedness.caruthers specifically excluded the drug information sheets from his january,medical review because he believed hashaway unum cardiologist had already discussed them.hashaway made his review of torres medical records without having seen the drug information sheets.because the side effects of necessary medication caused many of the problems that kept torres from being able to perform the job of perfusionist,unum had an obligation to address those effects.
likewise,as its employees noted on at least three occasions throughout the review process,including a comment by caruthers in unum final medical review,unum could not evaluate torres ability to perform his occupation without the opinion of a vocational consultant.unum offers no reason for its failure to obtain such an evaluation or to respond in any way to the comprehensive vocational evaluation torres submitted.
unum policy defines disability in relation to a participant ability to perform with reasonable continuity and in the usual and customary manner the substantial and material acts of the participant occupation.unum did nothing to determine the substantial and material acts of the occupation of perfusion,particularly with regard to the noise level attendant to the kind of surgical rooms in which perfusionists work.unum failure to consider the effects of torres medication and to assess his ability to
