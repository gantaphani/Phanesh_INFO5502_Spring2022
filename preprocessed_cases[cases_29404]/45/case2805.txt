defendant century surety company appeals from the judgment awarding plaintiff travelers casualty and surety company entered after the trial court granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment.code civ.the issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred by finding defendant insurer had a duty to contribute on a pro rata basis to the litigation and indemnification expenses incurred by plaintiff insurer in defending a common insured sued in a construction defect lawsuit.we conclude the trial court properly so held and affirm the judgment.
between july and,plaintiff issued commercial general liability insurance policies covering standard wood structures,standard,a framing contractor.the policies contained a provision declaring that,if any other insurance is also primary,plaintiff will share with all that other insurance,either in equal shares where all of the other insurance permits,or otherwise based on the ratio of each insurer applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

discussion 
this case involves an action for declaratory relief and contribution between two insurers who provided primary insurance coverage to a common insured,standard.we must decide whether the trial court correctly found defendant obligated to contribute,on a pro rata basis,to the defense and indemnification costs plaintiff incurred on standard behalf even though defendant policy declared it would be excess to other valid and collectible insurance.as defendant recognizes,we independently review the trial court decision.guz bechtel national,cal th,d.
both parties policies provided standard with coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence during the period of time each policy was in effect,including the type of loss alleged in the canyon estates lawsuit,that standard defective work caused continuous injury.montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d.plaintiff provided liability insurance coverage to standard between and,while defendant covered it for a period starting in september.furthermore,during the time each party policy was in effect,standard had no other liability insurance.
defendant argues that where two insurance policies provide coverage for the same risk and one has a standard pro rata other insurance clause and the other has an excess other insurance clause,the contract language of both policies should be enforced and the second policy will be deemed excess to the policy with the pro rata provision.since plaintiff policy contained a pro rata other insurance clause,defendant asserts plaintiff needed to exhaust the limits of its policy in defending and indemnifying standard before defendant duty to do so arose.because plaintiff did not exhaust its policy limits,defendant continues,the trial court erred in finding defendant obligated to contribute to the defense and indemnification costs incurred.but the law in california is to the contrary.
while generally,an insurer coverage terms will be honored if possible,there are exceptions to this rule.century surety united pacific ins.th,d fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.one exception arises where the policies of two or more insurers of a common insured,providing primary coverage for the same risk,contain conflicting other insurance clauses.in this circumstance,if one insurer pays more than its share of the loss or defense costs without participation from the other insurer or insurers,a right to contribution arises.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.ibid.
fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th,d,dealt with an analogous situation.in that case,the parties issued annual liability insurance policies to a building contractor,with maryland casualty policies covering it from through,while fireman fund policies covered it from to.all of the policies,except the last four issued by fireman fund,contained pro rata other insurance clauses.fireman fund final four policies contained excess other insurance provisions.in a construction defects action alleging continuous injury that commenced in,fireman fund alone defended the insured and paid the settlement on its behalf.fireman fund successfully sought contribution from maryland casualty,with the trial court allocating the defense and indemnification costs between the parties using the time on the risk method.but the court rejected fireman fund claim its last four policies should be disregarded because of their different other insurance clauses.
the court of appeal affirmed,noting,in cases of conflict between liability insurance policies stating coverage is excess over all other available insurance and liability insurance policies providing for pro rata contribution,the policies must contribute pro rata to the coverage afforded by the polic i es.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d.it justified the exception,citing a variety of public policy considerations.provisions in otherwise primary liability insurance policies have been analogized to escape clauses whereby coverage purports to disappear in the presence of other insurance.such escape clauses are generally disfavored as a matter of public policy.citations.in cases of mutually irreconcilable excess other insurance provisions,the law generally favors proration among carriers.citations.several courts have noted that imposing the entire liability for a loss on the insurer with a policy providing for pro rata coverage would annul that policy language,and create the anomaly that courts will only predictably enforce proration between policies when they all have conflicting excess other insurance language barring proration.citations.giving excess other insurance clauses priority over policies providing for pro rata apportionment of liability among policies is completely unrelated to the original historical purpose of such other insurance clauses,which was to prevent multiple recoveries by insureds in cases of overlapping insurance policies providing coverage for the same loss.for these reasons,among others,t he general rule,when multiple policies share the same risk but have inconsistent other insurance clauses,is to prorate according to the policy limits.citation.id.at,d,fn.omitted see also cse ins.group northbrook property casualty th,d.
