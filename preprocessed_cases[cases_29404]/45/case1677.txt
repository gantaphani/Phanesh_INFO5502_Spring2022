barbara jones appeals from the judgment of the district upholding the decision of the commissioner of the social security administration ssa which denied her deceased husband application for disability insurance benefits and supplementary security income benefits.we affirm.
david morris,now deceased,was born in.he had a tenth grade education and worked in various and unskilled jobs.on november,he applied for disability insurance benefits and supplementary security income under titles ii and xvi of the social security act the act.morris complained that he had been unable to work since february,due to symptoms related to heart problems,including shortness of breath,dizziness,chest pains,and a reduced capacity for aerobic activity.he also reported leg pain and impairment,headaches,back pain,lightheadedness or fainting,and blurred vision.
morris went to the truman medical tmc several times and was treated and discharged each time,except in february when he was admitted for hospitalization.during the course of this hospitalization morris was examined by cardiologists.he was discharged on march,with a final diagnosis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy,congestive heart failure,left ventricle thrombus,hypertension,possible pneumonia,alcohol abuse,and alcohol withdrawal.morris was prescribed medication and seen and treated regularly by tmc physicians through the hospital various outpatient clinics.he missed two clinic appointments in june and july.
morris continued to work after the onset of his symptoms.he was laid off from his job as a dish washer at a casino in february,but managed to find various general labor jobs through an employment agency.in august,he began working temporarily as a rotary machine operator,but was not hired for a permanent job at the end of a day probationary period because he was unable to pass the required physical exam.
after his claim was denied initially and on reconsideration,morris requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.a full hearing was held on august,at which morris appeared and testified he was represented by an advocate who was not an attorney.morris did not submit any report from his physicians discussing how his physical condition could be expected to impact his functional abilities,but he testified that his physicians had limited his activities to lifting no more than ten pounds.the commissioner submitted a residual functional capacity assessment prepared by physicians in the state disability determination section who had reviewed morris medical records.they concluded that he was able to lift twenty pounds occasionally,but no more than ten pounds frequently that he could stand walk up to six hours in an eight hour workday that he could sit with normal breaks for about six hours that his ability to push and pull was not limited that he had no manipulative,visual,or communication limitations and that he had some postural and environmental limitations.in addition,a vocational expert testified as to morris employment opportunities and capabilities.
the alj denied morris application,finding that he was not disabled within the meaning of the act.in reaching this decision,the alj employed the five step sequential analysis prescribed by ssa regulations,see,see also bowen yuckert,d describing the five step process.in step one the alj determined that morris met the disability insured status requirement and had not been engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset of his condition.he found at step two that morris had a severe impairment of cardiomyopathy,but that it did not meet or equal one of the impairments listed in the regulations as being so severe as to require an immediate finding of disability step three,see pt,subpt.p,app.listing such impairments.the alj assessed morris residual functional capacity rfc and determined that it showed that he could no longer perform his past relevant work step four,but that there were jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that morris had the ability to perform step five.
the alj conclusion in step five was based on the testimony of the vocational expert who had been asked in a hypothetical question whether jobs were available for an individual of morris age,education,and vocational profile who suffered from the same symptoms and limitations as he.the expert responded that there were a significant number of such jobs available in the economy which morris could perform.the alj concluded that morris was not disabled under the act and denied his application.
before dying from his heart condition,morris asked the appeals council to review the decision,and his wife,barbara jones,was later substituted as named plaintiff.the appeals council denied the request for review.the alj decision thus became the final decision of the commissioner.jones then brought this action in the district court pursuant to g and c,and the district court decided in favor of the commissioner.jones appealed.
jones argues on appeal that the alj erred in concluding that morris had not been disabled.she contends that morris condition met or equaled a listed impairment,that the alj violated ssa ruling by not providing for a further medical examination of morris,that the alj incorrectly relied on the vocational expert to determine that there were a significant number of jobs available to morris in the economy,and that the alj improperly relied on rule of the guidelines,pt,subpt.p,app,to determine that morris was not disabled.she also contends that the supreme court decision in barnhart walton,d,shows that a claimant who has an impairment expected to result in death need not demonstrate an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity to be considered disabled under the act.
we review de novo a district court decision affirming the denial of social security benefits.see lowe apfel,cir.in conducting this review,we must determine whether the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.davis apfel,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.mckinney apfel,cir.to determine whether the evidence is substantial,we consider evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision as well as evidence that supports it.id.we are not permitted to reverse merely because substantial evidence also exists that would support a contrary outcome,or because we would have decided the case differently.davis,at.
jones first contends that her husband condition met or equaled the listing for cardiomyopathy in of the listings,when evaluated under,see pt,subpt,app.the alj concluded that morris case did not fall within the listed cardiac impairments partly because the listings require that the debilitating symptoms occur while on a regimen of prescribed treatment and be evidenced by certain types of medical tests,such as an exercise test.id.the conclusion that the symptoms did not occur while on a regimen of prescribed treatment is supported by the evidence that his condition improved after morris received treatment in march.for example,on april,morris reported to his doctors that he was doing fine in terms of shortness of breath and chest pain,and on august,he denied experiencing any chest pain,shortness of breath,or palpitations.in addition,jones has not contended that morris underwent the type of tests required to meet the cardiac listings.moreover,the record shows that a consulting doctor from the missouri agency responsible for disability determinations concluded that morris condition did not meet any cardiac listing and was not the equivalent of a listed impairment the determination by a physician from such a state agency is to be treated by an alj as expert opinion evidence and given appropriate weight.ssr,supplementary pamphlet soc.security reporting service rulings west at,july.although jones has pointed out that the record indicates that morris was taking multiple heart medications and suffered from symptoms associated with heart disease,she has not directed our attention to any medical opinion that states that morris condition met or equ
