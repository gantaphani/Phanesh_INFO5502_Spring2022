the statute code of civil procedure section section,authorizes a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b section b creates an exception to the statute for any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if three conditions set forth in the statute are met.such a public interest lawsuit is not subject to a special motion to strike under section.
a qui tam is one brought under a statute that allows a private person to sue as a private attorney general to recover damages or penalties,all or part of which will be paid to the government.people ex rel.allstate ins.weitzman th,d weitzman.under california law,a qui tam action is brought on behalf of the people of the state of california,and the people are t he real party in interest.see also ex rel.killingsworth northrop cir.
in this case,we conclude the qui tam action brought by michael strathmann as relator on behalf of the general public under insurance code section falls within the public interest exception of section b.the trial court erred by finding otherwise and should have denied the special motion to strike brought by defendants acacia research corporation acacia,combimatrix corporation combimatrix,and amit kumar collectively,defendants.we therefore reverse the order granting defendants special motion to strike,reverse the order and judgment awarding defendants attorney fees and costs,and remand.
allegations of the complaint 
strathmann qui tam complaint against acacia,combimatrix,and kumar alleged the following facts.
theft of technology developed at nanogen.
acacia,a publicly owned delaware corporation,formed combimatrix in as a subsidiary.in,combimatrix separated from acacia and became a publicly traded company.kumar joined acacia as a in and the next year became the chief executive officer of combimatrix,a position he held until the end of june.
in,donald montgomery went to work for nanogen,nanogen,a biotechnology company in san diego.montgomery signed an agreement with nanogen,which provided that any invention conceived by montgomery while at nanogen belonged to it.while employed by nanogen,montgomery invented a unique biotechnology process by which chemical compounds were made on an array of electrodes.montgomery disclosed his new invention to brooke anderson,one of acacia founders,and conspired with acacia to start a biotechnology company based upon the new invention.acacia made at least one payment to montgomery while he was employed by nanogen.
montgomery resigned from nanogen in august.in october,he and acacia founded a new company,combimatrix,to commercially exploit this stolen technology.montgomery continued to receive additional payments from acacia through anderson.
in november,montgomery sued nanogen over rights to the technology he developed at nanogen.in february,nanogen and montgomery settled the lawsuit.
in april,montgomery became a director of combimatrix and received shares of its stock.in july,he filed a provisional patent application covering combimatrix core technology.this patent application was based upon the invention that montgomery had conceived while at nanogen.
nanogen lawsuit against combimatrix and montgomery 
in november,nanogen filed a lawsuit alleging combimatrix and montgomery had stolen technology owned by nanogen.in december,acacia and combimatrix notified national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,national union of the nanogen lawsuit,and made a claim under acacia directors,officers and corporate liability policy the policy issued by national union.the policy required national union to reimburse certain defense costs over a retention.national union acknowledged receipt of the claim and sent a letter to combimatrix,addressing policy issues and requesting more information.
when nanogen filed its lawsuit,combimatrix was in the early stages of negotiating a transaction to customize and license its technology to roche applied science roche.roche was concerned about the nanogen lawsuit and throughout expressed concern whether combimatrix had clear title to the technology.
in april and september,combimatrix requested that national union reimburse legal expenses incurred in the nanogen lawsuit.national union did not respond in writing to either request.
several weeks into the litigation,combimatrix began to look for ways to settle with nanogen.combimatrix wanted to settle the lawsuit because montgomery had stolen the technology from nanogen,its lawsuit was an impediment to combimatrix going public,and roche wanted combimatrix to secure clear title to the technology before providing it with additional funding.combimatrix efforts to settle the nanogen lawsuit was not related to any alleged failure of national union to reimburse legal expenses,and combimatrix march revised financial forecast made no mention of any cash shortage caused by that lawsuit.
roche required the effective date of its agreement with combimatrix be the date that combimatrix settled the nanogen litigation.a draft partnership document required that combimatrix obtain a settlement with nanogen,by which nanogen would confirm combimatrix sole ownership of some disputed patents.
in july,while preparing for production of documents to nanogen,combimatrix attorneys discovered the check written by acacia to montgomery while he was employed by nanogen.kumar later described this check as a smoking gun.
settlement of the nanogen lawsuit 
on august,combimatrix reached agreement in principle to settle with nanogen.as of that date,combimatrix had not communicated with national union for over a year.a new claims representative at national union sent a letter to combimatrix,asking about the status of the nanogen lawsuit.combimatrix did not respond.
on september,combimatrix entered into a final written settlement agreement with nanogen.combimatrix agreed to pay nanogen cash,stock,and future royalties with a total value of million.on the same day,kumar informed roche executives that the nanogen lawsuit had been settled and the condition to the roche agreement was satisfied.
in late,strathmann,who was then an employee of combimatrix,asked kumar why the nanogen lawsuit had been settled for such a large percentage of combimatrix stock.kumar replied that montgomery had stolen the technology from nanogen a smoking gun document had been discovered by the lawyers and if the case did not settle,combimatrix would have had to turn the document over to nanogen.kumar said the document was a check written by acacia to montgomery while he was still employed at nanogen,and that it proved that acacia and montgomery had been working together before montgomery left nanogen.kumar also told strathmann the reason for the settlement was to satisfy roche.
defendants claims made to national union 
in november,defendants made a claim with national union for reimbursement of million in litigation expenses,a right to reimbursement for the full cost of the settlement of the nanogen lawsuit,and costs and attorney fees.the claim was fraudulent because defendants knew the technology at issue in the nanogen lawsuit was stolen from nanogen in,the policy provisions and exclusions did not provide coverage for a lawsuit based on a claim of stolen technology,and the policy provisions and exclusions did not provide coverage until montgomery became a director in april.
defendants falsely represented to national union that the reason combimatrix and montgomery had settled with nanogen was because national union had not reimbursed their legal bills and that,as a result,they were unable to continue to defend the nanogen claims.defendants failed to disclose to national union that combimatrix internal documents projected more than million cash on hand at the time of the settlement and that combimatrix had additional resources available to it from its parent company,acacia.
the bad faith lawsuit against national union 
in april,acacia and combimatrix filed a complaint against national union for breach of contract and bad faith the bad faith lawsuit,alleging,i n or around september,following abandonment by defendants,mounting legal fees,and the possibility that plaintiffs would face a lengthy trial without any coverage,plaintiffs were forced to settle the nanogen action at their own expense.
during the trial of the bad faith lawsuit,kumar testified the technology in dispute in the nanogen lawsuit was developed by montgomery while he was employed at combimatrix.richard harris,president of acacia,testified combimatrix settled the nanogen lawsuit out of economic necessity.
in february,the united states district court for the central district of california issued a ruling against national union and in favor of acacia and combimatrix.the court found there was coverage under the policy,none of the policy exclusions applied,the settlement with nanogen was involuntary and in response to defendant breach of its duties,and plaintiffs faced economic ruin and were forced to settle with nanogen.the court awarded actual damages of nearly million,prejudgment interest in the amount of about million,and the present value of future royalty payments,attorney fees,and costs awarded in the amount of about million.
national union appealed the judgment and afterwards brought a motion to revest jurisdiction in the trial court to entertain a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.in this motion,national union submitted documents showing that combimatrix had settled to satisfy roche,not out of economic necessity.
in response to national union motion,kumar submitted a deliberately false declaration to the court claiming that the roche transaction had nothing to do with the settlement with nanogen and that the settlement with nanogen was because combimatrix was in need of money due to its defense costs in the nanogen litigation,without reimbursement by national union.kumar failed to disclose the existence of documents in the combimatrix files,which stated the roche agreement was expressly contingent upon settlement of the nanogen case.
acacia and combimatrix,with the assistance of kumar,ultimately settled with national union for a single payment of million.defendants never revealed to national union any of the facts that would have defeated their claims for insurance benefits under the policy.
strathmann complaint concludes as a result of defendants false and fraudulent insurance claims made to national union,and false,misleading and incomplete statements and testimony in the united states district court for the central district of california in their subsequent suit for payment of their claim,defendants fraudulently obtained a judgment in the amount of.defendants never revealed the truth about their claims,and instead after trial settled their false claims with national union for a payment of to acacia and combimatrix.defendants conduct falls squarely within the policy underlying california insurance code,which is to more effectively investigate and discover insurance frauds and to halt fraudulent activities.enforcement of california insurance code in this case will further the policy goals set by the california legislature and will help protect the public from inflated insurance rates that result from insurance fraud.
procedural history 
defendants demurred to the complaint and filed a special motion to strike pursuant to the statute.strathmann filed opposition and,before the hearing on the special motion to strike and demurrer,filed a first amended complaint.
the trial court granted the special motion to strike.in its tentative ruling,later adopted as the final ruling,the court stated these reasons for granting the motion filing a lawsuit is an exercise of a party constitutional right to petition for grievances and falls under ccp b.plaintiff can not frustrate the purpose of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combin in g protected and unprotected activity in one cause of action.plaintiff can not rely on the exception in ccp,as plaintiff does meet the requirements of ccp b,as plaintiff would get relief greater than that of the general public,as plaintiff stands to get a large portion of any award under ins code g iii iv.the alleged fraudulent claims which are the basis of this action were already litigated in federal court.the court grants plaintiff request for judicial notice at ex findings of fact and conclusions of law following trial and ex judgment in federal court.plaintiff,and the state,are in privity with national union,as all of the alleged fraudulent claims here are derivative of the claims of national union.plaintiff also claims that certain issues were not litigated in the federal court action,but plaintiff can not split his cause of action.all issues related to the fraud claims were required to be litigated in the federal action.if it has been determined in a former action,it is binding notwithstanding the parties litigant sic may have omitted to urge for or against it matters which,if urged,would have produced an opposite result.plaintiff can not establish a probability of prevailing,as the statements made in the federal action are protected by the litigation privilege of civil code section b.because the basis of the ruling is the bar of collateral estoppel,the court does reach plaintiff evidence o r defendants evidence objections thereto.
the trial court deemed the demurrer to be moot and did not rule on it.the court struck strathmann first amended complaint on the ground plaintiff is not allowed to file an amended complaint while an motion is pending.salma ca.boldface omitted.
a formal order granting the special motion to strike was entered in may.strathmann appealed from that order,and his appeal was assigned docket no.the order granting the special motion to strike is appealable under section,subdivision i.
in july,defendants filed a motion to recover attorney fees in the amount of over,pursuant to section,subdivision c.strathmann opposed the motion and moved to tax costs.the trial court granted the motion and awarded defendants attorney fees and costs in the sum of.a minute order awarding defendants attorney fees and costs was entered on august,and a judgment awarding defendants attorney fees and costs was entered on september.strathmann appealed from both the minute order and the judgment,and those appeals were assigned docket nos.and.we granted motions to consolidate all three appeals.
discussion 
complaint is protected by the public interest exception to the anti slapp statute.

whether strathmann lawsuit falls within the public interest exception of section b is a threshold issue,and we address it prior to examining the applicability of section.navarro ihop properties,th,d.if strathmann lawsuit did come within section b,then defendants special motion to strike should have been denied without reaching the merits of the motion.
section b states section does not apply to any action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public if all of the following conditions exist the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.a claim for attorney fees,costs,or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public or a large class of persons.private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.
the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section in to curb the disturbing abuse of the statute to undermine the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,contrary to the purpose and intent of section,subd.a see club members for an honest election sierra club cal th,d,club members.according to the sponsor of code of civil procedure section,senator sheila kuehl,the same types of businesses who used the slapp action were inappropriately using the motion against their adversaries.hence,the legislature expressly designed subdivision b of section to prevent the use of the device against specified public interest actions,among others.assem.com.on judiciary,on bill reg.sess.as amended june.blanchard directv,th,d.

not all public interest or class actions are intended to be exempt from the law.blanchard directv,supra,th at,d.to be exempt,the action must be brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public and meet the three conditions set forth in section b.t he term public interest is used to define suits brought for the public good or on behalf of the public.club members,supra,cal th at,d.the term solely as used in section b expressly conveys the legislative intent that section b not apply to an action that seeks a more narrow advantage for a particular plaintiff.club members,supra,at,d.
to determine whether strathmann qui tam lawsuit met those definitions,we rely on the allegations of the complaint because the public interest exception is a threshold issue based on the nature of the allegations and scope of relief sought in the prayer see northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules associates th,d concluding action was brought solely in the public interest based on allegations of the complaint.we consider the allegations of strathmann complaint in light of insurance code section and the nature of a qui tam lawsuit,matters to which we first turn.

strathmann is an interested person bringing this action as a qui tam relator.a qui tam relator is essentially a private attorney general,and his recovery is analogous to a lawyer contingent fee.the relator has no personal stake in the damages sought all of which,by definition,were suffered by the government.ex rel.milam university of texas anderson cancer center cir.a qui tam action is a type of private attorney general lawsuit in re marriage of biddle th,d,in which the qui tam plaintiff stands in the shoes of the state or political subdivision wells learning foundation,supra,cal th at,d.a lthough qui tam actions allow individual citizens to initiate enforcement against wrongdoers who cause injury to the public at large,the government remains the real party in interest in any such action.minotti lensink cir.
section b was intended to exempt such private attorney general actions from the statute this public interest exception,supporters say,parallels the existing exception for actions by the attorney general and public prosecutors.just as actions by the attorney general are not now subject to the motion,actions by private attorneys general would not be subject to the procedure since the statute already exempts actions filed by public prosecutors,it should provide a parallel protection when people are acting only in the public interest as private attorneys general,and are not seeking any special relief for themselves.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.
as a qui tam plaintiff,strathmann is acting in the public interest as a private attorney general and should be accorded the parallel protection contemplated by the legislature.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended june.defendants argue strathmann is not pursuing this lawsuit solely for the public benefit because he seeks to personally recover at least but not greater than of the proceeds of this action,which could result in an award to strathmann of between million and million.but strathmann,as a qui tam plaintiff,brought this lawsuit on behalf of the general public b.the word solely in section b modifies the term in the public interest,not on behalf of the general public.that is,the phrase solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public does not mean solely on behalf of the general public.ibid.if it did,then section b would be unnecessary because a lawsuit brought solely on behalf of the general public would not,by definition,include any individual claim for relief.a claim brought on behalf of the general public might include some kind of individual relief,in which case,it would have to be determined under section b whether that relief is greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public.
strathmann does not seek personal relief within the meaning of section b rather,he sought recovery of the bounty,to which he might be entitled under insurance code section,subdivision g a.the driving force behind the false claims concept is the providing of incentives for individual citizens to come forward with information uniquely in their possession and to thus aid the government in ferreting out fraud.state ex rel.harris pricewaterhousecoopers,llp cal th,d.the bounty advances the public purpose and benefit by encouraging private qui tam actions i ndeed,this prospect of reward may be the only means of inducing such private parties to come forward with their information.ibid.
