orthopedic surgeon george schoedinger and his employer,signature health services,collectively,plaintiffs,commenced this action for damages and equitable relief,alleging that united healthcare of the midwest,united,wrongfully denied or reduced health care insurance claims.united removed the action because of those claims were submitted under employee welfare benefit plans governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et.plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint asserting,as relevant here,state law claims for breach of contract and for violations of the missouri prompt payment act.mppa,and federal claims under erisa and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c.
prior to trial,united paid the unpaid principal amount of most of the claims.the evidence at the bench trial established that united computerized claims processing system committed hundreds of errors that resulted in improper denial,reduction,or delayed payment of claims for schoedinger health care services.the errors included continuing to apply discounts after schoedinger terminated his provider agreement inappropriate grouping or bundling of distinct medical procedures improper downcoding basing payment on a less expensive procedure and requesting unnecessary information before processing claims.the result,signature witnesses testified,was that united was consistently to delinquent in paying claims,and signature incurred the expense of a claims department to ferret out and correct repeated errors that united refused to correct.after trial,the district court awarded plaintiffs an additional in principal on the erisa claims,in interest on the six claims,and in interest,attorneys fees,and costs.this award is not challenged on appeal.the court also dismissed the rico claim at the close of plaintiffs case,and ruled at the close of all the evidence that united breached no independent contract governing the erisa claims,that erisa preempts claims for additional penalties under the mppa,and that plaintiffs are not entitled to broad injunctive relief.plaintiffs appeal these rulings.we affirm.
i.the breach of contract issue 
schoedinger is one of more than fifty physicians employed by signature,one of the largest health care provider organizations in the louis metropolitan area.united is a health care insurer and claims administrator.each year,signature submits thousands of claims to united for treatment provided to patients covered by a health care plan administered by united.before a patient covered by a united plan is treated by schoedinger or another signature physician,the patient signs an assignment of plan benefits form that signature later submits to united with its claim for payment.
united claim submission procedures are described on its website and in an administrative guide distributed to providers.like most plan administrators,united maintains a network of participating providers who agree by written contract to accept,as full payment for services provided to patients covered by a united plan,an agreed amount that is typically lower than the billed charges.schoedinger terminated his agreement with united effective april.the claims at issue in this case were for patient treatment after that date,when schoedinger was an provider.most signature physicians remained in united provider network.united claim procedures appear to be the same for and providers.
at trial,united conceded that the patients assignments of plan benefits provided a contractual basis for the erisa and claims at issue.but plaintiffs argued that the claims procedures published by united on its website,in the administrative guide,and in insurance cards distributed to plan participants constituted an offer of an independent contract in which united promised to properly and promptly compensate schoedinger every time he treated a united plan member.finding no missouri law addressing the issue in this context,the district court logically looked to missouri cases determining whether an employee handbook created a contract between employer and employee.see johnson mcdonnell douglas,banc.the court found that none of united documents contain language which could be interpreted as a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain.thus,there was no offer and no contract.
after careful review of the record,we conclude that the court findings of no offer and no contract are not clearly erroneous.see kansas city power light burlington,cir standard of review.at trial,schoedinger testified that he had contracts with patients,not with united.united website explains how to verify a patient eligibility and submit health care claims,provides tips for faster claims processing,and describes how health care coverage decisions are made.a provider using the website who wishes to review united reimbursement policy is first brought to a webpage entitled reimbursement policy agreement which states that the policy is intended to serve only as a general reference resource,and that united may modify this reimbursement policy from time to time.the viewer must click,i agree,to then review detailed policies regarding matters such as services and multiple procedure reductions.though more detailed than the website,we agree with the district court that united administrative guide is an instruction manual,not a contract offer.the insurance cards united provides to plan beneficiaries expressly state,this card does not prove membership nor guarantee coverage.
ii.the mppa preemption issue 
the missouri prompt payment act imposes statutory penalties on a health carrier that fails to pay,deny or suspend a claim within forty days,and interest of one percent per month if the health carrier has not paid the claimant on or before the day.the district court awarded plaintiffs interest for united violations of these mppa provisions in processing the six claims.however,the court denied mppa relief on the erisa claims,concluding that these mppa remedies are preempted by erisa.plaintiffs appeal that ruling,which we review de novo.painter golden rule ins,cir,cert.denied,d.
erisa preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions or frustrate its objectives.boggs boggs,d.the supreme court has repeatedly held that any cause of action that duplicates,supplements,or supplants the erisa civil enforcement remedy conflicts with the clear congressional intent to make the erisa remedy exclusive and is therefore.aetna health davila,d see pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.in in re life ins.of,cir,we held that erisa preempts claims for penalties under the missouri vexatious refusal to pay statute,explaining that pilot life could not have stated with any greater clarity that the remedies afforded under erisa are exclusive,and no state law purporting to supply additional remedies will escape the preemptive effect of a.we have consistently applied this principle.see werdehausen benicorp ins,cir any state law remedy is preempted by erisa comprehensive remedial scheme emphasis omitted.
plaintiffs argue that a state law obligating an erisa plan administrator to promptly pay health care providers is not preempted because its impact on the plan is too remote.plaintiffs rely on the decision in baylor.med.ctr.blue cross blue shield,d,that the texas prompt pay law was not completely preempted by erisa.we are not persuaded.unlike the texas statutes at issue in baylor,the mppa regulates health carrier payments to claimants,who are broadly defined to include erisa participants and beneficiaries.moreover,the state law claim in baylor was based on a provider agreement,whereas schoedinger erisa claims are based on patients assignments of plan benefits.thus,the impact of the mppa on plan administration is not remote.indeed,even if a provider asserts a contract right independent of his right under the patient assignment of plan benefits,the impact of additional state law remedies on erisa plan administration may require preemption of a state law claim based on that contract.in home health,prudential ins.of,cir.blue cross blue shield mary,cir.finally,the baylor court analysis of complete preemption seems inconsistent with the supreme court later decision
