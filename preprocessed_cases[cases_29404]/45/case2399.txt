american way cellular,american way,appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of travelers property casualty company of america travelers.american way filed suit against travelers,alleging that american way was entitled to policy benefits following a fire loss at its place of business located in van nuys,california the premises.the court determined that travelers had no obligation to pay benefits to american way,holding that an e ndorsement contained in the policy issued by travelers requires as a condition of insurance that the insured premises contain automatic sprinklers and it was undisputed that the premises did not have an automatic sprinkler system.the court found in favor of travelers on its for declaratory relief and reimbursement of a good faith advance payment against american way.
american way contends that the judgment must be reversed because triable issues of material fact exist with respect to its causes of action for negligence and declaratory relief,including whether a j financial insurance services a j,the insurance broker that prepared the insurance application for american way indicating the premises were equipped with sprinklers,was an actual or ostensible agent of travelers.american way also argues that it was entitled to coverage because the provisions requiring american way to maintain the protective devices or services listed can not require american way to maintain something that does not exist.we conclude that because the evidence showed as a matter of law that a j was not an actual or ostensible agent of travelers and the evidence showed that american way did not maintain a sprinkler system as required under the policy,american way failed to meet its burden of showing that triable issues of material fact exist with respect to its claims for declaratory relief and negligence.we affirm the judgment.

discussion 
standard of review 
the standard for deciding a summary judgment motion is,as is the standard of review on appeal.citation.a defendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of producing evidence showing that one or more elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.citations.the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to produce specific facts showing a triable issue as to the cause of action or the defense.citations.despite the shifting burdens of production,the defendant,as the moving party,always bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to whether summary judgment is warranted.citation.citation.on appeal,we review de novo an order granting summary judgment.citation.the trial court must grant a summary judgment motion when the evidence shows that there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citations.in making this determination,courts view the evidence,including all reasonable inferences supported by that evidence,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.citations.citation.hypertouch,valueclick,th,fn.omitted.
american way failed to meet its burden of showing that triable issues of material fact exist with respect to its claim for negligence 
american way contends that triable issues of material fact exist with respect to its claim for negligence,including whether a j was an actual or ostensible agent of travelers.we conclude that because the evidence showed as a matter of law that a j was not an actual or ostensible agent of travelers,the trial court properly determined that american way failed to meet its burden of showing that triable issues of material fact exist with respect to its claim for negligence.
american way alleged that travelers had a duty to conduct inspections of the premises,write the policy,insure the premises,and procure the policy requested by american way.it alleged that travelers knew of american way coverage requirements made affirmative representations to american way that it was adequately covered and knew that the premises did not contain a fire sprinkler system,but negligently wrote an insurance policy based upon its own independent inspections,which travelers now alleges provided no coverage to american way.
but an insurer does not have the duty to investigate the insured statements made in an insurance application and to verify the accuracy of the representations.mitchell united national ins.th.rather,it is the insured duty to divulge fully all he or she knows.ibid.and i nsurance companies and brokers have no affirmative duty to advise their insureds to procure particular or different kinds of coverage than they obtained.ray valley forge ins.th.further,the policy stated that travelers had the right to make inspections but was not obligated to do so.and the evidence showed that a j filled out the application based on information it received from american way,then submitted it to usasia.in turn,travelers relied on the representations in the application when it issued the policies.although american way argues on appeal that travelers negligently issued the policies knowing that the premises were not equipped with sprinklers,american way did not present admissible evidence that travelers made an independent investigation or otherwise knew that the premises were not equipped with sprinklers.rather,sheibani declared that he had never indicated or been asked if the premises were equipped with sprinklers and that a cursory inspection of the premises would have revealed the lack of sprinklers.and he testified in deposition that other than bills and the denial letter,he did not receive any correspondence from travelers and that no one from traveler called him or ever came out.
thus,in order to succeed on a theory of negligence against travelers,american way must show that a j,which wrote the application indicating that the premises were equipped with automatic sprinklers,acted negligently as the agent of travelers.an insurer,as a principal,may be vicariously liable for the torts of its agent if the insurer directed or authorized the agent to perform the tortious acts,or if it ratifies acts it did not originally authorize.citation.layered atop the relationship of the insurer to its agent is the insurer fiduciary duty to conduct itself with the utmost good faith for the benefit of its insured.citation.desai farmers ins.exchange th.statutorily,an agent is defined as one who is authorized,by and on behalf of an insurer,to transact all classes of insurance except for life insurance,while a broker is a person who,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transacts insurance other than life with,but not on behalf of,an insurer.krumme mercury ins.th.an insurance broker is one who acts as a middleman between the insured and the insurer,soliciting insurance from the public under no employment from any special company,and,upon securing an order,placing it with a company selected by the insured or with a company selected by himself or herself whereas an insurance agent is one who represents an insurer under an employment by it.a broker is,in essence,employed in each instance as a special agent for a single purpose,while the very definition of agent indicates an ongoing and continuous relationship b rokers and insureds are ordinarily involved in what can be viewed as a series of discrete transactions,while agents and insureds tend to be under some duty to each other during the entire length of the relationship.citations.id.at.
an individual can not act as an insurance agent in california without a valid license issued by the commissioner of insurance.in addition to possessing a license,an insurance agent must be authorized by an insurance carrier to transact insurance business on the carrier behalf.this authorization must be evidenced by a notice of agency appointment on file with the department of insurance,subd.a.citation.unlike an agent,a broker does not act for the insurer,and the insurer is not liable for the broker acts or omissions.krumme mercury ins,supra,th at rios scottsdale ins.th,insurance broker has no binding authority and is as a matter of law not a general agent for the insurer.
american way attempt to raise a triable issue of fact on the basis of agency fails.travelers produced evidence that a j was an insurance broker and not an agent of travelers.in its response to a request for admissions,a j admitted under oath that it was not acting as travelers agent when it procured insurance for american way and that it acted as an insurance broker for american way in procuring insurance for the premises.further,the broker agreement between a j and usasia stated that a j was a representative of american way and was not acting as the agent or representative of usasia or its insurance companies.and derakhshanfar testified in deposition that a j only represent ed the insured that a j had never represented or been an agent of travelers that a j had never represented to anyone that it was an agent of travelers and that in obtaining com
