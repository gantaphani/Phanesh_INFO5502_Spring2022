state farm lloyds appeals from a judgment of million in punitive damages entered against it on a verdict by a mississippi jury on the bad faith insurance claim of plaintiffs george and linda sobley.we conclude that the punitive damages issue should not have been submitted to the jury on remand from this court in the appeal from the first trial in this case,sobley southern natural gas sobley i we therefore reverse and render in favor of state farm.
relying on our description of the factual background in sobley i,we recapitulate.
the sobleys built their house in columbus,mississippi in and purchased homeowner insurance from state farm lloyds state farm.in the fall of,george sobley noticed that the ground around his pumphouse was saturated with water.his plumber found small holes in the pipe running in that area.it was repaired only to reoccur in pipes located several feet away.george sobley sent a section of damaged pipe to the manufacturer for analysis,learning that the holes were caused by electrolysis,an electrical current running through the pipe.it was later determined that facilities belonging to southern natural gas company sonat were responsible for the charge on the pipes and the resulting electrolysis.
when the sobleys first discovered water leaking into their house is disputed.state farm contends that george sobley testified in a deposition early in this case that water entered his house in.the sobleys allege that they first discovered water problems in their house one morning in,when they found water seeping from the walls,through the tile,and in their carpet in several locations throughout the house.the sobleys immediately attempted to clean up the water with rags,mops,and a shop vacuum.george sobley found that water was leaking into the house at each place where the plumbing pipes came through the slab.he then shut off the main water source and the damaged plumbing,completing the task in may.
during that process,the sobleys continued to live in the house and turned on the water for brief periods of time to shower.the sobleys acknowledge that some water leaked into the house each time they turned the water on but contend that this water never soaked the house as badly as had the initial leakage and that they contained any damage resulting from their daily water use by immediately cleaning up any leakage.
the parties also dispute when the sobleys first contacted state farm,with the sobleys insisting on january and state farm insisting on march,as the date of first contact.it is undisputed that pat dillard,a state farm claims adjuster,first spoke with linda sobley in april and arranged to visit the house on april.
dillard inspected the sobleys house on april,where,according to her own notes,she witnessed damage to the sobleys carpet and tile which she photographed.linda sobley told dillard that their pipes had been damaged by electrolysis.the parties disagree as to whether dillard ever mentioned the policy water exclusion to the sobleys at any time in april.it is undisputed that an april,letter from dillard to the sobleys explicitly cited the electrolysis exclusion in section of the policy as the basis for denying coverage for their claim that letter reads 
this letter will my inspection of your loss on april,and discussion regarding cause of loss being electrolysis.i have confirmed this cause of loss is excluded on page of your policy,exclusion.
should you find anything to the contrary or should you have any further questions,or if i can be of further assistance,please do not hesitate to call me.my number is listed below.based on the above,we are regretfully unable to provide any coverage for this loss.
attached to the letter was a copy of page of the sobleys homeowner policy.it is also undisputed that the sobleys did not contact state farm again after receiving this letter until some time in,when linda sobley contacted state farm to ask for copies of the pictures which dillard took at the house on april.
the sobleys filed suit against sonat in mississippi state court in october for negligence in causing damage through electrolysis to their house.in june,after sonat had removed the case,the sobleys amended their complaint to add state farm as a defendant,seeking coverage under their homeowner policy for the water damage to their house from their leaking water pipes state farm answered in july,raising numerous defenses and policy exclusions to coverage as affirmative defenses.state farm also against sonat for damages in the event that state farm was found to have insured losses caused by sonat negligence.all parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.
in march,the sobleys amended their complaint to add a claim for punitive damages against state farm based on bad faith denial of insurance coverage.after for summary judgment were denied,the case proceeded to a conference in early january.
at the conference,the sobleys reached a settlement with sonat.sonat moved to dismiss the sobleys claim and state farm against it,representing that,a s a part of the settlement agreement,plaintiffs will not attempt to recover property damage claims against state farm lloyds,but will litigate only whether plaintiffs are entitled to extra contractual damages,attorney fees,court costs and punitive damages and so the settlement will render moot the of state farm lloyds against sonat.the trial court granted the motion,concluding that,pursuant to the settlement agreement,all of plaintiffs claims for property damages are satisfied and extinguished and the sobleys claim and state farm against sonat are moot as a result of this settlement.
state farm took the position,however,that it did not waive any claims,or positions as a result of the agreement between the sobleys and sonat.state farm also moved to dismiss the sobleys claim for or punitive damages against it on the ground that there was no subject matter jurisdiction over the claim where the order of dismissal provided that the settlement agreement had extinguished all of the sobleys claims for property damages under their homeowner policy,but this motion was denied 
the case proceeded to trial before a jury in late january.at the first trial,the trial court first allowed the sobleys to present evidence only on the issue of coverage for their claim under their policy and deferred the issues relating to punitive or damages to a later phase of the trial.following the sobleys,however,the trial court ruled from the bench that the sobleys had created a jury issue as to coverage but that he was jumping over to make a determination of whether or not the jury,based upon the facts that have been before the court and the facts that the court is aware of is it sufficient to put forth a bad faith claim was there an arguable basis for denial,and ruled that state farm did have such an arguable basis.the trial court therefore issued a directed verdict in favor of state farm and entered a judgment dismissing the sobleys case against state farm.
on appeal,this court reversed and remanded.we held that,u nder mississippi law,a finding of coverage is a necessary predicate to bringing a punitive damages claim,and,o nce coverage is established,the issue of punitive damages should be submitted to the jury if the trial court determines that there are jury issues with regard to whether the insurer lacked an arguable or legitimate basis for denying the claims,and the insurer committed a wilful or malicious wrong,or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the insured rights.we noted that,in the instant case,the trial court determined that there was a jury issue as to coverage and this finding has not been appealed.we further held that,once coverage is established,a court should evaluate whether there was an arguable basis for denial of coverage based solely on the reasons for denial of coverage given to the insured by the insurance company,such that,in this case,the trial court should determine whether there is a jury question regarding arguable basis solely with respect to the reasons state farm gave to the sobleys for denying the claim.
we reversed because,in determining that the water exclusion provided an arguable basis for denying the sobleys claim,the trial judge did not make a factual finding as to whether the water exclusion was presented to the sobleys as a reason for denying coverage,and so this court can not tell whether it was an error under mississippi law to consider whether that exclusion provided state farm with an arguable basis for denying coverage.as such,we held that,o n remand,the trial court should reconsider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the arguable basis issue solely with reference to the reasons that state farm actually gave to the sobleys.
we further instructed that,i f a jury question on arguable basis is found,the trial court must consider whether there is a jury question on the second prong of the punitive damage analysis,namely,whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the insured rights.thereafter,i f there is a jury question regarding wilful conduct or reckless disregard,then the trial court is instructed to submit the coverage issue to the jury,and if coverage is found,to instruct the jury that in determining whether state farm had an arguable basis to deny coverage,it may not consider reasons not given to the insured nor evidence discovered after litigation began,but may only consider the facts known to state farm at the time of denial.
on remand,the trial court considered for judgment as a matter of law from the sobleys and state farm and denied them entirely,specifically noting that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the water exclusion was presented to the sobleys as a reason for denying coverage and whether that exclusion provided states farm with an arguable basis for denying coverage.the trial court later clarified that state farm motion was denied in all respects.
the case proceeded to trial in january.following the trial court denial of motions for judgment as a matter of law by state farm at the close of the sobleys and the close of the evidence,the trial court,through special interrogatories,submitted to the jury the issues of coverage,arguable basis,and whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights,but did not submit at that time the question of the appropriate amount of any contractual damages or punitive damages.the jury returned findings in favor of the sobleys on each of the interrogatories.
after the parties stipulated to the amount of state farm net worth and were allowed to present additional closing arguments on the issue of the appropriate amount of contractual damages and punitive damages,the trial court submitted to the jury a verdict form asking the jury to find the appropriate amount of contractual damages and any punitive damages to be awarded to the sobleys.the jury returned a verdict for in contractual damages and million in punitive damages.
the trial court entered judgment on the award of the punitive damages only and later denied state farm motion for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,new trial or remittitur.the sobleys also moved to recover from state farm their attorneys fees and expenses,which the trial court awarded in the amount of.
state farm appeals from the trial court judgment and the order awarding the sobleys their attorneys fees and expenses.
state farm raises several challenges to the trial court decision to submit to the jury the issue of punitive damages for bad faith denial of the sobleys insurance claim.
state farm first argues that the trial court violated our remand instructions in sobley i by failing to consider on for judgment as a matter of law,based solely on the record from the first trial,whether there was sufficient evidence to create a jury issue on the issue of arguable basis and,if so,on the issue of whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the insured rights.according to state farm,the trial court denied the and proceeded to trial,thereby abdicating its responsibilities under our remand instructions because an appropriate review of the record as it then existed would have resulted in the conclusion that no jury question as to whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights was presented by the sobleys bad faith claim.
we review de novo whether the trial court faithfully and accurately applied our instructions on remand here,the trial court considered the on all issues on the sobleys bad faith claim and denied the motions in all respects,albeit without specific reasons as to the issue of whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights.
these rulings satisfy the requirements of our remand instructions we are without jurisdiction to conduct further inquiry into the correctness of the trial court denial of state farm motion,based on our rule that such interlocutory orders are not to be reviewed where final judgment adverse to the movant is rendered on the basis of a subsequent full trial on the merits.
state farm also argues that the trial court erred in allowing the sobleys to proceed to trial on remand on an amended bad faith claim based on state farm and litigation conduct,which state farm alleges was an expanded claim from the bad faith count alleged in the last amended complaint and order for the first trial.state farm asserts that the only bad faith claim properly before the trial court was a claim based solely on state farm actions in april in investigating and denying the sobleys claim for water damage to their carpet and tile and their damaged piping.as such,state farm contends that the trial court violated this court mandate to reconsider whether to grant judgment as a matter of law on the sobleys bad faith claim from the first trial and,further,that allowing the sobleys to add this new,expansive claim on the eve of the second trial violated the federal rules and state farm due process rights.
under the mandate rule,the trial court was without power to do anything contrary to the letter or spirit of our mandate construed in the light of our opinion in sobley i,taking into account the circumstances that opinion embraces and after a order is entered,it controls the scope and course of the trial,and,i f a claim or issue is omitted from the order,it is waived,even if it appeared in the complaint.
these rules notwithstanding,a complete review of the record and controlling mississippi law does not support state farm complaint that a bad faith claim based on its conduct was sprung on it at the last minute following remand.state farm relies almost exclusively on the statement of the sobleys bad faith claim in the last amended complaint 
state farm failed to adequately investigate the plaintiffs claim,and subsequently denied coverage without an arguable basis for said denial.state farm conduct in inadequately investigating the plaintiffs claim and subsequently denying coverage without an arguable basis amounts to reckless disregard for the rights of the plaintiffs,and the plaintiffs are therefore entitled to an award of punitive damages.
and the order for the first trial 
the contested issues of fact are as follows 
by plaintiffs 
whether state farm properly and adequately investigated the plaintiffs claim.
whether state farm had an arguable basis for denial of plaintiffs claim at the time of initial denial on the basis of the electrolysis exclusion of the policy.
whether state farm actions in denying the claim rise to the level of willful,wanton misconduct or reckless disregard for the rights of the plaintiffs.
the contested issues of law are as follows 
by plaintiffs 
whether state farm conduct and actions in denying the claim of the plaintiffs entitles the plaintiffs to recovery of attorney fees punitive damages.
in the order for the second trial,the sobleys stated 
the contested issues of fact are as follows 
by plaintiffs 
whether state farm actions or inactions both before and after its denial of coverage subsequent conduct rises to the level of willful,wanton misconduct or reckless disregard for the rights of the sobleys.
at first blush,the claim in the second order appears to be a more expansive claim than that in the sobleys last amended complaint,if not the statement of the claim in the first order.a review of the record and of our opinion in sobley i makes clear,however,that the sobleys bad faith claim encompassed state farm conduct from the time the sobleys were allowed to amend their complaint to add the bad faith claim.
in response to state farm opposition to the sobleys motion to amend to add this claim,the sobleys stated that it has become apparent that state farm original and continuous denial of coverage despite its knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding this matter constitute bad faith,and that the plaintiffs are entitled to punitive damages.the sobleys went on to assert that they are continuing to suffer damages because of state farm continuous denial of coverage,even though state farm is aware of facts which warrant coverage,which is precisely the type of conduct for which punitive damages are prescribed.after receiving this response,the trial court allowed the sobleys to amend to add the bad faith claim for punitive damages.
thereafter,in response to state farm motion for summary judgment prior to the first trial,the sobleys argued that state farm conduct in adjusting the plaintiffs claim amounts to bad faith and a reckless disregard for the rights of the plaintiffs and that state farm duty to claims does not end merely because a lawsuit has been filed,such that an example of state farm continued bad faith predisposition and unfounded argumentative posture regarding the plaintiffs claims could be found in state farm responses to the sobleys request for admissions.the sobleys contended that,not only did state farm deny coverage based solely on the electrolysis exclusion despite the fact that pat dillard inspection revealed water damage to the carpet and the mexican tile and the rerouting of the plumbing system,but state farm continues to deny coverage for the carpet damage and tile damage based on an exclusion of coverage for deterioration,corrosion,rust,mold,or wet or dry rot despite the fact that dillard investigation revealed no such damages.thus,the sobleys asserted that this conduct on the part of state farm clearly entitles the sobleys to have a jury make the determination regarding the unreasonableness of state farm denial of coverage,and its reckless disregard for the rights of its insured.
at the first trial,the sobleys counsel began his opening statement by asserting that t he proof will show in this case that state farm lloyds never intended to provide coverage for the damages that the sobleys had in this case from the very beginning until the present day.counsel went on to argue that,as we sit here today,they still deny coverage for that carpet and tile.
this review of the record confirms that a bad faith claim based on state farm and litigation conduct was a part of this case from the time the sobleys moved to add a punitive damages claim through the first trial,regardless of how inartfully the last amended complaint or the first trial order were drafted.indeed,in sobley i,we observed 
according to state farm,the sobleys were allowed to put on evidence during the trial relating to state farm conduct both before and after its denial of coverage.such evidence would presumably be relevant to their bad faith claims given that the issue of coverage could be determined from the comparing the damage to the policy language itself 
consistent with this observation,evidence of conduct by the insurer is relevant under mississippi law to establish a claim for bad faith denial of insurance coverage,as state farm counsel admitted at oral argument 
state farm protestations that the sobleys raised a radically different theory for the first time in january,just before the start of the second trial,are belied by the record.accordingly,bereft of this faulty factual premise,there is no merit in state farm point of error that the sobleys new claim was raised too late and without compliance with the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure and that the trial court ruling allowing this new theory of bad faith to be added without a continuance for state farm to prepare or conduct additional discovery constitutes an abuse of discretion and a denial of due process to state farm.
state farm also contends that the trial court erred in sending the punitive damages issue to the jury based on the analysis prescribed in sobley i.in particular,state farm asserts that there was insufficient evidence to establish a jury issue with regard to whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights 
we review the trial court decision to submit this issue to the jury through the vehicle of the court denial of state farm motion for judgment as a matter of law as such,we review the trial court decision de novo,applying the familiar standard first articulated in boeing shipman for the sobleys to create a jury question,there must be a dispute in the substantial evidence,that is,evidence which is of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions,such that a mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury and,e ven if the evidence is more than a scintilla,boeing assumes that some evidence may exist to support a position which is yet so overwhelmed by contrary proof as to yield to a directed verdict.in applying this standard i n determining whether there is a jury question,the court should consider all the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the party.
although we engage in a de novo review,it will be helpful to review first the trial court rulings denying state farm motions on this issue.to recap,in sobley i,we instructed the trial court on remand that,i f a jury question on arguable basis is found,the trial court must consider whether there is a jury question on the second prong of the punitive damage analysis,namely,whether state farm committed a wilful or malicious wrong or acted with gross and reckless disregard for the insured rights.the trial court denied state farm motion at the close of the sobleys,stating 
and,again,as far as the bad faith and the questions about sobley testimony in that regard,that again,a who do we want to believe in this the guess you could say unfortunate for state farm,post litigation conduct is admissible under mississippi law to determine these issues.at this point,i going to allow it to go forward and i will deny the motion as it stands at this time.
in denying state farm renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence,the trial court reasoned 
now,it seems to me that there a logical conclusion you can make,if they can say,state farm the jurors could reach a conclusion that state farm made a mistake and instead of acknowledging the mistake,compounded it by piling on other matters.and i have faith in that as the whole thrust of how they presented those things through the answer and what all have done is post litigation conduct.
finally,in denying state farm motion for judgment as a matter of law,the trial court observed 
the defendant also asserts that the court erred by submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury.clearly,the law of mississippi does not allow the imposition of punitive damages for mere negligence or clerical mistake.this case,however,rises above simple negligence or clerical mistake.the jury properly found based on the evidence that the defendant denied the sobleys claim without an arguable reason.the court finds that the reasonableness of defendant actions was properly submitted to the jury and the jury found the intentional denial necessary for an award of punitive damages 
the sobleys proof at trial as to state farm alleged gross and reckless disregard focused on several aspects of state farm conduct in investigating and initially and continually denying the sobleys claim for carpet and tile damage and expenses without an adequate investigation the sobleys primarily argued that their evidence showed that state farm,after denying the sobleys claim in dillard april,letter citing only the electrolysis exclusion and later being sued by the sobleys in june,knew that the electrolysis exclusion did not bar coverage for the sobleys claim for carpet and tile damage and expenses but,instead of admitting the mistake and paying the claim,raised and pressed,without adequate investigation,several other defenses and exclusions to deny coverage through the first trial in january.
to this end,the sobleys presented evidence that,after being sued by the sobleys in,state farm continued to stand by the electrolysis exclusion as a basis for denying coverage of the sobleys claim.the sobleys evidence also demonstrated that state farm raised the water exclusion as a basis for denying their claim without sending a claims adjustor to inspect the carpet and tile damage for almost four years after dillard initial visit on april,the sobleys presented evidence that dillard april,inspection,according to her own contemporaneous notes,revealed nothing which would fit within the sobleys proffered definition of deterioration to the carpet or tile and that linda sobley own observations and the observations of a carpet specialist and a construction specialist demonstrated that deterioration required to deny coverage under the water exclusion had not occurred.moreover,there was qualified to some state farm representative rick mceuen that neither the electrolysis nor the earth movement exclusion would bar coverage for the claimed carpet and tile damage and that,during his january inspection of the sobleys house,he did not observe deterioration or,in fact,any damage to the tile 
the sobleys also put on evidence that,after state farm initially obtained an affidavit from cindy morgan,the carpet specialist,in which state farm asked her how water damage will generally affect a carpet but did not ask her to actually inspect the sobleys carpet,the sobleys counsel asked morgan to inspect the sobleys carpet and assess the extent of the damage or deterioration.the jury heard testimony from morgan that her inspection in determined that the sobleys carpet evidenced no deterioration,decomposition or physical breakdown,or wet or dry rot and that,despite the fact that she memorialized this in an affidavit provided to state farm in litigation,state farm did not contact her to learn what her inspection revealed indeed,the evidence showed that,after being sued in june,state farm continued to press the water exclusion as a basis for denying the sobleys claim.
the sobleys evidence at trial also showed that,after being sued in june,state farm invoked several policy exclusions,including the policy earth movement exclusion,and defenses,including that the sobleys failed to mitigate the water damage or engaged in neglect,intentionally misrepresented or concealed material information,and failed to provide immediate notice of loss as required under the policy.like the earth movement exclusion,the jury heard evidence that the notice defense was raised for the first time after the sobleys filed suit,despite state farm awareness at the time of its denial in april of facts which state farm later claimed indicated that the sobleys delayed notifying state farm of the loss from water damage and which it claimed justified denial of their claim on this basis alone,regardless of its merits.the sobleys also presented evidence that state farm failed to directly answer the sobleys request for admissions,even on matters such as whether the sobleys had a homeowner policy with state farm that state farm employed an allegedly overbroad definition of deterioration in invoking and pressing the water exclusion as a basis to deny coverage and that state farm pressed the interpretation of mceuen,dillard supervisor in april,of unclear statements in dillard log notes from her inspection on april,to indicate an abbreviation for water exclusion and not water leak,from which state farm argued that dillard had in fact raised the water exclusion with linda sobley on april,as a basis to deny the claim.
mississippi law is that p unitive damages should be assessed with caution and within narrow limits as an example and warning and that a plaintiff has a heavy burden when seeking punitive damages based on a bad faith insurance claim.the evidence of state farm conduct in investigating and denying the sobleys claim,both in april and through the date of the sonat settlement in january,is simply not of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions as to whether state farm engaged in gross and reckless disregard of the sobleys rights.
to begin with,although the sobleys argued at trial that the evidence permitted an inference that dillard denied the claim knowing it was not excluded by the electrolysis exclusion but hoping the sobleys would not challenge it,our review of the evidence of state farm conduct in april in investigating the sobleys claim for carpet and tile damage and expenses and denying it on the basis of the electrolysis exclusion persuades us that,as a matter of law,it amounts to nothing more than evidence of negligent acts for which punitive damages are inappropriate under mississippi law thereafter,state farm next heard from the sobleys two years later when they sued state farm to recoup their losses assertedly covered by their homeowner policy.the sobleys testified that they did not contact or with state farm after april or challenge the basis for state farm denial of coverage sooner because they believed the damages were caused by electrolysis and so excluded under the policy.
we have previously observed that,although an insured may argue there should have been a more complete investigation,there simply was no breach of any duty to the insured who passively accepted the fact finding of the insurer investigation.there is no question but that,under mississippi law,state farm had a duty to its customer to make a reasonably prompt investigation of all relevant facts and a continuing duty to reevaluate its position when it chooses to deny a claim.here,however,there was nothing to trigger state farm duty to reevaluate its claim at least until the sobleys filed suit in june and so no bad faith on state farm part in failing to further investigate the claim,which it had denied and which the sobleys chose not to further pursue during the intervening period of over two years between april and june.
the sobleys evidence of state farm alleged reckless disregard after june consists primarily of state farm litigation conduct and its raising defenses and exclusions allegedly without adequate investigation.the conduct at issue,however,does not rise to the level of gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights as insureds in state farm investigating and continuing to deny the sobleys claim after june through the date of the sonat settlement in january.
on appeal,the sobleys rely heavily on the decision of the supreme court of mississippi in state farm mutual automobile insurance grimes in which the court held 
this is not a case in which the insurance company was found to have had an arguable reason to deny a claim.nor is it a case in which the claim was denied because of some clerical error or other inadvertence for which the imposition of punitive damages would simply be unfair.see universal life ins.veasley,so d.on the contrary,here the jury could conclude that the insurer deliberately refused to pay in the face of knowledge that it could not reasonably expect to succeed on any claimed defense based upon the insured suspected involvement in the theft of his automobile.this was not inadvertence promptly corrected the evidence was amenable to the conclusion that there was deliberate indifference if not hostility to the right of the insured which was never corrected.after an investigation over a period which was clearly reasonable in duration from the standpoint of the insurance company,the company simply had no proof that a theft had not occurred to refute the insured sworn claim that there was a theft supported by the fact that a motor and transmission was indubitably missing.it should have paid,and,because it did not,the issue of punitive damages was properly put before the jury 
on the basis of grimes,the sobleys argue that state farm continued denial based on its,investigation,together with its unbelievable interpretations and application of policy provisions,sufficiently showed that state farm denial was not merely the product of simple oversight or a clerical mistake for which punitive damages would be improper.
while even state farm does not claim that its and litigation conduct is the product of simple oversight or a clerical mistake,the sobleys did not present substantial evidence from which it could be inferred that state farm deliberately refused to pay in the face of knowledge that it could not reasonably expect to succeed on any claimed defense or exclusion it raised in the course of litigation this case is therefore distinguishable from grimes,in which the insurer only basis for denial was its suspicion that the insured had filed a bogus theft claim,in the absence of any proof that a theft had not occurred to refute the insured sworn claim that there was a theft supported by the fact that a motor and transmission was indubitably missing.although the sobleys counsel made much at trial of state farm raising the defenses of concealment or material misrepresentation,which he characterized as state farm calling the sobleys liars and accusing them of being dishonest,the evidence,even taken in the light most favorable to the sobleys,showed that state farm was not provided with potentially important information concerning the sobleys problems with damage to their pipes and water leakage in and around their house until after the sobleys sued state farm in june.under these circumstances,raising this defense and other defenses and exclusions,such as the earth movement exclusion,which might well have applied based on the information does not amount to gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights in the form of state farm allegedly manufacturing defenses after it was sued or state farm relying on patently unjustifiable policy exclusions for denying the claim.
on appeal,state farm does not challenge the trial court conclusion that there was substantial evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions as to whether the electrolysis,water,and earth movement exclusions and defenses of failure to minimize damages and intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material information which state farm raised actually barred coverage for the sobleys claim.however,this conclusion is of no moment to our analysis as to whether there was substantial evidence that state farm acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights.under mississippi law,i f there is no arguable reason found for denying the claim,the issue of punitive damages should not automatically be submitted to the jury.rather,i n the absence of an arguable reason for denying the claim,the trial court must still determine whether there is a jury issue as to the insurer having committed a willful or malicious wrong,or acted with gross or reckless disregard for the insured rights.an exclusion or defense can,of course,constitute an arguable basis even if it does not ultimately bar coverage it follows that the fact that state farm raised defenses and exclusions that may not actually bar coverage does not,in itself,establish that there is substantial evidence as to the issue of gross and reckless disregard 
likewise,the positions advanced by state farm in the course of litigation,including mceuen testimony as to his somewhat strained interpretation of dillard log notes,reliance on an allegedly overbroad definition of deterioration,and responses denying or failing to directly answer the sobleys first request for admissions in discovery,are not evidence of gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights sufficient to create a jury issue as to bad faith denial of insurance coverage.again,state farm does not dispute on appeal the trial court conclusion that the sobleys presented substantial evidence as to whether there was coverage under the policy for the sobleys claim,whether state farm raised the water exclusion in such that it could be an arguable basis for state farm denial of the sobleys claim,and whether the electrolysis possibly the water an arguable basis for denial.that these litigation positions and tactics were ultimately unsuccessful does not,however,alter the fact that such conduct does not constitute the kind of malice,willfully wrongful conduct,gross negligence,or reckless disregard for the insured rights for which punitive damages are properly imposed under mississippi law 
as to state farm allegedly inadequate investigation,the supreme court of mississippi has made clear that,although it is well settled under mississippi law that an insurance company has a duty to investigate promptly and adequately an insured claim,a plaintiff burden in proving a claim for bad faith refusal goes beyond merely demonstrating that the investigation was negligent.citing our holding in merchants national bank southeastern fire insurance the supreme court of mississippi has held that the level of negligence in conducting the investigation must be such that a proper investigation by the insurer would easily adduce evidence showing its defenses to be without merit.a review of our decision upon which this holding relies reveals that evidence showing an insurer defense to be without merit requires that further investigation would undercover evidence that would have undermined at least the arguable merit of the insurer defenses 
here,the sobleys consistently argued that the water exclusion was not raised by state farm in april and so could not have constituted an arguable basis for denying the sobleys claim.considering the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the sobleys,the jury apparently so found in favor of the sobleys on the issue of arguable basis.accordingly,there was no finding requested by the sobleys nor made by the jury that the water exclusion would not,had it been raised by state farm in april,constitute at least an arguable basis for denying the sobleys claim,although the jury found that the water exclusion did not actually bar coverage for the claim.an arguable basis is a reason sufficiently supported by credible evidence as to lead a reasonable insurer to deny the claim,and we understand arguable merit in the same light.
the evidence at trial showed that,although other witnesses,including morgan,testified that there was no deterioration in the sobleys carpet,mceuen inspection in early january led him to the conclusion that there was deterioration in the sobleys carpet.accordingly,in the face of the evidence of the observations and conclusions mceuen drew from his january inspection and state farm interpretation of deterioration,the sobleys failed to present evidence that any further investigation by state farm after suit was filed in june would have easily adduced evidence showing its defenses to coverage under the water exclusion,or,for that matter,the earth movement exclusion,to be without even arguable merit.
based on our review of the entire record,we conclude that the sobleys failed to present substantial evidence that state farm acted with gross and reckless disregard for the sobleys rights.accordingly,the trial court erred in denying state farm motion for judgment as a matter of law and submitting the bad faith issue to the jury.we therefore reverse the trial court judgment on the jury punitive damage award and render judgment in favor of state farm.
state farm further asserts that,because the sobleys had no entitlement to the punitive damages,they have no entitlement to an award of their attorneys fees and expenses from state farm.the sobleys argue that the jury unchallenged finding of a lack of arguable basis entitles them to damages in the form of attorneys fees pursuant to the decisi
