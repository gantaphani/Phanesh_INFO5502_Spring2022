this dispute involves medical malpractice liability policies issued by two different insurers.a malpractice suit was filed against the insured doctor during the term of the second policy based on an alleged surgical error committed and reported during the term of the first.after the first insurer became insolvent,the second insurer,medical protective company medpro,brought this action against its insured seeking a declaration that its policy does not cover the risk.
the medpro policy provides coverage for claims first filed within its policy term arising from acts or omissions that occurred during a retroactive period that includes the date of the surgery at issue in this case.medpro contended that because the error was reported to the predecessor insurer,the claim was not first filed within the term of its policy.in the alternative,medpro sought rescission or reformation of its policy because the insured doctor did not disclose the surgery when asked about potential claims or suits on his application for insurance.the insured doctor counterclaimed for a declaration of coverage,breach of contract,and also sought statutory penalties for vexatious and unreasonable denial of an insurance claim under illinois law.see.comp.statt.after a jury found for the doctor on the misrepresentation claim,the district court entered a declaration that medpro had a duty to defend and indemnify the doctor.the court awarded damages and statutory penalties under section.
we affirm the judgment except for the imposition of statutory penalties.we see no reason in this record to disturb the jury verdict on medpro misrepresentation claim.as to coverage,the doctor receipt of the malpractice complaint,which he promptly sent to medpro,was the first filing of the claim as that term is defined in the policy,and it occurred during medpro policy term.that the prior insurer was given notice of the potential for liability does not take this claim outside medpro coverages.the district court award of statutory penalties,however,was improper under section an insurer conduct is not considered vexatious and unreasonable under the statute if there is a bona fide dispute about coverage,as there was here.
background 
on january,terry jennings was admitted to wabash general hospital in carmel,illinois,after complaining of severe abdominal pain.the next day hyun kim removed her gallbladder in a procedure known as a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.before the procedure,kim met with jennings and her husband to discuss complications associated with the surgery,including certain unique risks posed by jennings prior surgeries and the presence of preexisting scar tissue.
jennings was discharged from wabash hospital a few days after her procedure but returned within a day or so,again complaining of severe abdominal pain.this readmission,within days of jennings initial discharge from the hospital,triggered automatic peer review,a process in which the hospital medical staff discuss and evaluate the appropriateness of a patient course of treatment.
during jennings second admission,kim performed another procedure and discovered that bile was seeping into her abdominal cavity,though he could not pinpoint the source of the leak.to alleviate this problem,he inserted a device to drain the bile from the cavity.this leakage was not the patient only complication she also developed aspiration pneumonia after her second procedure.she was discharged about two weeks later,but all was not well.
when kim examined jennings during a visit at the end of january,he found that her bile leak had not resolved he referred her to a hospital in evansville,indiana,to be examined by a gastroenterologist,bello.further testing revealed a surgical nick or jennings common bile duct.bello told kim of his findings,and a decision was made to send jennings to indiana university hospital and clinics to receive treatment from howard,a specialist in hepatobiliary surgery.howard agreed with bello assessment that jennings injury occurred during the removal of her gallbladder.howard provided kim with periodic updates of jennings condition until she was discharged in the middle of march.at some point after jennings left the indiana facility,kim discussed with wabash hospital ceo,jim farris,whether jennings should be charged for the services leading to her complications.
wabash hospital quality and risk department also became involved.during jennings postoperative care,her husband requested her medical possible sign the jenningses were contemplating legal action.at this point,cynthia delancy,wabash hospital quality and risk manager,thought there were sufficient indicia of risk to notify the hospital insurer.on april,delancy submitted a notice of claim form to the hospital insurer,phico insurance company phico.the hospital phico policy covered the period from july,through july,and provided liability coverage for the hospital and kim as an additional insured.in the notice delancy indicated that while no claim had yet been filed,kim might have injured jennings during her gallbladder procedure.delancy also informed phico of jennings request for his wife medical records as well as the complications that arose after the second procedure.notably,kim was unaware of both delancy submission to phico and jennings request for his wife medical records.phico acknowledged receipt of the notice of claim on april.
on june,kim applied for a policy from medpro in anticipation of changing his status from an employee of wabash hospital to that of an independent provider.section vi of the medpro application required disclosure of known loss information there,kim noted a potential claim related to a laparoscopic cholecystectomy that resulted in a common bile duct injury.in that matter the patient and her family had expressed dissatisfaction with the complications resulting from her procedure the patient attorney also sent kim a letter threatening legal action.after listing this surgery as a possible claim,kim checked a box indicating that he had no knowledge of any other claims,potential claims,or suits,including without limitation,knowledge of any alleged injury arising out of the rendering or failing to render professional services which may give rise to a claim.
a medpro underwriter,david hoagland,reviewed and eventually accepted kim application medpro issued a policy covering claims made during the policy term of july,to july,with a retroactive date of july,the policy requires medpro to indemnify and defend 
a.in any claim for damages,first filed during the term of this policy,based on professional services rendered or which should have been rendered after the retroactive date,by the insured or any other person for whose acts or omissions the insured is legally responsible,in the practice of the insured profession as hereinafter limited and defined.
if reported to the company,the following shall be deemed to be a claim filed during the term of this policy 
a the receipt,by the insured,of a written notice of legal action for damages as described above,or 
b the receipt,by the insured,of a written notification of an intention to hold the insured responsible for damages as described above,or 
c the receipt,by the company during the term of the policy,of written notice of a medical incident from which the insured reasonably believes allegations of liability may result.in order to be deemed a claim,notice of a medical incident shall include all reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time,place,and circumstances of the professional services from which liability may result and the nature and the extent of the injury,including the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses.emphasis added.
the jenningses filed and served a malpractice suit against wabash hospital and kim on august.kim office faxed part of the complaint to medpro the following day.william meadows,a senior claims specialist in medpro legal department,received the fax and spoke by telephone to kim.after receiving a copy of the complete complaint and summons,meadows reviewed kim underwriting file and assigned an attorney,paul lynch,to defend him.phico,believing it was responsible for kim defense as well as the hospital,likewise assigned counsel.not wanting to unnecessarily duplicate each other efforts,the insurers communicated among themselves and resolved that phico should defend kim.
in february phico was declared insolvent and placed in liquidation.kim then looked to medpro,which initially accepted his defense but then backpedaled all the way to federal court.medpro filed this diversity action against kim and the jenningses seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the insurer argued that because wabash hospital notified phico of the possibility of a claim stemming from terry jennings surgery,the claim was not first filed during medpro policy term and therefore was not covered.alternatively,medpro sought rescission or reformation of its policy because kim had not disclosed terry jennings surgery as a potential claim or suit on his medpro insurance application.
kim counterclaimed against medpro and the illinois insurance guaranty fund the guaranty fund,alleging medpro owed primary coverage and had breached its policy by failing to defend.kim also sought statutory penalties under illinois law for vexatious and unreasonable denial of an insurance claim.see.comp.stat.as against the guaranty fund,kim alleged that it owed him excess coverage.the guaranty fund against medpro,and medpro eventually agreed to pay the fund attorney fees and costs in the underlying malpractice case if the court determined that medpro did,in fact,have a duty to defend and indemnify kim.
a jury trial was held on medpro claim that kim misrepresented on his insurance application that he had no knowledge of any potential claims during the retroactive period other than the claim not at issue here.kim testified that when he was filling out the insurance application,he did not think jennings treatment and complications were likely to produce a claim.kim explained that the jenningses had never expressed dissatisfaction with jennings care,and he had no knowledge of jennings request for his wife medical records or that delancy had reported these events to phico.kim contrasted these circumstances with those surrounding the only other potential claim against surgery he disclosed on the insurance application.the patient in that surgery had exhibited outright hostility and threatened to sue kim.medpro underwriter testified he would not have approved kim application if he had been aware of the potential jennings claim.
after the close of evidence,medpro moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.in support of its motion,medpro cited kim testimony about jennings his explanation of a mental checklist he uses when determining whether particular treatment might give rise to a well as hoagland testimony that he would not have approved the policy application if kim had disclosed a potential claim by the jenningses.the district court denied medpro motion.after closing arguments,the jenningses moved for judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence that medpro issued its policy after it was notified of the filing of the jenningses lawsuit.kim joined in that motion.the court took these motions under advisement pending the jury verdict.
the jury found kim did not knowingly make any misstatement or omission on his medpro application.medpro then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the misrepresentation claim and,in the alternative,asked for a new trial.medpro also filed a motion for a declaratory judgment that its policy did not cover the jennings claim.kim,in turn,moved for judgment on his counterclaim for a declaration of coverage,breach of contract damages,and statutory penalties.
the district court denied medpro motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial on the misrepresentation claim.the court likewise denied medpro motion for judgment on its claim for declaratory relief.the court granted kim motion,declared that medpro had a duty to defend and indemnify kim,and awarded breach of contract damages.the court also granted kim motion for statutory costs and attorney vexatious or unreasonable denial of an insurance claim under section.the guaranty fund then moved for its costs and attorney fees in the underlying malpractice suit as well as its costs and fees in the declaratory judgment action.the district court granted the motion.medpro appealed.
ii.discussion 
medpro defense and indemnity coverages 
medpro first challenges the district court denial of its motion for a declaration of noncoverage.substantively,this motion concerned whether kim claim came within the purview of medpro coverages,apart from the issue of any misrepresentation on the insurance application.it is not clear,however,what type of motion this was.medpro motion does not invoke any rule of civil procedure,and neither party on appeal has explained how it should be treated.the district court memorandum order sets forth the standards for motions brought under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure,though neither applies.only the issue of misrepresentation was submitted to the jury the question of the applicability of medpro policy was not.medpro motion might be read as inviting the district court to find facts and draw legal conclusions,as though the matter had been tried to the court medpro argued that r egardless of whether or not kim made a material misrepresentation in his application,the evidence conclusively demonstrates that the medical protective policy does not provide coverage for the jennings claim.the district court opinion,however,does not comport with the requirements of rule.
at oral argument,the parties agreed that no issue of material fact existed regarding the question of coverage and characterized the issue to be resolved as one of law.we will take the parties at their word.because there is no issue of fact to be resolved,we treat medpro appeal on this issue as if the district court rendered summary judgment,see.c celotex catrett,d hicks midwest transit,cir,and apply de novo review,see massey johnson,cir.
medpro maintains that its duty to defend and indemnify kim was not triggered because the jenningses lawsuit was not a claim first filed under its policy.the resolution of medpro argument requires us to interpret and apply the policy language,which the parties agree is controlled by illinois law.illinois courts construe the language of an insurance policy according to rules of contract interpretation.see valley forge ins.swiderski,hobbs hartford ins.of the midwest.that is,the policy should be construed as a whole and every provision given effect.valley forge,at country mut.ins.livorsi marine,cent.light home ins.we will interpret and apply policy language as written,assuming the policy is unambiguous and does not contravene public policy.hobbs,at.
and insurance policies insure different risks.in the occurrence policy,the risk is the occurrence itself.in the claims made policy,the risk insured is the claim brought by a third party against the insured.cont l cas.coregis ins,d.a typical policy covers acts and omissions occurring either before or during the policy period for prior acts,the policy may provide full retroactive coverage or it may only cover claims arising out of acts and omissions after the retroactive date specified in the declarations.barry ostrager thomas newman,handbook on insurance coverage disputes aspen publishers ed,vol,b,see also eric mills holmes,holmes appleman on insurance,lexis law publishing,vol,ch.insurers issuing policies protect themselves against liability for old occurrences by including a retroactive date specifying the earliest occurrence to be covered,no matter when the claim is made.cycle,savoy reins,cir.a and reported policy requires not only that the claim be first made during the policy period,but also that it be reported to the insurer during the policy period.insurance coverage disputes,vol,b.a very restrictive type of insurance will require not only that the claim be both made and reported to the insurer during the policy period,but also that the claim arise out of wrongful acts that take place after the incep
