this appeal arises out of a dispute between two insurers as to their respective duties to defend and indemnify a involved in an auto collision causing serious injuries.the owner of the tractor,ryder truck rentals ryder,obtained primary insurance for the tractor through old republic insurance company old republic.the operator of the tractor,dam express dam,obtained separate insurance through stratford insurance company stratford.old republic brought this suit to determine stratford insurance obligations.
the first question is whether the stratford policy is with the coverage provided by old republic for the tractor leased from ryder.the answer hinges on the intent of the contracting parties,and,more specifically,on which sources a court may consult to determine that intent under new hampshire law.we conclude that the district court committed no legal error in considering the stratford policy as a whole and turning to objective extrinsic evidence to resolve inconsistencies found therein.we affirm the district court conclusion that dam and stratford never intended the stratford policy to provide primary coverage to the tractor otherwise covered by old republic.
we must then determine stratford corresponding duty to defend as an excess insurer of the tractor.the answer is far from clear under new hampshire law.the district court interpreted a new hampshire case from as establishing a rule whereby an insurer duty to defend is the same regardless of whether its designation is as primary or excess.after a close analysis of new hampshire precedent,we conclude that the best course of action is to certify this question of new hampshire law to the new hampshire supreme court.
factual background 
on april,a crashed into daniel and karla bendor vehicle in connecticut,causing bodily injury.the tractor was owned by ryder,who had leased it to dam in order to transport a trailer owned by coca cola.the driver,antoine girginoff,was employed by dam.
dam is a motor company which operates out of manchester,new hampshire.as described by the office manager,dam work falls into two categories.one category is small package delivery such as consumer goods which is conducted in vans and small trucks owned by when business is particularly busy,dam rents an extra van of a similar type,for approximately per year.the second category is transportation of larger shipments in.dam leases these tractors from ryder for approximately per year.
dam and ryder lease agreement specified that ryder was responsible for obtaining liability insurance for the tractor.the lease agreement reads 
liability insurance.the party designated on schedule a the insuring party agrees to furnish and maintain,at its sole cost,a policy of automobile liability insurance with limits specified on each schedule a for death,bodily injury and property damage,covering both you and ryder as insureds for the ownership,maintenance,use,and operation of each vehicle liability insurance the liability insurance must provide that its coverage is primary and not additional or excess coverage over insurance otherwise available to either party the insuring party agrees to designate the other party as an additional insured on the liability insurance 
on the form titled schedule a,the insuring party is identified as ryder alone.dam agreed that ryder shall have the sole right to conduct accident investigations and administer claims handling and settlements and dam shall adhere to and accept ryder conclusions and decisions.
ryder obtained liability insurance from old republic,under which old republic agreed to pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto and to defend any suit asking for these damages.insureds included ryder for any covered auto and a ny person or organization for whom ryder is obligated by written agreement to provide liability insurance covered autos included any auto,the definition of which included t railers with a load capacity of pounds or less designed primarily for travel on public roads.for a coverage limit of,ryder paid a premium of.
in a section titled other insurance,old republic specified for any covered auto you own,this coverage form provides primary insurance.however,while a covered auto which is a trailer is connected to another vehicle,the liability coverage this coverage form provides for the trailer is p rimary while it is connected to a covered auto you own.
dam separately obtained insurance from stratford.stratford agreed to pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto,and to defend any insured against a suit asking for such damages.the stratford policy specified three categories of vehicles as covered autos specifically described autos,hired autos,and nonowned autos.for a maximum coverage of,dam paid a premium of.
specifically described autos are defined as o nly those autos described in item three of the declarations for which a premium charge is shown and for liability coverage any trailers dam does own while attached to any power unit described in item three.item three lists two chevy express vans and any trailer while attached to a covered auto.hired autos are defined as o nly those autos dam lease s,hire s,rent s or borrow s.in item four,dam estimated the cost of hire of these autos to be per year.the per year estimate yielded a liability premium of.nonowned autos are defined as o nly those autos dam do es not own,lease,hire,rent or borrow that are used in connection with dam business.
in the other insurance section,the stratford policy specifies that it provides primary coverage for autos that fall into one of these three categories of covered autos.it reads 
this coverage form liability coverage is primary for any covered auto while hired or borrowed by dam and used exclusively in dam business as a trucker and pursuant to operating rights granted to dam by a public authority.this coverage form liability coverage is excess over any other collectible insurance for any covered auto while hired or borrowed from dam by another trucker.however,while a covered auto which is a trailer is connected to a power unit,this coverage form liability coverage is 
on the same basis,primary or excess,as for the power unit if the power unit is a covered auto.
excess if the power unit is not a covered auto.
the bendors sued ryder,dam,and girginoff in federal court in connecticut on december,for damages in connection with the april,accident as required by its policy with ryder,old republic immediately began providing a defense.in march,old republic asked stratford to participate in the defense of its insureds.
in august,after learning about the underlying lawsuit,stratford proposed a general change endorsement to its policy with dam that was retroactively effective on the inception date of the policy.that endorsement specified for a covered auto leased or rented to dam by ryder or any related entity,liability coverage is excess over any other collectible insurance.stratford and dam executed the agreement on november.
by letter dated december,stratford informed old republic that it had no obligation to share in the cost of defending or indemnifying its insureds against the underlying lawsuit.stratford senior litigation specialist,sandra mcfarlane,wrote that the endorsement reflects dam understanding that it had opted to purchase primary insurance for its ryder vehicles through ryder.mcfarlane stated that a ny coverage provided to either dam or girginoff by stratford is excess to the coverage provided by ryder old republic.for this reason,mcfarlane took the position that stratford is not obligated to,and will not,share in the cost of defending or indemnifying their mutual insureds at this time.
ii.present litigation 
old republic filed suit against stratford on june,in state court in new hampshire.old republic sought a declaratory judgment pursuant to new hampshire revised statute et seq.that old republic and stratford have obligations to defend and indemnify dam,girginoff,and coca cola,with accompanying claims for equitable reformation,unjust enrichment,and waiver and estoppel.stratford removed the case to the united states district court for the district of new hampshire,and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that old republic provides primary coverage,and stratford provides excess coverage,for the liability of dam,girginoff,and coca cola.
the district court granted in part and denied in part both parties motions for summary judgment.old republic ins.stratford ins,cv lm,wl,at.the district court concluded that,as to the tractor,the stratford policy,as initially issued,did not require stratford to provide primary coverage for any losses that may ensue in the underlying action.id.at.nevertheless,because stratford concedes that its policy provides excess coverage,the district court held that stratford is obligated to share equally in the costs of defending its insureds in the underlying action.id.at.old republic additional claims for equitable reformation,unjust enrichment,and waiver and estoppel were dismissed.id.
both parties appealed.old republic argues that the district court erred in finding that coverage under the stratford policy is excess over coverage under the old republic policy.according to old republic,the plain language of the original policy made stratford coverage primary as to the tractor in addition to its own,and the subsequent endorsement changing the coverage to excess is invalid and unenforceable.stratford defends the district court holding that it is an excess insurer,but contends that the district court erred in requiring it to share equally the costs of defense nonetheless.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment under federal rule of civil procedure de novo,and affirm only if the record discloses no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.tropigas de,certain underwriters at lloyd of london,cir.in this analysis,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.id.the presence of for summary judgment does not affect this analysis.scottsdale ins.torres,cir.
iii.stratford coverage 
in new hampshire,t he fundamental goal of interpreting an insurance policy,as in all contracts,is to carry out the intent of the contracting parties.bates phenix mut.fire ins,quoting tech built.sur,see also hansen sentry ins,cir.analyzing the language of the policy and an extrinsic agreement,the district court concluded that dam and stratford never intended to provide coverage to the tractor dam leased from ryder.old republic,wl,at.
the key question here under new hampshire law is what sources a court may consult and in what circumstances to ascertain the parties intent for coverage.the interpretation of a contract,including whether a contract term is ambiguous,is ultimately a question of law birch,capitol broad.t o determine what the parties,as reasonable people,mutually understood the ambiguous language to mean necessarily involves factual findings id.
our search for the parties intent as to the coverage of the tractor begins with the words of the policy itself.bates,at.the new hampshire supreme court recently summarized 
in interpreting policy language,we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy words in context.we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.policy terms are construed objectively,and where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous,we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning 
white.mut.ins,wl,at,quoting bates,at.in this inquiry,we are not constrained to the specific terms of the provision involved we must read the policy as a whole.see great am.dining,phila.indem.ins.
to go beyond the four corners of the policy,however,generally requires ambiguity.see white,wl,at birch,at lawyers title ins.groff.clear and unambiguous policy language is generally the best evidence of the parties intent,and courts do not lightly disregard it.see white,wl,at.
when faced with an internally inconsistent policy,the new hampshire supreme court has looked to objective extrinsic evidence,such as other agreements between relevant parties,to conclusively resolve the intent of the contracting parties.see tech built,at.in tech built,the new hampshire supreme court considered a contract between surge,an employee leasing company,and its insurer,virginia surety.id.at.at issue was whether surge virginia surety policy extended coverage to surge employees who were leased to tech built,a corporation involved in the construction industry,or to tech built itself.id.at.in the section titled,who is insured,the policy stated you are insured if you are an employer named in item of the information page.id.the court acknowledge d that item of the information page itself reference d surge etal sic and the o ther workplaces subsection reference d the endorsement entitled additional named insured locations.id.third and fourth alterations in original.the endorsement in turn listed over companies,including tech built.id.the court noted,however,that o ther language within the policy itself reveal ed that the contracting parties anticipated that a single employer was named as the insured,namely surge,and that coverage for that employer extended to all workplaces of that employer listed in the endorsement id.at.in examining the entire policy,the court found a lack of clarity as to what the parties intended.see id.
the new hampshire supreme court used surge leasing agreement with tech built to inform its understanding of the virginia surety policy.id.at.the court concluded that surge leasing agreement with tech built memorialized surge clear intent to secure workers compensation coverage only for its leased employees.id.at.the court recognized that,in general,we do not look beyond the four corners of the insurance contract to discern the intent of the contracting parties regarding the scope and extent of insurance coverage.id.but,the court explained,we will not ignore that objective extrinsic evidence in favor of dogmatic adherence to insurance maxims.id.
in this case,the stratford policy provides primary insurance coverage to three categories of autos,including,as is relevant here,hired autos.hired autos are defined as those autos dam lease s,hire s,rent s or borrow s.the stratford policy states that t his coverage form liability coverage is primary for any covered auto while hired or borrowed by dam and used exclusively in dam business as a trucker 
to repeat,dam leased or rented two types of vehicles in the course of its business.first,dam rented small vans,similar to those it owned,for approximately per year to deliver small packages during busy periods.second,dam leased large tractors from ryder for approximately per year to transport palletized freight.there is no dispute that the parties intended the stratford policy to provide primary coverage for the small vans dam owned and rented.we must determine whether the parties intended the policy primary coverage to also extend to the large tractors leased from ryder.
if we were to confine our consideration to only the definition of hired autos,primary coverage would apply to the large tractors in the same way as the small vans since dam leased the large tractors from ryder,they would qualify as hired autos,for which coverage would be primary.indeed,stratford senior litigation specialist,sandra mcfarlane,conceded that the definition of hired autos would include the ryder tractor,but maintained that this was not the parties intent.she explained,i think the problem was that there was an exposure out there that was intended to be covered by the policy.
the district court noted that,read in isolation,the policy coverage provision and its definition of hired auto would appear to provide primary coverage for the tractor that girginoff was driving.old republic,wl,at.but,the district court found,t he rest of the policy reveals a contrary intent.id.we agree.
it is a cardinal principle of contract interpretation that we must read the policy as a whole.see great am.dining,a d at.for this reason,our analysis can not begin and end with the definition of hired autos.here,other provisions within the policy itself reveal a more tailored intent to insure only the smaller side of dam business,which conducted small package delivery in small vans and trucks.highlighting this side of dam business,the stratford policy describes dam business as the delivery of office supplies and small household appliances.there is no mention in the policy of the additional portion of the business concerned with the transportation of palletized freight.dam listed two of its small vans in the itemization of specifically described autos,and provided an estimate for the cost of hired autos that is consistent with similar small vans.dam did not describe the portion of the business concerning palletized freight involving ryder tractors.
we find the estimated cost of hire for hired autos,listed in the stratford policy,to be particularly instructive as to the parties intent.the estimated cost of hire is a term within the four corners of the policy and can not be ignored.for hired autos,dam estimated the yearly cost of hire to be.the parties agree that the cost of hire for small vans similar to those dam owned was per year,and that the cost of hire for the ryder tractors was approximately per year.the estimate is not binding on the parties,but it is informative of their intent when the policy was created.although the concurrence posits that an insured might lowball his estimate to reduce his premium,the dramatic difference between the estimate listed in the contract and the yearly cost to hire the ryder tractors in this case belies any suggestion that stratford and dam intended their policy to provide primary coverage for those tractors this incredibly low amount evidences that dam attempted to insure its own vans as specifically described autos and similar hired vans as hired autos,and not the ryder tractors.further,contract interpretation rules require consideration of the cost estimate within the four corners of the policy as indicative of the intent as to what was being covered.
as in tech built,dam lease agreement with ryder provides objective extrinsic evidence of the intent animating the stratford policy as to the scope of coverage.there,the new hampshire supreme court used an extrinsic lease agreement as a means to obtain clarity as to whom coverage applied.see at.tech built made it clear that inconsistent policy language must be viewed in terms of the background,circumstances,and context in which the policy was negotiated.see id.here,we use a similar extrinsic lease agreement to obtain clarity as to which vehicles coverage applied given the potential inconsistency within the stratford policy.dam and ryder lease agreement specified that ryder was the party responsible for liability insurance for the tractors.dam agreed that ryder shall have the sole right to conduct accident investigations and administer claims handling and settlements and dam shall adhere to and accept ryder conclusions and decisions.
the district court found that this agreement between dam and ryder was entirely consistent with the portions of the stratford policy that suggest that dam intended to insure only its small vans through stratford.see old republic,wl,at.when providing information on the scope of the coverage it needed for hired autos,the district court explained,dam knew that ryder was responsible for liability insurance on the tractors it leased to dam,and dam said nothing to stratford about those tractors.id.at.in sum,it can not have been the intent of the parties for stratford to provide primary coverage on a risk that dam never sought to insure and that stratford knew nothing about when it issued dam its policy and set the premium for it.id.
considering the entirety of the stratford policy,including the pricing estimate,background,and circumstances,as informed by the lease agreement between dam and ryder,we agree with the district court that the stratford policy was never intended to provide primary insurance for the ryder tractors.neither old republic nor the concurrence suggests that the policy or the extrinsic evidence supports the proposition that the parties did intend to provide primary coverage for the tractors rather,they argue that the parties should be restricted to the one provision in the policy defining hired autos despite any evidence of a contrary intent.the district court committed no legal error in its analysis of the stratford policy and dam lease with ryder.even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to old republic,the record demonstrates that dam and stratford did not intend the stratford policy to provide primary insurance for the ryder tractors,which ryder was already insuring through old republic as per its agreement with dam.see tech built,at finding no genuine dispute of material fact concerning the clear intent memorialized in the lease agreement.we repeat what the unanimous court in tech built stated under new hampshire insurance law,where the intent of the contracting parties can be conclusively resolved by objective extrinsic evidence,we will not ignore that evidence in favor of dogmatic adherence to insurance maxims.id.so too,here.
because we conclude that stratford policy with dam never provided coverage for the ryder tractor,we,unlike the concurrence,need not consider whether new hampshire law would conclude that stratford and dam later general change endorsement is a valid contract modification,which old republic disputes.we do note that stratford has now committed itself to provide excess coverage as to the ryder tractor both in its endorsement and independently in its representations to the district court and this court.
iv.stratford duty to defend 
the district court stated that,in new hampshire,the duty of an insurer to defend is the same whether its potential liability is either as a primary or as an excess carrier.old republic,wl,at quoting universal underwriters ins.allstate ins.b ecause stratford concedes that its policy provides excess coverage,the district court concluded,it is obligated to share equally in the costs of defending its insureds in the underlying action.id.stratford appeals and argues that,as an excess insurer,its duty to defend should be excess to that of the primary insurer.
in,the new hampshire supreme court noted that it ha s never addressed the precise issue of allocation of defense costs between a primary insurer and an excess insurer.progressive ins.argonaut ins.in that case,the court declined to review a trial court requirement that an excess insurer pay its pro rata share of defense costs since the issue was not properly raised in the notice of appeal.id.at.the court was also unwilling to hold that the trial court had committed plain error given the unsettled nature of the issue.id.at.
a previous new hampshire supreme court decision,universal underwriters,had touched on the same issue briefly.in universal underwriters,the new hampshire supreme court analyzed the coverage provided by two insurance companies,universal and allstate,for a leased vehicle when both purported to be excess carriers.universal underwriters,at.the court held that universal provided primary coverage up to,and that both universal and allstate provided coverage past that amount.id.at.on the duty to indemnify,the court held that the cost of settlement in this case in excess of is to be shared pro rata by universal and allstate.id.on the duty to defend,however,the court split the total defense costs equally between the two carriers.id.at.rejecting the trial court pro rata division,the new hampshire supreme court stated that the duty of an insurer to defend is the same whether its potential liability is either as a primary or as an excess carrier.id.at.
the district court interpreted universal underwriters to require primary and excess carriers to equally share the costs of defense.see old republic,wl,at.the majority rule is that the excess liability carrier is not obligated to participate in the defense until the primary policy limits are exhausted.couch on insurance ed see also id.schneider transp.ford motor,cir.the district court contrary conclusion follows from the statement of the new hampshire supreme court in universal underwriters,and the court holding that the two insurers must split the defense costs equally despite the fact that only universal provided primary coverage for the first.see universal underwriters,at.
stratford nevertheless argues that universal underwriters can not be taken at its word.stratford stresses that it is not asking this court to overrule the new hampshire supreme court on an issue of new hampshire state law.instead,stratford claims that i t is not at all clear that the supreme court of new hampshire actually held that excess insurers must share defense costs equally with primary insurers given the context within which universal underwriters was decided and the citations on which it relies.
first,stratford argues that the new hampshire supreme court would have explained its dramatic shift away from the general rule if this was actually its intent.critically,a federal district court decision interpreting new hampshire law two years before universal underwriters appears to follow the general rule.see town of stoddard sec.ins,devine.in that case,the district court differentiated between the primary and excess insurer,and held that the primary insurer alone was obligated to reimburse the insured for the costs of the defense.see id.at.stratford concedes that i t is certainly possible that universal underwriters reflects the announcement by the supreme court of new hampshire of a new position on the issue and a repudiation of the approach reflected in town of stoddard.but,t here is no indication in universal underwriters itself that the court was introducing a new rule of law 
second,stratford argues that the two cases cited by the new hampshire supreme court in universal underwriters do not support reading the decision as adopting a new rule.in universal underwriters,the court cited a decision from the georgia court of appeals,zurich insurance new amsterdam casualty,an earlier decision from the new hampshire supreme court,liberty mutual insurance home insurance indemnity,and a treatise,couch on insurance ed.see at.
in zurich insurance,the georgia court of appeals stated that one insurer,zurich,had a potential liability,either as primary or excess carrier,in either of which cases its duty to defend was the same.at zurich had defended the insured and paid the judgment when the other carrier refused.id.at.ultimately vindicated as the excess carrier,the georgia court of appeals held that zurich had a duty to defend its insured even though it was excess when the primary refused,but that it had a right to recover from the primary insurer in the same manner that its insured would have had.id.at.a later case in georgia cites zurich insurance for the uncontroversial position that an excess insurer ha s a duty to defend the claims against its insured after the primary insurer denied coverage and refused to defend.motors ins.auto owners ins.
in liberty mutual,the new hampshire supreme court held that two insurers provided primary coverage for an accident to varying limits.at.on a motion for rehearing,the court clarified as both policies afford primary coverage,liberty mutual and home insurance have a joint obligation to defend the insured and to share equally the costs of defense.id.the case has no bearing on the respective duties to defend when one insurer is primary and the other excess.
the district court reading of the statement in universal underwriters draws the most support from the second edition of couch treatise,published in.the cited provision of the treatise explained 
the duty to defend is absolute,even if the policy turns out to be excess insurance.for example,where a truck driver car insurer and truck owner insurer both covered the accident and each policy contained the defense provision,each had the duty to defend the driver against the injured party claim,even if the car insurer coverage was excess.
couch on insurance ed collecting cases,including zurich insurance.in hawaii,for example,when both primary and excess insurer s shared a duty to defend the action,each insurer was responsible for half of the costs and expenses of defending regardless of the pro rata division of principal liability.id.citing indus.indem.aetna cas.sur,cir.elsewhere in the treatise,however,the general rule is stated as follows w here the insured maintains both primary and excess policies,an excess liability insurer is not obligated to participate in the defense until the primary policy limits are exhausted.id.
the modern version of couch treatise on insurance law reaffirms that,a s a general rule,a insurer is not obligated to defend its insured until all primary insurance is exhausted or the primary insurer has tendered its policy limits.couch on insurance ed.however,the treatise continues,a minority of jurisdictions have held an excess carrier duty to defend may be triggered if there is a possibility that excess coverage may be reached.id.the treatise cites universal underwriters for the proposition that o nce an excess carrier obligation to defend arises,the duty to defend is the same as the duty of a primary insurer.id.this reading of universal underwriters is plausible if we assume that the low threshold of triggered both carriers duty to defend and the new hampshire supreme court then required them to split defense costs equally.it is still unclear how this rule,if new hampshire has adopted this minority position,would apply to the facts of our case when the primary carrier had a coverage limit of and the complaint does not estimate the damages sought.
the new hampshire supreme court has not provided clarity on its holding in universal underwriters regarding an excess insurer duty to defend since that opinion was issued when denying stratford motion to alter or amend its decision,the district court stated that,if presented with the precise facts of this case,the new hampshire supreme court might be inclined to revisit universal underwriters,and reassess that opinion reliance upon zurich insurance the district court felt obligated to stand by its prior ruling given the law as currently enunciated by the new hampshire supreme court.on appeal,stratford invites certification to the new hampshire supreme court,which old republic does not oppose.
we are permitted to certify questions of law to the new hampshire supreme court when questions of new hampshire law are determinative of the case,and there is no controlling precedent from the new hampshire supreme court.in progressive,the new hampshire supreme court explicitly stated that it had never addressed the issue that we now find before us and that it could not say that the state law on the issue is settled.see,at.we conclude that certification is the appropriate route in this case given the important,and unsettled,question of new hampshire law.
we certify the following questions to the new hampshire supreme court 
under new hampshire law,when is an excess insurer duty to defend triggered does new hampshire follow the general rule that the excess insurer duty to defend is triggered only when the primary insurer coverage is exhausted if not,what rule as to allocation of defense costs and timing of payment does new hampshire follow 
conclusion 
we conclude that dam and stratford never intended stratford to provide coverage to the involved in the automobile accident.this leaves old republic as the primary insurer,and stratford as the excess insurer.we certify to the new hampshire supreme court the attendant question of stratford duty to defend under new hampshire law in light of universal underwriters.
the clerk of this court is instructed to transmit to the new hampshire supreme court,under the official seal of this court,a copy of the certified questions and our opinion in this case,along with copies of the parties briefs,appendix,and supplemental filings under rule j of the federal rules of appella
