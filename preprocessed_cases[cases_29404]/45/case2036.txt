background 
nyl sells life insurance products to independent insurance brokers throughout the united states.sales are made mainly through field representatives who promote the sale of nyl products and services to the independent insurance brokers.field directors receive internal support from marketing service consultants msc.an msc acts as a liaison between the field directors,who are out in the field selling insurance,and nyl producing groups.six mscs worked in nyl leawood,kansas office.
that office hired mickelson as an msc in september.mickelson resume indicates that she graduated from law school in may and that for the six years before and during law school she worked for another life insurance company,first in the underwriting department,and later for the last six months,as a marketing service position very similar to the one she was hired to perform at nyl.because of her law degree,mickelson was assigned to the msc group responsible for high net worth clients and corporations for this reason,the group was considered relatively prestigious.although a law degree was not required for her position,nyl believed it added to mickelson credibility when dealing with those clients additionally,mickelson used her legal knowledge to prepare estate planning illustrations for those clients.although she did not have any professional licences when she was hired,she steadily worked toward and obtained a series license in addition,mickelson earned a fellow life management insurance designation,which indicates extensive knowledge of products in the life insurance industry,as well as a chartered life underwriter designation,which indicates passage of ten professional courses.
when a new employee is hired,nyl assigns him or her to a grade level each grade level carries a specific salary range.typically,mscs are assigned to grade level,which carries a salary range of to.john begley,the director of human resources at the leawood office,and james vavra,the of operations at the leawood office,assigned mickelson to grade level and set her salary,without negotiation,at.by september she was earning.
vickie day was hired as an msc in october,the month after mickelson.day brought to nyl five years of experience working in the life insurance industry,as well as eleven years experience in an administrative assistant position.she had a bachelor degree and series and professional licenses.her salary immediately prior to being hired at nyl was.like mickelson,day was assigned to grade level and her starting salary was.by september,day salary was.
mark shelton was hired as an msc in december,three months after mickelson.shelton had a bachelor degree and twenty years of experience in the insurance industry.his salary immediately prior to being hired at nyl was.he was assigned to grade level,which carries a salary range of to,and his salary was set at.by september,his salary was.
kevin harriman was hired as an msc in february.harriman had two years of experience as a marketing and business analyst at a life insurance company.it appears that harriman experience in the life insurance industry is limited to these two years.he also had three years of experience working as a securities trader and financial analyst,and two years of experience as a mutual fund representative in which he acted as a liaison between the fund and the.harriman had a bachelor degree and was working toward obtaining his masters in business administration when he was hired.he also had series,and professional licenses.in his most recent job prior to being hired at nyl,he earned,although for the six months prior to being hired at nyl he was unemployed.he was assigned to grade level and begley,vavra,and tracie billings,the msc supervisor,set his starting salary at.no documents were prepared describing how harriman salary was set.
two other mscs worked in the leawood wirtz and susan hairgrove.both were hired in.although the record does not reveal their qualifications,starting salaries,or performance histories,in,hairgrove earned,compared to wirtz salary.by september,both were considered senior mscs but hairgrove earned while wirtz earned difference of over.
shortly after harriman was hired,mickelson learned that his starting salary was set at.she made a written inquiry to billings asking what criteria were involved in setting salaries.billings and vavra met with mickelson to discuss her concerns.vavra told mickelson that four factors were taken into consideration in setting harriman,qualifications,market factors,and salary history.not satisfied that these reasons could explain the disparity in pay,mickelson made a formal complaint of salary discrimination to nyl home office in new york city.she sent a copy of the complaint to begley.nyl conducted an internal investigation of the complaint and concluded that the disparity in pay was warranted based upon harriman relevant experience in the market,nyl current need for expertise in that market,harriman and mickelson relative salary histories,and their respective professional licenses.in march,mickelson filed a charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc.
according to mickelson,after she filed her complaint,she experienced several adverse employment actions.first,although vavra had personally committed to look for opportunities for mickelson in nyl legal department,he never reported back to her about whether there were any such openings.second,billings cancelled a business trip to boston that mickelson was scheduled to take.third,billings told mickelson that she would need to use her vacation time to study for a bar examination she was taking the following week,although mickelson was previously told that she did not have to use her vacation time fourth,vavra sent mickelson an,which she considered demeaning,informing her that one of her projects was dead.fifth,she met with vavra,billings,and another employee named louis gardner to discuss the fact that mickelson was asking gardner questions regarding work when he was not her supervisor.vavra became extremely angry during the meeting.sixth,after she became engaged to the field director to whom she provided support services,mickelson asked that she be promoted to a key accounts position or moved to another distribution source because she felt that it was not in the company best interest to have a married couple working on the same marketing team.billings initially suggested that the key accounts position would be a good move for mickelson but later,billings indicated that there were no openings for that position.she was then reassigned to a different field director in a msc group.
finally,in december,mickelson took medical leave pursuant to the family and medical leave act fmla and was treated for depression and panic attacks.her leave was scheduled for december,through january.after she had been on leave for approximately two weeks,however,she inquired as to whether she could return to work on a basis because her doctor indicated it would be a good step for her.billings denied her request,stating that because of business demands and staffing requirements,her position had to be filled by a employee.this response came despite the fact that nyl employee handbook indicates that fmla leave for a serious health condition can be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule if medically necessary,and despite the fact that hairgrove,another msc,suffered a back injury at work in december and was permitted to return to work from march through may.after mickelson request to work was denied,mickelson condition worsened.she had to extend her leave until february,which was when her fmla leave was exhausted.when she could still not return to work,she was fired.
mickelson filed this complaint against nyl in may,alleging salary discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of both title vii,see,and the equal pay act,see d.she also alleged that nyl retaliated against her for filing her salary discrimination complaint,also in violation of title vii,see.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of nyl on all claims.in dismissing the salary discrimination claims,the court held that nyl showed that the reason for the disparity in pay between mickelson and the male employees was based upon their relative experience and qualifications.as to her retaliation claim,the court held that mickelson had not shown an adverse employment action.mickelson now timely appeals the district court order granting summary judgment.

salary discrimination 
there are two ways a plaintiff can proceed on a claim of salary discrimination on a theory of intentional discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of title vii,or on a theory of wage discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of the epa.this is a significant distinction because a plaintiff burden to prove discrimination varies depending on the statute at issue.under title vii,the plaintiff always bears the burden of proving that the employer intentionally paid her less than a male employee.the epa,however,has been described as imposing a form of strict liability on employers who pay males more than females for performing the same other words,the plaintiff in an epa case need not prove that the employer acted with discriminatory intent.ryduchowski port auth.of,cir sinclair auto.club of,cir miranda b b cash grocery store,cir stating that the epa prescribes a form of strict liability.
because of this difference in the statutes,the analysis involved in determining whether the plaintiff has met her burden differs depending on the statute at issue.under title vii,a plaintiff must prove that the employer intentionally discriminated against her because of her sex.jaramillo.judicial,cir.when the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence of is the case apply the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas and its progeny.mcdonnell douglas green,d plotke,at.under mcdonnell douglas,the aggrieved employee must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination.mcdonnell douglas,at.relevant to this case,a prima facie showing of discrimination consists of evidence that a female employee occupies a job similar to that of higher paid males.miller auto.club of,cir quotation omitted.if the plaintiff makes such a showing,the burden of production shifts to the employer to state a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its adverse employment action.plotke,at quotation omitted.if the employer meets this burden,then summary judgment is warranted unless the employee can show there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered reasons are pretextual.id.
claims based upon the epa,however,do not follow the same mcdonnell douglas framework.rather,epa claims proceed in two steps.first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that employees of the opposite sex were paid differently for performing substantially equal work.miller,at having met this,the burden of persuasion then shifts to the defendant to prove that the wage disparity was justified by one of four permissible reasons.tidwell fort howard,cir.these reasons are a seniority system a merit system a pay system based on quantity or quality of output a disparity based on any factor other than sex.id.citing d.if the employer fails to convince the jury with its evidence of one or more of the affirmative defenses the plaintiff will prevail on her prima facie case.id.this is not to say that an employer may never be entitled to summary judgment on an epa claim if the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case.but,because the employer burden in an epa claim is one of ultimate persuasion,in order to prevail at the summary judgment stage,the employer must prove at least one affirmative defense so clearly that no rational jury could find to the contrary.stanziale jargowsky,cir quotation omitted.
the employer burden in an epa case differs from its burden in a title vii case for another reason.whereas in a title vii case the employer need only proffer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action,with no need to establish that the reason actually motivated the decision,the epa prohibits a disparity in pay between men and women except where such payment is made pursuant to one of the four aforementioned affirmative defenses.d emphasis added.the third circuit has explained,and we agree,that this language requires an employer to submit evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude not merely that the employer proffered reasons could explain the wage disparity,but that the proffered reasons do in fact explain the wage disparity.stanziale,at.accordingly,where,as here,employers seek summary judgment as to an equal pay act claim,they must produce sufficient evidence such that no rational jury could conclude but that the proffered reasons actually motivated the wage disparity of which the plaintiff complains.id.at see also tenkku normandy bank,cir at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings,the employer justification for the differences is irrelevant,unless it is strong enough to establish one of the statutory affirmative defenses as a matter of law.
because of the varying burdens of proof,it is conceivable that in some cases an employer would be entitled to summary judgment on the title vii claim,but not on the epa claim.we leave that discussion for another time,however,because in this case we hold the following with respect to nyl proffered reasons for paying the male employees more than mickelson that mickelson has presented sufficient evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment on her title vii claim and that nyl has failed to establish that its proffered reasons were in fact the reason for the disparity in pay as a matter of law on the epa claim.we first turn our attention to the epa claim.
significantly,nyl admitted for purposes of summary judgment,that mickelson made a prima facie showing of discrimination under the epa.therefore,summary judgment for nyl is inappropriate unless no rational jury could conclude but that the proffered reasons actually motivated the wage disparity of which the plaintiff complains.stanziale,at.before the district court,and at oral argument,nyl focused on harriman relevant experience in the refers to the market for variable life insurance warranting the disparity in pay because,at the time he was hired,nyl was trying to break into the market to sell variable life insurance products and needed harriman expertise to do so.indeed,an employee prior experience is a factor other than sex for purposes of the equal pay act.angove,cir citing irby bittick,cir,see also balmer hca,cir.although this reason could explain the wage disparity,we can not conclude,as a matter of law,that it in fact explained the wage disparity.
to begin,no documents were executed contemporaneously with harriman hiring that indicated nyl was looking for someone with experience or that harriman was hired because of his experience.when mickelson first inquired as to why harriman starting salary was twenty percent higher than her own,vavra made no mention of nyl need for someone with experience in the market.he merely said that harriman experience,qualifications,market factors,and salary history warranted the disparity in pay.the form prepared after harriman interview states that the reason he was hired was because of his life ins urance background,team orientation,relevant insurance experience,communications,securities.although harriman experience and qualifications necessarily include his experience,the first indication that nyl was looking for such experience and that harriman background in that field warranted the disparity in pay came from the new york office internal investigation of mickelson complaint.it is undisputed,however,that the new york office played no role in setting either mickelson salary or harriman salary.the results of its internal investigation,therefore,can not be conclusive on this issue.
moreover,though nyl maintains that it was trying to penetrate the market at the time it hired harriman,vavra admitted that the market for those products crashed in the summer of,well before harriman was hired,and that nyl sold very few variable life insurance products as a result.also,what is conspicuously missing from the record is any suggestion that harriman ever used his experience in the market in any capacity at nyl.in fact,vavra admitted that harriman responsibilities were essentially the same as mickelson.
in addition,it is undisputed that mickelson and day had more life insurance industry experience than.harriman resume reflects that he had only two years of experience in the life insurance industry.in contrast,mickelson had approximately six years in the life insurance industry before she was hired at nyl,and another eighteen months of experience in the industry by the time harriman was hired.similarly,day had five years of experience in the life insurance industry when she was hired,and another seventeen months experience by the time harriman was hired.of course,shelton had the most experience of if he were the only msc at nyl leawood office,we might well conclude that his experience so far outweighed the women experience that no rational trier of fact could conclude other than that his experience was the determinative factor in setting his salary.but that is not the case harriman,with the least amount of experience in the life insurance industry of all the mscs,was paid substantially more than both mickelson and day.moreover,as of september,he was earning less than hairgrove,a senior msc who had been working at nyl for approximately nine years.
there are also disputed issues of fact as to whether market factors and salary history warranted the disparity in pay.as to market factors playing a role in setting harriman salary,billings recalled that harriman had multiple job offers and that nyl had to compete for his services.see stanley of southern,cir an employer may consider the marketplace value of the skills of a particular individual when determining his or her salary.but nyl produced no evidence that it had to pay him in order to retain him.further,it is undisputed that harriman was unemployed for six months prior to being hired at nyl,and mickelson said that during the interview process,which she took part in,that harriman said he was desperately trying to find a job.as for harriman prior salary history as justification for the wage disparity,this reason is undermined by the fact that at her previous job day was making and her salary was set at,while shelton was making at his previous job and his salary was set at 
casting further doubt on nyl asserted justifications for the disparity in pay is that one of its reasons was that harriman has more nasd licenses,which refers to the series,and licenses.to begin,nyl presented no evidence that a series license is either required or even relevant to the msc job.further,mickelson had a series license and a clu neither shelton nor harriman had.vavra testified that the clu designation was more important to the position than a series license.indeed,nyl advertisement for the msc position states that it prefers an applicant with a clu designation.finally,day had both a series and when she was hired,and her starting salary was twenty percent less than harriman.
based on the foregoing,and based on the fact that the employer bears the burden of persuasion,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of nyl on the epa claim.when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to mickelson,a jury would not be compelled to find that the reasons proffered by nyl were,in fact,the reason for the disparity in pay.to be sure,these reasons could explain the disparity,but the evidence here is not so overwhelming as to require that conclusion.to the contrary,a jury could reasonably conclude that the common denominator between the salaries was being male,not the level of experience,and the common denominator between the salaries was being female,not the level of inexperience.
turning to mickelson title vii claim,we first must address an evidentiary matter.mickelson argues that the district court improperly excluded evidence that other females had complained of discriminatory treatment by nyl.specifically,the district court disregarded the affidavits of julie,a former service associate at nyl,and rhonda kunz,a former human resources administrative assistant at nyl.averred that she helped to train mickelson and shelton as mscs and that both needed an equal amount of training.also claimed that she herself sought a promotion to the msc position because she was already performing the same duties as an msc,but for less money.when she asked begley for the promotion he repeatedly told her that it was in the works but she never was promoted.she ultimately resigned in march at that time her salary was.
kunz,whose position involved reviewing personnel records,keeping track of attendance and vacation schedules,and ensuring that pay raises earned by employees were actually received,averred that she believed there was no concern for equal pay for equal work at nyl leawood office.indeed,when she and two others earned their bachelor degrees at the same time,only the male of the group received a raise,while the women did not.
the district court disregarded these affidavits,finding that they contain ed conclusory allegations that are not supported by the record.see nichols hurley,cir.as a general rule,however,the testimony of other employees about their treatment by the defendant is relevant to the issue of the employer discriminatory intent.spulak k mart,cir see also atchley nordam group,cir.both these women testified from personal knowledge.said that she trained both mickelson and shelton for the msc position and that they needed the same amount of training.when the employer proffered reason for the twenty percent difference in their salaries is,in part,based upon experience and qualifications,that both employees needed the same amount of training is relevant to determination of discriminatory intent.similarly,kunz testimony that a similarly situated male received a raise while she and another woman did not is relevant to the issue of discriminatory intent.the district court erred in disregarding these affidavits.see spulak,at citing stumph thomas skinner,cir reversing summary judgment for employer,holding that affidavits of former employees created a genuine issue of fact on issue of defendant discriminatory intent.
we turn now to the mcdonnell douglas framework.as with mickelson epa claim,the parties agree that mickelson has met her burden to establish a prima facie case of is,she occupies a job similar to that of higher paid that nyl met its burden to proffer a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity in,the relative experience,qualifications,market factors,and salary histories of the higher paid male employees.the remaining question,therefore,is whether mickelson has produced sufficient evidence that nyl proffered reasons are pretext for unlawful discrimination to survive summary judgment.a plaintiff can show pretext by revealing such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them u
