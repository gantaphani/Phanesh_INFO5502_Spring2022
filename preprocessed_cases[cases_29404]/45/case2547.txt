introduction 
anthony mccarty purchased a used chevy blazer for his son,kevin from triple crown auto sales,triple crown.approximately one week later,kevin was driving the blazer when he collided with and seriously injured plaintiff and appellant pamela spangle plaintiff.plaintiff obtained a judgment against kevin far in excess of the insurance covering him.plaintiff now seeks to recover against a garage operations liability policy issued to triple crown by defendant and respondent insurance company plaintiff theory is that,because triple crown incorrectly filled out the department of motor vehicles dmv paperwork,title never transferred to kevin,triple crown was still an owner of the blazer when the accident occurred,and therefore kevin was insured as a permissive user of the blazer under policy.
this opinion concludes that there are triable issues of material fact regarding title to the automobile and consequently whether kevin was a permissive user of the automobile.it can not be established as a matter of law that kevin was not covered by the policy if he was a permissive user.the summary judgment against plaintiff is reversed.
in june,kevin lived in oregon with his mother and stepfather.he flew to california to visit his father,anthony.on june,anthony purchased from triple crown a used chevy blazer automobile for kevin,paying the full purchase price in cash.triple crown required anthony to sign the purchase agreement because triple crown had a policy of not entering into purchase agreements for automobiles with minors.although a minor,kevin signed the dmv report of vehicle form as the purchaser of the blazer.kevin also executed the dmv power of attorney form authorizing triple crown to forward the necessary documentation to the dmv to transfer ownership of the blazer.at the time,triple crown was insured under a commercial automobile and garage operations liability policy issued by.
on july,kevin was driving the blazer when he made a left turn into oncoming traffic.the blazer collided with a car driven by plaintiff.plaintiff was severely injured,and her passenger was killed.in october,plaintiff sued kevin and his family to recover for her personal injuries.
at the time of the accident,kevin mother and stepfather were insured by progressive classic insurance progressive.while plaintiff suit against kevin was pending,progressive denied coverage for the accident and sought a judicial declaration from the united states district court for the eastern district of california the progressive action that the blazer was neither a covered vehicle nor a vehicle under the progressive policy.on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the blazer was a vehicle as defined in the progressive policy because legal title had never passed from triple crown to kevin pursuant to vehicle code section.the court reasoned,it was undisputed that anthony,not kevin,was the actual purchaser of the vehicle.triple crown therefore should have transferred title to anthony,who in turn could have transferred title to kevin.because kevin was a minor,the power of attorney that kevin had signed purporting to authorize triple crown to transfer title was void.the district court concluded that kevin was therefore covered by the progressive policy as a relative of his mother driving a vehicle with permission.
after the district court rendered its decision in the progressive action,plaintiff made a claim against triple crown policy with.plaintiff asserted that kevin was insured as a permissive user under the policy because,as legal title had never passed from triple crown to kevin,triple crown was an owner of the blazer at the time of the accident.rejected plaintiff position,contending that triple crown was never the legal or registered owner of the blazer and was not an equitable owner because anthony had paid the full purchase price and taken possession of the vehicle.furthermore,kevin was not an insured because the policy excluded from the definition of insureds those customers of triple crown who had other insurance available.
in july,plaintiff obtained a judgment against kevin for million.plaintiff attorney made a policy limits settlement demand of million on.rejected the settlement demand,contending that regardless of whether triple crown might be deemed an owner of the blazer at the time of the accident,kevin and anthony were excluded from coverage as customers of triple crown.further,asserted that the accident did not result from triple crown garage operations under the policy,reasoning that the coverage for garage operations applied only to the service and repair of automobiles.along with used car sales,asserted,triple crown business,for which the garage operations coverage applied,included complete auto service.
in plaintiff first amended complaint against,she alleged claims for insurance bad faith and breach of contract,and a claim as a judgment creditor for direct recovery against a debtor insurer,pursuant to insurance code,section,subdivision b.plaintiff moved for summary adjudication of the coverage issues pursuant to code of civil procedure,section,subdivision f.for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.
the trial court denied plaintiff motion for summary adjudication and granted motion for summary judgment.the trial court granted motion on the basis that there was no relationship between kevin use of the blazer at the time of the accident and triple crown garage operations,as defined in the policy as a result,the accident did not result from triple crown garage operations and was not covered.the trial court declined to grant summary judgment on the ground that kevin was a customer,concluding that the term customer was ambiguous when applied to a minor.the trial court also declined to grant summary judgment on the ground that triple crown was not an owner of the blazer,concluding that had failed to meet its threshold burden of production on the issue.the trial court entered judgment in favor of.plaintiff timely appealed.

garage operations 
argues that the policy covers only liability resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of locations for garage business or the roads or other access that adjoin these locations.because kevin accident occurred some miles from triple crown lot while kevin was driving the blazer for his own private purposes,contends,the accident did not result from triple crown garage operations.argument is contrary to the plain text of the policy.
the relevant coverage provision in the policy states we will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from garage operations involving the ownership,maintenance or use of covered autos.stated otherwise,this coverage applies if an insured legally must pay damages because of bodily injury or property damage,when such damage is caused by an accident which results from garage operations involving the ownership,maintenance or use of covered autos.
it is assumed for purposes of this analysis in this part b that kevin was an insured under the policy.see discussion,parts c and d,post.does not assert its alleged lack of ownership or that it legally transferred ownership to kevin as grounds to affirm the judgment.only argues on appeal its interpretation of the policy language.
there is no dispute that kevin was legally obligated to pay damages because of the bodily injury and property damage suffered by obtained a judgment against kevin in excess of that plaintiff damages were caused by an accident.it is likewise undisputed that the blazer was a covered auto under section i of the coverage form,which defines covered autos as any auto.
whether the policy potentially covers plaintiff damage therefore turns on whether kevin accident result ed from garage operations involving the ownership,maintenance or use of the blazer.italics added.to resolve that issue,we must determine what constitutes a garage operation.the policy defines garage operations as follows garage operations means the ownership,maintenance or use of locations for garage business and that portion of the roads or other accesses that adjoin these locations.garage operations includes the ownership,maintenance or use of the autos indicated in section i of this coverage form as covered autos.garage operations also include all operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.
the definition of garage operations consists of three sentences.the first sentence is a general statement that the term garage operations refers to the ownership,maintenance,or use of locations for a garage business the second and third sentences modify and clarify the general statement made in the first sentence.the second sentence states that garage operations include the ownership,maintenance or use of covered autos.the third sentence states that garage operations also includes operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.it thus appears that although the second and third sentences both modify the first,they are distinct from and independent of one another.
the second sentence is particularly relevant here.that sentence expressly defines garage operation to include the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.in other words,an insured use of a covered auto defined in section i of the policy as any auto is itself a garage operation,as defined in the policy.there is no additional requirement that the use of the covered auto also be related to triple crown business of selling or repairing motor vehicles.the policy basic coverage provision thus encompasses liability for bodily injury or property damage incurred by an insured that is caused by an accident and that results from an insured use of any auto kevin an insured use of the blazer a covered auto was thus,under the policy,a garage operation.because the accident resulted from kevin use of the blazer,plaintiff bodily injuries fall within the basic coverage provision of the policy.
the best indicator of an insured reasonable expectation of coverage is,of course,the language of the insurance policy.trb investments,fireman fund ins,supra,cal th at,d,parties intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract powerine,supra,cal th at,d,haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d.it is not our role to speculate on the policyholder abstract expectations,but rather to consider reasonable expectations defined by the insurer policy language.citation.we must apply rules of construction of insurance contracts to ascertain what reasonable expectations were created by the insurer in drafting its policy.jauregui ins.th,fn,d.the policy in this case reasonably can be read to afford coverage for liability arising from an insured use of any automobile,whether that use was miles or five blocks from triple crown lot.moreover,a dealership such as triple crown presumably needs insurance for such activities as test drives and customers driving onto the lot.there is no indication that triple crown had any liability policy other than the garage operations policy.for these reasons,triple crown objectively would have a reasonable expectation of coverage.
the interpretation of the garage operations provision is consistent with interpretations of similar policy provisions by commentators and courts in other jurisdictions.t he significant criterion for coverage under a garage operations policy is whether the vehicle involved is an insured vehicle under the policy,and not the nature of its use when the accident occurred.arnold beacon ins.of america so d,italics added accord,burr nationwide mut.ins,burr leitner,supra.as stated in one leading treatise,usually,the policy by its terms insures against loss from liability imposed by law upon the insured for injury to person or damage to property as a result of accidents caused by or through the business of the insured upon the premises described in the policy,or outside such premises if caused by the insured or its employees engaged in the discharge of their duties in said business,or caused by or through the ownership,maintenance,use,or operation of any automobile.thus,it has been formally recognized that garage liability policies ordinarily cover more hazards than most liability policies.couch on insurance,italics added.
as the foregoing authorities demonstrate,the general understanding of the term garage operations in the insurance context is contrary to the narrow interpretation advanced by in this case.as the court in burr,supra,explained in rejecting an interpretation identical to,it seems clear that the definition of the term garage operations includes three components of coverage.first,there is coverage for liability arising from the ownership,maintenance or use of the locations utilized as the garage business.second,there is coverage for the ownership,maintenance or use of the autos specified in the policy as covered vehicles.third,coverage is available for all operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.the insurer appears to argue that the first coverage,involving the garage location,must also be deemed to form a limitation on the second coverage dealing with automobiles.it contends that to be covered the operation,maintenance,and use of an insured vehicle must be around the garage premises,or at least closely interwoven with some activity arising from the garage operation.however,it seems clear to us that the second coverage deals generally with the ownership,maintenance,and use of the covered vehicles and is not narrowly confined to garage business uses.id.at,fns.omitted,italics added.as the court in burr noted,the insurer could have include d a standard clause which limits the motor vehicle coverage to the ownership,maintenance or use of any automobile in connection with garage operations.id.at,fn.it did not in that case,and neither did policy at issue here.see atlantic mutual ins.travelers ins,supra,d at fn.garagekeepers coverage limited to bodily injury arising out of the ownership maintenance or use of the premises for the purposes described in the declarations and all operations necessary or incidental thereto.
relies on miesen bolich d.miesen for the proposition that there must be a link between the accident causing injury and the policyholder garage operations.miesen has no bearing on this case.in miesen,the insured was a service station and repair shop that also rented a few pieces of equipment to third parties using the same premises.a man rented a truck from the insured he was injured when negligently maintained side rails failed while he was loading furniture into the truck.he fell backwards from the bed of the truck to the pavement.id.at.the issue was whether the insured negligent maintenance of the truck was necessary or incidental to the insured business.id.at.
unlike miesen,d,the coverage in this case does not arise from the policy coverage for all operations necessary or incidental to a garage business.as discussed above,that definition of garage operations is separate from and independent of the portion of the definition relevant is,the definition of garage operations to include the use of covered autos by an insured.in this case,the bodily injury to plaintiff was caused by an accident,and resulted from kevin use of the definition,a garage operation,assuming kevin otherwise qualifies as an insured.
customer exclusion 
as a separate and alternative basis for affirming the summary judgment,asserts that kevin was excluded from the definition of insured as a matter of law because he was a customer of triple crown with other insurance available to him in excess of the minimum required by california financial responsibility laws.the trial court declined to grant summary adjudication of this issue,concluding that the term customer is ambiguous when applied to a minor for whom a vehicle is purchased by another.the evidence before the trial court at the summary judgment proceeding suggests that kevin was not a customer as that term is used in the policy because he was not the purchaser or potential purchaser of the blazer.
it is undisputed that triple crown was in the business of selling used cars,and that the policy declarations page stated that triple crown business was used car sales.the policy excludes from the definition of insureds,your customers,if your business is shown in the declarations as an auto dealership.this exclusion does not apply to customers who are uninsured or who carry insurance less than that required by the financial responsibility laws.see,subd.d,subd.a see also universal underwriters ins.gewirtz cal d,fn,tilley truck ins.exchange d,fn.it is also undisputed that kevin was covered by other insurance in excess of that required by the financial responsibility laws.whether the exclusion applies thus turns on whether kevin was a customer within the meaning of the policy.
the policy does not define the term customer,and california authority has not addressed this specific insurance policy issue.we therefore look to the term ordinary and popular meaning.zurich american ins.cal th,d.dictionary definitions of customer with respect to the usage relevant refer to a purchaser or buyer.see,webster new internat.dict,one that purchases some commodity or service black law dict.ed,a buyer,purchaser,consumer or patron ballentine law dict.ed,in common usage,a person who buys the merchandise or engages the services of another person.it appears that courts in other states have concluded that one who purchases or who is a potential purchaser of a motor vehicle is a customer within the meaning of an auto dealership garage operations liability policy.see haro universal underwriters ins,mutual service cas.ins.west bend mut,general acc.ins.of america hughes,american states ins.hartford cas.ins,winn becker,aubrey harleysville ins.companies,frontier ford,carabba,guient timmons,so d,employee of purchaser not a customer when driving to dealership on behalf of employer after sale was completed.
courts have similarly defined customer in other contexts with reference to one who purchases good or services.see,jim auto body commissioner of motor vehicles,construing statutory phrase customers of dealers and repairers consistent with common usage to mean one who furnishes payment for the repair of a vehicle movers,chastain,approving class definition of customers as those who engaged and paid,or caused to be paid,charges for storage insurance or insurance for storage fink florida unemployment appeals commission so d,phrase home depot customer in employer policy meant people who purchased materials from home depot empire gas graham,construing customers as used in restrictive covenant to mean one who has repeated dealings with a particular tradesman or business see also jtl consulting,shanahan,following empire gas.
in sales transactions triple crown required purchasers to sign a retail installment sales contract,even though,as here,the vehicle was paid for in full apparently,triple crown would permit only an adult to sign such a contract.kevin was a minor.it therefore appears that triple crown would not have sold kevin a vehicle under any circumstances.it is undisputed that the blazer was purchased not by kevin,but by kevin father,anthony.the contract of sale was signed solely by anthony,who paid the entire purchase price in cash.kevin did not pay any money to triple crown,nor did he sign the contract as a,although the contract provided spaces for a signature.the purchase and sale transaction concerning the blazer was thus a transaction between anthony as purchaser and triple crown as seller.by the time of the accident,as between the purchaser and seller,that transaction was complete.at the time of the accident,therefore,kevin was neither a party nor potential party to the purchase transaction.consequently,for purposes of this sale,kevin was not triple crown customer.
the fact that anthony purchased the blazer to give to kevin is not determinative of kevin status as a customer.to conclude that kevin is the customer would mean that every gift recipient is the customer of the retailer from whom the gift was purchased.that is not how the term customer is commonly understood.for whatever purpose anthony purchased the car,it was anthony who purchased it.triple crown would not do business with kevin and therefore did not treat him as the customer.
it is not significant that kevin signed the dmv paperwork and that the blazer was to be registered in kevin name.as the district court stated in its memorandum decision in the progressive action,the substance of the transaction was that anthony purchased the vehicle from triple crown,and was subsequently to transfer title to the vehicle to kevin.that the parties sought,albeit ineffectively,to shortcut the formalities of the registration process does not change the fundamental nature of the transaction.as james kane,triple crown manager,testified,kevin was listed as the purchaser on the dmv paperwork b ecause that was the wishes sic of anthony mccarty italics added not because it was kevin wish,or the wishes of both anthony and kevin.kane testimony supports the conclusion that with respect to the sale of the blazer,triple crown considered anthony to be its customer.
argues that,because kevin participated in choosing the blazer and test drove,was a customer of triple crown.even if prior to the purchase kevin was a potential customer,any such potentiality went unrealized when anthony purchased the blazer from triple crown.kevin was neither a customer nor a potential customer when the accident occurred a week after anthony had purchased and paid for the car.
also argues that james kane of triple crown testified that he would consider a minor to be a customer when they came into the shop accompanied by a parent.kane testimony is not so clear as represents.as noted above,triple crown would enter sales contracts only with adult purchasers.kane testified,well,it was my belief that once the customer enters into a legal binding contract,the contract state
