douglas stalley stalley filed seven separate lawsuits in the district courts in addition to numerous cases in other jurisdictions against different that methodist healthcare methodist,sumner regional health systems,sumner,erlanger health system erlanger,wellmont health system wellmont,mountain states health alliance mountain states,covenant health covenant,and the baptist health system of east tennessee baptist collectively referred to as appellees all violated the medicare secondary payer act msp,b.in none of the virtually identical complaints does stalley allege any direct injury.instead,the complaints are premised on his belief that the msp is a qui tam statute granting him standing to sue as a private attorney general.the several district courts,following the clear language of the msp and a plethora of case law,separately ruled that the msp is not a qui tam statute and,therefore,stalley does not have article iii standing to raise these claims.stalley appeals those decisions.because we find no basis upon which to hold that the msp is a qui tam statute,and no basis upon which to find that stalley can otherwise demonstrate standing,we affirm the judgments of the district courts.
background 
procedural history 
stalley sued appellees complaining that they violated the msp by failing to reimburse medicare for unspecified payments that medicare supposedly advanced to treat unspecified medical errors made with regard to unspecified medicare beneficiaries at unspecified health care facilities owned by appellees.appellees all filed motions to dismiss,asserting that stalley lacked standing to raise his claim,fed.civ.proc.b and that stalley failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,fed.civ.proc.b.
the district court for the eastern district of tennessee consolidated the actions filed in that district,namely,those against erlanger,wellmont,mountain states,covenant and baptist,and dismissed the claims,both because stalley lacked article iii standing to assert them and because stalley failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court for the middle district of tennessee dismissed stalley complaint against sumner on the same grounds.finally,the district court for the western district of tennessee dismissed stalley claim against methodist,holding that stalley lacked standing to assert his claim the court did not address the question of whether stalley had raised a claim upon which relief could be granted.all of the district courts held that the msp is not a qui tam statute.stalley timely appealed all three decisions,and the cases were consolidated for appeal because they raise identical issues of law and fact as to all appellees.

iii.analysis 
a.the msp is not a qui tam statute.
stalley,as the party invoking federal subject matter jurisdiction,has the burden of demonstrating that he satisfies each element of article iii standing.courtney smith,cir citing lujan defenders of wildlife,d see also vermont agency of natural resources united states ex rel.stevens,d as we have frequently explained,a plaintiff must meet three requirements in order to establish article iii standing.the irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements.lujan,at.first,stalley must show that he has suffered an injury in fact.id.he must have suffered a harm that is both concrete and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.agency,at.quoting whitmore arkansas,d.second,stalley must establish a causal connection between the alleged injury and the appellees conduct of which he complains.lujan,at.that is,the injury must be fairly traceable to the appellees actions.id.quoting simon eastern.welfare rights organization,d.third,stalley must demonstrate that the injury is redressable in this action.agency,at.there must be a substantial likelihood,as opposed to mere speculation,that a favorable decision in this court will redress stalley alleged injury,lujan,at.
stalley does not claim that appellees alleged conduct injured him personally.he does not allege that he is a medicare beneficiary,that he is medicare eligible,or that he was denied by some primary payer coverage for a medical procedure.thus,it is irrefutable that stalley does not have standing in the traditional sense to bring this action.stalley claim is that the of the provision for a private right of action set out in b is actually a qui tam statute that affords stalley standing to bring his claims on behalf of the united states as a private attorney general.therefore,we must decide whether the msp is in fact a qui tam statute.
a qui tam statute allows a private person to bring an action in the name of the united states,that will benefit both the person and the government.agency,at.the qui tam action is for redress of an injury to the government it is the government injury that confers standing upon the private person,id.at,and the qui tam plaintiff has standing because he is a partial assignee of the united states claims against a defendant,id.at.as the.agency court detailed account of the history of qui tam actions makes clear,in the united states,the right to bring a qui tam action is entirely created by statute.see id.at.see also united seniors,at there presently is no right to
