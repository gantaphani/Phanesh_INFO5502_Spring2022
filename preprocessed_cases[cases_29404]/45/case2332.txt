plaintiff brian cuevas,through his guardian ad litem,brought an action for medical malpractice against defendant the county of contra costa,among others,arising out of injuries he sustained at birth.a jury awarded him as the present cash value of his future medical and rehabilitation care expenses.defendant appeals from the damages verdict,asserting,among other things,that the trial court erred in excluding evidence that health insurance benefits under the patient protection and affordable care act aca,stat.would be available to mitigate plaintiff future medical costs.we agree that the trial court erred in ruling that evidence of future aca benefits is inadmissible.we reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial on the amount of plaintiff future medical damages.in light of our conclusion,we also reverse the postjudgment orders awarding costs and expert fees.
factual background and procedural history 
background 
because defendant does not contest the jury findings of liability and proximate cause,we need not address the facts of this case in great detail.plaintiff suffered irreversible brain damage in utero while his mother pregnancy was being managed by teresa madrigal,a physician employed by defendant.plaintiff is the surviving twin of a pregnancy a condition whereby identical twins share a placenta,but have separate amniotic sacs.
when plaintiff mother reported for an appointment at weeks and six days pregnant,only one fetal heartbeat could be detected.she was transferred to a hospital by ambulance,where the twins were delivered via caesarian section.plaintiff twin had died,and plaintiff had suffered a hypoxic brain injury.as a result,plaintiff has a very low verbal iq and will never be a functional reader.he also has serious language communication difficulties,significant behavioral problems,and has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.though he has severe developmental delay,he is sociable.he is toilet trained and can walk,run,and feed himself.in the future,he will be able to feed,dress,and bathe himself.however,he will be dependent on others for his personal care and safety for the rest of his life.
on april,plaintiff,through his guardian ad litem,filed a first amended complaint fac against contra costa county health services and other defendant health care providers and medical centers.the fac alleges two causes of action medical malpractice as to plaintiff,and negligent infliction of emotional distress as to his mother plaintiff theory at trial was that he sustained his injury because madrigal breached the applicable standard of care by failing to schedule his delivery prior to weeks gestation.the case was tried to a jury,which found in plaintiff favor on liability.defendant does not contest this finding on appeal.
plaintiff and defendant life care plans 
during discovery,plaintiff disclosed a life care plan prepared by jan roughan,in which she provided her opinion as to the kind of medical and rehabilitative care he will need for the rest of his life,along with the projected costs for each specific care item.her plan was based on the recommendations of medical specialists who testified on plaintiff behalf.as to future medical costs,the plan does not account for service discounts associated with,even though plaintiff is currently receiving benefits.nor does it reflect negotiated discounts that would potentially be available under insurance procured through the aca.instead,roughan determined future costs for plaintiff medical care by referencing a national database that reflects the average charges billed for each type of service.
defendant life care planner,linda olzack,prepared life care plans based on services recommended by a defense pediatric neurologist.in contrast to roughan,olzack plans reflect three alternate cost scenarios,including one in which plaintiff would continue to be covered by,one in which he would procure private insurance under the aca,and one in which he would pay for his expenses out of pocket.with respect to the private pay scenario,olzack did not rely on amounts billed by healthcare providers in calculating future medical expenses.instead,she contacted local health care providers and asked them how much individuals without insurance are required to pay.these rates typically are less than what providers would state on a bill.
olzack alternative plans reflect the wide variations that presently exist in medical charging practices.her life care plan reflects reimbursement rates that appear to be substantially lower than the rates paid by persons without insurance.for example,one category of expenses reflects a more than percent difference between the private pay rate and the rate.within her plans,she also took into consideration the free benefits that plaintiff is currently entitled to receive from the regional center and public school system.
olzack also prepared a report comparing the costs for the services itemized in roughan plan with the payment rate for the same goods and services,revealing that roughan costs were substantially higher.for example,the cost for a wide variety of physician visits listed in roughan plan were four to six times higher than the corresponding rates 
evidentiary rulings 
on january,plaintiff filed various motions in limine,including one seeking to exclude evidence of collateral source payments from and other public sources,and another to exclude evidence of future collateral sources.plaintiff also filed a motion to exclude evidence,opinion,or argument regarding any possible future medical benefits available through insurance.in part,plaintiff asserted that civil code section section,a statute contained within the medical injury compensation reform act micra,does not allow the introduction of evidence regarding future collateral source medical benefits.he contended defendant expert should be prohibited from offering opinions as to such evidence.
on july,defendant filed further briefing on the issue of future medical benefits.in support of its argument that evidence of prospective aca benefits should be offered to the jury,it included a declaration prepared by thomas dawson,an expert on the aca and regulatory and health care policy,who worked for the united states house of representatives during the passage of the aca and was directly involved in negotiating key provisions of the legislation.
after hearing argument,the trial court ruled that defendant could not present as a offset any evidence concerning publicly funded benefits available through regional centers and the public school system.relying on section,it also ruled defendant could not introduce any evidence of benefits,nor could it introduce evidence of aca insurance benefits.with respect to,the court ruled that is not subject to micra exception to the collateral source rule.with respect to the aca,the court also reasoned i believe that there is no reasonable certainty that that benefit will be in place,and that something that you have to cross that barrier in order to be considered as something that should be presented to the jury for factual consideration.
on august,defendant filed a request for clarification regarding the presentation of evidence as to plaintiff future medical expenses.specifically,it asserted roughan had relied on inflated billed amounts in calculating the cost of plaintiff future medical care,rather than the lower amounts providers actually accept as full payment.defendant questioned whether the trial court had intended to allow the introduction of such evidence when it made its earlier rulings on plaintiff motions in limine.defendant suggested the evidence should instead be limited to the amounts health care providers will accept in the future as full payment.
defendant noted roughan life care plan did not reflect the substantially lower amounts that would be accepted as full payment under or private insurance it relied heavily on howell hamilton meats provisions,cal th howell and corenbaum lampkin th corenbaum in arguing that plaintiff recovery should be limited to the amount he proves is likely to be paid to providers for his future medical care,not the amount his providers are likely to bill.it contended that the billed rates reflected in roughan plan were therefore inadmissible.
defendant also asked whether it would be allowed to introduce evidence concerning the range of amounts healthcare providers accept as full payment,without making reference to the actual sources,or private insurance of those payments.defendant asserted that introducing these reduced amounts would assist the jury in evaluating the reasonable value of plaintiff future medical care,without violating the collateral source rule by disclosing the third party source of payment.it reasoned t he fact that does not fall within the exception to the collateral source rule of micra is completely separate from the issue of whether the county may introduce evidence regarding the amounts will pay for a service,without referencing the source of payment.in the former scenario,the county would be seeking to be completely relieved from paying for a service that will cover,while in the latter,the county simply seeks to provide the jury with all of the information needed to determine the reasonable value of plaintiff future medical care.
the trial court stated that it would allow evidence of roughan reliance on the national database to project plaintiff medical costs into the future because it not relying on past billed amounts.the court also indicated it would permit olzack to testify that she had based her own calculations on the lower amounts that are accepted by healthcare providers under certain circumstances the private pay scenario.however,defendant would not be allowed to attempt to establish that future billed amounts do not reflect the amounts that will actually be accepted by the providers.
defendant also sought a modified version of caci with the modification italicized to recover damages for future medical expenses,plaintiff brian cuevas must prove the reasonable cost of reasonably necessary medical care that he is reasonably certain to need in the future.the damages awarded for future medical expenses can not exceed the amount that is reasonably certain to be owed or paid to plaintiff healthcare providers in the future for that care.the trial court rejected defendant proposed modification.
evidence offered at trial 
roughan life care plan was admitted in evidence during her testimony.subsequently,olzack was permitted to testify about her life care plan,the only version of her three plans that the trial court allowed into evidence.olzack noted that her plan identifies the providers her office contacted to obtain her cost estimates.as to the specific services listed for future medical care,her task was not to make care recommendations,but only to determine how much the recommended services will cost.unlike roughan,olzack did not rely on the charged amounts that appear in national health care cost databases.notwithstanding their different approaches,olzack plan reflects essentially the same costs as roughan plan for many life care categories.
based on a projected remaining life expectancy of years,plaintiff economist calculated the total value of his future care expenses under roughan life care plan to be million,with a present value of nearly million.in contrast,defendant economist took the rates to which olzack was permitted to testify and concluded that the present value of plaintiff future service needs totaled somewhere between and.defendant claims these estimates would have been significantly lower if olzack had been able to factor into her analysis the free benefits plaintiff receives from the regional center and the school system,as well as discounted medical care rates that would apply under or a private insurance policy.
jury instructions and verdict 
the jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded million for future medical,hospital,surgical,and rehabilitation care expenses,which it reduced to in present cash value.the total represents approximately of what plaintiff had sought,and about three times the total in the private pay version of olzack plan that the trial court admitted into evidence.following posttrial motions,defendant appealed from the judgment and postjudgment orders awarding plaintiff costs and expert witness fees.
discussion 
issues and standard of review 
on appeal,defendant asserts the trial court committed four categories of error,all pertaining to its rulings regarding evidence of the costs for plaintiff future care defendant claims the court erred in barring evidence under section of future benefits that will be available to plaintiff through the aca ruling that his future medical expenses could be based upon figures derived from billed rates relying on the collateral source rule to exclude evidence concerning insurance benefits available under the aca and relying on the collateral source rule to exclude evidence of free regional center and educational benefits.
trial courts ordinarily enjoy broad discretion with respect to the admission and exclusion of evidence in ruling on motions in limine.katiuzhinsky perry th.nonetheless,that discretion is limited by the legal principles applicable to the case.ibid.where a trial court exclusion or admission of evidence transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law,it is an abuse of discretion.ibid.thus,to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion here,we must first determine what the law permits and requires with respect to the recovery of future medical damages under micra.
ii.the collateral source rule and section 
the collateral source rule provides that if an injured party received some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor,such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.citation.therefore,the collateral source rule precludes a defendant from presenting evidence that an injured plaintiff medical expenses have been paid by an independent source.citation.while the rule may effectively allow a plaintiff to receive a double recovery,t he collateral source rule expresses a policy judgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for personal injuries and for other eventualities.to permit the defendant to tell the jury that the plaintiff has been recompensed by a collateral source for his medical costs might irretrievably upset the complex,delicate,and somewhat indefinable calculations which result in the normal jury verdict.hernandez california hospital medical center th,hernandez.
in response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis in california,the legislature in adopted micra.barme wood cal d,barme.section alters the collateral source rule in medical malpractice cases.a medical malpractice defendant may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of the personal injury pursuant to the united states social security act,any state or federal income disability or worker compensation act,any health,sickness or insurance,accident insurance that provides health benefits or coverage,and any contract or agreement of any group,organization,partnership,or corporation to provide,pay for,or reimburse the cost of medical,hospital,dental,or other health care services,subd.a,fn.omitted.if the medical malpractice defendant introduces evidence of the plaintiff collateral source benefits,the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any payments made to obtain these benefits.ibid.this section also provides that n o source of collateral benefits introduced pursuant to subdivision a shall recover any amount against the plaintiff nor shall it be subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff against a defendant,subd.b.under section,the jury is informed of collateral source benefits and may elect not to award damages that duplicate those benefits.barme,at,fn.
courts have held that section does not apply to payments made on behalf of an injured party by welf.inst.code,et hernandez,supra,th at.in brown stewart d,brown,the appellate court concluded that applying section to medicaid payments for medical services would create a direct conflict with provisions of federal law that require states to seek reimbursement of medicaid payments from third party tortfeasors.therefore,the collateral source rule continues to apply in medical malpractice cases as to payments.
iii.evidence regarding future benefits is admissible under section 
section is ambiguous with respect to awards of future damages 
the trial court ruled that section does not allow the introduction of evidence regarding future health insurance benefits only past benefits.defendant asserts that section allows the introduction of future as well as past collateral source medical benefits,thereby allowing the jury to decide whether to reduce a plaintiff damages award for future medical expenses.
the issue is one of statutory interpretation.a court primary task in interpreting a statute is to determine the legislature intent,giving effect to the law purpose.citation.the court consider s first the words of a statute,as the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.words must be construed in context,and statutes must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.tuolumne jobs small business alliance superior court cal th.if,however,the statutory language may reasonably be given more than one interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.people cornett cal th.
again,section provides,in relevant part in the event the defendant so elects,he may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of the personal injury pursuant to the united states social security act,any state or federal income disability or worker compensation act,any health,sickness or insurance,accident insurance that provides health benefits or coverage,and any contract or agreement of any group,organization,partnership,or corporation to provide,pay for,or reimburse the cost of medical,hospital,dental,or other health care services.where the defendant elects to introduce such evidence,the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any amount which the plaintiff has paid or contributed to secure his right to any insurance benefits concerning which the defendant has introduced evidence,subd.a,italics added,fn.omitted.defendant argues that the statute use of the term amount payable,instead of amount paid,contemplates that evidence of future benefits should be admissible as well.we agree.
while the meaning of paid as used in subdivision a of this section is clear,in that it references that amount which a plaintiff has already paid to obtain insurance benefits,we agree with defendant that amount payable is ambiguous insofar as it could apply to amounts that will be payable in the future as well as to amounts that were payable in the past an argument can be made that amount payable should be restricted to past medical expenses because the statute only includes an offset for those premiums that a plaintiff has already paid or contributed.however,section does not explicitly limit the presentation of a defendant evidence to past benefits.
preliminarily,we observe we are not alone in entertaining the notion that section permits the introduction of evidence of future collateral source benefits that a plaintiff is likely to receive.a footnote in fein permanente medical group cal d,fein supports the conclusion that available medical insurance can be used by the jury to reduce a medical malpractice plaintiff future medical damages award fein,at,fn.in fein,the trial court used an anomalous procedure in implementing section.it did not permit evidence of collateral source benefits to be introduced into evidence.rather,because the amount of such benefits was not in dispute,the court ruled that it would simply reduce the verdict by the amount of the benefits.neither party objected.fein,at,fn,fn.thereafter,the jury awarded,inter alia,in future medical expenses,and the trial court ordered the defendant to pay the first of those expenses not covered by medical insurance provided by plaintiff employer,as such expenses were incurred.id.at.
although this reimbursement procedure was not raised as an issue on appeal,the supreme court observed in the footnote referenced above that the plaintiff did raise a minor contention which is somewhat related to this matter.fein,supra,cal d at,fn.the court explained in awarding damages applicable to plaintiff future medical expenses,the trial court indicated that defendant was to pay the first of such expenses that were not covered by medical insurance.plaintiff,pointing out that he may not be covered by medical insurance in the future,apparently objects to any reduction of future damages on the basis of potential future collateral source benefits.under the terms of the trial court judgment,however,defendant liability for such damages will be postponed only if plaintiff does in fact receive such collateral benefits thus,it is difficult to see how plaintiff has any cause to complain about this aspect of the award.indeed,if anything,the trial court may have given plaintiff more than he was entitled to,since it did not reduce the jury award by the collateral source benefits plaintiff was likely to receive,but instead imposed a continuing liability on defendant to pay up to a total of for any noncovered medical expenses that plaintiff may incur in the future as a result of the injury.defendant has not objected to this portion of the judgment,first italics in,second italics added.
concededly,the relevant language in fein appears to be dicta however,in support of its argument,defendant also draws our attention to several federal court cases holding that section allows the admission of evidence of future insurance benefits.in brewington united states.july,no.cv cwx dist.lexis brewington,the district court concluded section applies to future benefits,and held that evidence concerning future benefits could be introduced at trial.id.at pp.however,that decision noted the ninth circuit had not yet explicitly held that section applies to actions under the federal tort claims act et.brewington,at.nevertheless,it relied on unpublished california authority and a district court case,silong united states,dist.lexis,at pp.silong,in finding it appropriate to take insurance benefits available under the aca into consideration in calculating reasonable future life care plan needs.brewington,at.because we conclude the term amount payable is ambiguous,we turn to extrinsic interpretation aids.
purpose of micra and public policy 
we recently had occasion to reflect on the significant reform created by micra legislation.in may,the governor citing serious problems that had arisen throughout the state as a result of a rapid increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums convened the legislature in extraordinary session to consider measures aimed at remedying the situation.in response,the legislature enacted micra,a lengthy statute which attacked the problem on several fronts.citation.in broad outline,the act sought to curtail unwarranted insurance premium increases by authorizing alternative insurance coverage programs and by establishing new procedures to review substantial rate increases,and attempted to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of medical malpractice litigation by revising a number of legal rules applicable to such litigation.chan curran th,fn.omitted see american bank trust community hospital cal d.
defendant asserts that as a matter of practice and policy,maintaining a distinction between past and future insurance benefits makes no sense because of the public strong interest in containing medical malpractice liability.we note t he cases agree that micra provisions should be construed liberally in order to promote the legislative interest in negotiated resolution of medical malpractice disputes and to reduce malpractice insurance premiums.preferred risk mutual ins.reiswig cal th.
as the supreme court stated in fein because section,subdivision a is likely to lead to lower malpractice awards,there can be no question but that this provision directly relates to micra objective of reducing the costs incurred by malpractice defendants and their insurers.and,as we have seen,the legislature could reasonably have determined that the reduction of such costs would serve the public interest by preserving the availability of medical care throughout the state and by helping to assure that patients who were injured by medical malpractice in the future would have a source of medical liability insurance to cover their losses.fein,supra,cal d at.interpreting the statute as abrogating the collateral source rule with respect to future medical benefits as well as past benefits is consistent with the legislative purpose of reducing malpractice insurance costs.
legislative history 
the legislative history of section also supports our conclusion,as it suggests the legislature intended to allow evidence of benefits payable both in the past and in the future 
assembly bill ex.sess.assem.bill was enacted and codified as section.all of assem.bill predecessor bills,including assembly bill ex,as introduced may,assem.bill,and ex.sess.as introduced june,assem.bill,identified the legislature desire to eliminate duplicative damages,including duplicative future damages,for the cost of medical care in actions for personal injuries against health care providers or health care institutions when such care has already been or will be provided by a collateral source.bill reg.sess.as amended may,bill,subd.d,italics added accord assem.bill assem.bill ex.sess.as amended,assem.bill,subd.c assem.bill assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,see also assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,containing substantially similar language.
while p rior unpassed bills generally have little value in showing legislative intent medical board superior court th,here the predecessor bills are instructive.this is because the assembly committee on judiciary acknowledged the relationship between assem.bill and its predecessor bills,stating that assem.bill incorporates the concepts or language of the following assembly bills introduced during the regular or special session,referencing assem.bills and.since the adopted bill,assem.bill,incorporated the concepts or language of the prior bills,it is not unreasonable to conclude the legislative intent to extend the statute reach to future damages was adopted as well 
and while the legislature used the past tense in section,subdivision a with respect to a plaintiff right to offer evidence regarding the amount he or she has paid or contributed to secure a collateral source benefit,prior versions of the bills,including those that expressly provided that a defendant could introduce evidence of future care that will be provided by a collateral source,contained this same language concerning the amount a plaintiff has paid or contributed.bill assem.bill.this suggests the legislature did not understand the use of paid or contributed to restrict the term amount payable to past collateral source benefits only.further,our interpretation is consistent with the cardinal principle of statutory construction that we are required to give it an interpretation based upon the legislative intent with which it was passed.friends of mammoth board of supervisors cal d.in sum,we conclude section permits the introduction of evidence regarding future as well as past medical benefits.the trial court thus erred in relying on this section to bar defendant from introducing evidence of future benefits 
d.the collateral source rule and howell 
defendant asserts the trial court erred independent of section by relying on the collateral source rule to exclude evidence of the aca and the amounts that healthcare providers typically accept as payment for their services.defendant relies on howell,supra,cal th for the proposition that negotiated payment amounts and the aca guaranteed issue and renewal requirements are highly probative because they are of substantial probative value in determining the reasonable value of plaintiff medical services.defendant reasoning is persuasive.
howell addressed whether a plaintiff could recover from a tortfeasor economic damages for amounts billed by a medical provider in excess of the discounted sum the provider agreed to accept as full payment for past medical services pursuant to a preexisting contract with the plaintiff health insurance carrier.howell ultimately concluded the plaintiff was limited to recovering the amount actually paid on his behalf because the billed amounts did not represent an economic loss the plaintiff incurred.howell,supra,cal th at.
the howell court explained it was not abrogating or modifying the collateral source rule,it simply found the rule inapplicable the rule has no bearing on amounts that were included in a provider bill but for which the plaintiff never incurred liability because the provider,by prior agreement,accepted a lesser amount as full payment.such sums are not damages the plaintiff would otherwise have collected from the defendant.they are neither paid to the providers on the plaintiff behalf nor paid to the plaintiff in indemnity of his or her expenses.because they do not represent an economic loss for the plaintiff,they are not recoverable in the first instance.howell,supra,cal th at.howell affirmed the vitality of the evidentiary aspect of the collateral source rule,stating evidence that payments were made in whole or in part by an insurer remains generally inadmissible.id.at.the court declined to opine as to the relevance or admissibility of the full billed amount with respect to noneconomic damages or future medical expenses.ibid.
the appellate court in corenbaum addressed issues left open in howell,supra,cal th at page.the court held evidence of the full amount billed for a plaintiff medical care is not relevant to damages for future medical care or noneconomic damages,concluding that the admission of such evidence was error.corenbaum,supra,th at.the court reasoned the trial court erroneous admission of such evidence was prejudicial in that case because the record clearly demonstrate d that the damages awards were based on the full amount billed and not on the lesser amount the plaintiff medical providers had accepted as full payment.id.at.the court reversed and remanded for a new trial limited to the issue of compensatory damages.id.at.
a recent case from the second appellate district,markow rosner th markow,cites to howell and corenbaum,explaining our supreme court has endorsed a market or exchange value as the proper way to think about the reasonable value of medical services.citation.this applies to the calculation of future medical expenses.citation.for insured plaintiffs,the reasonable market or exchange value of medical services will not be the amount billed by a medical provider or hospital,but the amount paid pursuant to the reduced rate negotiated by the plaintiff insurance company.markow,at.
in markow,the plaintiffs life care planning expert estimated that the amount billed for the injured party future hospitalizations would be approximately million.she also testified that the amount actually paid is usually to percent of the total amount billed,while noting that with respect to one particular hospitalization,the injured party cost had been reimbursed at a much lower rate of percent.she also testified that reimbursement rates vary and that there is no one,set percentage.markow,supra,th at.the jury awarded million for the cost of future hospitalizations,which the defendant claimed was excessive because the plaintiffs expert did not consider amounts actually paid for hospitalization.id.at.if the jury had applied the percent rate,he argued,the award for future hospitalizations would have been reduced to.id.at.citing the expert testimony,the appellate court found substantial evidence supported the jury award of million,which was roughly halfway between the expert to percent reimbursement figure.ibid.these cases support the conclusion that the collateral source rule is not violated when a defendant is allowed to offer evidence of the market value of future medical benefits.
iv.the aca 
in a related argument,defendant further faults the trial court for preventing it from introducing evidence of future bene
