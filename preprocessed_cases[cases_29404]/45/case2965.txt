insurance policies 
alonzo henry,a tenant at lakeview,sued preferred capital for damages he sustained when he jumped out of his bedroom window to avoid an intruder.at the time of henry loss,preferred capital was the named insured of a commercial general liability policy issued by american equity.it was also insured under a travelers general commercial liability policy identifying lakeview identified in the policy as a partnership as the named insured,and providing coverage for real estate managers of the named insured.both insurance policies contained virtually identical provisions regarding other insurance.each policy stated it was primary,except that it was excess over other valid and collectible insurance.
settlement and summary judgment 
the lawsuit was tendered for defense and indemnity to both travelers and american equity.travelers accepted the tender without a reservation of rights and assumed the defense of preferred capital.american equity refused to participate in the defense of the action.travelers settled the underlying lawsuit on behalf of preferred capital for and thereafter initiated the present action against american equity,seeking pro rata equitable contribution for of the costs and fees expended in the defense and settlement of alonzo henry action.
both travelers and american equity moved for summary judgment.the parties stipulated that both policies covered the liability loss that travelers defended and indemnified preferred capital,while american equity did not that other insurance provisions in both policies were applicable.on august,the trial court entered its order granting summary judgment to travelers and denying summary judgment to american equity.the court found that both policies provided primary coverage and that they contained substantially identical other insurance clauses.the court concluded that both policies provided coverage at the same level.therefore,in accordance with the general rule of policy interpretation,conflicting other insurance clauses would be ignored and travelers was entitled to contribution from american equity on a pro rata basis.the court also concluded that american equity demonstrated no equitable considerations that take the subject setting outside the general rule.the court ordered american equity to pay travelers half the expended by travelers in the underlying suit.
american equity appeals,arguing that by virtue of the indemnity provision of the property management agreement between the receiver and preferred capital,its coverage is excess to travelers primary coverage.

the two levels of insurance 
there are two levels of insurance coverage,primary and excess,reliance,supra,th at,d.primary coverage is insurance coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches immediately upon the happening of the occurrence that gives rise to liability excess or secondary coverage is coverage whereby,under the terms of the policy,liability attaches only after a predetermined amount of primary coverage has been exhausted.olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins.d,italics omitted reliance,supra,th at,d.it is settled under california law that an excess or secondary policy does not cover a loss,nor does any duty to defend the insured arise,until all of the primary insurance has been exhausted.community redevelopment agency aetna casualty surety th,d accord reliance,supra,th at,d.
other insurance clauses 
most insurance policies contain other insurance clauses that attempt to limit the insurer liability to the extent that other insurance covers the same risk.such clauses attempt to control the manner in which each insurer contributes to or shares a covered loss.citations.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.the courts will generally honor the language of excess other insurance clauses when no prejudice to the interests of the insured will ensue.however,there are many exceptions.for example,where two or more primary insurers policies contain excess other insurance clauses purporting to be excess to each other,the conflicting clauses will be ignored and the loss prorated among the insurers on the ground the insured would otherwise be deprived of protection.olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins,supra,d at.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,pp.to.thus,although a true excess that is solely and explicitly an excess insurer providing only secondary no duty to defend or indemnify until all the underlying primary coverage is exhausted or otherwise not on the risk,primary insurers with conflicting excess other insurance clauses can have immediate defense obligations.citations.fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.
other insurance clauses become relevant only where several insurers insure the same risk at the same level of coverage.an other insurance dispute can not arise between excess and primary insurers.citations.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,at,citing,among others,olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins,supra,d at,and fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at,d see also reliance,supra,th at,d.
subrogation and contribution 
the court of appeal in fireman fund ins.maryland casualty,supra,th at pages,d,explained the concepts and confusion surrounding the theories of subrogation and contribution at length as follows as one california appellate court has opined,i t is hard to imagine another set of legal terms with more soporific effect than indemnity,subrogation,contribution,and joint tortfeasorship.citation.it is also difficult to think of two legal concepts that have caused more confusion and headache for both courts and litigants than have contribution and subrogation.citation.although the concepts of contribution and subrogation are both equitable in nature,they are nevertheless distinct.citations.subrogation is defined as the substitution of another person in place of the creditor or claimant to whose rights he or she succeeds in relation to the debt or claim.by undertaking to indemnify or pay the principal debtor obligation to the creditor or claimant,the subrogee is equitably subrogated to the claimant or subrogor,and succeeds the subrogor rights against the obligor.citation.in the case of insurance,subrogation takes the form of an insurer right to be put in the position of the insured in order to pursue recovery from third parties legally responsible to the insured for a loss which the insurer has both insured and paid.citations.as now applied the doctrine of equitable subrogation is broad enough to include every instance in which one person,not acting as a mere volunteer or intruder,pays a debt for which another is primarily liable,and which in equity and good conscience should have been discharged by the latter.citations.citation.the right of subrogation is purely derivative.an insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured claim,and succeeds only to the rights of the insured.the subrogated insurer is said to stand in the shoes of its insured,because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured.thus,an insurer can not acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights,and may claim no rights which the insured does not have.citations.fn.omitted,original italics.reliance,supra,th at,d.
the court of appeal continued equitable contribution is entirely different.it is the right to recover,not from the party primarily liable for the loss,but from a who shares such liability with the party seeking contribution.in the insurance context,the right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim,and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others.where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk,each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.id.at,d,fn.omitted,original italics.as a general rule,there is no contribution between a primary and an excess carrier.id.at,fn,d citations.however,where different insurance carriers cover differing risks and liabilities,they may proceed against each other for reimbursement by subrogation rather than by contribution.citations.reliance,supra,th at,d.
in short,e quitable subrogation allows an insurer that paid coverage or defense costs to be placed in the insured position to pursue a full recovery from another insurer who was primarily responsible for the loss.citation.this doctrine commonly applies to shift defense costs between primary and excess insurers.citations.maryland casualty nationwide mutual ins.th,d.equitable contribution,on the other hand,applies to apportion costs among insurers that share the same level of liability on the same risk as to the same insured.citation.id.at,d.
rossmoor and reliance 
travelers focuses,as did the trial court,upon the insurance policies and the virtually identical language of the other insurance clauses.it argues that because both insurers insured the same risk at the same level,it has the right to equitable contribution from american equity under the general rule.
not surprisingly,american equity focuses upon the indemnity clause of the property management agreement,arguing that it was entitled to subrogation to preferred capital asserted right to indemnity from the receiver.american equity argues that because it is entitled to subrogation under the express indemnity clause of the property management agreement,its coverage is considered to be excess to that provided under the travelers policy and travelers has no right to equitable contribution from it.
american equity relies upon the california supreme court opinion in rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,hereafter rossmoor to support its analysis.travelers seeks to distinguish rossmoor and argues that reliance,supra,th,d,provides the appropriate template for analysis of the issue.neither case is on all fours with the present case.however,they provide a starting place.
in rossmoor,supra,cal d,the california supreme court addressed the rights and obligations of parties to an indemnity agreement.a sewage facility contractor had entered into an agreement with the owner of real property,wherein the contractor agreed to indemnify and hold the owner harmless for all claims for property damage or personal injury.id.at.the owner was held liable for the personal injuries and death of employees from a of an unshored trench.the owner and its insurer sought indemnity from the contractor and its liability insurer.id.at.the contractor insurer against the owner insurer seeking apportionment of sums paid under the other insurance clauses of the policies.ibid.in a court trial,the trial court found the general contractor indemnitor was negligent and the owner indemnitee was not actively negligent and therefore required the contractor to indemnify the owner under the terms of the parties indemnification agreement.the supreme court affirmed.id.at.
the supreme court also held that the owner insurance coverage,provided by a direct insurer,was excess over coverage provided by an provision in the contractor policy.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.the other insurance clauses of each policy were identical,each stating that if the insured had other insurance against a covered loss,an apportionment would be made.id.at.in denying apportionment between the insurers,the supreme court reasoned that the owner insurance company was subrogated to its insured right to indemnity from the contractor and its insurer.these subrogation rights extended to sums paid in satisfaction of the tort judgment against the owner.the supreme court viewed one factor as compelling t o apportion the loss in this case pursuant to the other insurance cl
