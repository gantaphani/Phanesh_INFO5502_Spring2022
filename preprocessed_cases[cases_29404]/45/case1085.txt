bad faith under kentucky law 
rawe argues that liberty mutual violated its good faith obligations under kentucky law in its handling of her bodily injury and uim claims.rawe also argues that liberty mutual actions during the litigation of these disputed claims and contributed to its violations of kentucky law.appellant br.at.because rawe and her parents were insured by liberty mutual under their uim policy,rawe claims stemming from liberty mutual handling of the uim claim are claims.given that haggard was the insured under the bodily injury claim,rawe claims pursuant to that policy are considered claims.see motorists mut.ins.glass.
as the supreme court of kentucky explained in guaranty national insurance company george,cooper,concurring,kentucky law recognizes four categories of claims against insurance companies bad faith,which occurs when a liability insurer failure to settle a tort claim against its insured results in a judgment in excess of the insured policy limits.id.citing eskridge educator executive insurers,bad faith,which arises when an insurer refuses to pay the claim of its own insured under a coverage provision of its policy.id.citing curry fireman fund ins,bad faith in violation of the kcpa,which allows an insured to recover against her or his insurer for an unlawful act as defined by the kcpa,see davidson amer.freightways,citing stevens motorists mut.ins,and first and bad faith in violation of the kucspa.see guaranty,at citing state farm mut.auto.ins.reeder.rawe alleges claims under all four categories.at compl.at counts.
a single test under kentucky law exists for the merits of claims,whether brought by a first or claimant or brought under common law or statute.this test,established by the supreme court of kentucky in wittmer jones,is the leading case on bad faith in kentucky,and the culmination of the development of bad faith liability in kentucky jurisprudence.davidson,at.kentucky law dictates that 
an insured must prove three elements in order to prevail against an insurance company for alleged refusal in bad faith to pay the insured claim the insurer must be obligated to pay the claim under the terms of the policy the insurer must lack a reasonable basis in law or fact for denying the claim and it must be shown that the insurer either knew there was no reasonable basis for denying the claim or acted with reckless disregard for whether such a basis existed.
cobb king liberty mut.ins,cir unpublished opinion quoting wittmer,at.the district court in this case properly identified the wittmer test as the critical kentucky standard,at order at,but did not reach the merits on any of plaintiff claims because it found that all of rawe claims failed as a matter of law for a variety of reasons.we now review the various categories of rawe claims in order to determine whether the district court properly granted judgment on the pleadings to liberty mutual.
rawe claims under kentucky common law and the kcpa 
rawe alleges that liberty mutual breached its duty to act in good faith under kentucky common law and the kcpa by failing to satisfy its obligations to pay her claim under the uim policy.at compl.at.liberty mutual argued before the district court that all of these claims are barred as a matter of law.at mem.in support of mot.for judgment on pleadings at.the district court agreed with liberty mutual,holding that any claims based upon d efendant conduct in handling p laintiff claim for uim benefits are barred under the doctrine of res judicata.at order at.upon review,we conclude that the district court reasoning in relation to plaintiff claims based upon liberty mutual conduct allegedly occurring before rawe filed her complaint in the first suit is sound,but that the district court erred in dismissing without analysis rawe claims based upon liberty mutual alleged conduct that occurred after rawe filed the complaint in the first suit.
rawe claims based upon conduct are barred by claim preclusion 
as this case involves successive diversity actions,federal res judicata principles apply,shelby ins,cir.a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.federated dep t stores,moitie,d emphasis added.we use a test for determining whether a subsequent action is barred by the doctrine of res judicata,or to be more precise in this circumstance,claim preclusion r es judicata has four elements a final decision on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction a subsequent action between the same parties or their privies an issue in the subsequent action which was litigated or which should have been litigated in the prior action and an identity of the causes of action.kane magna mixer,cir.
relying upon one of our unpublished decisions,hamilton state farm fire cas,wl cir,unpublished opinion,the district court concluded that rawe previous suit to enforce her rights under the uim policy,which ended with the district court final order recognizing the settlement agreement,precluded this subsequent action.at order at.the facts of this case closely resemble those in hamilton,where a plaintiff sued his homeowner insurer because the insurer failed to pay on the policy after the plaintiff home was destroyed by fire.id.at.after the defendant in hamilton removed the case to federal court,the plaintiff prevailed in his action to enforce the insurance agreement,and the insurer satisfied the judgment.the plaintiff then filed a subsequent action in state court for bad faith and infliction of serious emotional distress for failing to honor the homeowner policy.this case was also removed,and the district court concluded that the claims were barred by res judicata because the court found identity between the causes of action plaintiff asserted in his second suit and that which he asserted in the first suit.id.we affirmed,stating that claim preclusion barred the subsequent action because the causes of action all arose from the insurance policy issued to plaintiff by defendant,the fire which destroyed plaintiff home and defendant nonpayment of the proceeds under the policy.id.at.
we agree with the district court that our reasoning in hamilton is instructive here.as in hamilton,the causes of action here all arose from the uim policy issued to rawe by liberty mutual,the car accident that injured rawe,and liberty mutual nonpayment of the proceeds under the policy.similar to hamilton,all of the asserted causes of action stemming from liberty mutual alleged actions occurring before the first suit was filed in october arose from the same transaction,or series of transactions,and therefore they should have been litigated in the earlier action.id.the fact that rawe now asserts alternative theories of recovery and seeks a different remedy does not allow her to avoid claim preclusion,when those other theories could have been asserted and remedies could have been sought in the earlier action.id.rawe allegations of bad faith based upon liberty mutual alleged actions predating the filing of rawe first suit do not arise from entirely separate and discrete events and wrongful acts by liberty mutual than those asserted in her first uim suit.black.nationwide,cir.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiff claims under kentucky common law and the kcpa,because those claims based upon defendant conduct that allegedly occurred before rawe filed her complaint in october are barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion.
rawe claims based upon conduct are not barred by claim preclusion 
the district court did not analyze plaintiff claims based upon liberty mutual alleged conduct that occurred after rawe filed her complaint in the first lawsuit in october,but nevertheless dismissed all of her claims about the handling of the uim policy on res judicata grounds.upon review,we conclude that these claims are not barred by claim preclusion,and so we reverse the district court dismissal of these claims.
in count ii,rawe claim,and count iii,her claim under the kcpa,rawe alleges that liberty mutual actions after the october filing of her complaint in the first lawsuit constituted bad faith.rawe cites primarily liberty mutual failure to comply with the judgment for that resulted from the first lawsuit until rawe agreed to sign a release of claims extraneous to her uim policy claim as constituting bad faith.at compl.at,appellant br.at.rawe argues that because she had received the judgment,no release was required and upon liberty mutual refusal to pay,a cause of action arose.appellant br.at.she further argues that u ntil the claim is finally paid in full,the processing of the claim is not final and the transaction is still covered by kentucky law on bad faith under the kcpa and kentucky common law.id.
we agree that rawe claims that are based upon liberty mutual actions after she filed the first lawsuit to enforce the uim contract can not be barred by res judicata,because those alleged actions had not yet occurred at the time she filed the first uim suit.the district court dismissal of these claims on res judicata grounds was erroneous.simply put,rawe could not have asserted a claim that she did not have at the time.kane,at.rawe argues persuasively that these claims were not yet ripe when she filed suit to enforce her rights under the uim contract,appellant br.at,and she is correct that res judicata does not apply to claims that were not ripe at the time of the first suit.katt dykhouse,cir.rawe previous suit under the uim policy does not prospectively immunize the defendant from liability for future actionable conduct for bad faith.
we also reject the argument that res judicata bars rawe claims based upon liberty mutual alleged conduct after rawe filed the initial complaint on the theory that rawe could have amended her complaint to include this ongoing alleged wrongdoings.instead,we follow the majority rule articulated by the wright and miller treatise that an action need include only the portions of the claim due at the time of commencing that action,because the opportunity to file a supplemental complaint is not an obligation.charles alan wright,arthur miller,and edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.see also mitchell city of moore,cir w e agree with those courts holding the doctrine of claim preclusion does not necessarily bar plaintiffs from litigating claims based on conduct that occurred after the initial complaint was filed.manning city of auburn,cir w e do not believe that the res judicata preclusion of claims that could have been brought in earlier litigation includes claims which arise after the original pleading is filed in the earlier litigation.spiegel continental.bank,cir holding that res judicata does not bar new action based on alleged acts occurring after the filing of the first law suit.
as we have concluded that rawe claims based upon liberty mutual alleged conduct occurring after the filing of rawe october complaint in first lawsuit are not barred by claim preclusion,we now consider liberty mutual argument that it is entitled to judgment on the pleadings on these claims.whether liberty mutual actions demanding that rawe sign a release before it would comply with the judgment are sufficient to support rawe under kentucky common law and the kcpa is a close question,and we can find no simple answers in kentucky case law.because we conclude that liberty mutual is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that issues of material fact remain,we reverse the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings to liberty mutual with respect to the alleged conduct.
first,rawe claims do not fail as a matter of law.while liberty mutual encourages us to conclude that failure to comply with a judgment can not constitute bad faith,either under common law or the kcpa,it is unable to provide any legal authority to suggest that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this principle.the supreme court of kentucky has stated the acts complained of in a kcpa claim,like a tort claim for bad faith,must be substantial wrongs,and that mere irritations injuring pride are insufficient.capitol cadillac olds,roberts.while it is unclear whether a jury would view these actions as substantial wrongs,a reasonable jury could so view liberty mutual actions.the insurance company demand that the release be executed was certainly more than an irritation of rawe pride,as it stood in the way of her clearly protected interest s and rights under the court judgment and required her,through her attorney,to take further action to collect under the judgment.id.
furthermore,the supreme court of kentucky appears to view the question of whether an insurer actions rise to the level of unlawful conduct under the kcpa to be a question of fact,therefore rending the inquiry inappropriate for resolution on a rule c motion.see paskvan,at.in stevens motorists mutual insurance,which established that a claim against an insurer is actionable under the kcpa,the supreme court of kentucky reversed a directed verdict on a kcpa claim for the insurer,stating that when the evidence creates an issue of fact,that any particular action is unfair,false,misleading or deceptive it is to be decided by a jury.stevens,at.similarly,here it seems that the supreme court of kentucky would view the question of whether liberty mutual failure to comply with the judgment,its demand that rawe sign a complete release of all potential claims,and its compliance with the judgment only after rawe sought a writ to enforce the unfair conduct under the kcpa to be a question of fact.as this material issue of fact remains,we reverse the grant of judgment on the pleadings to liberty mutual on plaintiff claims based upon liberty mutual alleged actions occurring after the filing of the first lawsuit in october,and remand these claims to the district court for further consideration.
rawe claim 
the district court correctly dismissed rawe claim as a matter of law,because the pleadings do not allege that haggard,who was the insured under the bodily injury policy,ever assigned his rights under the policy to rawe.at order at.it is settled law in kentucky that insurers do not have any duty of good faith to claimants.manchester ins.indem.grundy,there is no privity of contract between the insurer and the claimant,so the insurer is never guilty of bad faith to the claimant.the claimant can look only to the insured for satisfaction of the judgment unless the insured makes an assignment to the claimant,cert.denied,d see also glass,at citing manchester as establishing that a cause of action for bad faith belongs only to the liability insured.in glass,the supreme court of kentucky explained that a claim arises only when the insured has assigned her contractual rights to the plaintiff.
u nder the principle of privity of contract,the cause of action belonged only to the liability insured but the insured could assign it to the liability plaintiff in consideration for a release of the insured from any liability in excess of the policy limits.as assignee of the insured,the successful plaintiff could then bring the bad faith action in a derivative capacity against the insurer to recover the excess amount of the verdict.punitive damages were not recoverable,because the action was considered to be one for breach of contract.this type of action is referred to as a bad faith action.
id.in count ii of her complaint,rawe does not allege that haggard assigned rights to her,but merely states that she was a third party beneficiary to haggard bodily injury insurance contract with liberty mutual,and that liberty mutual owed her a duty in that capacity.at compl.at.this is insufficient under kentucky law.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of rawe claim because rawe has not alleged privity of contract between herself and haggard.
rawe claims under the kentucky unfair claims settlement practices act 
we next consider rawe allegations that liberty mutual actions in response to her attempts to recover under haggard bodily injury policy as well as her parents uim policy violated the kucspa.rawe argues that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law to liberty mutual on count i of her complaint,which contains her claims under the kucspa.upon review,we reverse the grant of judgment on the pleadings to liberty mutual on rawe kucspa claims,and affirm the grant of judgment on the pleadings on rawe kucspa claims.
the kucspa creates both first and obligations to settle insurance claims in good faith.the kucspa imposes what is generally known as the duty of good faith and fair dealing owed by an insurer to an insured or to another person bringing a claim under an insurance policy.knotts zurich ins,citing.stat.ann.the kucspa is intended to protect the public from unfair trade practices and fraud.it should be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purpose.reeder,at.the kucspa proscribes a list of fifteen particular acts and practices that it deems unfair claims settlement practices.knotts,at.rawe alleges in her complaint that liberty mutual violated five subsections of the act by 
failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies 
failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under i
