federal insurance company federal,appeals from the memorandum opinion and order granting defendant motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiff motion for summary judgment entered by the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,southern division.federal seeks equitable subrogation from,the hartford steam boiler inspection and insurance company hartford,on an insurance settlement.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted hartford motion and denied federal motion.for the reasons that follow,we reverse and remand to the district court for specific findings as to damages.
background 
federal filed suit against hartford seeking declaratory relief and equitable subrogation and claiming breach of contract.at.federal claimed a loss compensable by hartford in excess of million.the facts that precipitated this case are not in dispute.
federal is the subrogee of norvest norvest and norquick distributing company norquick.norvest leased certain property to norquick at,on which norquick operated a frozen food storage and distribution facility at.federal policy provides loss to building or personal property.at.federal also insured against business income and extra expense loss.at.
hartford provided with equipment breakdown coverage.at.it is from the hartford policy that federal seeks indemnification for the monies paid to norquick for stock loss that was not recovered through salvage.
on january,a norquick manager attempted to drain oil from an ammonia refrigeration system oil separator tank at the distribution facility.at.during the process,the handle of a ball valve came off from the stem.at.the parties agree that a mechanical breakdown occurred at.the broken handle left the valve partially open.at.
ammonia subsequently leaked from the open valve for approximately one hour.at.the ammonia leak led to an explosion and fire.at.the pressure from the rising levels of ammonia caused at least two walls and part of a third wall in the compressor room to fail.at.
approximately seven thousand pounds of ammonia were released during the incident.at.the leaking ammonia spread throughout the compressor room and to the entire facility,including to the warehouse loading dock,the freezer,and the office area.at.hartford expert confirmed that the release resulted in elevated levels of ammonia in the main engine room,the loading dock,and at least some dispersion of ammonia into the freezer compartments.at emphasis added.
federal expert stated that it was unlikely that any ammonia vented into the loading dock let alone the freezers from the explosion.at emphasis added.in fact,he opined that the explosion actually consumed large quantities of the escaped ammonia and served to reduce ammonia accumulation in the loading dock and warehouse.at.in this regard,federal expert and hartford expert agree.at.
according to hartford expert,at the time of the explosion,the average ammonia level in the freezer area was three hundred fifty parts per million ppm.at.however,the ammonia levels were not uniform throughout the freezer area.near the doors,the ammonia level reached as high as eight thousand ppm before the explosion id.the explosion may have contributed an additional two hundred ppm of ammonia throughout the freezer and up to four thousand ppm of ammonia near the doors.at.ammonia carried into the freezer by water from the facility sprinkler system,which activated when fire erupted after the explosion at,added an estimated six ppm of ammonia to the overall average ammonia level with higher concentrations likely near the freezer doors at.approximately eight hours after the explosion and fire,vapor levels inside the freezers and the offices areas were too high for safe entry.at.
due to the high levels of ammonia detected in the freezer at,the department of agriculture usda quarantined the freezer inventory on suspicion of ammonia contamination and temperature abuse at.although high concentrations of ammonia were found in and on some food packaging tested by the usda,the food was found to be safe for human consumption at.based on this conclusion,on april,the usda released the food for sale on the open market.at.
before the usda released the food for sale,norquick reported a loss to both federal and hartford.federal made two payments to norquick.the first payment of million was made on january,for loss to owned stock.at.the payment,made under protest,was considered an advance made to mitigate business income loss under the federal policy.at see also at.federal issued a second payment to norquick on april,in the amount of representing the remainder of the stock loss.at.
on february,norquick offered to repurchase the inventory from federal for fifty cents on the dollar.at.federal accepted this offer.at.after covering testing costs for the inventory,federal received from norquick as salvage return.at.
hartford agreed to cover the cost to replace the valve handle assembly and the cost to recharge the system with ammonia.at.however,hartford took the position that it was not liable for the inventory losses because any ammonia contamination to the food in the storage freezer was caused by the explosion,fire,or firefighting efforts.at.
federal policy language 
business income and extra expense 
the federal policy provided coverage for business income and extra expense.at.specifically,the policy insured against business income lost due to the actual impairment of operations and extra expenses incurred due to the actual or potential impairment of operations.at emphasis omitted.per the terms of the policy,the actual or potential impairment must be caused by or result from direct physical loss or damage by a covered peril to property at emphasis in original.the policy defines a covered peril as a peril covered by the form s shown in the property insurance schedule of forms,except care,custody or control legal liability,applicable for the lost or damaged property.at emphasis in original.
ii.property insurance 
federal also provided with property insurance subject to certain limitations and exclusions.at.in that policy,only the mechanical breakdown and ammonia contamination exclusions are relevant to this case.the mechanical breakdown exclusion states 
this insurance does not apply to loss or damage to property caused by or resulting from mechanical breakdown of that property.
this mechanical breakdown exclusion does not apply to 
loss or damage that results to other insured building or personal property or 
ensuing loss or damage caused by or resulting from a peril not otherwise excluded.
at italized emphasis added bold emphasis in original.
the ammonia contamination exclusion states 
this insurance does not apply to loss or damage caused by or resulting from the discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of ammonia from any processing equipment,plumbing system,refrigeration system,cooling system or heating system.
this ammonia contamination exclusion does not apply 
if the discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of ammonia is caused by or results from any of the specified perils or 
to ensuing loss or damage caused by or resulting from a specified peril.
at italized emphasis added bold emphasis in original.
the federal policy identifies the following as specified perils 
aircraft or missiles 
fire or lightning 
leakage from fire protection equipment 
mine subsidence 
riot or civil commotion 
sinkhole collapse 
volcanic action or 
windstorm or hail.
hartford policy language 
the hartford policy provides coverage for equipment breakdown.at.the insurance applies to the direct result of an accident to covered equipment.at emphasis added.per the terms of the hartford policy,an accident is direct physical loss from a m echanical breakdown,including rupture or bursting caused by centrifugal force.at.the hartford policy specifically provides coverage for the loss of perishable goods due to contamination from the release of refrigerant,including but not limited to ammonia.emphasis added.the hartford policy excludes coverage for f ire or combustion explosion,whether or not caused by or resulting from an accident and w ater or other means used to extinguish a fire,even when such an attempt is unsuccessful.at.
standard of review

summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the trial court should consider a material fact in dispute genuine if a reasonable jury could return a verdict in favor of the nonmoving party.tech dry,at.we consider all factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.the moving party bears the burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,city of keego harbor,cir.when reviewing for summary judgment,this court must assess each motion on its own merits.tech dry,at.

discussion 
federal raises several issues on appeal.firstly,federal argues that the district court failed to apply the unambiguous ammonia contamination exclusion in federal policy.final br.of the appellant appellant br.at.secondly,federal states that it is not a volunteer and,therefore,is not precluded from recovering from hartford.appellant br.at.thirdly,federal offers that the other insurance clauses of the respective policies are inapplicable or,alternatively,that the loss should be apportioned on a pro rata basis.appellant br.at.lastly,federal requests penalty interest as a result of hartford failure to cover norquick loss under the hartford policy.appellant br.at.
not surprisingly,hartford embraces the opinion of the district court.hartford submits that the district court correctly refused to apply the ammonia contamination exclusion in federal policy,applied the appropriate michigan causation standard in its review,properly ruled that federal policy was primary and covered the entire loss,and correctly failed to consider penalty interest.final br.of the appellee appellee br.at.hartford argues in the affirmative that federal has failed to establish that the ammonia contamination exclusion in the federal policy applies and that federal is a volunteer and,therefore,is not entitled to equitable subrogation.appellee br.at.
the parties issues will be considered in turn.
federal is not a volunteer.
we first decide the issue of whether federal is a volunteer.if so,federal is not entitled to equitable subrogation.equitable subrogation is a legal fiction through which a person who pays a debt for which another is primarily responsible is substituted or subrogated to all the rights and remedies of the other.in re lewis,cir citations omitted construing michigan law.equitable subrogation is a flexible,elastic doctrine of equity.hartford accident indem.used car factory.before granting equitable subrogation,courts should conduct an analysis based on equity jurisprudence and proceed on a basis.id.
the requirements of equitable subrogation were long ago stated by the supreme court.firstly,the party seeking equitable subrogation must have paid a debt due to a third party before he can be substituted to that party rights.prairie state bank united states.quotation and citation omitted.secondly,in paying the debt,he must not act as a mere volunteer,but on compulsion,to save himself from loss by reason of a superior lien or claim on the part of the person to whom he pays the debt id.the right to equitable subrogation is never accorded in equity to one who is a mere volunteer in paying a debt of one person to another.id.to avoid being a mere volunteer,the party seeking subrogation must have made payment in order to fulfill a legal or equitable duty owed to the subrogor.in re lewis,at.
a volunteer has been defined as one who intrudes himself into a matter which does not concern him,or one who pays the debt of another without request,when he is not legally or morally bound to do so,and when he has no interest to protect in making such payment.detroit auto.exch.detroit mut.auto.ins,quotation and citation omitted.further,a payment is not voluntary when made under compulsion,under a moral obligation,in ignorance of the real state of facts,or under an erroneous impression of one legal duty.id.at,quotation and citation omitted emphasis added.
federal made two payments to norquick.the first was within two weeks after the accident and was made under protest.the second was the day before the usda released the seized inventory for sale and approximately three months after the accident.when the first payment was made,federal acted on the possibility that its business income and extra expense insurance would be invoked.at.federal acted quickly to mitigate its potential losses under the business income and extra expense provisions.federal did not then know whether or to what extent the inventory might have been contaminated by ammonia.by the time the second payment was made,there was some indication that the inventory might not have been contaminated,but the usda report had not yet been issued 
at the time each payment was made,federal was ignorant of the real state of facts concerning the later alleged ammonia contamination and under an erroneous impression that it had a legal duty to compensate norquick under the business income and extra expense provision of its policy.as such,federal was not a volunteer,and its claim for equitable subrogation may proceed.
ii.the federal ammonia contamination exclusion applies,and hartford equipment breakdown coverage applies.
in michigan,courts construe insurance policies in the same manner as other contracts.farm bureau mut.ins.of nikkel.a court primary responsibility in construing a michigan contract is to ascertain and enforce the intent of the parties.wonderland,at citation omitted.the purpose of insurance is to insure against a loss.thus,courts should not construe a policy to defeat coverage unless the language of the policy requires it.cas.sur.group coloma.
if the provisions of a policy are clear and unambiguous,the court applies the terms in their plain,ordinary,and popular sense.clevenger allstate ins,citation omitted.an unambiguous contract is not open to construction and must be enforced as written.cochran ernst young.whether ambiguity exists in the terms of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide.equitable life assurance soc y of the poe,cir.
a contract is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably and fairly susceptible to multiple understandings and meanings.id.citing parameter driven software.bay ins,cir.disagreement amongst the parties as to the meaning of a contract term does not necessarily create ambiguity as a matter of law.steinmetz contractors ass local union int l of workers.to determine whether an ambiguity exists,the court must read the insurance policy as a whole.see murphy agency.the reviewing court should consider all parts and every word no part should be eliminated or stricken by another part unless absolutely necessary.workmon publishers clearing house,cir.
the parties agree that a mechanical broken.the broken valve caused the release of ammonia throughout norquick facility.it is also clear from the record that extremely elevated levels of ammonia were present in the warehouse freezer at the time of the explosion.the parties differ over which company is responsible for the stock loss that resulted from the january,incident.
because both federal and hartford policies are clear and unambiguous,this court will interpret them using the common and ordinary meanings of their terms.
federal ammonia contamination exclusion applies.
the district court held,and neither party seems to dispute,that the mechanical breakdown exclusion in federal policy does not apply to this coverage dispute.the exclusion bars coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from mechanical breakdown of that property,but the exceptions to the exclusion state that the exclusion does not apply to loss or damage that results to other insured building or personal property.at.the perishable goods at issue in this dispute,in other words,fall under the exception to the exclusion.
federal main challenge to the district court decision is that its ammonia contamination exclusion applies barring coverage under the policy.we agree.the ammonia contamination exclusion states that the insurance does not apply to loss or damage caused by or resulting from the release of ammonia.at.the exclusion does not apply,however,when the release is caused by or results from any of the specified perils or when a specified peril occurs because of the release and there is ensuing loss or damage caused by or resulting from the specified peril.at.notably,fire and explosion are specified perils.at.by its terms,then,the policy does not cover any damage caused by ammonia contamination but does cover any damage caused by fire or explosion.
hartford equipment breakdown coverage applies.
likewise,hartford policy is clear and unambiguous.the hartford policy provides coverage for direct physical loss due to an accident.as defined by hartford policy,accident includes mechanical breakdown,which the parties concede occurred.the hartford policy also specifically covers loss of perishable goods due to contamination from the release of refrigerant,including but not limited to ammonia.at.clearly,the hartford policy provides coverage for loss due to ammonia contamination.however,hartford argues that its exclusions apply to relieve it from responsibility.
the hartford policy excludes coverage for loss or damage caused by f ire or combustion explosion,whether or not caused by or resulting from an accident and w ater or other means used to extinguish a fire at.however,hartford own expert reported excessive levels of contamination in the warehouse at the time the explosion occurred.at.while the subsequent explosion and fire appear to have raised further the ammonia levels in the warehouse,the effect of any change in ammonia levels before and after the explosion and fire is a question of fact and is not subject to determination by this court.
hartford is not relieved of responsibility for the ammonia contamination that occurred prior to the explosion and fire even though the explosion and fire possibly raised already elevated levels of contamination in the warehouse freezer.the ammonia contamination damage and loss suffered by the inventory prior to the explosion and fire are clearly covered by hartford policy.hartford is relieved of obligation for any additional ammonia contamination to the inventory resulting from the explosion,fire,or water or other means used to fight the fire.however,the record is unclear as to contamination damage occurred to the inventory prior to the explosion,fire,and firefighting efforts.the record is also unclear about whether the explosion,fire,and firefighting efforts contributed to any ammonia contamination suffered by the inventory.these are questions of fact.as a result,we remand this case to the district court for a specific determination as to damages.
the district court is directed to determine the following 
whether the inventory was contaminated by ammonia prior to the explosion,fire,and firefighting efforts 
if so,the amount of inventory loss in dollars attributable to the ammonia contamination that occurred prior to the fire,explosion,and firefighting efforts 
whether the inventory suffered additional ammonia contamination as a result of the fire,explosion,firefighting efforts,or any combination of the foregoing 
if so,the amount of inventory loss in dollars attributable to the ammonia contamination that occurred as a result of the fire,explosion,firefighting efforts,or any combination of the foregoing 
whether the inventory was further contaminated by ammonia after the explosion,fire,firefighting efforts,or any combination thereof but not as a result of the fire,explosion,firefighting efforts,or any combination thereof and 
if so,the amount of inventory loss in dollars attributable to the ammonia contamination that occurred after the explosion,fire,firefighting efforts,or any combination thereof but not as a result of the fire,explosion,firefighting efforts,or any combination thereof.
hartford will compensate federal only for those calculated inventory losses due to ammonia contamination that occurred not as a result of the fire,explosion,firefighting efforts,or any combination thereof,whether or not prior or subsequent to the fire,explosion,and firefighting efforts.
c.this court preceding analysis is consistent with michigan common law concerning causation in the insurance context.
the causation standard applied in tort cases is not the same as that applied in an insurance case.see vanguard ins.clarke,citing bird paul fire marine ins,pac.employers ins.mut.ins.the esteemed judge cardozo wrote the bird opinion.in bird,judge cardozo stated that c ausation is not a chain but a net.at each point,influences,forces,events,precedent and simultaneous,meet,and the radiation from each point extends indefinitely.bird,at,citation omitted.from this complex web,the law selects one cause or another.id.the same cause producing the same effect may be proximate or remote as the contract of the parties seems to place it in light or shadow.id.ultimately,in insurance cases,the court is not to trouble itself with distant causes.id.at,citation omitted see also clarke,at,lansing bd.of water light deerfield ins,d,t he cause of a claim under michigan law is only a close cause,and not a distant one,with respect to insurance cases.
our conclusion is consistent with michigan precedent,which we find the district court misapplied.in.sugar employers mut.liab.ins.of,the michigan court of appeals faced a similar situation,michigan sugar.the plaintiff operated a large sugar silo with heated floors that served to eliminate moisture.the plaintiff entered into an insurance policy that excluded in subsection k loss by 
shrinkage,evaporation,loss of weight,contamination,change in flavor,color,texture,or finish,change in temperature whether or not atmospheric or humidity but excepting loss by or resulting from freezing of automatic sprinkler,fire hydrant,standpipe,plumbing or heating systems rust or corrosion unless loss by fire or explosion not otherwise excluded ensues,and then the insurance company shall be liable only for such ensuing loss 
id.at,emphasis added.during the period of coverage,a worker at the facility noticed that sugar was bubbling at the top of the mound of sugar and running down the sides like lava.id.the phenomenon was caused by the sugar having overheated.the silo full of sugar was a total loss.after an investigation,the insurance company determined that the thermostat controlling the heating system and the heating cables had been improperly installed.id.at.on the basis of the policy temperature exclusion,the insurance company then denied coverage for the loss.
the michigan sugar court noted that the qualifying language of the contract may properly be interpreted to mean that the parties intended efficient,proximate cause to be the ultimate test of liability.id.at,quoting kangas life ins.the court then restated the definition of proximate cause as that which in a natural and continuous sequence,
