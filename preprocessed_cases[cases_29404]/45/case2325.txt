when a homeowners policy expressly covers accidental bodily injury but excludes coverage for bodily injury arising out of an illegal act,is the insurer obligated to defend and indemnify its insureds in a wrongful death action brought against them after their teenage son accidentally shot and killed his friend we conclude that,in the context of the policy as a whole,the insurer does have such an obligation.
on march,kelly and some of his friends were at kelly home when kelly found a caliber beretta handgun in his mother coat pocket.kelly father had taught him how to handle a beretta.taking the same precautions he would have taken to unload a beretta,kelly removed the clip from the handle of the caliber beretta,placed the clip on a table,and pulled back the slide on the gun.believing the gun to be unloaded,kelly pulled the trigger.the gun fired,killing his friend,christopher mitchell.
a petition alleging kelly commission of involuntary manslaughter,a felony,subd.b,was filed in juvenile court welf.the court sustained the petition,made kelly a ward of the court,and placed him on probation.
timothy and christy mitchell,the parents of christopher,brought a wrongful death action against kelly and his parents,who tendered defense of the action to safeco insurance company of america safeco under their homeowners insurance policy.safeco undertook the defense under a reservation of rights.
safeco then brought this action in superior court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify its insureds because the policy excluded coverage for an illegal act.named as defendants were the insureds and the mitchells.safeco unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment,contending that the accidental killing of christopher fell within the policy exclusion for an illegal act.
thereafter christy mitchell,joined by the insureds,moved for summary judgment contending that safeco as a matter of law had a duty to defend and indemnify.the trial court granted the motion,ruling that the policy illegal act exclusion could reasonably be interpreted as excluding coverage only for an intentional illegal act.the court found it was undisputed that kelly s.did not intend to cause harm to mitchell son and that kelly did not intend to commit an unlawful or illegal act.accordingly,the court ruled that the mitchells wrongful death claim was potentially covered by the insureds policy,giving rise to safeco duty to defend.safeco appealed.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment.relying on a dictionary definition of illegal as meaning not according to or authorized by law unlawful,the court of appeal concluded that the illegal act exclusion in the policy precluded coverage for any act in violation of civil or criminal law,whether or not the person committing the act intended to cause harm or to violate the law,but that it did not exclude coverage for ordinary civil negligence.applying this understanding of the scope of the policy illegal act exclusion,the court held that the policy did not provide coverage for an act causing death that resulted in a juvenile court adjudication of involuntary manslaughter.
we granted the separate petitions for review filed by the insureds and christy mitchell.
the homeowners policy at issue here covered the period june,through june.the accidental shooting occurred in march.under the terms of the policy,kelly and his parents are insureds.
relevant here are these policy provisions safeco agreed to defend and indemnify the insureds in the event of claims brought against any insured for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which the policy defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury during the policy period.excluded from coverage was liability for bodily injury arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.italics added.the policy did not define the term illegal act.
we now turn to the task of stating the controlling principles of insurance contract interpretation and applying them to the policy here.
insurance policies are contracts and therefore subject to the rules of construction governing contracts.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.the goal of contractual interpretation is to determine and give effect to the mutual intention of the parties,bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.
a policy provision is ambiguous when it can have two or more reasonable constructions.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.an ambiguity is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor,the insurer believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.citation.if application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity,ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.citation.citation.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d.any ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds favor,consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations.kazi state farm fire casualty cal th,d.
the homeowners policy here excluded coverage arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.italics added.the phrase illegal act is susceptible of two reasonable meanings.as mentioned earlier,the court of appeal,relying on a dictionary definition,construed the term broadly,as meaning any act prohibited by law.but the term can also be interpreted more narrowly as meaning a violation of criminal law.this is the construction safeco urges us to adopt.certain thesauruses do treat the term illegal as synonymous with criminal.see,burton,legal thesaurus stating that against the law and criminal are synonyms of illegal webster collegiate thesaurus stating that criminal is a synonym of illegal.if we were to adopt this meaning in the context of the policy here,we would have to treat the policy clause excluding coverage for an illegal act as the equivalent of a clause excluding coverage for a criminal act.
the policy before us,however,contains not a criminal act exclusion but an illegal act exclusion.had safeco wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage,it could have easily done so.insurers commonly insert an exclusion for criminal acts in their liability policies.croskey kaufman,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,pp.because safeco chose not to have a criminal act exclusion,instead opting for an illegal act exclusion,we can not read into the policy what safeco has omitted.to do so would violate the fundamental principle that in interpreting contracts,including insurance contracts,courts are not to insert what has been omitted.code civ,jensen traders general ins.cal d,jacobson simmons real estate th,d.
we now consider the court of appeal construction of the term illegal as meaning violation of any law,whether civil or criminal.see,webster new collegiate dict.not according to or authorized by law unlawful webster new world dict.college ed prohibited by law against the law unlawful illicit also,not authorized or sanctioned,as by rules black law dict.ed,against or not authorized by law see,law includes constitutional,statutory,and decisional law.that construction,however,is so broad as to render the policy liability coverage practically meaningless.
for instance,a violation of any law would include the law governing negligence,which holds individuals responsible for the failure to exercise ordinary care resulting in injury to another,every one is responsible for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill.the duty to exercise ordinary care is imposed by law.see sharon arman,cal th,d.a violation of that duty is therefore a violation of law.broadly construed,a violation of any law,whether civil or criminal,is an illegal act.an insured negligent act,being a violation of law and therefore an illegal act,would thus not be covered under safeco policy excluding coverage for an insured illegal acts.
but the homeowners policy that the insureds here bought from safeco expressly provided that safeco would defend and indemnify them for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which the policy defines as an accident which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage.because the term accident is more comprehensive than the term negligence and thus includes negligence black law,supra,at,safeco homeowners policy promised coverage for liability resulting from the insured negligent acts.that promise would be rendered illusory if,as discussed above,we were to construe the phrase illegal act,as contained in the policy exclusionary clause,to mean violation of any law,whether criminal or civil.when reasonably practical,contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect,and that is consistent with the parties intent,see palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d.
the court of appeal attempted to give the policy a practical and workable construction by drawing a distinction between negligence involving the failure to exercise ordinary care,which the court viewed as falling outside the illegal act exclusion,and gross negligence involving a punishable public offense,which the court considered to be within the policy exclusion.after stating that the exclusion was not limited to liability arising out of a criminal conviction or criminal act,the court of appeal stated that while the failure to exercise ordinary care may result in the imposition of an obligation to provide compensation for any loss caused by one negligence,such failure to exercise ordinary care is not illegal.it then concluded that the specific act at issue in the present case,involuntary manslaughter,falls into an entirely different category,involving as it did gross negligence and the commission of a punishable,public offense.we disagree with that analysis.
it is not clear how the court of appeal defined the word illegal as it is used in the exclusionary clause.if the court of appeal construed the exclusionary clause as excluding every offense,that is,every crime,it defines the word illegal as meaning criminal.as we have seen,that definition is inappropriate here because it rewrites the policy by inserting what has been omitted.drawing a distinction,as the court of appeal did,between negligent acts and grossly negligent acts exceeds the bounds of construction by rewriting the policy.the word illegal is not a synonym for gross negligence.
as we noted earlier,ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds favor,consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations.kazi state farm fire casualty,supra,cal th at,d.an insured should not be expected to know the subtle legal distinctions between the concepts of ordinary negligence and gross negligence.such distinctions are not objectively within the reasonable expectations of the insured 
also,to draw a distinction between negligent and grossly negligent acts,as the court of appeal did,would be at odds with insurance code section.under that provision,an insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured but he is not exonerated by the negligence of the insured,italics added.the statute does not distinguish between ordinary and gross negligence.therefore,an insurer intending to exclude from a homeowner policy coverage for gross negligence would have to say so in express terms,instead of,as here,using the ambiguous phrase illegal act.the burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.state farm mut.auto.ins.jacober cal d.
safeco would have us give effect to the policy illegal act exclusion in this case,despite the absence of any satisfactory definition of the word illegal,because any insured would reasonably expect that an accidentally caused death resulting in a conviction for involuntary manslaughter would fall within the policy illegal act exclusion.safeco view leaves the exclusionary clause without meaning until after an event has occurred.this violates the rule that expectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made,montrose chemical admiral ins,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,an insured objectively reasonable expectations are measured not by an insured knowledge of the nuances of criminal law,but by what an insured would expect to be covered by the policy.the proper inquiry is would reasonable insureds expect their homeowners policy to protect them against liability for accidental injury or death occurring in their home the answer is yes.
in short,because the illegal act exclusion can not reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract,it must be rejected as invalid.
finally,we reject safeco contention that civil code section relieves it of any duty to indemnify the insureds for liability resulting from kelly accidental killing of christopher mitchell.section provides all contracts which have for their object,directly or indirectly,to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another,or violation of law,whether willful or negligent,are against the policy of the law.section applies to contractual exemptions from liability,not to indemnity contracts.state farm fire casualty eddy d.lemat american basketball d.an insurance policy is an indemnity contract.thus,section simply does not apply here.
for the reasons given above,we conclude that the mitchells wrongful death action is within the liability coverage of the homeowners policy at issue here.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed with directions to enter judgment affirming the judgment of the trial court.
though my reasons differ from the majority,i agree with their conclusion that the illegal act exclusion in safeco policy did not deprive kelly parents of liability coverage for their son fatal shooting of christopher mitchell.i respectfully dissent,however,from the majority determination that,despite the policy explicit refusal to cover an insured for his or her illegal act,the policy nonetheless covered kelly himself for his criminal homicide.
on the latter point,i accept,for purposes of argument,that an illegal act could mean something broader than a criminal act,a more common form of coverage exclusion.there may be situations that would strain the outer limits of an illegal act exclusion in a policy designed to afford coverage for accidental injuries.finally,i do not doubt that all reasonable uncertainty about the phrase meaning must be resolved against the insurer,that drafted the policy,and in favor of coverage a policyholder would reasonably expect.hence,i am satisfied that the illegal act exclusion can not contravene the parties basic understanding that coverage would be afforded for an insured ordinary negligence.
but kelly can not benefit from even the narrowest reasonable interpretation of the illegal act exclusion.an exclusion for illegal acts must apply wherever a criminal act exclusion would apply any criminal act is also illegal,and no layperson would understand otherwise.moreover,even if the meaning of illegal might be uncertain when applied to particular facts,it can not be so here.an illegal act exclusion must at least have been intended,and understood,to withdraw liability coverage from an insured who,by recklessly pointing and shooting a loaded firearm,committed the grave felony offense of manslaughter.
such a conclusion does not undermine the purposes of an insurance policy intended to afford liability coverage for accidental injuries.nor does it defeat the insured reasonable expectations of coverage.a policyholder found guilty of criminal homicide under such circumstances could hardly expect that his or her tort liability for the killing somehow falls outside an explicit exclusion for illegal acts.
the majority discount a recent court of appeal decision,century ins.stewart th,d century,that illustrates this point.there,during a party,matthew guglietti,while intoxicated,took a revolver from his parents bedroom and inserted one bullet.he pointed the gun at a friend and pulled the trigger,then pointed the gun at his own head and pulled the trigger again.the next day,as the party continued,guglietti,still intoxicated,retrieved the revolver.he pointed the gun at victim digeronimo and pulled the trigger once more.the weapon discharged,wounding digeronimo fatally.to avoid murder charges,guglietti pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter with personal use of a firearm.
edwina stewart,digeronimo mother,sued guglietti for wrongful death.guglietti,an insured under his parents homeowners policy,tendered his defense to the insurer.the policy excluded coverage for injury foreseeably resulting from an insured criminal act.century,supra,th at,d.the insurer accepted the defense under a reservation of rights but sued stewart,guglietti,and guglietti parents to determine coverage.thereafter,the insurer won a declaratory judgment that no coverage was afforded.
the court of appeal affirmed.as the court explained,stewart contends the p olicy criminal act exclusion is ambiguous century,supra,th,d and has proffered several factual circumstances which,if applicable,arguably would subject the p olicy criminal act exclusion to several reasonable interpretations,at,d.however,the court emphasized,she does not suggest alternative reasonable interpretations under the facts of this case,italics added.as the court noted,guglietti action had resulted in his conviction of a serious felony,eliminating any doubt whether the conduct at issue came within the meaning of criminal act as used in the policy.ibid.
moreover,the court observed,even if the exclusion might be deemed ambiguous,there could be no reasonable expectation that the p olicy covered liability for guglietti killing of digeronimo.stewart posits that the criminal act of manslaughter is based on and really nothing more than negligence and that an insured would reasonably expect the p olicy would cover injury caused by an insured negligence.but stewart characterization of guglietti action as based or premised on mere negligence trivializes his conduct.this is not a case in which a firearm was negligently mishandled and fired by mistake or inadvertence.guglietti deliberately and intentionally pointed the revolver at digeronimo and deliberately and intentionally pulled the trigger under these circumstances we conclude the insured could not reasonably have expected the p olicy coverage for injury caused by negligence to have covered guglietti criminal act.century,supra,th,d,fn.omitted.
here,as in century,there can be no claim that the phrase illegal act is ambiguous as applied to this case.kelly fatal shooting of christopher mitchell comes within any reasonable understanding of the policy exclusionary clause.in a juvenile proceeding instituted for that purpose,it was found beyond reasonable doubt that kelly act constituted the serious felony offense of manslaughter.as noted above,when the killing of another is adjudged a serious violation of the penal law,an ordinary layperson would certainly understand the conduct to be illegal.
for similar reasons,kelly had no reasonable expectation that,despite the exclusion for illegal act s,he was covered for his criminal homicide.urging the contrary,defendants suggest the tragedy was simply a negligent accident,in that kelly tried to unload the weapon,thought he had disabled it,and intended no harm.but,as in century,this characterization trivializes the seriousness of the unlawful conduct at issue.here,as there,the victim was not killed by the mere negligent mishandling of a gun that caused it to fire inadvertently.instead,it is undisputed that kelly brandished the gun,pointed it in the general direction of christopher head,and deliberately pulled the trigger.
even if kelly thought the weapon was unloaded and intended no injury,he committed a wilful and potentially lethal act without due caution and circumspection,subd.b.because of the obvious danger,it is universal knowledge that one must never engage the firing mechanism of a gun while aiming it anywhere near another human being.laypersons also know it is a serious crime to injure or kill another by the reckless mishandling of a firearm.in the face of an exclusion for illegal acts,kelly expectation that the policy covered his ordinary negligence could not include the reasonable belief that he would be covered for his reckless shooting of christopher,which led to an adjudication he was guilty of the felony of manslaughter 
the majority decline to accept this logic,and therefore to find the exclusion applicable to kelly.instead,they conclude that because the illegal act exclusion might be difficult to apply in some factual situations,it is simply null and void in every case,including one where its application is beyond debate.
the majority offer meager support for this sweeping conclusion.they suggest that to apply the exclusionary clause to these facts,when its meaning might be uncertain in other cases,would violate the rule that expectations of the insured are examined at the time the contract is made,montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,ante,d at,at.not so.as indicated above,from the inception of the contract,an insured could only have expected that the illegal act exclusion would bar coverage for his or her criminally reckless homicide resulting in a conviction for manslaughter.contrary to the majority assertion,a lay policyholder was not required to appreciate subtle legal distinctions to reach that understanding,d at,at.
the majority posit that because the illegal act exclusion can not reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract,it must be rejected as invalid,ante,d at,at.the cited only authority the majority provide for this the unremarkable maxim that w ords in a contract which are wholly inconsistent with its nature,or with the main intention of the parties,are to be rejected.the majority fail to show how interpreting the illegal act exclusion to bar coverage for the felony of manslaughter,committed by the wilful and reckless misuse of a deadly weapon,would give the clause a meaning wholly inconsistent with the nature of the contract or the main intention of the parties.
in another context,the majority insist that courts can not insert in an insurance contract what the parties have omitted,ante,d at,at.but by omitting what was expressly inserted and agreed upon,the majority do equal damage to the parties intent and expectations.
accordingly,i can not join the majority strained effort to avoid applying the exclusionary clause to kelly commission of manslaughter.with respect to coverage for kelly personally,i would affirm the court of appeal determination that judgment should be entered for safeco.
i reach a different conclusion,however,with respect to any liability of kelly parents for the fatal shooting.they committed no reckless homicide and were found guilty of no crime.the causes of action against them for christopher wrongful death relied solely on allegations of their negligent supervision,control,and maintenance of other words,the alleged breach of their duty of ordinary care.
as indicated above,the illegal act exclusion could not apply directly to the mere negligent acts or omissions of kelly parents.such a broad interpretation of illegal would defeat the reasonable expectation that a policy promising to pay bodily injury damages for which the insured is legally liable italics added at least covers liability for an accidental injury arising from his or her ordinary negligence.safeco does not suggest otherwise.
however,safeco urges that the particular language of the exclusionary clause withdraws coverage from kelly parents for any claim based on kelly illegal act.as safeco notes,the clause states that the policy coverage is inapplicable to liability arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.italics added.safeco insists that the reference to an insured bars all policyholders from coverage for liability related to the illegal act of any of them.
it is true that in policies with multiple insureds,the cases have distinguished clauses that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to the insured from those that exclude coverage for particular facts applicable to an or any insured.absent contrary evidence,the former language is considered singular and specific,so that one insured remains covered despite facts that exclude coverage for another,while the latter is considered plural and indefinite,so that if particular facts exclude coverage for one or more insureds,they exclude coverage for all,california state auto.bureau warwick cal d,warwick fire ins.exchange altieri d,d altieri.
however,safeco policy also contained a paragraph entitled severability of insurance.in language common to many insurance contracts,this paragraph stated that,subject to the policy monetary limits,t his insurance applies separately to each insured.italics added.
severability is a widely recognized doctrine that acknowledges the separate and distinct obligations the insurer undertakes to the various insureds,named and unnamed.citations.the intent of a severability clause is to provide each insured with separate coverage,as if each were separately insured with a distinct policy,subject to the liability limits of the policy.citation.american nat.fire ins.fournelle,fournelle.
little california authority considers the effect of severability clauses on exclusionary provisions.however,a number of cases from other jurisdictions have concluded that if the policy contains language stating the severability of the insurer obligation,exclusionary clauses apply separately to each insured,even when language internal to the clauses themselves might suggest otherwise.thus,these cases reason,an exclusion must be considered solely from the standpoint of the insured seeking coverage,so that facts which would preclude coverage of a particular insured do not necessarily preclude coverage for the related liability of another.
in worcester mut.ins.marnell,marnell,parents homeowners policy included their son as an insured.the policy excluded coverage for liability arising from the operation or ownership of a motor vehicle by any insured,but also contained a severability clause,at.after consuming alcohol at a party in the family residence,the son drove friends home in his car.en route,he struck and killed a pedestrian.the parents were sued,on a theory of negligent supervision,for allowing the son to drive while drunk.citing the motor vehicle exclusion,the insurer declined the parents tender of defense.in a coverage action,the trial court found that a defense was required.
the supreme judicial court of massachusetts affirmed.the court conceded that,absent a severability clause,the exclusionary reference to any insured would bar coverage for the parents liability arising from their coinsured son ownership and operation of the car.marnell,supra.however,the court explained,a severability provision requires that each insured be treated as having a separate insurance policy,at.
thus,the court observed,the term insured as used in the motor vehicle exclusion refers only to the person claiming liability coverage under the policy.marnell,supra,italics added.because the insured parents neither owned nor operated the accident vehicle,the court reasoned,the exclusionary clause could not bar their claim for coverage.see also shamban worcester ins,in homeowners policy with severability clause,policy exclusion for operation of motor vehicle by an insured did not bar coverage of parents sued for negligent supervision of coinsured son,who caused injury while riding his dirt bike.
applying utah law,the tenth circuit court of appeals recently took the same view of a motor vehicle exclusion in a policy containing severability language.in west american ins.av s cir,a business liability policy covered several pizza franchisees and their employees.the policy excluded coverage for liability arising from ownership or operation of a motor vehicle by any insured,at.in light of the policy severability clause,the court concluded,the exclusion applied only to the particular franchisee whose coinsured employee caused an accident while delivering pizza in his own car,at.
in fournelle,supra,a homeowners policy named the husband and wife as insureds and defined,as additional insureds,relatives and dependent minors who were residents of your household,at,italics added.the policy,which contained a severability clause,generally covered an insured liability for bodily injury to another,but excluded such coverage for injury to you,a named insured or any insured.ibid.after moving from the family home pending a divorce,the husband returned for a visit,killed his children,and then committed suicide.the minnesota supreme court held that despite the exclusionary clause,the policy covered the father estate for the children wrongful deaths.
the court reasoned as follows s everability demands that policy exclusions be construed only with reference to the particular insured seeking coverage.citations.fournelle estate,supra.hence,the issue was whether,with respect to husband individually,the children were additional insureds for whose deaths he was not covered.because,at the time of their deaths,the children were no longer residents of his household,they were not additional insureds as to him.accordingly,he and his estate were not denied coverage by virtue of the exclusionary clause.see also state farm fire cas.ins.keegan cir,under texas law,where homeowners policy with severability clause defined additional insured to include member of your household and excluded bodily injury coverage for an insured,husband,who had moved from marital household,was covered for negligent injury to child who remained with wife as household resident.
in brumley lee,the kansas supreme court concluded that because a severability provision gives each insured separate coverage,a homeowners policy clause which ambiguous ly excluded liability coverage for intentional acts by any insured did not bar coverage for an insured husband,sued on grounds he negligently failed to prevent his coinsured wife from inflicting an intentional,and fatal,blow upon a child,at see also catholic diocese of dodge city raymer,in homeowners policy with severability clause,exclusion for intentional conduct,or damage expected or intended,by an insured did not bar coverage of parents,sued for negligent supervision in connection with coinsured son vandalism of school property.
