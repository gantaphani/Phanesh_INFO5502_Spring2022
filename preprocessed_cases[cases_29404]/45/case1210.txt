this is an insurance case about twinkling christmas lights.jlj,and its licensee inliten,llc collectively jlj sued santa best craft,llc sbc over its marketing of lights.the present case is about an insurer duties to sbc and others in that underlying action.
jlj alleged that sbc copied jlj stay lit lights packaging design and that sbc sold lights using false and deceptive language.sbc asked its insurer,paul fire and marine insurance company,for a defense and then sued paul when none was forthcoming.paul counterclaimed with a declaratory action about its duty to defend and then tendered hundreds of thousands of dollars to sbc for its litigation expenses after the district court held that paul had a duty to defend.the district court,however,agreed with paul that it was not obliged to cover defense expenditures for sbc contract indemnitee monogram licensing monogram or to reimburse the settlement payment that resolved the underlying action.each party appealed.we agree with the district court that paul had,but did not breach,a duty to defend.we also agree that the district court properly declined to require paul to reimburse sbc for monogram expenses,but we remand for further proceedings to resolve whether paul owes prejudgment interest on litigation expenses and reimbursement for the settlement expenses.
background 
a.the relevant parties.
the present litigation has its roots in august,when jlj sent sbc a letter,demanding that sbc change the packaging of its lights.jlj claimed that the lights boxes aped the look and slogans of jlj stay lit lights.sbc forwarded the letter to paul,which responded that the commercial general liability cgl coverage policy sbc purchased did not cover the claims in the demand letter.specifically,paul claimed that false representation claims were not covered by the policy in the first instance and that two policy exclusions,relating to intellectual property and material previously made known or used,meant that it owed no defense for the remaining claims.
in november,jlj sued sbc in federal court in the southern district of ohio for lanham act trademark infringement,false designation of origin,false advertising,trademark dilution and deceptive trade practices.see jlj,santa best craft,llc,no.paul again denied coverage.in,after jlj joined as defendants santa best and craft manufacturing,two principal members of sbc,as well as monogram,paul continued an investigation of its duties,but reserved the right to determine that the policy provided no coverage.
sbc did not wait for paul to finish its investigation.in february,sbc and the other plaintiffs filed this declaratory action to compel paul to defend them and,in june,paul counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that it had no such duty.in december,the underlying action settled after sbc and its members agreed to pay jlj million and to refrain from using the mark or any colorable imitation of the stay lit mark.
as noted above,monogram was added as a defendant in the underlying action based on claims of unjust enrichment and conspiracy for approving sbc use of the allegedly offending marks and slogans.monogram,a general electric ge company subsidiary,and sbc had entered into a trademark licensing agreement licensing agreement in which sbc promised to defend,indemnify and hold harmless monogram and ge from and against any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the licensed products including any infringement of any rights in connection with the manufacture,advertising,promotion,sale,possession or use of the licensed products.santa best recall,one of the members of sbc,which is a limited liability company reimbursed monogram defense expenses of approximately million.paul cgl policy requires it to defend its insured contract indemnitees,assuming certain control and cooperation requirements are satisfied.these requirements include the indemnitee obligation to provide paul notice of each legal paper as soon as possible after it is received paul obligation to first determine that there is no conflict between the insured interests and those of the indemnitee and the indemnitee and insured agreement in writing that they can share the same counsel.monogram never tendered a defense to paul.instead,in august,the plaintiffs advised paul that,under the licensing agreement,they believed that monogram was a contract indemnitee and that paul owed coverage.monogram,in the underlying action,was represented by counsel separate from plaintiffs,although the two legal teams coordinated a defense.
b.the district court orders.
the district court held that paul had,but did not breach,a duty to defend because the complaints in the underlying action potentially sketched a claim for infringement of slogan,which was covered as an advertising injury offense.see santa best craft paul fire marine ins.santa best i,wl,at.july.it also held that the intellectual property exclusion did not apply or that,even if it did,the allegations could be construed as a infringement of a trademarked slogan,which was an exception to the exclusion.see id.at.in addition,the court held that the material previously made known or used exclusion did not apply because not all of the slogans were finalized until,after paul policy became effective.see id.at.in a subsequent order,the district court stayed the action pending the outcome of litigation involving paul.see santa best craft paul fire marine ins.santa best ii,d.
this litigation primarily involved a coverage action instituted by sbc against the last significant party in this american insurance company zurich,sbc insurer before paul policy took effect in january before they filed the present lawsuit,the plaintiffs also looked for a defense from zurich and,even though zurich provided one,they filed a declaratory action in the circuit court of cook county,chancery division,to address several issues about zurich reimbursement of the defense expenses.see santa best craft,llc zurich am.ins,case ch cook county,ch.div.zurich action.zurich drew paul into the action via a complaint for contribution.in a december order,the zurich court indicated that paul agree d that it is bound by this court determination as to the reasonableness of fees at issue both in this proceeding and also in our present case on appeal.santa best craft,llc zurich am.ins,case ch cook county,ch.div.it entered a judgment of million in defense costs for the plaintiffs,of which approximately million were monogram defense costs the zurich court then denied the plaintiffs motion for prejudgment interest for reasons stated on the record.see id.to date,according to the parties briefing,all of the costs the plaintiffs incurred in the underlying action have been reimbursed except the monogram defense costs and the settlement payments and possible interest payments.
after the zurich action was terminated,the district court held that paul did not owe the plaintiffs a duty to indemnify them for settlement costs in the underlying action because some of the claims were not covered under the cgl policy exclusions and because the plaintiffs failed to allocate the settlement between covered and claims.see santa best iii,wl,at.it also held that paul did not owe prejudgment interest or reimbursement for monogram defense costs because of other cgl policy exclusions and the zurich court findings.see id.at.

iii.discussion 
duty to defend.
the plaintiffs argue in support of the district court decision that paul owed them a defense because the complaint in the underlying action included allegations that made out a claim for u nauthorized use of any slogan of others in your advertising,where a slogan is defined as a phrase that others use and intend to attract attention in their advertising.the term slogan excludes a phrase used as,or in,the name of organizations or businesses other than the insured or any of the products of any person or organization,other than the insured.paul responds that these allegations serve as background for jlj trade dress infringement claim,a claim that paul is not required to defend because the cgl policy has an exclusion for certain intellectual property claims.
to determine whether the insurer has a duty to defend the insured,the court must look to the allegations in the underlying complaint and compare these allegations to the relevant provisions of the insurance policy if the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall within,or potentially within,the policy coverage,the insurer duty to defend arises.outboard marine liberty mut.ins,internal citations omitted.paul policy provided that w e have the right and duty to defend even if all of the allegations of the claim or suit are groundless,false,or fraudulent.and,illinois law specifies that w e give little weight to the legal label that characterizes the underlying allegations.instead,we determine whether the alleged conduct arguably falls within at least one of the categories of wrongdoing listed in the policy.lexmark int l,transp.ins.i f the underlying complaints allege several theories of recovery against the insured,the duty to defend arises even if only one such theory is within the potential coverage of the policy.see id.quoting with internal citations omitted,fidelity guar.wilkin insulation,see also outboard marine,at.
the district court properly found that the cgl policy requires paul to defend the plaintiffs.it held that the insurer owed a duty to defend because the allegations may potentially give rise to a claim for unauthorized use of slogan.see cincinnati ins.zen design group,cir michigan law insurer owed duty to defend an action with trademark and trade dress claims partially based on the fact that the competitor trademarked phrase the wearable light was potentially an infringement of slogan.
paul cgl policy covers unauthorized use of a slogan,which suggests that the claims underlying this conduct include as an element the defendant ownership or,at least,control,over the slogan.see,applied bolting tech,fidelity guar,vermont law holding that allegations that a company falsely advertised that it complied with an industry standard did not fall within insurance coverage for lawsuits about infringement of slogan see also black law dictionary ed.defining authorize as.to give legal authority to empower.to formally approve to sanction.and unauthorized as done without authority,made without actual,implied or apparent authority.paul contends that jlj has no ownership or exclusive right to the slogans on the packages and,therefore,can not have asserted an unauthorized of slogan claim.see lexmark int l,at declining to find a duty to defend based on infringement of slogan when the insured was accused of breach of contract and unfair business practices but not accused of lifting any of the plaintiff slogans.the present case is distinguishable because lexmark underlying suit did not contain claims for relief based on the plaintiff own advertising ideas or slogans,or claim ownership or the exclusive right to the language it used.id.in contrast,the jlj complaints contain allegations that sbc copied certain jlj slogans,suggesting that jlj had some claim of ownership over them.zen design group,at,discussing assertions of ownership over the contested phrase such as the advertiser trademarking of the slogan,its widespread use of the slogan and the good will it developed that is associated with the phrase in addition,although many of these allegations about slogans support jlj trade dress claim,as noted above,our inquiry is based on the allegations in the complaint,not the legal labels attached to them.see,id.at,noting that the complaint failure to refer to the offending phrase as a slogan and failure to include a specific claim labeled infringement of slogan did not preclude the finding that the insurer had a duty to defend based on allegations of infringement of slogan.given the presumptions at play,the complaint triggered paul duty to defend.we now address whether any exclusions in paul policy apply so that paul has no duty to defend.
ip exclusion.
paul contends that jlj slogans are not trademarked and therefore the claims are not covered because of the intellectual property ip exclusion.insurers have the burden of proving that an exclusion applies.see,ins.of hanover shelborne.insureds,in turn,have the burden to prove that an exception to an exclusion restores coverage.see,couch,couch on insurance.paul ip exclusion disallows coverage for injury or damage that results from any actual or alleged infringement or violation of any of the following rights or laws trade dress,trademark,other intellectual property rights or laws.an exception to the ip exclusion is unauthorized use of trademarked slogan of others in your advertising.
paul argues that,because the conduct the plaintiffs identify as making out a claim for infringement of slogan is all conduct that,in the language of paul policy,results from a trade dress claim,the ip exclusion precludes coverage.under any authority we could find indicating when a claim may affect coverage for a covered claim based on the similarity of allegations,the fact that the trade dress allegations are a subset of those alleging infringement of slogan does not eliminate coverage under the policy.that is,unless a slogan infringement claim would not have arisen but for the trade dress violation claim or necessarily arises out of the trade dress violation claim clearly not the case can not find that the exclusion for trade dress claims excuses paul from a duty to defend the underlying action.see,paul fire marine ins.antel,n,if an insurer relies on an exclusion,it must be clear and free from doubt that the exclusion applies hugo boss fashions,fed.ins,cir new york law suggesting that the breach of contract exclusion might apply if,but for a breach of contract,there would be no advertising injury or other covered injury,but noting also that it was uncertain what was meant by the arising out of language of the exclusion cent.mut.ins.stunfence,d,holding that knowledge of falsity exception did not preclude coverage because some of the claims were based on unintentional,rather than knowing,conduct.the district court properly found a duty to defend that was not affected by the ip exclusion.
additionally,the district court found,however,that even if the ip exclusion applies,the differences between trade dress and trademark have so narrowed that,if the ip exclusion applied,the exception for trademarked slogans likely did as well.it noted that what is or is not trademarked is a decision for the court in the underlying action.we agree with the district court that,even if the ip exclusion applied,the trademark exception would require paul to defend the action given the uncertainty whether the court in the underlying action would have decided the slogan qualified as trademarkable.but,because paul has not met its burden to prove that the ip exclusion applies in the first instance,we need not reach this alternative holding.
material previously made known or used exclusion.
paul claims that its material previously made known or used mpmk exclusion applies to defeat a duty to defend with respect to the policy period,but acknowledges that it did not make this argument with respect to the policy period although it argues that the exclusion defeats any duty to indemnify under either policy because facts revealed in the course of litigation demonstrated that much of the offending behavior predated.the district court held that paul was obligated by the policy to defend the plaintiffs because the insurer must defend if even one allegation of liability falls within the policy coverage.
the mpmk exclusion bars coverage for personal or advertising injury that results from any material that was first made known before this agreement begins and any advertising idea or advertising material,or any slogan or title,of others,whose unauthorized use in your advertising was first committed before this agreement begins.given that the parties agree that the allegations in the relevant complaints describe some language first used by the plaintiffs in,this exclusion bars coverage under the policy but not under the policy taco bell continental cas,cir illinois law unless the differences in the subsequent advertising are immaterial,modified advertising can serve as fresh wrongs that are not excluded from insurance coverage by a prior publication exclusion.
complying with the duty to defend.
the district court found no breach of the duty to defend because paul timely filed a and a counterclaim seeking a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend.under illinois law,an insurer has three options if it contests its duty to defend seek a declaratory judgment regarding its obligations before trial of the underlying action defend the insured under a reservation of rights or refuse either to defend or to seek a declaratory judgment at the insurer peril that it might later be found to have breached its duty to defend and estopped from asserting defenses as to payment based on.see,county mut.ins.olsak.that is,if it declines to defend under a reservation of rights,to avoid estoppel,the insurer must file a declaratory action or answer and cross claim in an action against an insured.see,connection ins,collecting cases and deciding that the weight of illinois authority holds that the insured may file the declaratory judgment action,even though contrary authority exists roman catholic diocese of springfield in.cas,cir illinois law.but see supreme laundry,hartford cas.ins,cir illinois law explaining,without citation,that because the insured instituted the declaratory action regarding coverage,the insurer was estopped from raising a policy defense 
paul claims that it did not breach its duty to defend because the plaintiffs initiated a declaratory judgment action in february,before paul had time to finish its investigation of coverage of the amended complaint,tendered in january.moreover,st paul counterclaimed in june,seeking a declaration that it owed no duty to defend before the case reached settlement,talks for which began in late.illinois courts have three tests to measure the timeliness of the declaratory action.it must be filed before the underlying action is resolved,see employers ins.of wausau ehlco liquidating trust,d,before settlement or trial is imminent,westchester fire ins.heileman brewing,finding no breach when declaratory judgment was filed months before settlement or within a reasonable time of being notified of the underlying suit.connection,at timely when insurer months after it denied insurance coverage sears,roebuck seneca ins,seven months not untimely.paul satisfies all of these timeliness tests.because paul did not breach its duty to defend,we do not address the plaintiffs arguments based on a breach.
reimbursement of defense costs already advanced to the plaintiffs.
in its,paul asks us to reverse the district court decision to deny paul request for reimbursement of costs it already submitted to the plaintiffs because of the district court finding that paul had a duty to defend.because the district court did not err,paul request for leave to amend its counterclaim to seek reimbursement was properly denied.
paul may need to reimburse the jlj settlement payment.
paul argues,as held the district court,that the plaintiffs failed to designate which of the claims addressed by the settlement were covered by the paul cgl policy and,therefore,paul properly declined to reimburse the settlement.the plaintiffs argue that they have no burden to allocate,citing federal ins.binney smith.they acknowledge that jlj threatened damages in the underlying action were undifferentiated as to the various claims,and they argue that there is no practical way of allocating the settlement.
in binney,an illinois appellate court confirmed that an insurer must reimburse an insured for its settlement expenses when the settlement was made in reasonable anticipation of liability for damage covered by the insurer policies,gypsum admiral ins,and the settlement primary focus was a claim covered under the insurer policy,see commonwealth edison union fire of pittsburg.see binney,at.both gypsum and edison relied on the record developed in the underlying action,including allegations in the complaint and evidence presented in the coverage action edison or the evidence presented in underlying companion cases that went to trial before settling gypsum to conclude that the settlement resolved litigation primarily focused on covered damage.see,gypsum,at edison,at.edison explains that an insured is not required to apportion its liability for different claims because that would either require the coverage litigation to be a retrial of the merits of the insured underlying lawsuit would discourage settlement because the insured would essentially have to prove its own liability for the underlying conduct even if it had not made that concession in arriving at a settlement.see edison,at discussing gypsum.illinois courts do require the insured to establish when the covered claims arose to allocate responsibility for paying the settlement based on which insurer policy was in effect at the time.see binney,at,see also michael orthodox catholic church preferred risk mut.ins,because the insured failed to meet its burden to prove that some of the roof damage occurred during the effective dates of the insurer policy,judgment was wrongly rendered for insured fidelity cas.mobay chem.corp,placing burden on insureds to allocate settlements for periods of policy coverage and.
the district court,relying on illinois school district agency pacific insurance company,held that the plaintiffs had to allocate the settlement into covered and uncovered claims.see,cir holding that the policy at issue included no duty to allocate defense costs but that if,on remand,the insurer owed the insured a duty to defend a contested claim,the insured might have to prove how much it spent defending that contested claim.this case relied on the specific contract at issue and cited michael,which addresses allocation based on when claims arose rather than based on liability.
legal commentators have noted the lacuna in the caselaw regarding apportionment of settlements in lieu of litigation that would likely have involved both covered and uncovered claims.see,allan windt,insurance claims and disputes supp.some states place on the insurer the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that specific settlement costs could be allocated solely to claims for relief that are not even potentially covered by the insurance policy.see,buss superior,cal holding that an insurer may seek reimbursement of defense costs that may be allocated to claims that are not even potentially covered because a party desiring relief carries the burden of proof couch on insurance,at.other courts place the burden to segregate claims on the insured.see,comsys info.tech,twin city fire inst.dist,pet.denied.still others vary the burden initially on the insured to prove coverage,on the insurer to prove the existence of an exclusion,and back to the insured to prove an exception to an exclusion.lastly,courts generally addressing corporate directors and officers liability insurance policies d o policies sometimes use the rule,where an insurer is responsible for the settlement except to the extent it is larger because of uncovered claims.see,caterpillar,great am.ins,f d,cir illinois law 
consistent with the illinois policy that a coverage action should not require the insureds to conclusively establish their own liability in the interest of promoting settlement,we think the proper inquiry is whether the claims were not even potentially covered by the insurance policy.see,gypsum,at noting the benefits of settlement.a competing policy interest is is inequitable to require an insurer to pay for a settlement that is clearly not within the terms of its policy.consequently,our prediction is that illinois courts,in cases in which it is possible that none of the settlement was attributable to the dismissal of claims for damage covered by the insurer policy,would evaluate whether a primary focus of the claims that were settled was a potentially covered loss burden on the insured.conversely,if it can be established that the claims were not even potentially covered burden on the insurer,then the insurer is not required to reimburse the settlement.this primary focus language is derived from the commonwealth edison case.see edison,at see also binney,at citing edison.because,in this case,the parties contest whether the settlement was made in anticipation of covered claims,the burden should be on the insured to prove coverage of the settlement in the first place and then on the insurer to prove the existence of exclusions barring coverage.as the district court held,several of the allegations in the underlying action complaint deal with claims and conduct outside of the policy coverage,including the trademark claims based on the product names and jlj false advertising claim.see santa best iii,wl,at.we agree with these holdings based on the plain language of paul policy.
the only remaining coverage dispute,therefore,is whether the allegations and record evidence supporting the trade dress claim suggest that the primary focus of settlement was damages payments for a covered infringement of slogan claim.the district court concluded that plaintiffs had not made an allocation of the settlement and therefore denied any reimbursement for the settlement.although the district court inquiry is close to the one we predict illinois courts would require,we will remand to allow the district court to consider the record evidence and supplemental briefing or an evidentiary hearing if it so chooses,although it may choose not to do so of whether a primary focus of the underlying action was a covered loss.in addition,paul may attempt to prove that the mpmk exclusion applies to defeat recovery under the policy.
paul does not have to reimburse sbc for monogram defense expenditures.
under the license agreement,monogram gave sbc permission to market its christmas lights under the ge brand.the plaintiffs contend that this agreement required them to defend and indemnify monogram for any litigation arising out of products marketed with the ge label and that paul was required to reimburse expenditures for this purpose because monogram was their contract indemnitee.
paul cgl policy covers the advertising injury of insureds indemnitees if several conditions are met.the plaintiffs argue that they complied with all preconditions to reimbursement that were feasible in view of paul failure to timely defend,and or,alternatively the defense of monogram was reasonably related to their own defense,requiring paul to reimburse them for monogram costs.
in december,the plaintiffs amended their complaint in the present case to seek reimbursement for monogram expenses,which were paid by santa best.the district court determined that paul owed monogram nothing because santa best was under no obligation to pay monogram expenses and,therefore,even if sbc were a contract indemnitee under the paul policy,sbc is responsible for its own liabilities,not those of santa best.see santa best iii,wl,at.alternatively,the district court noted that the plaintiffs failed to tender the complaint for many months and a conflict of interest existed between monogram and the plaintiffs.see id.
paul is not required under its policy to reimburse the monogram expenses.the cgl policy required paul to determine that there was no conflict between the insured interests and those of the and required the indemnitee to provide paul with a copy of any demand and give notice of the claim or suit in support of the plaintiffs motions for partial summary judgment quantifying defense expenses,counsel for the plaintiffs and santa best as well as sbc cfo testified via declaration that a separate firm represented monogram in the underlying action because of a potential conflict of interest between the plaintiffs and monogram that precludes monogram representation by counsel for the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs now argue that they never conceded there was a conflict of interest.they cite a later declaration in support of a separate summary judgment motion,in which the cfo testified that the claims against monogram and against the plaintiffs are essentially the same and that t he work of all defense counsel benefitted santa defense.regardless whether the earlier declarations constituted a concession,the cfo declaration does not call into doubt the district court determination that a conflict existed between monogram and the plaintiffs such that they did not comply with all preconditions to paul providing monogram defense.we acknowledge that certain of paul requirements were impossible for the plaintiffs to satisfy because paul did not immediately defend it in the underlying action.that said,the plaintiffs could have complied with other requirements but chose not to.
assuming,arguendo,that they did not waive the argument,the plaintiffs also argue that,because defense of monogram was reasonably related to their defense,paul should cover monogram expenses.the plaintiffs note that monogram liability is largely derivative of their own.see ryland mortgage,travelers indem,d,stating in dicta if defense expenses are reasonably related to a covered claim,the expenses may be wholly apportioned to this covered claim so that an insurer must reimburse some defense costs that aid in the defense of an uncovered claim same goes for coverage of defense expenses for an uninsured party,vacated on other grounds,fed.app cir.july,fed.realty inv.trust pac.ins,requiring insurer to cover all uncovered claims,including against uncovered parties,if the insured proves,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defense of these uncovered claims is reasonably related to covered separately,in the particular case of directors and officers insurance d o policies,several courts use a reasonably related rule to require the insurer issuing the d o policy to cover some defense expenditures also used to defend the directors and officers uninsured corporation.see,safeway stores,union fire ins,cir noting that the insurer conceded that the defense costs were covered under the d o policy.
while insurance contracts should be construed against the drafter,nothing in the paul policy supports the plaintiffs argument here that the illinois supreme court would apply a reasonably related test to hold that monograms costs are covered.in illinois,as the plaintiffs acknowledge,a duty to defend encompasses defensive claims that serve to reduce its courts are mum on coverage for uninsured parties.see great west cas.marathon oil,d.int l ins.rollprint packaging,holding that the insurer did not have to reimburse defense expenses related to an offensive counterclaim.the plaintiffs therefore ask us to extend our limited acceptance of the larger settlement rule for certain d o policies to require reimbursement for defense expenses of related parties unless total defense costs are higher because of the uninsured party defense.caterpillar,at emphasizing that the proper allocation method is primarily an issue of contract.
none of these cases allows us to predict that the illinois supreme court would require an insurer to reimburse the defense costs of all parties whose defense may have benefitted an insured,given the contract provisions at issue here.the plaintiffs reasonably related rule would swallow the contract provisions limiting paul liability to its insureds contract indemnitees.paul also argues that monogram defense expenditures were not in fact reasonably related to the plaintiffs and questions whether defense costs would have been the same whether or not monogram was a party to the underlying notes,for example,that monogram had separate counsel.we need not
