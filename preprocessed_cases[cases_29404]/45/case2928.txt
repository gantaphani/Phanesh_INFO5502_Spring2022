standard of review 
since a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the supporting and opposing papers,we independently review them on appeal,applying the same analysis required of the trial court.citations.first,we identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond by establishing a complete defense or otherwise showing there is no factual basis for relief on any theory reasonably contemplated by the opponent pleading.citations.second,we determine whether the moving party showing has established facts which negate the opponent claim and justify a judgment in the movant favor when a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment,the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,material factual issue.citation.pepperell scottsdale ins.th,d pepperell.
discussion 
century contends the policyholders are not entitled to coverage as a matter of law because the third party claimant,the kang family partners,did not purchase the hotel until after the expiration date of all five policies.century explains,t he terms of century indemnity policies clearly preclude coverage for the underlying action in order to come within the scope of the insuring agreements,and thus to obtain coverage,the policyholders must be liable to the claimant for injuries that the claimant suffered during the policy period.however,the claimant in this case,kang family partners,did not purchase the hotel until after the expiration of all five of the policies.thus,the claimant did not and could not sic have suffered any injuries during any of the policy periods,and no coverage under the policies attaches.
since century argues that the policies clearly preclude coverage,we shall begin by examining those policies.the first and second,issued by bankers standard insurance company,insured state wide from april,to april,and from april,to april.the third,also issued by bankers standard,insured hearrean and state wide from april,to april.the fourth and fifth,issued by century predecessor,insurance company of north america,insured hearrean and state wide from april,to april,and from april,to april.
the insuring agreements of all five of these policies stated,we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.in addition,the first and second policies provided this insurance applies only to bodily injury and property damage which occurs during the policy period.the three remaining policies contained a similar provision this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.the definitions section of all policies provided property damage means physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.italics added.
century asserts that under liability policies,as here,coverage is determined based upon the facts that existed at the time the complaining party was actually injured.italics omitted.the kang family partnership was not injured,century argues,until after it purchased the hotel in,which was after each of the five century and bankers standard policies had expired.consequently,century maintains there can be no coverage.
for this strict construction of insurance law,century relies on this court opinions in label transamerica ins.th,d and fmc plaisted companies th,d fmc,and the california supreme court opinion in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,montrose.
in label,we stated,in order to determine whether these allegations stated a cause of action,we must first determine the scope of the coverage which plaintiff was obligated to provide to defendants under this cgl occurrence policy.california courts have long recognized that coverage in the context of a liability insurance policy is established at the time the complaining party was actually damaged.citation.the coverage under such a policy must be construed in accord with the mutual int
