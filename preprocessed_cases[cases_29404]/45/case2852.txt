this is an appeal from the trial court grant of summary judgment to an insurance company,defendant industrial indemnity company industrial.the trial court determined that industrial had no duty to defend its insureds,plaintiffs westoil terminals,and westoil terminals,collectively,westoil,against lawsuits brought by their lessee western fuel oil western and western successor in interest,coastal corporation coastal.the lawsuits sought damages arising out of an order to clean up groundwater contamination at property owned by westoil.the trial court found,inter alia,no potential for coverage under the comprehensive general liability policy at issue,based upon a qualified pollution exclusion qpe in industrial policy.
we affirm.the trial court properly granted industrial motion for summary judgment pursuant to the qpe in industrial policy.in so holding,we do not reach the remaining issues in westoil appeal or the issues raised by industrial in its.
factual and procedural background 
westoil and coastal operations and the groundwater contamination 
from to,westoil owned and operated a tank farm for the storage and transfer of chemicals,fuels,and other liquid commodities at its facility.in,westoil leased the facility to coastal,which operated the facility until,when it was closed for remediation.
in,the california regional water quality control board for los angeles issued a and abatement order,requiring coastal to investigate the groundwater contamination and formulate and implement a remediation plan to remove the source of the groundwater contamination.
in august,coastal demanded from westoil for expenditures.it also demanded monies for future costs associated with cleaning up the contamination of the groundwater at the facility.
the underlying lawsuits and settlement 
on december,coastal sued westoil in federal court for allegedly contaminating the groundwater underneath the property leased to coastal.thereafter,in january,westoil was named in a brought by coastal in a state court action,alleging substantially the same claims as were asserted in the federal court complaint.
on january,westoil notified industrial of coastal claims in both the federal and state court actions.
approximately months later,on november,westoil demanded that industrial defend and indemnify it against coastal claims.in response,on december,industrial refused.it specifically denied westoil claim on the ground that there was no evidence or contention that any property damage occurred during the policy period.however,industrial also specifically reserve d all of its rights under the terms,conditions and exclusions contained in its policies for the claim.
in july,westoil settled with coastal.under the settlement,westoil incurred over million in damages for indemnity and defense costs.
industrial insurance policy 
on july,industrial issued an insurance policy providing comprehensive general liability cgl insurance to westoil from july,through july.the policy contains general cgl language regarding insurance coverage.specifically,it provides that industrial will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence,and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage.occurrence is defined in the policy as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.property damage is defined as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period,including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom,or loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.
the policy also contains two separate pollution exclusions,attached and signed as separate endorsements to the industrial policy.the original pollution exclusion is a qpe and was effective from july,through november.it excludes coverage for property damage arising out of the discharge of pollutants unless a sudden,unexpected and unintended discharge,dispersal,release or escape takes place during the policy period and causes bodily injury or damage to tangible property during the policy period.on november,the policy was amended to exclude coverage for all property damage and costs caused by the discharge of absolute pollution exclusion.
the instant lawsuit 
in november,westoil filed the instant lawsuit for breach of contract,tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief against several of its insurers but not industrial.on august,westoil filed and served its fourth amended complaint,the operative pleading,alleging breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing against industrial 
on august,industrial filed a motion for summary judgment,or in the alternative,summary adjudication.industrial alleged that it had no duty to defend or indemnify westoil on the ground that the pollution exclusions incorporated in industrial policy preclude any such duty.
westoil opposed the motion,urging that industrial was not entitled to summary judgment based upon the qpe.specifically,westoil argued that pursuant to montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,montrose ii,insurance policies do not impose,as a condition of coverage,a requirement that the damage or injury be discovered at any particular point in time.rather,under the continuous trigger doctrine,if the injury continues beyond the end of one insurer policy period all subsequent insurers are also liable for defense and potential indemnity costs as long as the injury is ongoing during the subsequent policy periods.
on december,the trial court granted industrial motion.specifically,the trial court found that industrial did not owe westoil a duty to defend pursuant to the qpe,precluding claims which did not occur during the policy period.
westoil timely appeal followed.industrial also filed a protective challenging the trial court orders allowing westoil leave to amend its fourth amended complaint to add industrial as a doe defendant,and denying industrial demurrer to the breach of the implied covenant cause of action in the fourth amended complaint.
discussion 
standard of review 
a trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision de novo.merrill navegar,cal th,d,see also aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.if,in deciding this appeal,we find there is no issue of material fact,we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to this case,whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not,and whether it was raised by defendant in the trial court or first addressed on appeal.western mutual ins.yamamoto th,d.if,on the other hand,we find that one or more triable issues of material fact exist,then we must reverse the judgment.
similarly,we apply the de novo standard of review to the interpretation of industrial insurance policy.the interpretation of an insurance contract,as with that of any written instrument,is primarily a judicial function.citation.unless the interpretation of the instrument turns upon the credibility of conflicting extrinsic evidence,a reviewing court makes an independent determination of the policy meaning.cooper companies transcontinental ins.th,d.
exercising our independent judgment as to the legal effect of the undisputed facts spitler children institute international th,d and acknowledging the obligation to affirm on any ground supported by the record becerra county of santa cruz th,d,we conclude that summary judgment properly was granted.
ii.the trial court did not err in finding no duty to defend 
interpretation of insurance contracts 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citations.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.citation.moreover,if the policy terms are used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,this use or meaning controls judicial interpretation.citation.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d.
an insurance policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citations.courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.citation.l anguage in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citations.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.citations.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity,supra,cal th at,d.
although insuring clauses normally are interpreted broadly montrose ii,supra,cal th at,d,and exclusions strictly are construed delgado heritage life ins.d,where an exclusion is clear and unambiguous,it is given its literal effect.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.and,while exceptions to exclusions are somewhat analogous to coverage provisions and thus are interpreted broadly national union fire ins.lynette d,they are still subject to the same rules of policy interpretation,we first look to the language of the contract in order to ascertain its plain meaning.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller.
mindful of these guiding principles,we note that cgl policies provide for broad coverage and cover all claims that fall within the terms of the insuring agreement unless those claims are specifically excluded.waller,supra,cal th at,d,see also croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.cgl policies have two principal parts the insuring clauses,which state the risk or risks covered by the policy and the exclusions,which remove coverage for risks that would otherwise fall within the insuring clauses.before even considering exclusions,we must examine the insuring clauses to determine whether a claim falls therein.only if the occurrence appears to be covered do we then turn to the exclusions.
the insuring agreement herein provides coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence.occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.property damage is defined as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period,including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom,or loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.
in montrose ii,supra,cal th at page,d,our california supreme court considered identical language in a standard cgl policy.the insurer agreed to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence italics added.p roperty damage to which this insurance applies is defined in the insurer policies as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period,including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom italics added.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
furthermore,occurrence is defined in the insurer policies as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.italics added.when read together with the aforementioned clauses defining covered bodily injury and property damage,this policy language unambiguously distinguishes between the causative accident or continuous and repeated exposure to conditions and the resulting bodily injury or property damage.it is the latter injury or damage that must occur during the policy period and which results from the accident or continuous and repeated exposure to conditions.montrose ii,supra,cal th at,d.
here,like the definition in the insurance policy at issue in montrose ii,the term occurrence in industrial policy is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured similarly,property damage is defined as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period.standing alone as in montrose ii,this language suggests that only the property damage must occur during industrial policy period to give rise to a duty to defend.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.after all,unlike property damage,occurrence is not defined in terms of timing there is no requirement in the general cgl definitions that an occurrence take place during the policy period.
however,our deference to the montrose ii analysis can not stop here.unlike the policy at issue in montrose ii,industrial policy contains a qpe,which expressly excludes coverage for any pollution damage unless such damage is caused by a sudden,unexpected and unintended discharge,dispersal,release or escape of contaminants that takes place during the policy period and causes bodily injury or damage to tangible property during the policy period.in other words,the qpe narrows the scope of coverage for pollution occurrences and requires that they occur during the policy period in order to give rise to coverage.thus,this language establishes that the exception to the qpe does not apply unless both the release of contaminants and the damage occur during industrial policy period.
our conclusion is not inconsistent with montrose ii.the montrose ii court did not consider a pollution exclusion in the policy.standun,fireman fund ins.th,d,citing montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose i.thus,the court discussion of the continuous trigger doctrine and its interpretation of property damage during the policy period is incomplete as it pertains to the instant context.see also croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,pp.to noting that even if coverage otherwise exists,an insurer may avoid liability pursuant to exclusions in the policy,including pollution exclusions.
moreover,regardless of the court interpretation of the insurance policy at issue in montrose ii,if the policy expressly provides when coverage is triggered,such language will be determinative.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,to,citing borg transamerica ins.th,fn,d.nothing in montrose ii precludes an insurer from limiting coverage for pollution damages to occurrences that take place during the policy period.in fact,the montrose ii court expressly noted that it only was interpreting the phrase property damage which occurs during the policy period,leaving open,for example,the issue of when coverage is triggered for loss of use damages.montrose ii,supra,cal th at,d,fn.the policy definition of property damage to which this insurance applies also includes loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.since the loss of use clause pertains only to property which has not been physically injured or destroyed,the sustaining of damage or injury to such property during the
