appellant mary ann jordan seeks the reversal of a summary judgment granted to the respondent allstate insurance company allstate on her first amended complaint for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.the trial court determined that the homeowner insurance policy issued by allstate to jordan did not provide coverage for the loss she had sustained as the result of the alleged collapse of a portion of her santa monica home.
by its terms,the policy expressly provided additional coverage for any loss due to an entire collapse caused by hidden decay.the policy also contained an exclusion for any loss caused by wet or dry rot.we conclude that,in the factual context of this case,such conflicting policy language created an ambiguity that must,for the reasons discussed,be resolved against allstate.we therefore will reverse the summary judgment granted by the trial court and remand with directions for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in august of,jordan purchased a deluxe plus homeowner policy from allstate that provided coverage for her year old santa monica home.the policy provided coverage of up to for the dwelling and other structures.
as is common in such policies,it was subject to certain exclusions.particularly relevant to the issues before us,the policy provided that it did not cover a loss consisting of or caused by rust or other corrosion,mold,wet or dry rot italics added or a loss to covered property consisting of or caused by collapse.italics added.there was an exception to this collapse exclusion,however,that was set out in a section of the policy headed by the term additional coverage.this section provided that the policy would nevertheless cover 
a the entire collapse of a covered building structure 
b the entire collapse of a part of a covered building structure and 
c direct physical loss to covered property caused by a or b above.italics added.
this exceptional additional coverage was limited to the collapse of a building structure specified in a or b that was a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by one or more of the following b hidden decay of the building structure and f defective methods or materials used in construction,repair,remodeling or renovation,but only if the collapse occurs in the course of such construction,repair,remodeling or renovation.the term collapse,however,did not include settling,cracking,shrinking,bulging or expansion.
on or about december,jordan was advised that there was evidence of damage to her home that had been caused by a fungus known as meruliporia incrassata poria.she received this information in a report prepared by jose luis delacruz of delacruz wood preservation services 
jordan had contacted delacruz after she discovered,on december,that a window had fallen out of the wall of her living room.she also observed that the floorboards in a corner of the living room were giving way.following receipt of delacruz report,jordan submitted a claim to which allstate responded with a letter to jordan,dated december,acknowledging her submission of the claim but reserving all of its rights.allstate also promptly retained its own experts to conduct an inspection of jordan property.those experts likewise determined that the damage that had been sustained to jordan home was the result of an infestation of the poria fungus.
on or about january,jordan hired stephens,stephens to conduct a fungi abatement and remediation on her property performance of that work has led to a dispute between jordan and stephens that is not relevant to the issues which we resolve in this case.
on january,allstate advised jordan that it rejected her claim,primarily on the ground that coverage was precluded under the exclusion for any loss consisting of or caused by rust or other corrosion,mold,wet or dry rot.jordan responded that the poria fungus did not fall within the term wet or dry rot and asked that allstate reconsider its coverage decision.on february,allstate advised jordan that poria fungus and the resulting damage are considered wet or dry rot and her loss was therefore excluded under the policy.
thereafter,on august,jordan filed this action after the conclusion of certain discovery matters,jordan moved for summary adjudication of her breach of contract claim and allstate moved for summary judgment on jordan entire complaint.the issue presented to the trial court,under the facts and the relevant language of allstate policy,was whether coverage for the loss claimed by jordan was excluded.the court denied jordan motion and granted allstate.that ruling was based on two conclusions reached by the trial court the broad general policy exclusion for losses due to wet or dry rot included the fungal infestation that had caused jordan claimed damages and the coverage for collapse upon which jordan relied did not extend to the imminent collapse of a portion of jordan home that was demonstrated by the record.
jordan has filed this timely appeal.
contentions of the parties 
jordan asserts essentially two principal arguments.first,she claims that she is entitled to coverage under the collapse provisions of allstate policy irrespective of the cause of such collapse.put another way,she contends that even if the poria fungus that invaded her home falls within the exclusion for wet or dry rot,she is still entitled to coverage under the separate collapse provision.second,jordan argues that poria fungus does not fall within the policy exclusion for wet or dry rot.in support of that argument,jordan relies upon the declaration testimony of her expert delacruz,claiming that declaration would have raised a triable issue of fact but for the trial court erroneous ruling sustaining allstate objection to that declaration on the ground of a lack of foundation.
allstate disputes each of these arguments and contends that principles of policy construction establish that the wet or dry rot exclusion is dispositive of jordan claim without regard to the separate coverage ground based on collapse.allstate further argues that the trial court properly excluded the testimony of jordan expert and,in any event,the plain meaning,to a layperson,of the exclusionary term wet or dry rot necessarily embraces the fungus that caused the damage to jordan home.next,even if jordan collapse claim were considered,recent supreme court authority establishes that jordan evidence of damage demonstrated nothing more than a condition of imminent collapse and thus was not sufficient to provide a basis for coverage,given the language of allstate policy.

summary judgment is granted when no triable issue exists as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c villa mcferren th,d.after examining documents supporting a summary judgment motion in the trial court,this court independently determines their effect as a matter of law.hulett farmers ins.exchange th,d.where the facts are undisputed,the court can resolve the question of law in accordance with general summary judgment principles.adams paul cal th,d.absent a factual dispute as to the meaning of policy language,the interpretation,construction and application of an insurance contract is strictly an issue of law.century transit systems,american empire surplus lines ins.th,d.as we explain below,the disposition of this case turns upon our conclusion that an ambiguity was created by conflicting policy language contained in an exclusion on the one hand,and a provision for additional coverage on the other.we therefore begin by reviewing relevant general principles of policy interpretation.
relevant principles of insurance policy interpretation 
in aiu ins.superior court cal d,the supreme court explained,under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage,controls judicial interpretation.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.citations.if there is ambiguity,however,it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor,the insurer believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.if application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity,ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,at.
in,the supreme court amplified on these principles in bank of the west superior court cal th,d.in that case,the court noted that w hile insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.this rule,as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy,protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but,rather,the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.only if this rule does not resolve the ambiguity do we then resolve it against the insurer in summary,a court that is faced with an argument for coverage based on assertedly ambiguous policy language must first attempt to determine whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in so doing,the court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy this is because language in a contract must be construed in the context of that instrument as a whole,and in the circumstances of that case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.id.at,d,citations omitted.
the bank of the west court made it clear that in order to conclude that an ambiguity exists which will be construed against an insurer,it is necessary first to determine whether the coverage under the policy,which would result from such a construction,is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.in order to do this,the disputed policy language must be examined in context with regard to its intended function in the policy.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d,see also cooper companies transcontinental ins.th,d.this requires a consideration of the policy as a whole,the circumstances of the case in which the claim arises and common sense.bank of the west,supra,cal th at,d.
an insurance policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins.cal th,d.the uncertainty may relate to the extent or existence of coverage,the peril insured against,the amount of liability or the party or parties protected.see continental cas.phoenix const.cal d,and cases cited there.as indicated,the language in an insurance policy is interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.thus,the proper question is whether the particular phrase is ambiguous in the context of this policy and the circumstances of this case.citation.the provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand.citation.bay cities paving grading,lawyers mutual ins,supra,cal th,d.this question must be answered through the eyes of a reasonable person in the position of the insured.montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d.words used in an insurance policy are to be interpreted according to the plain meaning which a layman would ordinarily attach to them.courts will not adopt a strained or absurd interpretation in order to create an ambiguity where none exists.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d.

the exclusion for wet or dry rot applies to damage caused by fungus 
applying the foregoing principles of policy interpretation,we are persuaded that allstate exclusion for wet or dry rot includes the poria fungus that attacked and damaged jordan home.
we agree with the comment set out in allstate brief that few laypersons would be familiar with the term poria,much less the full name of the fungus to which it refers.but it seems likely that a layperson would describe the decay caused by the fungus as dry rot.certainly,that was the effect of sworn deposition testimony given by delacruz,jordan own expert,in another case,a copy of which was presented to the trial court by allstate in support of its motion 
this common understanding of the term dry rot is confirmed by webster third new international dictionary dry rot a decay of seasoned timber caused by certain fungi as the house fungi and some polypores that consume the cellulose of wood leaving a mere soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder a rot of plant tissue in which the affected areas are not soft and wet but dry and often firmer than normal or more or less mummified as a decay of standing timber involving such rot and caused chiefly by polypores a fungus causing dry rot 
it is well settled that in order to construe words in an insurance policy in their ordinary and popular sense,a court may resort to a dictionary.scott continental ins.th,d see also stamm theatres,hartford casualty ins.th,d.in looking to dictionary definitions,however,courts must take care to consider the policy context in which the word or term was used and attempt to put itself in the position of a layperson and understand how he or she might reasonably interpret the particular language.mackinnon truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.we believe our conclusion regarding the layperson understanding of the term dry rot is consistent with that admonition.
jordan seeks to counter that conclusion by reliance on a declaration from delacruz that she filed in support of her opposition to allstate motion.in that declaration,delacruz identified himself as a state licensed pest control operator with years of experience.he explained that he tried to avoid using the term dry rot and does not use it at all to describe the decay caused by poria.allstate,however,objected to delacruz declaration on the ground that it lacked a proper foundation demonstrating that he was qualified to express an opinion as to whether poria was properly embraced in the term dry rot.the trial court sustained that objection arguably,this was error as delacruz declaration did provide sufficient facts to establish a foundation for the expression of his opinion.mann cracchiolo cal d.as the mann court explained,the determinative issue in each case must be whether the witness has sufficient skill or experience in the field so that his testimony would be likely to assist the jury in the search for the truth,and no hard and fast rule can be laid down which would be applicable in every circumstance.citation.where a witness has disclosed sufficient knowledge,the question of the degree of knowledge goes more to the weight of the evidence than its admissibility.citation.id.at.
delacruz declaration was sufficient to demonstrate a special knowledge of the subject matter of the poria fungus.the weight and value of his opinion would be a matter for the trier of fact,but it should not have been rejected on the ground asserted by allstate.see,generally,brown colm cal d.to the extent that this was error,however,it was harmless.
expert testimony is not generally admissible on the question of the meaning of particular policy language.national auto.casualty ins.stewart d.the opinion of a linguist or other expert as to the meaning of the policy is irrelevant to the court task of interpreting the policy as read and understood by a reasonable lay person italics added see also cooper companies transcontinental ins,supra,th,d pieper commercial underwriters ins.th,d.
as we have explained,it is the court function to interpret policy language as a matter of law where,as here,there is no dispute as to the words used in the policy.in making such interpretation,the court is required to do so through the eyes of a reasonable lay person,not those of a lawyer,an insurance specialist,an expert in wood science or a pest control operator.montrose chemical admiral ins,supra,cal th at,d,crane state farm fire cas.cal d.delacruz declaration contrary to his earlier deposition testimony did not provide any assistance to the court with respect to a layperson common understanding of the term dry rot.moreover,nothing that delacruz said suggested or tended to show that the term dry rot had a particular or technical meaning understood by the parties at the time the policy was issued or that his particular reluctance to use the term was sufficient to demonstrate that it included certain types of fungus and not others.see,generally,wolf superior court th,d.
it appears clear to us that a layperson understanding of the term wet or dry rot embraces damage or decay caused by a fungus.since poria is admittedly a fungus,we would have no trouble concluding that the poria fungus that damaged jordan home fell within the policy exclusion for wet or dry rot.but that is only true if we read the terms of that exclusion in isolation.when read in the context of the entire policy,however,such clarity disappears.thus,we do not agree with allstate contention that reliance on the exclusion for wet or dry rot is sufficient to resolve jordan claim in allstate favor.
there is an ambiguity between the additional coverage exception for collapse and the exclusion for wet or dry rot 
the allstate policy provides,on a limited basis,additional coverage for collapse.as we mentioned at the outset,the allstate policy is an policy,it provides coverage for all risks of loss,except those expressly excluded.there are,however,two exclusions that are relevant to the resolution of this matter.the first is the one relating to wet or dry rot that we have already discussed.the second is for a loss to covered property consisting of or caused by collapse.but the exception to that exclusion states that it does not apply if the requirements of the additional coverage for collapse have been met an entire collapse of all or part of a covered building structure which is a sudden and accidental direct physical loss caused by as far as is relevant here hidden decay of the building structure or defective methods or materials used in construction,repair,remodeling or renovation provided that the collapse occurs in the course of such construction,repair,remodeling or renovation.
jordan makes two arguments with respect to her claim for coverage under this exception to the collapse exclusion.first,she contends that the poria fungus and the damage it caused constituted hidden decay.second,she asserts that some part of the collapse resulted from and during the negligent trenching work of stephens whom she had retained to remediate her poria fungus problem.we need discuss only the first of these arguments 
the exception to the collapse exclusion is described in a section of the policy designated as additional coverage and applies to a loss caused by an entire collapse that is due to hidden decay.there is evidence in this case that the damage caused by wet or dry rot was found in wood members in the concealed area of the wall see fn,ante.as our discussion of the dictionary definition of dry rot made clear,that term necessarily involves decay.thus,the use of the term dry rot in the exclusion and the use of the term hidden decay,in the provision for additional coverage lead to a confusing contradiction.such contradiction creates an ambiguity with respect to coverage involving a claim of collapse.given our obligation to read the allstate policy so as to give full effect to all of its terms and conditions,holz rubber.american star ins.cal d,we might reconcile this contradiction in one of two ways.first,we could conclude that a collapse due to hidden decay would be covered,but not if such decay was caused by wet or dry rot or,second,we could conclude that coverage for a collapse due to hidden decay was provided,but noncollapse damage caused by wet or dry rot was excluded.each of these constructions of the policy language is reasonable.the first is consistent with allstate contention that the exclusion for wet or dry rot precludes coverage irrespective of whether there is a basis for coverage under the exception to the collapse exclusion.on the other hand,the second interpretation is advanced by jordan and supports her claim for coverage under the collapse provisions of the additional coverage section of the policy.thus,when read in the context of the entire policy,particularly the provision granting coverage for a collapse caused by hidden decay,the effect and application of the exclusion for a loss caused by wet or dry rot is not at all clear.
when presented with such a conflict between competing policy provisions,it is our obligation to attempt to resolve the resulting ambiguity by first looking to the objectively reasonable expectations of jordan,the insured.when the dry rot exclusion is read in the context of the entire policy,particularly the exclusion for collapse and the additional coverage exception thereto,an insured could reasonably conclude that while the dry rot exclusion will generally preclude coverage for damage caused by a fungus,the exception to the collapse exclusion will counter that and provide coverage for a collapse caused by hidden decay.since dry rot is a form of decay stamm theatres,hartford casualty ins,supra,th at,d,coverage would be reasonably expected.put another way,an insured objectively reasonable expectation of coverage could arise from a reading of the entire policy in context because the collapse exception for decay will justify coverage for a collapse caused by dry rot,even if noncollapse damage caused by dry rot is excluded.that being so,we must resolve the ambiguity by looking to the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured and construing the policy language consistent therewith and against the insurer.bank of the west superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see also,zurich american ins.cal th,d.
the evidence presented with respect to allstate summary judgment motion demonstrated that the decay caused by the poria fungal infestation and the resulting dry rot was hidden thus,one of the two causal factors set out in the policy collapse exception and relied upon by jordan has been satisfied our resolution of this issue of policy construction in jordan favor,however,does not fully answer the question as to the existence of coverage.
whether the entire collapse requirement for coverage under the collapse exception can be satisfied presents unresolved issues of fact 
the collapse exception expressly provides that there will be additional coverage for an entire collapse of all or a part of a building.although we have resolved the ambiguity problem created by the dry rot hidden decay conflict,that only permits us to conclude that the trial court erred in relying on the wet or dry rot exclusion to summarily find that there was
