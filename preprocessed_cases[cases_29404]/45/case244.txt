under sections and of the employee retirement income security act of erisa,congress empowered the department of labor to issue rules and regulations governing claims procedures for employee benefit plans.this case calls upon us to interpret an agency regulation in the context of the regulation purpose,as well as the purpose of the regulation authorizing statute,as we address some of the consequences that follow from a plan failure to comply with the department regulation.
the united states district court for the district of connecticut bryant,held that,when exercising discretionary authority to deny a claim for benefits,a plan failure to establish or follow reasonable claims procedures in accordance with the regulation entitles the claimant to de novo review of the claim in federal court,unless the plan substantially complied with the regulation,in which case an arbitrary and capricious standard applies to the federal court review of the claim.the district court further held that a plan failure to follow the department regulation results in unspecified civil penalties.
we respectfully disagree with the district court holdings in light of the careful balance struck by the department regulation.specifically,we hold that,when denying a claim for benefits,a plan failure to comply with the department of labor regulation,will result in that claim being reviewed de novo in federal court,unless the plan has otherwise established procedures in full conformity with the regulation and can show that its failure to comply with the regulation in the processing of a particular claim was inadvertent and harmless.we further hold that civil penalties are not available to a participant or beneficiary for a plan failure to comply with the regulation.finally,we hold that a plan failure to comply with the regulation may,in the district court discretion,constitute good cause warranting the introduction of additional evidence outside the administrative record.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background and procedural history 
a full discussion of the factual background of this case is set forth in the district court memorandum of decision.see halo yale health plan halo ii,d.because the district court conclusions were premised on the incorrect standard substantial compliance,the district court did not make factual findings that would permit us to assess whether defendant appellee yale health plan,director of benefits records yale university yale health plan established procedures in full conformity with the regulation but inadvertently and harmlessly failed to comply with it in the processing of a particular claim.we therefore do not delve deeply into the specific facts of this case,because we leave it to the district court to apply the correct standard in the first instance on remand.we summarize the factual background and procedural history merely to provide context for the legal discussion to follow.
plaintiff appellant tiffany halo was a student at yale university and an insured under the yale health plan.when halo began experiencing serious problems with her left eye in,she visited and underwent surgery with doctors within the yale health plan network.dissatisfied with the results of her treatment,she returned to her parents home,where she eventually underwent further surgery with doctors who were not in the plan network and whose treatment therefore was covered only if the condition treated constituted an emergency or urgent condition or if the treatment was approved in advance by the plan care coordination department.
yale health plan rejected halo claims for coverage.appearing pro se,halo filed a civil action against yale health plan alleging,among other things,that it violated the department of labor regulation when it denied a number of her claims for benefits.halo contests both the timing and content of the explanations concerning yale health plan denials.for example,the department of labor regulations require that notification of an adverse benefit determination shall set forth,in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant a number of specific pieces of information,including the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination r eference to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary and a description of the plan review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures,including a statement of the claimant right to bring a civil action under section a of the act following an adverse benefit determination on review.g i iv.yet,in at least one notification,the only explanation yale health plan provided to halo was service not authorized.app.
on august,yale health plan filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record.the district court granted the motion and halo appealed.on halo first appeal,we held that the motion should have been treated as a motion for summary judgment under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which required that halo should have received notice of the consequences of failing to respond to the motion for summary judgment.halo yale health plan halo i,app x,cir quoting vital interfaith med,cir.because we concluded that halo apparent ignorance of her rule burden may have hampered her ability to oppose yale health plan summary judgment motion,we vacated the judgment.id.at.
in vacating the judgment,we expressly declined to reach halo argument that civil penalties are available for violations of or that,in light of yale health plan alleged violations of erisa regulations,the court should review halo erisa claims de novo.id.at.we instead left it to the district court to address these issues in the first instance.id.at.
on remand,and after yale health plan again moved for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the plan clearly reserves discretion for the plan administrator and that,o nce it is clear that the administrator has discretionary authority,the standard of review ordinarily shifts from de novo to an arbitrary and capricious standard of review.halo ii,d at.the district court correctly recognized,however,that,under certain circumstances,a plan administrator failure to comply with the letter of the claims procedures outlined in erisa requires courts to eschew the more deferential arbitrary and capricious review normally applied to an administrator discretionary decisions in favor of a more searching de novo review.id.at.
the district court nonetheless applied the substantial compliance doctrine,which excuses failures to comply with the department regulation if the record otherwise shows that the plan substantially complied with the regulation requirements.as the district court explained,a plan substantially complies with the regulation if the administrator made efforts to keep the beneficiary apprised of the claim assessment process and delivered reasonably timely and detailed decisions,which indicate that the administrator validly exercised its discretion.id.at.applying the doctrine,the district court concluded that,while yhp communications of its claim denials were not ideal and in some instances failed to comply with erisa regulations,the substance and timing of its denials of halo claims were sufficient to indicate that yhp had exercised its discretion,such that the district court review ed its denials of halo claims under an arbitrary and capricious standard.id.at.
despite the district court conclusion that yale health plan substantially complied with the department of labor regulation and that it was therefore entitled to have halo claims reviewed under the more deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the district court went on to hold that civil penalties are available to a claimant if a plan fails to substantially comply with the regulation.id.at.

background 
congress enacted erisa to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans,and to protect contractually defined benefits.firestone tire rubber bruch,d citations and quotation marks omitted.a key component of erisa statutory plan is section,which requires that,i n accordance with regulations of the department of labor,every employee benefit plan shall do two things first,provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied,setting forth the specific reasons for such denial,written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant and second,afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.
the department of labor first issued a regulation governing claims procedures for employee benefit plans under its erisa section authority in may.see claims procedures for employee benefit plans.may,codified at.two decades later,the department issued a request for information from the public concerning the advisability of amending the regulation,noting that,in the years since the department had issued the regulation,dramatic changes in health care delivery had raised many issues concerning access,coverage,and quality of care.claims procedures for employee benefit plans.
as the department explained in its request for information,o ne of the most important changes since was the growth of managed health care delivery systems,which adopt various measures to control costs and increase efficiency,including impos ing limits or conditions on an individual choice of physicians and often requir ing prior approval before an individual can obtain,or obtain reimbursement for,hospital care or medical services provided by a specialist.id.at.in light of these changes,t he department sought comments concerning the nature of existing benefit determination and review practices of plans and whether the department then existing regulation was adequate to protect the interests of both pension and welfare benefit plan participants and beneficiaries.id.at.among other things,the department asked whether it should adopt minimum standards for filing claims and new minimum standards for requesting review.id.
in september,and in response to the comments it received,the department issued for public comment a proposed regulation revising the minimum requirements for benefit claims procedures of employee benefit plans covered by title i of erisa.erisa rules and regulations for administration and enforcement claims procedures.the department explained that its review of the comments received in response to the request for information had led it to conclude that the procedural standards set in the current regulation were no longer adequate to protect participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.id.at.this inadequacy stemmed partly from the fact that the regulation had been adopted at a time when access to health services was controlled principally by the independent judgments of physicians and other healthcare professionals,but,s ince that time,the growth of managed care delivery systems ha d largely transformed the relationship between patient and health care provider.id.at footnote omitted.among other things,the growth of managed care delivery system s heighten ed concern about the fair and expeditious resolution of benefit disputes.id.accordingly,the department decided to replace the regulation in its entirety.id.at.
in a section of the proposed regulation supplementary information entitled consequences of failure to establish and follow reasonable claims procedures,the department noted that m any of the comments that the department had received in response to the request for information asserted that plans often fail to follow the minimum standards for procedural fairness set by the regulation,and that t he department believe d it was important to make clear that the claims procedure regulation prescribes the minimum standards for an administrative claims review process consistent with erisa.id.at.the department further explained that claimants should not be required to continue to pursue claims through an administrative process that fails to meet the minimum standards of the regulation.id.
the department therefore proposed adding a new subsection providing that a claimant who attempts to pursue a claim is deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available to him or her if the plan fails to provide or to abide by procedures that meet the regulatory minimum standards required under the proposal.id.furthermore,the department was of the view that,in such a case,any decision that may have been made by the plan with respect to the claim is not entitled to the deference that would be accorded to a decision based upon a full and fair review that comports with the requirements of section of the act.id.
following a period,the department issued its revised regulation in november.see erisa rules and regulations for administration and enforcement claims procedures.the regulation preamble,or statement of basis and purpose,explains that t he new standards are intended to ensure more timely benefit determinations,to improve access to information on which a benefit determination is made,and to assure that participants and beneficiaries will be afforded a full and fair review of denied claims.id.at.taking into consideration the purely voluntary nature of the system through which these vital benefits are delivered,the department concluded that the procedural reforms contained in the regulation were necessary to guarantee procedural rights to benefit claimants.id.
among the many changes to the regulation,the most relevant for our purposes was the addition of subsection l,addressing the consequences for the f ailure to establish and follow reasonable claims procedures.l.that subsection provides 
in the case of the failure of a plan to establish or follow claims procedures consistent with the requirements of this section,a claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under section a of the act on the basis that the plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim.
id the department explained in the regulation preamble that its intentions in including this provision in the proposal were to clarify that the procedural minimums of the regulation are essential to procedural fairness and that a decision made in the absence of the mandated procedural protections should not be entitled to any judicial deference.at.the department further noted in the preamble that 
m any commenters representing employers and plans argued that this provision would impose unnecessarily harsh consequences on plans that substantially fulfill the requirements of the regulation,but fall short in minor respects.these commenters suggested that the department adopt instead a standard of good faith compliance as the measure for requiring administrative exhaustion.alternatively,they suggested that the department recognize the judicial doctrine under which exhaustion is required unless the administrative processes impose actual harm on the claimant.
id.at.rejecting these criticisms and suggestions,the department decided to retain the proposed provision in its entirety,noting inasmuch as the regulation makes substantial revisions in the severity of the standards imposed on plans,we believe that plans should be held to the articulated standards as representing the minimum procedural regularity that warrants imposing an exhaustion requirement on claimants.id.at 
discussion 
under erisa section a b,a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b.the issues we address today concern some of the consequences that follow from a plan failure to comply with the department regulation when a participant or beneficiary brings a civil action under erisa section a b.
i.the standard of review applied to claims under erisa section a b 
we begin with the standard of review that courts should apply to a claim under erisa section a b when a plan fails to comply with the department of labor regulation.as discussed above,the department regulation imposes minimum requirements for benefit claims procedures,and the department preamble clarifies that,when a plan fails to comply with those minimum requirements,the plan decision denying a claim should not be entitled to deference in court.see.at.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
although it is a comprehensive and reticulated statute,erisa does not set out the appropriate standard of review for actions under a b challenging benefit eligibility determinations.firestone tire rubber bruch,d citation and quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the supreme court has observed that erisa abounds with the language and terminology of trust law,and,therefore,i n determining the appropriate standard of review for actions under a b,courts are guided by principles of trust law.id.at see also metro.life ins.glenn,d.applying such trust law principles,the firestone court held that a denial of benefits challenged under a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,in which case an arbitrary and capricious standard applies.firestone,at.the district court concluded that yale health plan gives its claims administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.halo yale health plan halo ii,d.trust law principles would therefore normally dictate that a federal court review such eligibility determinations under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.
but the supreme court has also recognized that trust law does not tell the entire story.after all,erisa standards and procedural protections partly reflect a congressional determination that the common law of trusts did not offer completely satisfactory protection.varity howe,d.accordingly,a lthough trust law may offer a starting point for analysis in some situations,it must give way if it is inconsistent with the language of the statute,its structure,or its purposes.hughes aircraft jacobson,d quoting varity,at.in approaching this question,
courts may have to take account of competing congressional purposes,such as congress desire to offer employees enhanced protection for their benefits,on the one hand,and,on the other,its desire not to create a system that is so complex that administrative costs,or litigation expenses,unduly discourage employers from offering welfare benefit plans in the first place.
moreover,n ot only is there no erisa provision directly providing a lenient standard for judicial review of benefit denials,but there is no requirement necessarily entailing such an effect even indirectly.rush prudential hmo,moran,d.rather,the general or default rule is de novo review.id.
bearing these principles in mind,we turn first to trust law and then to regulatory and statutory purpose to determine the appropriate standard of review to apply when a plan fails to comply with the department of labor regulation.
trust law principles 
applying a de novo standard of review to claim denials that fail to comply with the minimum regulatory requirements comports with trust law.the firestone court accorded deference to an administrator discretionary determinations based on the trust law principle that,w hen a trustee has discretion with respect to the exercise of a power,its exercise is subject to supervision by a court only to prevent abuse of discretion.restatement third of trusts am.law inst see also firestone,at citing restatement second of trusts am.law inst for the same principle.equally,however,is the principle that a court may properly interpose if it finds that the trustee conduct,in exercising a discretionary power,fails to satisfy the applicable standard of care,skill,and caution.restatement third of trusts,cmt.under erisa,the department of labor regulation provides the applicable standard of care,skill,and caution that plans must follow when exercising their discretion.under trust law principles,then,courts may interpose,review a claim de novo if they fail to do so.
regulatory and statutory purpose 
regardless of whether trust law would accord deference to an otherwise discretionary decision that failed to comply with the department regulation,we must consider whether such deference conflicts with the language of the statute,its structure,or its purpose,bearing in mind competing congressional purposes.varity,at.foremost among our considerations is that congress entrusted the department of labor,not the courts,to issue a regulation that appropriately addresses erisa competing purposes.our duty today,then,is to interpret that regulation,a task that requires us to examine the regulation text in light of its purpose,as stated in the regulation preamble,see generally kevin stack,interpreting regulations,as well as the purpose of the regulation authorizing statute,erisa,see varity,at.
the regulation and its preamble 
when issuing regulations,the administrative procedure act requires agencies to incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose,c,a statement that is commonly known as the regulation preamble.based on this congressional command,it does not make sense to interpret the text of a regulation independently from its preamble.stack,supra,at see also fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d w e look to the preamble for the administrative construction of the regulation,to which deference is clearly in order.quoting udall tallman,d.outdoor council forest,while language in the preamble of a regulation is not controlling over the regulation itself,we have often recognized that the preamble to a regulation is evidence of an agency contemporaneous understanding of its proposed rules.citation omitted.accordingly,we begin with the regulation text and its preamble.
as noted above,in,the department added to the regulation a subsection addressing the consequences for f ail ing to establish and follow reasonable claims procedures,which provides 
in the case of the failure of a plan to establish or follow claims procedures consistent with the requirements of this section,a claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under section a of the act on the basis that the plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim.
l.the preamble to the regulation explains that the department intentions in including this provision in the proposal were to clarify that the procedural minimums of the regulation are essential to procedural fairness and that a decision made in the absence of the mandated procedural protections should not be entitled to any judicial deference.at emphasis added.in other words,a plan failure to establish or follow the regulation entitles the claimant to have his or her claim reviewed de novo in federal court.
we conclude that the department interpretation of its own regulation as contained in the regulation preamble is entitled to substantial deference based on the regulation ambiguity and the timing,formality,and history of the preamble interpretation.
a.the regulation ambiguity 
in auer robbins,the supreme court held that a department interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,d quoting robertson methow valley citizens council,d.but in christensen harris county,the supreme court clarified that auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous,d.
subsection l of the regulation admittedly says nothing about standards of review.some district courts have read the absence of any reference to the standard of review in subsection l as unambiguously indicating that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review continues to apply to discretionary decisions even if the plan fails to follow the department regulation based on this purported lack of ambiguity,these courts have declined to accord any deference to the regulation preamble.see,kohut hartford life accident ins,d,goldman hartford life accident ins,d.these decisions,however,ignore the legal context in which the department issued its regulation.
in firestone,the supreme court held that courts should defer to an administrator discretionary decision,but this holding is premised on there being a decision to which a court may defer.interpreting firestone,many courts applying the regulation concluded that deference is not warranted if the plan failed to make a decision in the first place.see,nichols prudential ins.of,cir w e may give deferential review only to actual exercises of discretion.gilbertson allied signal,cir deference to the administrator expertise is inapplicable where the administrator has failed to apply his expertise to a particular decision.gritzer cbs,cir where a trustee fails to act or to exercise his or her discretion,de novo review is appropriate because the trustee has forfeited the privilege to apply his or her discretion it is the trustee analysis,not his or her right to use discretion or a mere arbitrary denial,to which a court should defer.citing moench robertson,cir see also jebian hewlett packard.emp.benefits org.income prot.plan,cir decisions made outside the boundaries of conferred discretion are not exercises of discretion,the substance of the decisions notwithstanding.for example,w e previously concluded,based on the regulation,that failure to respond to a plan participant claim within the timeframe established by the department of labor regulations rendered the claim deemed denied and the participant subsequent erisa challenge to the benefits determination subject to de novo review.krauss oxford health plans,cir citing nichols,at.
subsection l states that a plan failure to establish or follow reasonable procedures in accordance with the regulation means that a claimant shall be deemed to have exhausted the administrative remedies available under the plan and shall be entitled to pursue any available remedies under section a of the act on the basis that the plan has failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim.l emphasis added.this language could be reasonably read as incorporating the logic of firestone and its progeny that a claim is subject to de novo review if it is deemed denied,the effective equivalent of being deemed exhausted under the regulation,eastman kodak stwb,cir torres pittston,cir.based on this case law,subsection l is at least ambiguous with respect to the standard of review.and because the regulation is ambiguous,the department interpretation is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at quoting robertson,at.for the reasons discussed above and below,we conclude that the interpretation is fully consistent with the regulation.
b.the timing,formality,and history of the department interpretation 
the timing,formality,and history of the department interpretation further indicate that the department interpretation as contained in the regulation preamble is entitled to substantial deference.the preamble issued contemporaneously with the regulation and thus demonstrates the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.gardebring jenkins,d.in addition,the preamble issued as part of a formal rulemaking,formality that generally entitles an agency interpretation to greater deference.see,christensen,at here,however,we confront an interpretation contained in an opinion letter,not one arrived at after,for example,a formal adjudication or rulemaking.
moreover,the preamble explanation of the regulation is consistent with the regulation history.as noted,the department completely overhauled its regulation two decades after it was first issued because of dramatic changes in health care delivery that raised many issues concerning access,coverage,and quality of care.at.in response to comments that plans often failed to follow the regulation,t he department believe d it was important to make clear that the claims procedure regulation prescribes the minimum standards for an administrative claims review process consistent with erisa.at.to further that intent,the department proposed and ultimately implemented subsection l,the stated purpose of which was to make clear that that a decision made by a plan that did not establish or follow the regulation minimum requirements is not entitled to the deference that would be accorded to a decision based upon a full and fair review that comports with the requirements of section of the act.id.thus,the preamble explanation of subsection l is consistent with the regulation history and purpose.
in sum,then,the department interpretation of its own regulation as contained in the regulation preamble is entitled to substantial deference in light of the regulation ambiguity as well as the timing the preamble was issued contemporaneously with the regulation,formality the preamble was issued as part of a formal process,and history the preamble interpretation is consistent with the reason for revising the regulation of the preamble.
statutory purpose 
having examined the regulation text and preamble,we next address how the department interpretation of its regulation accords with the purpose of the authorizing statute or,more accurately,erisa dual purposes of encouraging employers to continue voluntarily providing benefits while also protecting employees interests in those benefits.see,fifth third bancorp dudenhoeffer,d w e have recognized that erisa represents a careful balancing between ensuring fair and prompt enforcement of rights under a plan and the encouragement and creation of such plans.quotation marks omitted quoting conkright frommert,d.
a key consideration in this discussion is the judicially created exhaustion requirement,which mandates claimants to pursue their claims through their plan claims procedure before filing an erisa section a b suit in federal court.although neither erisa nor the regulation contained an exhaustion requirement,see,amato bernard,cir.at,by the,this circuit and others had recognized the firmly established federal policy favoring exhaustion of administrative remedies in erisa cases,kennedy empire blue cross blue shield,cir quoting alfarone bernie wolff,cir.among other things,administrative exhaustion is a safeguard that encourage s employers and others to undertake the voluntary step of providing medical and retirement benefits to plan participants.larue dewolff,boberg,d roberts,concurring.
but we have also explained that there is a balance to be struck between encouraging employers and protecting employees erisa requires both that employee benefit plans have reasonable claims procedures in place,and that plan participants avail themselves of these procedures before turning to litigation.eastman kodak,at emphasis added.as the department explained in the preamble to the regulation,i nasmuch as the regulation makes substantial revisions in the severity of the standards imposed on plans,we believe that plans should be held to the articulated standards as representing the minimum procedural regularity that warrants imposing an exhaustion requirement on claimants.at.
in other words,if plans comply with the regulation,which is designed to protect employees,the plans get the benefit of both an exhaustion requirement and a deferential standard of review when a claimant files suit in federal court protections that will likely encourage employers to continue to voluntarily provide employee benefits.but if plans do not comply with the regulation,they are not entitled to these protections.that result is
