medical liability mutual insurance company insurer brought this action against alan curtis and evergreene properties of north carolina,llc evergreene seeking a declaratory judgment regarding its duties to defend and indemnify them against claims in an arkansas state court action brought by the estate of annie redden.all parties filed motions for summary judgment.the district court concluded that insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify curtis,that it had a duty to defend evergreene on all claims in the underlying lawsuit,and that its duty to indemnify evergreene extended only to any judgment against it for breach of contract.curtis and evergreene appeal.we affirm.
annie redden entered into a contract with evergreene and moved into its crestpark inn of marianna crestpark nursing home facility in.evergreene holds the medical needs license for crestpark and contracted with alan curtis enterprises,curtis enterprises to provide onsite management and operational services at crestpark and seven other evergreene nursing home facilities in arkansas.redden moved out of crestpark on january,and died in november.
on march,redden estate initiated a state court action in arkansas against evergreene,curtis enterprises,and alan curtis,an employee of curtis enterprises,seeking compensatory and punitive damages for negligence,wrongful death,medical malpractice,and violations of the arkansas long term care resident rights act rra et and other regulations.the estate fourth amended complaint,filed on december,upon which this action is based named evergreene and alan curtis,but not curtis enterprises as defendants and added a breach of contract claim against defendant.
evergreene is the named insured under a primary policy and a supercover umbrella policy originally issued by fireman fund insurance company,but later acquired by insurer which succeeded to all of the obligations under the policies.the primary policy covers claims on an occurrence basis,that is claims are covered only if they arise from incidents that occur while the policy is in force.the policy was in force from january,to january,and therefore does not cover any claim arising from incidents which occurred outside that period.the underlying lawsuit was initiated on march,after which evergreene notified insurer and demanded that it provide coverage under the primary policy both for its defense and indemnity.
insurer brought this action for a declaratory judgment regarding its rights and obligations under the policies.both sides moved for summary judgment.insurer argued that each of the estate claims has a two or three year limitations period.claims with a two year statute of limitations would be timely only if they had arisen from incidents occurring on or after march,since the state court action was initiated on march.timely claims with three year statutes of limitation must have arisen from incidents occurring on or after march.since the policy does not cover claims which arise from incidents occurring after the policy period ended on january,insurer asked the court to declare that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify on any of the estate claims.appellants countered that some of the estate claims should be subject to a five year limitations period,which would trigger coverage under the policy because they could arise from incidents occurring as early as march,a date within the policy period.appellants also argued that the continuous treatment doctrine tolled the statute of limitations on the estate negligence claims because the estate alleged injuries resulting from a continuous course of treatment,part of which may have occurred during the policy period.
the district court concluded that the estate breach of contract claim against defendant had a five year limitations period under arkansas code and that it applied only to evergreene because redden never contracted with curtis.although insurer was held to have a duty to defend and indemnify evergreene against the contract claim because that claim may be based on an incident which occurred during the policy period,insurer has no duties to curtis with regard to that claim.the court also decided that the duty to defend evergreene on the contract claim triggered a duty to defend against all of the estate claims,but not necessarily to indemnify it.the estate other claims were barred by applicable statutes of limitation or were based on incidents occurring outside the policy period,and insurer thus had no duty to indemnify evergreene or curtis on any of them.
since the original complaint was filed on march,and the covered period for occurrences ended on january,the court concluded the case was filed too late to obligate insurer to cover the wrongful death and medical malpractice claims which have a two year limitations period.that was also true for negligence,statutory and regulatory violations,and claims under the rra which the court concluded have a three year limitations period.in addition,the continuous treatment doctrine was held not to toll any of the statutes of limitation.evergreene and curtis appeal.
on appeal evergreene and curtis argue that once the district court determined that insurer had a duty to defend evergreene on the contract claim,triggering a duty to defend on all of the estate claims,it should not have reached any questions regarding the duty to indemnify on the negligence,wrongful death,and rra claims or the duties to defend or indemnify curtis.they contend that resolution of those coverage questions turns on factual issues to be presented in the underlying lawsuit to answer the questions in this action raises the risk of inconsistent judgments.insurer counters that the district court acted within its discretion by resolving all questions about the scope of its duties to defend and indemnify appellants and points out that it is not a party to the underlying lawsuit where different interests and issues are involved.
the rra does not include a limitations provision,and evergreene,curtis,and amicus arkansas advocates for nursing home residents advocates argue that the district court erred by concluding that claims under it are subject to a three year limitations period under arkansas code.evergreene and curtis argue for a five year limitations period,either under on the theory that the claim sounds in contract or under because the claim does not fall under any other arkansas statute of limitations.advocates urge us to certify the rra limitations period question to the arkansas supreme court and argue alternatively that claims under the rra should have no limitations period or five years.insurer argues that a party may not request certification after an adverse judgment,that advocates do not have standing to request certification of an issue to the arkansas supreme court,and that the district court did not err in concluding that the rra claim has a three year statute of limitations because it either sounds in tort or is a statutory source of liability,both of which have a three year limitations period under arkansas law.
evergreene and curtis argue that the district court also erred by concluding that the continuous treatment doctrine did not toll the statute of limitations on the negligence and rra claims and by deciding the issue because it involves a factual dispute which should be resolved in the underlying lawsuit.insurer counters that the district court was correct in concluding that the complaint did not allege facts which could have implicated the continuous treatment doctrine and that regardless,the doctrine would not apply as a matter of law to a relationship between a nursing home and its client.
curtis argues that the district court erred by concluding that insurer does not have a duty to defend him coextensive with its duty to defend evergreene.curtis says that because curtis enterprises acted as evergreene agent in the management and operation of crestpark,the policy obligates insurer to defend him to the same extent it must defend evergreene.insurer counters that curtis was not a party to the contract between redden and evergreene on which the breach of contract claim and the duty to defend are based.
we review for an abuse of discretion a district court decision to exercise jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action in which there are parallel state court proceedings,giving great deference to its analysis and conclusions.see wilton seven falls,d scottsdale ins.detco,cir.an insurer who is not a party to the parallel proceeding is entitled to have the extent of the coverage of its policy declared,scottsdale insurance flowers,cir,quoting american states insurance,cir,and a district court is not prohibited from answering all questions presented to it on declaratory judgment,see royal indemnity apex oil,cir.insurer is not a party to the underlying lawsuit,which involves different interests and issues than those presented here,and the district court did not abuse its discretion by resolving all of insurer questions regarding the scope of its duties to defend and indemnify evergreene and curtis in the underlying lawsuit.

in the fourth amended complaint in the underlying lawsuit the estate seeks compensatory and punitive damages based on its claim that evergreene and curtis negligently,willfully,and recklessly violated the rra resulting in redden injuries and eventual death.the rra,arkansas code et,seeks to protect residents of long term care facilities by requiring licensed facilities to meet certain requirements,and by granting rights to residents.residents now have the right to receive information about the facility,control their own finances,choose their physicians,access information about their medical condition and treatment,and receive adequate and appropriate healthcare.residents are also provided a civil remedy for violation of any enumerated right or for a failure of an employee of the care facility to do something which a reasonably careful person would do or did something which a reasonable person would not do.
arkansas courts have not explicitly addressed which limitations period should apply to claims brought under the rra.amicus advocates urge us to certify this question to the arkansas supreme court.insurer attacks both advocates standing to raise the issue as an amicus and the propriety of requesting certification after an adverse judgment.certification of the rra limitations question at this stage,after the district court has issued its judgment and after we have had full briefing and oral argument,would cause undue delay.the task of a federal court sitting in diversity is to attempt to predict how the forum state highest court would resolve a question which it has not squarely decided.highland,at.by ruling on the limitations issue,the district court helped move this litigation forward.we review its determination of state law de novo.salve regina coll.russell,d whirlpool ritter,cir.
chapter of arkansas code title contains the limitation periods for actions brought in arkansas.et.these statutes of limitation do not apply if a statute already includes a limitations period,but they do apply to all other common law and statutory actions.the statutes of limitation include one year for actions including assault,battery,and slander,three years for actions including trespass,libel,and a ll actions founded on any contract or liability,expressed or implied,two years for medical malpractice,five years for actions to enforce written agreements,and catchall period of five years for actions not described by other sections in chapter.the district court concluded that rra claims have a three year limitations period under,either because they sound in tort or because they are express liabilities by reason of the legislature expression of liability.
based on our review of arkansas law we conclude that the arkansas supreme court,if presented with the issue of which limitations period applies to an rra claim,would decide that such a claim is subject to a three year limitations period under.this conclusion does not of course foreclose the arkansas supreme court from issuing an authoritative decision on this question of state law in a future case.
as early as the arkansas supreme court ruled that a statutorily created liability had a three year limitations period unless that liability was part of a written agreement which would then have a five year limitations period under what is today.davis estate herrington,liability to pay child support created by bastardy statute has three year limitations period under what is now arkansas code.the supreme court has continued to recognize that the statutory liability to pay child support in a divorce or bastardy proceeding has a three year limitations period.winston robinson,wilder garner,but see green bell,questioning whether limitations period for child support has been statutorily changed to ten years by amendment to.this precedent was then applied by the same court in a different type of case in nebraska national bank walsh.
nebraska national bank involved a statute which made corporate presidents and secretaries liable for corporate debts incurred during any period in which the officers failed to file certain financial information with the county clerk.the supreme court decided that a three year limitations period applies,for h aving reached the conclusion that this is a statutory liability,the statute of limitations would be the three year limitation applicable to all actions founded upon any contract or liability,expressed or implied,not in writing,citing sand.dig,now.numerous arkansas decisions have relied on nebraska national bank in holding that claims under that and similar corporate officer liability statutes have a three year limitations period.see love couch,period of limitation applicable for the enforcement of statutory liabilities is three years mcdonald mueller,former creates statutory liability which has three year limitations period under what is now zimmerman fire ins,claim under former has three year statute of limitations based on nebraska national bank.
although the arkansas supreme court has not squarely decided which limitations period applies to an rra claim,it has explicitly referred to an rra claim as a statutory claim,koch northport health servs.of,llc.we have found no arkansas case questioning the general proposition that where a statute creates a liability but does not include a limitations provision and no other statute of limitations applies a claim to enforce the statutory liability is an action founded on liability,expressed or implied under and is subject to a three year limitations period.other recent cases support the district court application of to the estate rra claim.see highland,at applies to private suits brought under arkansas hazardous waste management act chalmers toyota motor sales,usa,applies to statutory liability under arkansas franchise law,citing winston,at.we conclude that the arkansas supreme court would likely hold that an rra claim is an action based on a statutory liability which has a three year limitations period under.
we also agree with the district court that it is possible that arkansas courts might determine that an rra claim sounds in tort and is therefore subject to a three year limitations period under arkansas code.as insurer argued in the district court,the rra essentially codifies the common law negligence standard.the estate complaint alleged that redden injuries were the result of employees agents of defendants,failing to do that,which a reasonably careful person would do under similar circumstances in arkansas i t is well settled that the gist of the action as alleged in the complaint determines which statute of limitations applies.shelter ins.arnold,emphasis added see ernest loewer.farms,bank of,horn.
advocates argue that the rra is more in the nature of a privately enforceable civil rights law than a codification of ordinary duties of care,however,
