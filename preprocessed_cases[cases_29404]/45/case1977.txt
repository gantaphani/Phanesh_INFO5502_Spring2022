the issue this case presents is whether the district court violated california law in dismissing appellant lana guebara bad faith claims because there were genuine issues as to coverage.guebara argues that the genuine issue rule should be limited to disputes over contractual language and california insurance law.we hold that the district court did not err in applying the genuine issue rule to this case,and we affirm.
factual background 
on may,lana guebara house burned down.the house in niland,california,was appraised at as of april.guebara was attempting to sell the house although it needed considerable electrical and structural work,in which she owned a percent interest.the house was insured by allstate under a deluxe homeowners insurance policy,which contains a fraud and concealment provision that says 
this policy is void if it was obtained by misrepresentation,fraud,or concealment of material facts or if you intentionally conceal or misrepresent any material fact or circumstance,before or after loss if it is determined that this policy is void,all premiums paid will be returned to you since there has been no coverage under this policy.
guebara contacted allstate on the day of the fire,which killed four of her dogs and destroyed most of her belongings.allstate immediately advanced guebara for living expenses.a week after the fire,allstate referred her claim to its special investigations unit because independent fire investigators believed that guebara had overstated the quantity and value of her personal property allegedly destroyed by the fire.investigators also continued to probe the cause of the blaze.
on may,the day after the fire,allstate claims adjuster,joel alba,interviewed guebara.when alba asked guebara about appliances in the house at the time of the fire,she mentioned a washer,dryer,refrigerator,and stove.alba also asked her about television and stereo equipment 
q okay,what about the,do you have any tvs or anything like that 
a i had a console tv.
q any stereo systems or anything like that 
a no,i had an antique dresser that was about years old.
q okay,and any other electronic equipment or appliances that i did not,major appliances 
a oh,a microwave.
four days later,guebara and her daughter,karen dixon,provided allstate with a formal list of personal property destroyed by the fire.the list was several pages long and contained items valued at,including a stereo,a vcr,worth of video cassettes,and worth of camping equipment.
allstate investigators returned to the scene of the fire on may,with guebara list in hand.dave johnson,an independent fire investigator hired by allstate,inspected every room of the house along with the niland fire department chief mike aleksick and captain lynn mara johnson found remains of about only percent of the items on guebara list and found no trace of the following vcr,one of the ceiling fans,stereo,cassette deck,turntable,pressure cooker,luggage,jewelry boxes,camping equipment,coin collection,kirby vacuum cleaner,electric broom,rug shampooer,headboards,singer sewing machine,night stand,video cassettes,video games,polaroid camera,mm camera,first aid kits,crock pots,or crystal glass.johnson report filed with allstate in late may indicated that most of these items,if they were in the house at the time of the fire,should have left some type of residue.
on may,dixon called allstate in order to express concern about the fire department taking additional pictures of the home.dixon informed alba that she and a friend had gone through the house and moved debris around while trying to identify damaged items.dixon did not mention that she had removed anything from the scene.on may,guebara sister and of the property,sharon jensen,informed allstate that guebara was in the process of taking a loan on the property in order to repair the house and to repay jensen.that same day,allstate referred the case to its special investigations unit and informed dixon that the investigation would be completed in days.the niland fire department was still investigating the fire cause.on june,allstate informed guebara that no further payment would be made until the investigation was completed.
on june,allstate confronted guebara with inconsistencies between the contents list and the experts investigation.during an examination under oath euo,guebara was asked why she had not mentioned anything about a stereo or a vcr during her initial interview and why fire investigators did not find remnants of these items.guebara eventually withdrew the vcr from the contents list,explaining that dixon had removed it from the house in.guebara never mentioned that dixon and dixon friend had removed any items from the house after the fire.guebara claimed that the missing contents burned up in the heat of the fire.
on july,guebara attorney notified allstate that dixon had removed some items from the house during a scavenger hunt following the fire.on september,allstate took the statements of dixon and her friend,suska brandon.they stated that they had rummaged through the remains of the house on may and.dixon said that she found nonsalvageable items such as the sewing machine,describing them as blobs.she said that she removed the items in order to show her children what fire could do so they would not play with matches.dixon said that she took the items in three garbage bags back to their motel,but she threw them away because they smelled bad.guebara later testified that dixon children were at the house during the scavenger hunt.dixon eventually added to her transcript that she removed the items in order to help her mother cope with the loss.brandon said dixon had made a list of the items that they found.dixon,however,testified that she did not make a list.
on october,dixon requested a copy of the audiotape of her recorded statement.upon being asked to review,correct and sign her transcript,dixon claimed that her transcript did not reflect her actual interview.allstate mailed dixon and brandon their audiotapes on november.allstate again inquired on february,why dixon and brandon had not signed and corrected their transcripts.two weeks later,allstate counsel received signed copies of the transcripts.on march,the of the house accepted allstate offer for of the actual cash value of the structure.on april,allstate sent guebara a letter stating that it was not conducting an arson investigation.yet allstate indicated that it was continuing to investigate guebara contents claim.
the opinions of allstate independent experts contradicted dixon and brandon explanations about the missing items.johnson said that he had been at the site on three different days and saw no signs that anyone had been rummaging through the debris.on april,johnson issued a report after reviewing all of the testimony from guebara,the fire chiefs,and guebara witnesses.johnson concluded that the physical evidence did not support guebara claims of loss of contents 
dixon stated that on may and,she,her mother guebara and brandon visited the fire scene during the visits they went through the rubble in an effort to find salvageable items dixon described most of the items in vague terms,blobs,melted plastic,torched.it is difficult to understand how the untrained eye of dixon was able to identify so many items.
the investigator visited the scene on three occasions,may,and.there were no significant changes in the fire scene between the may and visits.if any salvageable items remained in the house they would have been small items in areas that would have been protected,in the lower portion of dresser drawers and cabinets,under linens.in order to retrieve these items considerable excavation would have been required.there was no evidence of that having occurred.
chief aleksick confirmed johnson conclusions that there were no signs of excavation.although aleksick concluded that the fire started on the kitchen stove,he stated no exact conclusions regarding his suspicions of arson 
on june,allstate received a letter from guebara attorney indicating that he had been dismissed from the case.the letter also informed allstate of other witnesses who had seen the items before they were allegedly lost in the fire.allstate subsequently interviewed those witnesses.on june,guebara informed allstate that she had her attorney.on september,allstate sent guebara a letter denying her contents claim on the grounds of misrepresentation as to the personal property allegedly destroyed by the fire.
in september,guebara served allstate with a lawsuit alleging eight causes of action,including breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith.on april,allstate moved for summary judgment on all claims except breach of contract.on june,the district court granted allstate motion,including the bad faith claim with regard to the contents but excluding the bad faith claim with regard to the structure.in dismissing the bad faith claim with regard to the contents,the district court said in the instant case,allstate presents considerable evidence to support its contention that there was a genuine issue as to its duty to pay plaintiff benefits for her contents claim under the policy.
after granting allstate motion for reconsideration,the district court also granted allstate summary judgment motion on the bad faith claim with regard to the structure.the district court concluded that a genuine issue existed about the structure claim,given the fraud and concealment language in the policy and the majority rule though unaddressed in california that a material misrepresentation about a personal property claim may void a claim about the structure.
the district court denied guebara motion for reconsideration about bad faith as to the contents claim.the district court was unpersuaded by guebara new evidence,which included a deposition from chief aleksick acknowledging that some of the items had been found photographs of the debris taken in june personal photographs taken well before the fire and debris found by guebara attorney in a dumpster on her property two years after the fire.the district court,however,granted guebara motion excluding any evidence of arson,finding that allstate had waived the affirmative defense because it denied that it was conducting an arson investigation.
on september,a jury found breach of contract and awarded guebara.the district court did not award any attorneys fees.judgment was entered in guebara favor on january.guebara timely appealed the district court dismissal of her bad faith claims.allstate the district court order excluding evidence of arson and the court instructions regarding the jury calculation of damages.

we review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.see gilbrook city of westminster,cir.
we review a district court formulation of civil jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.gilbrook,at.when the alleged error is in the formulation of the instructions,the instructions are to be considered as a whole and an abuse of discretion standard is applied to determine if they are misleading or inadequate.see masson new yorker magazine,cir.
iii.genuine issue as to insurer liability 
in order to establish a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under california law,a plaintiff must show benefits due under the policy were withheld and the reason for withholding benefits was unreasonable or without proper cause.see love fire ins,d.the key to a bad faith claim is whether or not the insurer denial of coverage was reasonable.under california law,a bad faith claim can be dismissed on summary judgment if the defendant can show that there was a genuine dispute as to coverage 
a court can conclude as a matter of law that an insurer denial of a claim is not unreasonable,so long as there existed a genuine issue as to the insurer liability.an insurer is liable for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if it acted unreasonably in denying coverage.

guebara argues that the genuine issue as to coverage rule also known as the genuine dispute doctrine should not be applied to allegations of a biased investigation rather,the rule should be limited to when there is a dispute over the meaning of a contractual provision or unsettled california insurance law.the dissent refashions guebara claim into an argument that the genuine issue as to coverage rule should be limited to disputes that are quintessentially legal,but not applied to disputes that are quintessentially factual.
although california law governs our resolution of this case,the california supreme court has not discussed the scope of the genuine issue rule.our task is to surmise how the state supreme court would decide the issue.the holding in a recent california appeals court decision,though not controlling,is instructive the genuine dispute doctrine may be applied where the insurer denies a claim based on the opinions of experts.fraley allstate ins,th,d,citing allstate ins.madan,and austero national cas,d,disapproved of on other grounds by egan mutual of omaha ins,cal d.fraley,which affirmed a summary judgment order in the insurer favor,involved a dispute over the cost to repair the insured home that was extensively damaged by fire.contractors for both parties could not agree on the cost of repairs.fraley held where the parties rely on expert opinions,even a substantial disparity in estimates for the scope and cost of repairs does not,by itself,suggest the insurer acted in bad faith.fraley,th at,d at.furthermore,an insurer may give its own interests consideration equal to that it gives the interests of its insured s.id.quoting love,d at.at.
the ninth circuit has affirmed the dismissal of bad faith claims in numerous cases over the past years because of genuine issues about liability under california law.in some of these cases,we found a genuine dispute as to coverage,despite the insurer failure to investigate the claim,because of a dispute over the policy language.see american casualty krieger,cir applying california law and finding a genuine dispute whether sport or athletic language included bungee jumping joint venture pacific erectors,cir finding no duty to investigate under california law if there is a genuine dispute over policy language franceschi american motorists ins,cir applying california law and finding a genuine dispute about the meaning of medical treatment in condition clause of policy hanson prudential ins,cir finding a genuine dispute as to whether preadolescent residential treatment facility constituted a hospital under the policy as construed pursuant to california law.in other cases,we found a genuine issue as to coverage even when the district court failed to state a reason for denying the bad faith claim.see lunsford,at because the insurer investigated the insureds claim and based its refusal to defend on that information and a reasonable construction of the policy,the insurer did not act in bad faith safeco ins.of america guyton,cir finding a genuine dispute over california insurance law about negligence.
no ninth circuit case,however,has limited the genuine issue as to coverage rule to legal disputes.lunsford indicates just the opposite,finding a lack of bad faith based on information from the insurer investigation and the insurer construction of the policy.see lunsford,at.nor does finding the insurer liable under the policy mean that bad faith claims automatically proceed to the jury.see franceschi,at a court can conclude as a matter of law that an insurer denial of a claim is not unreasonable,even if the court concludes the claim is payable under the policy terms,so long as there existed a genuine issue as to the insurer liability.citation omitted emphasis added.
lower federal courts have applied the rule to quintessentially factual disputes,or where information revealed by the insurer independent experts is inconsistent with an insured claims.see phelps provident life accident ins,d,applying california law and finding that a genuine dispute existed about disability insurance liability based on surveillance films and examinations by three independent physicians.phelps concluded while plaintiffs dispute the results of the examinations,it is clear that a genuine issue regarding defendant continuing liability under the terms and conditions of the insuring agreement existed based on defendant investigation and reports.id.at.see also allstate ins.madan,finding a genuine dispute as to coverage based on the testimony of three independent experts.in madan,allstate investigator and three independent fire experts concluded that a wildfire did not cause the blaze that destroyed the madans home.furthermore,allstate had evidence that the madans were experiencing financial hardship.thus,the court found that allstate discovered evidence sufficient to find a genuine issue of liability under the policy.id.at.
other lower federal courts,however,have characterized the rule as being limited to disputes over policy language.see,dym provident life accident ins,d,finding a genuine dispute because this error was not based on a mistake regarding the facts surrounding plaintiff disability fact but rather a mistake as to how the disability provision should be interpreted aronson state farm ins,wl,no.cas bqrx,at.may,finding that t he genuine issue standard,or a similar standard,has been applied with particular force where,as here,the insurance claim presented either a complex or unresolved issue of law in the jurisdiction citations omitted.no district court in this circuit,however,has refused to apply the rule solely because the insurance company decision was based on information from independent experts or because the dispute was purely factual.
given the current state of california insurance law,the state appeals court recent decision in fraley,and the decisions of this court and other federal courts,we decline to limit the genuine dispute doctrine to purely legal or contractual disputes.rather than establish a rule,we hold that the genuine dispute doctrine should be applied on a basis.in some cases,the application of the rule to purely factual disputes will be inappropriate.in others,investigations by a defendant independent experts will permit the invocation of the doctrine and summary judgment for the defendant on a bad faith claim.
in this case,allstate experts questioned the validity of guebara contents list from the outset.guebara initially submitted an contents list.the list contradicted guebara initial interview with allstate claims adjuster.three independent investigators subsequently searched every room in the house and found only percent of the items on the list.although some of the items were eventually accounted for,even treating the evidence most favorably to guebara,none of the items such as the stereo,the television,the polaroid and millimeter cameras,or the camping equipment was ever found.
from guebara and her family,allstate received inconsistent explanations about the missing contents.guebara daughter,sharon dixon,initially informed allstate that she had rummaged through the debris,but she did not mention that anything had been removed.guebara testified during her euo that the missing contents were lost in the heat of the fire.a month later,dixon claimed to have removed some of the nonsalvageable items from the scene in order to show her children.dixon later claimed she had removed the items in order to show guebara.yet both dixon children and guebara were at the scene when dixon allegedly removed the items,which were never recovered.
johnson final report issued april,found no evidence that anyone had rummaged through the scene.aleksick and mara of the niland fire department corroborated johnson report.in addition to the three expert opinions and guebara inconsistent explanations,allstate learned of guebara extreme financial hardship.her house was recently appraised at,declining in value from,and it needed substantial electrical and structural repairs.guebara had put the house up for sale,and she had taken out a loan on the house.
allstate had legitimate bases for disputing guebara contents claim.this was not a case where allstate was simply unwilling to pay off the policy.it paid the of the house based on half the value of the structure.this case is directly in line with phelps,madan,and fraley.in all of these cases,the insurance companies disputed insurance claims based on the opinions of independent experts.as in phelps and fraley,in this case allstate relied on three expert opinions and other suspicious factors,including guebara inconsistent explanations,to deny insurance benefits.thus,we find that allstate refusal to pay guebara claim was reasonable.
guebara real problem with allstate investigation is not that it was biased but that it took too long.bad faith,according to the dissent,was based on the insurer unreasonable delay.part of the delay can be blamed on guebara witnesses.on september,allstate took the statements of guebara daughter,sharon dixon,and dixon friend,suska brandon.yet they did not return their signed transcripts until april.in april,based on these transcripts,johnson issued his final report.in june,guebara presented allstate with additional witnesses who had seen the items in the house before the fire.allstate interviewed the witnesses and denied the claim in september.
allstate probably should have denied guebara claim in may instead of interviewing more witnesses at guebara request in june.allstate also probably should have denied guebara claim in july or august before guebara filed her lawsuit in september.at best,by not denying guebara claim during the summer of instead of in september,allstate was merely negligent.and under california law,negligence is not bad faith.see aceves allstate ins,cir citing national life accident ins.edwards,d,mere negligence is not enough to constitute unreasonable behavior for the purpose of establishing a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in an insurance case.
if anything,allstate is guilty of investigating too much.but if allstate had terminated its investigation immediately after interviewing dixon and brandon in october,it could have exposed itself to bad faith liability for not investigating enough.under california law,an insurer may breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing when it fails to properly investigate its insured claim.egan,cal d at.the insurer in egan denied the claim without a thorough investigation and without any good faith reason to believe that it was not liable for the claim,at.this case involves an independent investigation by three experts and a valid reason for denying the claim.in many genuine dispute cases based on the interpretation of policy language or on the current state of california insurance law,the insurers use the genuine dispute as a valid reason to terminate the investigation immediately.see id.at.in this case,guebara merely asserts that allstate prolonged investigation was biased and unreasonably long.the evidence does not support these allegations.
this case demonstrates why the dissent suggestion that we limit the genuine dispute doctrine to purely legal issues is unworkable.the genuine dispute in this case was not purely factual.the genuine dispute as to the contents claims was based on factual expert opinions,inconsistent testimony by guebara and her witnesses,and desperate financial circumstances.the genuine dispute as to the structure claim,however,was based on the fraud language in the policy and on an unsettled issue in california insurance law.thus,the dissent rule fails to account for cases such as this one where the genuine disputes are both legal and factual.if any rules are to be drawn about the genuine dispute doctrine,we leave that task for the california supreme court.
our decision does not eliminate bad faith claims based on an insurer allegedly biased investigation.expert testimony does not automatically insulate insurers from bad faith claims based on biased investigations.although this list is not exhaustive,we can think of several circumstances where biased investigation claims could go to a jury the insurer is guilty of misrepresenting the nature of the investigatory proceedings,see tomaselli transamerica ins,th,d,allowing a bad faith claim to go to the jury where an insurance company without any evidence of fraud forced an insured to submit to an examination under oath,dissuaded the insured from having an attorney present,and misled the insured about the purpose of the examination the insurer employees lie during the depositions or to the insured the insurer dishonestly selected its experts the insurer experts were unreasonable and the insurer failed to conduct a thorough investigation.
thus,we hold that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on guebara bad faith claims based on the genuine dispute doctrine.the genuine dispute doctrine is not limited to purely legal disputes it should be applied on a basis.in this case,the insurer three independent experts and the insured inconsistent explanations justified the invocation of the genuine dispute rule.
iv.exclusion of arson defense 
on,allstate argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting guebara motion to exclude evidence of arson.we affirm the district court decision because allstate repeatedly denied to guebara that it was conducting an arson investigation.in a april,letter to guebara,allstate wrote 
i have informed you repeatedly that allstate is not conducting an arson investigation in this matter as no investigating agency,to my knowledge,has confirmed that this is an arson fire,it is difficult to understand how allstate could be conducting such an investigation.i must note that,if some fire investigator determined that this matter was an arson fire,guebara had the opportunity to start the arson fire,had the motive to do so,and could have benefitted therefrom.while that may be intellectually interesting,it has no bearing on this matter unless and until some investigative agent would determine officially that the fire was an arson fire.
allstate assured guebara that arson would have no bearing on its coverage analysis.none of allstate experts officially concluded that this was an arson fire.its claim denial letter also did not mention arson.
under california law,t he waiver must be either express,based on the words of the waiving party,or implied,based on conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right.waller truck ins,cal th,d,citations omitted.based on the april letter,the district court did not err in finding an express waiver and precluding arson evidence at trial.it does not matter whether arson is an affirmative defense or just evidence to rebut guebara claim.nor does it matter that arson was not mentioned in the claim denial letter.see id.at,d,finding that waiver does not occur automatically because of a failure to include a defense in the denial letter.what matters is that,based on allstate april letter,guebara relied on allstate assertions that it was not investigating arson,and therefore she did not hire a fire investigator of her own.thus,we affirm the district court exclusion of the arson evidence.
jury instruction on actual cash value 
finally,allstate argues that the district court failed to instruct the jury to award only the actual cash value of all personal property lost in the fire.guebara insurance policy limited her contents claim to actual cash value depreciated value,not the replacement value.the district court granted allstate motion to exclude all evidence of the replacement costs of guebara personal property.
allstate argues that the district court instruction on california insurance code contravened its ruling and improperly allowed the jury to award replacement costs.although the district court instruction was not a model of clarity,it instructed the jury to award actual cash value the plaintiff is entitled to recover the actual cash value on these items in her contents claim,only entitled to recover the actual cash value of these ones that you find were in the house at the time of the fire.
the district court references to insurance code section,which deals with waiver of proof of loss,did not instruct the jury to award replacement costs.nor did the jury award replacement costs.it simply found guebara contents list a more credible estimate of the actual cash value than the estimate provided by allstate two years after the fire.guebara contents list distinguished between actual cash value and replacement costs.therefore,we affirm the district court instruction as to actual cash value.
i respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that upholds the district court grant of summary judgment to allstate on guebara bad faith claims.the critical issue is whether the genuine issue as to coverage rule genuine issue rule applies to factual disputes concerning coverage under an insurance policy or if the rule is limited to coverage disputes over the meaning of the policy.i conclude that the california supreme court would limit the rule to questions of law.thus,i would reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to allstate on guebara bad faith claims and remand them for trial.alternatively,i would certify whether the genuine issue rule applies to factual disputes concerning coverage under california law to the california supreme court.
what is at stake is not whether guebara ultimately should prevail on her bad faith claims,but rather whether she has raised genuine issues that should be decided by the jury under the rule the majority would adopt as california law,whenever a factual dispute is advanced,whether real or debatable or even manufactured by the insurer,the insured is foreclosed from presenting to a jury her bad faith claim.
the facts in this case are admittedly messy,but all the more reason to let the jury decide.the record here contains evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to guebara,that is sufficient to withstand summary judgment.allstate did almost nothing to investigate guebara claim after august of allstate did not deny guebara claim until she filed suit,sixteen months after the fire and allstate paid guebara sister for her share of the structure claim,despite refusing to pay guebara and asserting that guebara fraud voided the entire policy.allstate had a duty to investigate fully guebara claim in a timely manner,even if it believed that she had made a fraudulent claim.at a minimum,the evidence in the record at least presents a genuine question as to whether allstate fulfilled its duty tomaselli transamerica ins,th,d,of course the insurer denies its investigation or claims handling were in bad faith,and posits innocent explanations for each of the indicia of bad faith cited by the insured.while these charges and demonstrate that the evidence can be viewed differently,they also demonstrate that the issue was one for the jury to decide,and that either determination would find adequate evidentiary support.upholding jury finding of bad faith as supported by substantial evidence.
under california law,every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that requires each party to the contract to act in a manner not to injure the rights of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.kransco am.empire surplus lines ins,cal th,d.since insurance policies are contracts,they contain the implied covenant.id.central to the inquiry for determining whether an insurer has violated the implied covenant is whether the insurer has processed an insured claim under a policy in a reasonable manner.see,gourley state farm mut.auto.ins,cal d,d,in bank the substance of a bad faith action in these first party matters is the insurer unreasonable refusal to pay
