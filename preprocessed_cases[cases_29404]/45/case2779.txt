discussion 
standard of review 
statutory construction is a question of law we decide de novo.citation.our primary objective in interpreting a statute is to determine and give effect to the underlying legislative intent.citation.intent is determined foremost by the plain meaning of the statutory language.if the language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for judicial construction.when the language is reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,it is proper to examine a variety of extrinsic aids in an effort to discern the intended meaning.we may consider,for example,the statutory scheme,the apparent purposes underlying the statute and the presence or absence of instructive legislative history.citation.city of brentwood central valley regional water quality control bd.th,d.our review of the ruling on the constitutional question is also de novo.city and county of san francisco sainez th,d.
statutory scheme 
the california constitution empowers the legislature to create and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,including full provision for adequate insurance coverage against liability to pay or furnish compensation full provision for regulating such insurance coverage in all its aspects and full provision for otherwise securing the payment of compensation cal,art.xiv.
the legislature has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme for workers compensation insurance,et labor code section requires employers to secure the payment of compensation by obtaining workers compensation insurance from an insurer duly authorized to write compensation insurance in california or through a program approved by the director of industrial relations the director the securing of the payment of compensation in a way provided in this division is essential to the functioning of the expressly declared social public policy of this state in the matter of workers compensation.the conduct or operation of any business or undertaking without full compensation security,in continuing violation of social policy,shall be subject to imposition of business strictures and monetary penalties by the director,subd.a.
where an employer has failed to secure the payment of compensation as required by section,the director shall issue and serve on such employer a stop order prohibiting the use of employee labor by such employer until the employer compliance with the provisions of section.at the time the stop order is issued and served pursuant to section,the director shall also issue and serve a penalty assessment order requiring the uninsured employer to pay to the director,for deposit in the state treasury to the credit of the uninsured employers fund,the sum of one thousand dollars per employee employed at the time the order is issued and served,as an additional penalty for being uninsured at that time,subd.a.however,the maximum penalty that may be assessed is,subd.f.
different penalty provisions apply if an injured employee files a claim for compensation and the workers compensation appeals board finds that an employer had not secured the payment of compensation as required by the workers compensation law,subd.d.after the time for any appeal has expired and the adjudication of the claim has become final,the uninsured employer shall be assessed and pay as a penalty either of the following in noncompensable cases,two thousand dollars per each employee employed at the time of the claimed injury.in compensable cases,ten thousand dollars per each employee employed on the date of the injury.ibid.the maximum penalty that may be assessed is,subd.f.
the director may,at any time,require any employer to furnish a written statement showing the name of his or her insurer or the manner in which the employer has complied with the provisions of section.failure of the employer for a period of days to furnish the written statement is prima facie evidence that he or she has failed or neglected in respect to the matters so required an insured employer who fails to respond to an inquiry respecting his or her status as to his or her workers compensation security shall be assessed and required to pay a penalty of five hundred dollars to the director for deposit in the state treasury to the credit of the uninsured employers fund.
an employer may contest a penalty assessment order by filing a written request for a hearing within days after service of the order.upon receipt of the request,the director must set the matter for a hearing within days.ibid.an employer aggrieved by the decision of the director may take a writ of mandate from the findings upon the execution of a bond to the state in double the amount found due,as long as the party agrees to pay any judgment and costs rendered against the party for the assessment.ibid.
labor code section authorizes the director to withdraw erroneous penalty assessments the director may withdraw a stop order or a penalty assessment order where investigation reveals the employer had secured the payment of compensation as required by section on the date and at the time of service of such order.the director also may withdraw a penalty assessment order where investigation discloses that the employer was insured on the date and at the time of an injury or claimed injury,or where an insured employer responded in writing to a request to furnish the status of his workers compensation coverage within the time prescribed.
in addition to the penalty provisions set forth above,former labor code section provided that t he failure to secure the payment of compensation as required by this article by one who knew,or because of his or her knowledge or experience should be reasonably expected to have known,of the obligation to secure the payment of compensation,is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the county jail for up to one year,or by a fine of up to ten thousand dollars,or by both that imprisonment and fine.
withdrawal of penalty assessment 
employer contends that although it did not have insurance through an authorized carrier,it was insured at the date and time of any injuries to employees and its employees were not deprived of any benefits.therefore,employer contends,the dlse had discretion under labor code section to withdraw or reduce the penalty assessment against employer.we conclude relief was not available to employer under labor code section.
labor code section authorizes the dlse to withdraw a stop order or penalty assessment order upon finding that the penalized employer had in fact secured the payment of compensation as required by the workers compensation provisions at the time the order was served withdraw a penalty assessment where the employer was in fact insured at the time of a claimed injury and withdraw a penalty assessment where the employer in fact responded to a request to furnish evidence of coverage within the prescribed time 
the latter two provisions for relief under labor code section are inapplicable in this case.employer was not cited under labor code section,subdivision d for a failure to secure payment of compensation at the time an employee was injured.this case does not present an issue regarding injured employees.nor was employer cited for failing to respond to a request to furnish evidence of coverage under labor code section.the basis for the stop order and penalty assessment against employer was employer failure to secure payment of compensation as required by labor code section.accordingly,the only possible basis for relief available to employer is found in the first provision of labor code section.employer is only entitled to relief in the instant case if the record supports a finding that the penalized employer had in fact secured payment of compensation as required by the workers compensation provisions at the time the order was served.
employer was not entitled to relief under the first provision of labor code section.the record is uncontradicted that employer failed to secure compensation as required by the workers compensation statutes at the time the stop order was issued.the insurance company utilized by employer was not duly authorized to write compensation insurance in california.presented with a record revealing that employer was in violation of labor code section,the dlse had no statutory authority to relieve employer of the penalty assessment.the trial court properly denied the petition for writ of mandate under these circumstances.
due process 
employer contends the penalty provisions of labor code section,subdivision a are unconstitutional on their face or unconstitutional as applied in this case.we disagree.
t he legislature may constitutionally impose reasonable penalties to secure obedience to statutes enacted under the police power,so long as those enactments are procedurally fair and reasonably related to a proper legislative goal.citation.kinney vaccari cal d.imposition of civil penalties has,increasingly in modern times,become a means by which legislatures implement statutory policy.hale morgan cal d.c ivil penalties may have a punitive or deterrent aspect,but their primary purpose is to secure obedience to statutes and regulations imposed to assure important public policy objectives.kizer county of san mateo cal d.it is not uncommon for a civil penalty to require no proof of actual harm.city and county of san francisco sainez,supra,th at,d.moreover,a penalty statute presupposes that its violation produces damage beyond that which is compensable.citation.ibid.
the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions are the most basic substantive checks on government power to act unfairly or oppressively.hale morgan,supra,cal d at.courts have consistently assumed that oppressive or unreasonable statutory penalties may be invalidated as violative of due process.citation.id.at.we examine the penalty provision to determine whether,as enacted or as specifically applied,the penalties authorized are reasonable and proper or arbitrary and oppressive.ibid.
in considering the constitutionality of a penalty assessment,the courts have examined whether the amount of the statutory penalty is mandatory the duration of the penalty is potentially unlimited the prohibited acts encompass a broad range of culpable conduct and widely divergent injuries the penalty is imposed equally on those with different levels of sophistication and financial strength and the penalty is potentially more severe than that provided by the legislature for other more serious transgressions under the statutory scheme.kinney vaccari,supra,cal d at,hale morgan,supra,cal d at.
a penalty provision that is suspect for these reasons is facially constitutional if under some circumstances,the application of the penalty would be constitutional.hale morgan,supra,cal d at.a statute is presumed to be constitutional and it must be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly,positively and unmistakably appears.citations.ibid.where a penal statute may be subject to both constitutional and unconstitutional applications,courts evaluate the propriety of the sanction on a basis.ibid.a penalty may be unconstitutionally excessive as applied to the facts of a particular case.ibid.
the penalty assessment required under labor code section,subdivision a,is not unconstitutional on its face.although the amount of the penalty is mandatory,the amount is limited to by labor code section,subdivision f.moreover,the am
