background 
harris is a medical doctor,specifically,an anesthesiologist.as such,she was required to work long shifts.her tasks were physically and mentally demanding.because she worked in surgical procedures,harris was required to use and was surrounded by latex products.at the time harris claims to have become disabled,she was working approximately hours per week and earning over annually.
in,while living and working in california,harris entered into a disability insurance contract with provident,whereby harris would receive benefits if she became unable to work as an anesthesiologist.at the time harris claims to have become disabled,the insurance policy provided benefits in the amount of per month if harris became totally disabled.the insurance policy states that a covered person is totally disabled if she is not able to perform the substantial and material duties of her occupation and she is receiving care by a physician which is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.the policy further states that occupation means the occupation in which the covered person is engaged at the time she becomes disabled,including the person specialty.
on or about march and,harris was working at glens falls hospital as the staff anesthesiologist.during her shift,harris worked primarily in the obstetrics department,but also went in and out of the operating room for various procedures.at that time,the obstetrics department was undergoing major construction for latex abatement,which made the area very dusty.harris began to feel ill and to have difficulty breathing.harris continued to feel ill for several days,and on march,she was examined by michael slaughter,an allergist.slaughter informed harris that he believed she had asthma,which he believed could have been induced by an allergy to latex.
between march,and may,harris attempted to work as an anesthesiologist both at glens falls hospital and at another area hospital,avoiding the construction area at glens falls.throughout that time period,harris avoided using latex gloves,and took medication to treat her symptoms.on may,harris returned to slaughter after having difficulty breathing at work.slaughter advised harris to stop working.harris has not worked as an anesthesiologist since that date.
on or about may,harris submitted a claim to provident asserting,in a physician statement prepared by slaughter,that she had become unable to work due to latex induced asthma,plus latex anaphylactoid reaction,plus latex contact reactivity,plus allergic rhinitis.provident paid preliminary disability benefits to harris for the period from may,through september,but informed harris that she would have to provide proof of continuing disability on a monthly basis.
in september,james demasi,an allergist and asthma specialist,evaluated harris at provident request demasi testified at his deposition that he was retained by provident to determine whether harris had a latex allergy he was not specifically asked to determine whether harris had asthma,but the presence or absence of asthma was part of the evaluation because it may be a symptom of latex allergy.demasi found no evidence that harris was allergic to latex,but suspected that harris may have some asthma.demasi also suspected that harris had an anxiety disorder which included a perception of a latex allergy.demasi tested harris lung capacity,which was normal,and determined that whatever asthma harris might have was triggered by dust or other irritants other than latex.on the basis of these findings,provident denied harris application for benefits,notifying harris of its decision by a letter she received on or about october.harris appealed the denial to provident review board,which affirmed the decision to deny benefits on november,noting that harris had not presented any new evidence that she was in fact totally disabled.
after receiving demasi initial report,harris wrote to provident requesting that she be evaluated by one of four experts,including one from johns hopkins and one from the mayo clinic,whom she considered t he most prominent names in the literature on latex allergy.provident declined to have harris evaluated by any of these experts.
on october,harris visited johns hopkins on her own initiative and was evaluated by franklin adkinson.the tests performed by adkinson did not support a finding that harris was allergic to latex.adkinson diagnosed harris as having suffered an acute pulmonary insult as a result of the construction at glens falls hospital.adkinson secondary diagnosis was asthma,and his tertiary diagnosis was a possible latex allergy.adkinson advised harris orally at the time of his evaluation that he felt she could return to work and see how she does.adkinson produced a written report of his findings on january,which he sent to harris and slaughter.harris did not inform provident of the results of adkinson evaluation or disclose his report until required to do so by an order of the district court dated december.
on june,harris went to the mayo clinic on her own initiative and was evaluated by loren hunt.hunt found no evidence of latex sensitivity.hunt also reported that harris treadmill testing,echocardiogram,pulmonary artery pressure and other tests were all normal.hunt report stated that harris health appear ed to be quite good,and did not recommend that harris take any medications.hunt advised harris that she could return to work at glens falls hospital after construction there was completed.harris did not inform provident of the results of the mayo clinic evaluation until required to do so by an order of the district court dated december.
harris initiated litigation against provident in the united states district court for the northern district of new york on july,claiming that provident had breached its contract with her by refusing to pay her disability benefits,and that provident had also breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in that contract.provident filed a counterclaim contending that it was entitled to rescission of the insurance contract because harris had failed to inform provident of the results of her testing at johns hopkins and the mayo clinic in a timely manner.harris moved for summary judgment on the breach of contract claim and on provident counterclaim.provident moved for summary judgment on both counts of the complaint and on its counterclaim.
on december and,after the commencement of the instant litigation,harris was evaluated by irwin berlin of trinitas hospital.berlin found no problems in harris function,but concluded that harris had a positive latex nrl challenge.this report was made available to provident during litigation.
in support of its opposition to harris motion for summary judgment,provident submitted an expert report prepared by demasi,which reviewed and summarized the findings of the other doctors who evaluated harris,as well as his own findings demasi concluded that there is no objective medical evidence that harris is disabled by asthma,allergic to latex,or unable to work in a hospital environment.
the district court held that it was irrelevant whether harris suffered from a latex allergy.the district court found that harris had established that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether she was totally disabled from working as an anesthesiologist due to severe asthma,and that harris therefore was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the first count of her complaint.the district court dismissed harris second claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in a footnote,on the grounds that under new york law,such a claim is duplicative of a claim for breach of contract.finally,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of harris on provident counterclaim on the grounds that the information withheld by harris was not material.
this appeal and followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
as the analysis required for summary judgment is a legal one,we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.caldarola calabrese,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.t he issue of material fact required by rule c to be present to entitle a party to proceed to trial is not required to be resolved conclusively in favor of the party asserting its existence rather,all that is required is that sufficient evidence supporting the claimed factual dispute be shown to require a jury or judge to resolve the parties differing versions of the truth at trial.first bank of cities serv,d.in ruling on a motion for summary judgment,the district court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment and must draw all permissible inferences from the submitted affidavits,exhibits,interrogatory answers,and depositions in favor of that party.if,as to the issue on which summary judgment is sought,there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the opposing party,summary judgment is improper.gummo village of depew,cir internal citations omitted.
ii.harris first claim breach of contract 
the primary dispute in this case is whether harris is entitled to payments under the disability insurance policy she had with provident in other words,is harris not able to perform the substantial and material duties of her occupation as an anesthesiologist.as the moving party,harris bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether she is totally disabled under the policy any ambiguity is to be resolved in favor of provident.see carlton mystic,cir.further,not only must there be no genuine issue as to the evidentiary facts,but there must also be no controversy regarding the inferences to be drawn from them.donahue windsor locks bd.of fire comm rs,cir.upon de novo review,we conclude that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether harris is totally disabled,and summary judgment on this claim in her favor should not have been granted.
in support of her motion for summary judgment,harris submitted the opinions of slaughter,her treating allergist,and desmond delgiacco,her treating pulmonologist.each of these doctors stated that it was his opinion that harris was totally disabled due to asthma and unable to work as an anesthesiologist.harris also produced the report of berlin,which concluded that harris was allergic to latex.
in opposition to harris motion,provident produced the medical evaluation of demasi,as well as the reports of the evaluations performed at johns hopkins and the mayo clinic.each of these evaluations found no evidence that harris was allergic to latex,and found harris pulmonary function to be normal.demasi,adkinson and hunt each found that harris could return to work,at least after the construction at glens falls hospital was completed.
this disagreement among the doctors who evaluated harris gives rise to a genuine issue of material fact as to what disability,if any,affects harris,and whether that disability totally disables her from working as an anesthesiologist.the district court erroneously stated that provident relied solely on demasi opinion in opposing summary judgment,and that because demasi made no finding as to whether harris was disabled because of asthma,his opinion did not give rise to a genuine issue of material fact.w here,as here,there are conflicting expert reports presented,courts are wary of granting summary judgment.hudson riverkeeper fund atlantic richfield,d.see also goodrich betkoski,cir denying summary judgment where expert affidavit raised genuine issue of material fact iacobelli constr.county of monroe,cir same in re joint dist.asbestos,cir same jiminez dreis krump,cir same.considering the mayo clinic and johns hopkins reports in conjunction with demasi opinion,as is appropriate,and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of provident as the nonmoving party,we find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of harris on this claim.
the district court focused solely on the issue whether harris suffered from asthma,as opposed to asthma.the original notice of claim filed by harris with provident includes a statement from slaughter which repeatedly refers to harris disability as being related to latex.the form poses the following question what restrictions or limitations,if any,are there on your patient ability to perform the duties of occupation,and why in response,slaughter wrote patient has become hypersensitive to airborne concentrations of latex.the hospitals and medical facilities where she performs her duties are major repositories of latex antigens.the patient develops significant coughing,wheezing and illegible onset march,ceased work on our direction.slaughter did not mention asthma as a reason for harris inability to work in the claim form.thus,when harris applied for benefits,she applied on the grounds that she was allergic to latex and therefore unable to work in the environment of a hospital.provident evaluated harris claim for benefits accordingly.provident expert determined that harris was not allergic to latex,and harris own physician could not state unequivocally that harris was allergic to latex.harris claim was therefore denied.
there is ample evidence in the record to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether harris is severely allergic to latex.there is also sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether harris is totally disabled by asthma.although demasi,johns hopkins and the mayo clinic evaluated harris primarily for latex sensitivity,each also performed testing on harris pulmonary functioning,as asthma is often a symptom of latex sensitivity,and harris had specifically complained of breathing difficulty.each of these evaluations found harris to be in good pulmonary health.demasi and johns hopkins found
