in this erisa case,david cox,appeals the district court judgment on the administrative record approving standard insurance company discontinuation of cox disability benefits.we affirm the district court order.
cox worked as a family practice physician until april,when he suffered a disabling event that he and his physician described as a stroke cox had a history of complex migraine headaches and suffered a migraine on april,that left him hospitalized.cox underwent various neurological scans and tests in the following weeks.his neurologist,voci,evaluated cox on june and noted that the mri scan showed evidence for ischemic change in the brainstem and cerebellum.voci progress notes over the next few years continued to describe cox as suffering from complicated migraine syndrome that resulted in an ischemic brainstem event.voci further described cox as having suffered a stroke related to complicated migraine.
in june,after voci advised cox that he should not return to work,cox began receiving disability benefits from standard pursuant to a group plan through his employer,bon secours.standard initial determination approving cox for disability benefits was based on limited notes provided by cox the disability benefits expired in october,at which point cox began receiving benefits under bon secour disability plan which also was administered by standard,because standard determined that cox met the own occupation definition for disability at standard request,cox also applied and was approved for disability benefits through the social security administration in june.
during this time,cox continued to receive care from voci.voci progress notes indicated that cox suffered from daily headaches,precipitated by stress,weather,and bright lights.in a february letter,voci stated that cox had persistent problems with balance and disequilibrium and that he was at risk for ongoing ischemic injury.in,cox went to the emergency room on several occasions for acute migraine events.each time,he received pain medication and was discharged shortly thereafter.
standard own occupation benefits lasted until october.cox,thereafter,received a letter from standard in january,informing him that he would have to meet the any occupation definition to continue receiving benefits past october.the letter also noted that standard would be reviewing cox claim to determine if he met this definition.as part of this review process,standard obtained additional medical records from cox and had them reviewed by an outside neurologist.
standard outside neurologist,elias dickerman,concluded that cox had a history of migraine headaches with transient neurological symptoms.dickerman also noted that voci,cox treating physician,had interpreted cox mri scans differently than the reviewing radiologist,peter nefcy.he concluded that it would be highly unusual for cox to have suffered a stroke,as voci had diagnosed,given that the radiologist found no abnormalities in cox mri scan.according to dickerman,cox received full neurological examinations during his emergency room visits and none of these exams were consistent with a previous stroke.dickerman then concluded that the restrictions placed on cox were excessive and not supported by the record.
after receiving dickerman analysis,standard sent cox for an independent medical evaluation with robin hanks,a neuropsychologist,on november,and december.in her report,hanks noted that cox complained of problems with balance,weakness,sleep disorder,difficulty focusing,panic attacks,memory difficulties,sensitivity to light,and difficulties,symptoms which generally can be described as cognitive defects.hanks performed fourteen separate tests on cox to assess his complaints.based on the test results,she concluded that cox did not suffer any cognitive decline secondary to a stroke.she also reported that cox memory,attention,and language skills,the cognitive symptoms of which cox complained,were all within normal limits.hanks concluded that there was no reason,from a cognitive standpoint,for cox not to work.
as a final step in its review,standard hired private investigators to survey cox activities over a period in december.the investigators observed cox driving and shoveling snow during a snow storm.the investigators also observed cox shopping at a local mall with florescent cox claimed triggered migraines.
as a result of its review,standard sent cox an letter on march,notifying him that he no longer met the definition of any occupation disability under their plan and that his claim would be closed.the letter detailed cox medical history and reported complaints.it also informed cox of the results of dickerman review of cox record,hanks tests,and the investigator observations.the letter specifically noted that dickerman had concluded that the exams performed on cox during his hospitalizations did not show deficit consistent with a previous stroke or ischemia.it further stated that hanks findings did not show cognitive impairment secondary to a stroke in.
in september,cox requested an administrative review of standard decision.as part of the request,cox sent additional medical records and documentation to standard.standard sent these materials to a second neurologist,lawrence zivin,for review.zivin noted that the small amount of possible ischemic changes on the mri scans could not be interpreted as necessarily resulting from cox migraines or from a stroke,and he concluded that nothing in the medical records suggested that cox could not perform his occupation as a family practice physician.in addition to zivin review,standard also performed further investigation into cox activities.this investigation showed that cox spoke at numerous medical conferences and worked as a consultant during his period of alleged disability.
on june,standard sent cox another letter informing him that it would uphold its decision to discontinue his benefits.though the letter acknowledged that a cerebral angiogram showed occlusion of the left vertebral artery blood clotting in the artery and that mris showed small amounts of mildly abnormal signal intensity in the brain potentially stemming from early ischemic changes,the letter went on to explain that zivin had reviewed cox record and concluded that cox did not have any significant underlying anatomical vascular abnormality and that the small amount of possible ischemic change could not necessarily be interpreted as being related to the migraines.in short,standard determined that cox medical records as a whole did not provide sufficient evidence of neurological,physical or cognitive impairments to sustain a finding that cox could not perform the material duties of his own occupation.the letter further suggested that mri scans indicated that cox had never actually suffered a stroke.
on august,cox filed suit in the eastern district of michigan seeking a determination that he was entitled to restoration of his benefits.the district court granted judgment on the administrative record in favor of standard in a ruling from the bench cox timely appealed.
we review an erisa plan administrator denial of benefits de novo,unless the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits.gismondi united techs,cir citing firestone tire rubber bruch,d.when the plan gives the administrator discretionary authority,we apply the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard of review.id.under this deferential standard,when it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation,based on the evidence for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.hosp.of cleveland emerson,cir quoting davis kentucky finance.retirement plan,cir.deferential review is tempered,however,when an important conflict of interest consideration requires that benefits decisions be closely scrutinized.when the same entity determines eligibility for benefits and also pays those benefits out of its own pocket,an inherent conflict of interest arises.in close cases,courts must consider that conflict as one factor among several in determining whether the plan administrator abused its discretion in denying benefits.metro.life ins.glenn,d de lisle sun life assur.of,cir.here,cox concedes that standard plan contains language sufficient to grant discretion to standard.further,standard both grants eligibility for benefits and pays benefits.therefore,we review this case under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,while bearing in mind that a conflict of interest exists.
post hoc justification for termination and review of the record 
cox and standard present inconsistent facts regarding the following whether standard decision to discontinue disability benefits was based on a finding that cox did not have a stroke,whether the no stroke justification was advanced post hoc whether the record indicates that voci was the only physician who diagnosed cox as suffering from a stroke and whether standard incorrectly characterized cox disability as being a cognitive deficit when it discontinued his benefits.
cox claims that standard did not use the no stroke justification to terminate his benefits until it reached the district court.he claims that,by advancing this new post hoc justification for denying his claim,standard violated erisa requirement that a benefits administrator give specific reasons for its decision and provide a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review.however,cox claim that standard has changed the justification for its decision is simply not supported by the record.
both letters sent to cox informing him of the termination notified cox that the decision was based,in part,on standard belief that cox did not have a stroke.in its march,letter to cox,the first letter terminating his benefit,standard informed cox that the independent medical evaluation showed no significant cognitive impairment secondary to stroke in.the letter also stated that standard medical consultant had determined that cox never had a focal neurological deficit consistent with a previous area of stroke or ischemia.in its june,letter to cox attorney informing cox of the results of its administrative review,standard justified its decision in part because no interpreting radiologists indicated any major abnormality and that the small amount of possible ischemic changes could not necessarily be interpreted as being connected to cox migraines.the letter also stated that standard consulting neurologist believed that cox mri scans,taken after his april hospitalization,were not consistent with what would be expected of a patient who had an actual stroke of the brainstem.the letter further stated that cox neurological exams,performed in when cox sought treatment at the emergency room,were inconsistent with residual impairment from a previous area of stroke or ischemia.standard continued to advance the same justifications at the district court level.in its motion for judgment on the administrative record,standard noted that its neurology experts opined that cox did not have a stroke on april,or at any time thereafter.thus,cox is incorrect in claiming that standard has changed its justification for terminating his benefits.
cox references these letters in his reply brief but characterizes standard justifications as irrelevant snippet s.cox is apparently arguing that,because standard letters do not contain the exact phrase never had a stroke and contained multiple reasons for the termination,its justification was later changed.this argument is not supported by case law.
we have previously held that the insurer did not comply with erisa full and fair review requirement because one letter justified termination on the grounds that the materials requested by the insurer have not been received but another letter justified termination on the grounds that the claimant was not disabled.wenner sun life assur.of canada,cir.standard interchanging of stroke and ischemia is not analogous to the situation in wenner.in wenner,we held that the insurer did not comply with erisa full and fair review requirement because the insurer termination letters specified two completely unrelated reasons for terminating benefits.id.in the present case,however,although the insurer uses the terms stroke and ischemia interchangeably in its termination letters,ischemia describes a type of stroke therefore,the words stroke and ischemia are interrelated.further,cox own treating physician uses the terms stroke and ischemia interchangeably.the record contains seventeen progress notes from voci,ranging in date from june to february,in which only two use the word stroke to describe cox condition.the remainder use descriptive terms such as ischemia,infarction,or vascular event.cox can hardly claim that he did not receive a full and fair review due to standard interchanging the terms stroke and ischemia when his treating physician does the same 
the parties also disagree as to whether cox has been diagnosed as suffering from a stroke by another physician aside from voci.cox claims that voci diagnosis is supported by a radiologist report from his angiogram performed in may,a claim,which if true,might buoy cox argument in this case.cox claims that the report statement that t he left vertebral artery is not shown is equivalent to voci diagnosis that cox left vertebral artery was occluded and that both statements are code for had a stroke.cox quotes the record without giving any specific citation as to where this report can be found.leaving that aside,his lawyer attempts to clarify this argument by educating the court on the technicalities of an angiogram.cox that one physician assessment of an artery as not shown is the same as another assessment that the artery is occluded and that both mean stroke is not supported by anything aside from his attorney bald assertion.aside from voci progress notes and cox self reports,the record does not reflect that another physician independently confirmed that cox suffered a stroke.the only other physician noting an ischemic infarction of the brainstem was initial physician at standard to approve cox claim.however,this determination was made with limited notes to review and,according to standard,fancher accepted voci determination that cox had suffered an ischemic infarction at face value.both of standard consultants who reviewed the full medical records stated that they did not believe that cox scans were consistent with those of a patient who had suffered a stroke.at best,it would be speculative for us to adopt cox logic as evidence that another physician supports voci diagnosis.
the third area of disagreement is over standard justification of lack of cognitive deficit for terminating the benefits.cox claims that this reason ignores the true nature of his disability claim,which he states is premised on the risk of suffering another potentially deadly stroke.cox is correct in stating that his disability claim was based,in part,on voci opinion that he was at risk of another stroke.however,he is incorrect in arguing that standard fabricated the claim of lack of cognitive deficit.in a february letter to standard,cox himself claims that he was disabled because his migraine episodes caused slurred speech,disorientation,muscle weakness,and memory loss.further,voci wrote a letter in july to standard claiming that cox suffered memory loss,coordination problems,and residual deficits from this initial ischemic event.voci progress notes,submitted by cox to support his disability claim,also indicated that cox had difficulties.these are claims of present cognitive deficits,not of fear of future problems.as part of its review,standard had hanks perform an independent medical examination.hanks ultimately concluded that cox did not suffer cognitive deficit,but this conclusion was premised on fourteen tests specifically addressing cox memory,speech,ability,motor function,and energy.thus,cox is incorrect in arguing that standard justification is premised on something other than his stated reasons for being disabled.
yet,even though cox misstates the record,it does not automatically follow that we should uphold standard decision.we should still review standard decision to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious,bearing in mind that standard both grants and pays benefits.gismondi,at.
