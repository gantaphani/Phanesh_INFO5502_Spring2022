applying this standard of review here,tilbury complaint alleges the following 
tilbury entered into an insurance contract for workers compensation insurance with state fund on april.
in september,tilbury was working on the expansion of california dairies facilities in turlock,california.tilbury worked as a subcontractor for golden state steel company,which in turn was a subcontractor to the general contractor on the project,harris company.
most of tilbury work took place in the creamery silo.harris employees ordered tilbury employees not to use tilbury ladders in the silo.in fact,a harris employee installed its own portable metal extension ladder in the silo to provide access to the catwalk inside the silo.the harris employee,however,failed to properly secure that ladder.
on september,gary alfrey,one of tilbury employees,was working in the silo.a harris employee directed alfrey to climb to the catwalk and erect a safety line.alfrey used harris ladder to ascend to the catwalk when the ladder slipped out from under him and he fell feet to the ground.alfrey suffered severe injuries to his right leg and foot.his foot will never completely heal.
the california department of industrial relations,division of occupational safety and health issued a citation to tilbury for violating worker safety rules regarding unsecured ladders.subsequently,that citation was deleted by the department for lack of evidence.
alfrey sued harris for his injuries.during that litigation,the harris employee who placed the ladder and failed to secure it testified in his deposition that the ladder was not in place prior to the accident nor did he enter the silo in the days immediately prior to the accident.at trial,the employee recanted this testimony and claimed that he had lied during his deposition to avoid being blamed for the accident.
state fund paid out workers compensation benefits to alfrey in the amount of and estimated his compensable future losses would amount to.state fund has subrogation rights under the law and its policy is to recover these sums from third parties who caused the accident.state fund investigated whether to pursue subrogation and ultimately decided to pursue a subrogation claim against harris.
ten days prior to the scheduled trial date,state fund sold its subrogation rights to harris for.tilbury alleges that state fund relied on three documents in its decision to settle the action a notice from the division of occupational safety and health that it decided not to cite harris a citation against tilbury for violation of the regulation requiring ladders to be safely secured the primary charge in this citation had been deleted nine months prior and a mediation brief submitted by harris attorneys to the superior court.tilbury alleged that state fund failed to take any steps to determine that the occupational safety and health appeals board had deleted the determination in the citation issued against tilbury.before settling its subrogation claim with harris,state fund did not speak with any employees of tilbury,including alfrey,tilbury general manager,or any employees on the job site the day of the accident.further,state fund did not obtain any of the documents filed by alfrey attorneys in the action.state fund did not inform tilbury of its decision to sell the lien to harris until days later.
at trial,harris settled alfrey legal claims against it for million.to date,state fund has paid and held in reserve at least on behalf of alfrey and received only as an offset of that amount.
tilbury workers compensation premiums are affected by its experience modification rating.tilbury alleges as a result of state fund conduct of failing to investigate and obtain a fair settlement from harris,tilbury experience modification factor has increased.in turn,its workers compensation insurance premiums have increased in the amount of for the year april,through april,and will increase in an unknown amount in the following year.other employers will also suffer an increase in premium periods as well.the increase in tilbury workers compensation premiums has also forced tilbury to raise its bidding rates and caused it to lose business opportunities and profits.
tilbury alleges that state fund has sought to obtain a credit against its obligations to pay alfrey benefits based on the million settlement.the net effect of this application will be to reduce state fund expenses,but will provide tilbury with no relief from its increased premiums.in that application for credit,state fund has taken the position that there was no finding that tilbury had any fault in the accident.
tilbury further alleges that state fund failed to provide it with documentation of its subrogation handling for three months after tilbury request.state fund further refused to discuss altering any of tilbury premiums.
based on these allegations,tilbury sued state fund for breach of the insurance contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violation of business and professions code section,interference with prospective economic advantage,and unjust enrichment.in short,tilbury claims state fund failed to properly investigate its subrogation claim and based on its failure to investigate,settled the claim for an unreasonably low amount.
state fund filed a demurrer to the complaint.the trial court sustained that demurrer without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of state fund.tilbury appeals.
discussion 
itilbury has not alleged an actionable breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
tilbury argues the trial court erred in dismissing its cause of action for tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.tilbury contends this tort is available to prevent the insurer from taking unreasonable actions that will increase future premiums.while this rule holds true in some circumstances,it does not apply here.
every contract imposes on each party an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.citation.simply stated,the burden imposed is that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.citations.or,to put it another way,the implied covenant imposes upon each party the obligation to do everything that the contract presupposes they will do to accomplish its purpose.citations.a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing involves something beyond breach of the contractual duty itself,and it has been held that b ad faith implies unfair dealing rather than mistaken judgment citation.citation.citation.for example,in the context of the insurance contract,it has been held that the insurer responsibility to act fairly and in good faith with respect to the handling of the insured claim is not the requirement mandated by the terms of the policy defend,settle,or pay.it is the obligation under which the insurer must act fairly and in good faith in discharging its contractual responsibilities.citation.citation.chateau chamberay homeowners associated internat.ins.th,d.
insurance contracts are unique in nature and purpose.citation.an insured does not enter an insurance contract seeking profit,but instead seeks security and peace of mind through protection against calamity.citation.the peace of mind comes from the assurance that the insured will receive prompt payment of money in times of need.citation.because peace of mind and security are the principal benefits for the insured,the courts have imposed special obligations,consonant with these special purposes,seeking to encourage insurers promptly to process and pay claims.thus,an insurer must investigate claims thoroughly citation it may not deny coverage based on either unduly restrictive policy interpretations citation or standards known to be improper citation it may not unreasonably delay in processing or paying claims citation.love fire ins.exchange d.these special duties,at least to the extent breaches thereof give rise to tort liability,find no counterpart in the obligations owed by parties to ordinary commercial contracts.the rationale for the difference in obligations is apparent.if an insurer were free of such special duties and could deny or delay payment of clearly owed debts with impunity,the insured would be deprived of the precise benefit the contract was designed to secure,peace of mind and would suffer the precise harm,lack of funds in times of crisis the contract was designed to prevent.citation.to avoid or discourage conduct which would thus frustrate realization of the contract principal benefit,peace of mind,special and heightened implied duties of good faith are imposed on insurers and made enforceable in tort.while these special duties are akin to,and often resemble,duties which are also owed by fiduciaries,the duties arise because of the unique nature of the insurance contract,not because an insurer is a fiduciary.ibid.
in love,the insureds sought to estop the insurance company from asserting the statute of limitations because the insurance company had an obligation to disclose that an excluded loss was a covered loss under certain circumstances.love fire ins.exchange,supra,d at.the insureds claimed this duty arose out of the fact that the insurance company owed the insureds a fiduciary duty to disclose this legal argument that would provide them with coverage.ibid.in rejecting this argument,the love court noted,because of the special relationship inherent in the unique nature of an insurance contract,the insurer obligations attendant to its duty of good faith are heightened.such obligations have been characterized as akin to responsibilities.citation.because of this unique special relationship,a breach of the obligation of good faith may give rise to tort rather than mere contractual remedies.citation.id.at.the court continued,however,the california supreme court has never squarely held that an insurer is a true fiduciary to its insured.ibid.the court pointed out that u nique obligations are imposed upon true fiduciaries which are not found in the insurance relationship.for example,a true fiduciary must first consider and always act in the best interests of its trust and not allow to overpower its duty to act in the trust best interests.citation.an insurer,however,may give its own interests consideration equal to that it gives the interests of its insured citation it is not required to disregard the interests of its shareholders and other policyholders when evaluating claims citation and it is not required to pay noncovered claims,even though payment would be in the best interests of its insured citation.id.at.in discussing the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the love court held,there are at least two separate requirements to establish breach of the implied covenant benefits due under the policy must have been withheld and the reason for withholding benefits must have been unreasonable or without proper cause.id.at.
state fund relies on new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d.there,the court was called upon to decide whether an employer who has assigned its subrogation rights to its workers compensation insurance carrier has a cause of action against the carrier for negligence or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when the carrier does not actively pursue those subrogation rights.id.at,d.the court concluded the insured employer had no cause of action.ibid.in new plumbing,the employer alleged that its workers compensation carrier failed to properly investigate or pursue its subrogation rights and as a result the employer lost the opportunity to have its experience modification reduced and receive a refund of premiums for several years.id.at,d.the court first examined the insured employer causes of action for negligence and the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at,d.in that examination,the court concluded that the insurance carrier had no duty to diligently pursue its subrogation rights.ibid.the court explained that under the workers compensation statutes,an insurance carrier has three statutory options to assert its right to subrogation.ibid.first,it can file suit against the third party in its own name.second,it may intervene in an action filed by the employee against the third party.third,the insurer can take no action,but instead claim a lien against any judgment recovered by the employee,subd.b.the new plumbing court concluded that requiring the carrier to chose the method that was most favorable to its insured would vitiate the choices presented by the statutory scheme because the carrier would always have to file an action on its own behalf.new plumbing contractors,at,d.the court stated,rather than impose a duty on the carrier to proceed in a specific manner,the statutory scheme gives the carrier its choice of proceeding in any manner.furthermore,because subrogation is a right,not an obligation,the insurer presumably has the option of not pursuing subrogation recovery at all.likely,this is often the case when the amount of benefits are relatively small and it would be economically unreasonable to pursue subrogation.id.at,d.
the new plumbing court also separately examined the insured employer cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the court stated,neither the duty nor the covenant of good faith and fair dealing extends beyond the terms of the insurance contract in force between the parties.new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins,supra,th at,d.the insurance contract between nationwide and new plumbing provided that we nationwide have your rights,and the rights of persons entitled to the benefits of this insurance to recover our payments from anyone liable for the injury.you new plumbing will do everything necessary to protect those rights for us and to help us enforce them.id.at,d.thus,the carrier decision regarding pursuing its subrogation rights after it has properly paid claims under the insurance policy does not affect the insured receiving the benefits of the insurance agreement.id.at,d.the court concluded that because t
