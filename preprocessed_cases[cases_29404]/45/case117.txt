class actions,by their very nature,can alter the usual dynamics of litigation and bring to bear on defendants and insurers alike intense pressure to settle.see,waste mgmt.holdings,mowbray,cir discussing situations in which the grant of class status raises the stakes of the litigation so substantially that the defendant likely will feel irresistible pressure to settle.faced with such a situation,american national fire insurance company anfic attempted to have its cake and eat it too it joined in an advantageous settlement of a potentially costly class action and then attempted to recoup from its own insured york county,maine the lion share of the payment that it had made.
the district court ruled that anfic was not entitled to reimbursement.see am.fire ins.york county,d.discerning no error,we affirm.
background 
we assume the reader familiarity with the district court exegetic account of the underlying facts,see id.at.thus,we rehearse here only those particulars that are helpful to place the appeal itself into a workable perspective.because the appealed decision follows a bench trial and there is no clear error in the district court factfinding,we state the facts as found and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the judgment.
we bifurcate our survey,first discussing the class action and then moving to the instant case.
a.the class action.
in october of,three persons who had been at the york county jail following misdemeanor arrests filed suit against the county.the suit was filed as a putative class action on behalf of the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated.see nilsen york county.it sought damages on account of an alleged pattern and practice of illegally arrestees.
during what would become the class,through april,county had in force a series of law enforcement liability lel insurance policies underwritten by twin cities insurers company,anfic,and maine county commissioners association risk pool,respectively.
each insurer had covered york county for a portion of the class period twin cities covered the county for a span that included the first sixteen days anfic coverage ran from november,through january,and the risk pool afforded coverage from the expiration of anfic policy to a date past the end of the class period.
when the putative class action was filed,the risk pool was the insurer of record.consequently,it assumed the defense on york county behalf and retained peter marchesi as defense counsel for the county.it also retained jim poliquin as separate counsel to represent its own interests.york county retained gene libby to represent its uninsured interests.
the district court certified the class in.on an interlocutory appeal,we upheld the certification.tardiff knox county,cir.while that appeal was pending,the county notified its other insurers,each of which ultimately agreed to participate in a coordinated defense of the class action.
as noted above,anfic lel coverage was in effect for a interval all of which fell within the class period.as a member of the coordinated defense group,anfic agreed to pay percent of the collaborative defense costs.
the declarations page of anfic policy made its coverage subject to both a per claim deductible and an aggregate limit of.defense costs under the policy were supplementary they were,therefore,neither set off against liability limits nor capped in any amount.
anfic commenced its participation in the joint defense after issuing a letter on january.in that letter,a company hierarch,william curtin,unilaterally declared that the deductible will apply to each claim brought for illegal strip search within the coverage period.anfic never explicitly withdrew this reservation of rights.
as a prelude to a planned mediation of the class action,members of the defense group including representatives from york county,twin cities,anfic,and the risk pool held a private meeting.at this session,marchesi stated the obvious a settlement was desirable from everyone point of view because the defense was faced with a sizable class,liability was a,and total damages would likely be.marchesi predicted that the award would far exceed the face value of all available insurance and that,in the bargain,there would be very significant litigation costs libby explained that,aside from available insurance,york county had less than to contribute to any settlement fund.
the first mediation session took place on september.at that session,marchesi acted as the principal negotiator for the defense group,but all members of the group were individually represented.curtin restated anfic position that its coverage was subject to a per claim deductible.he also maintained that anfic contribution to any settlement should be limited to no more than fifteen percent of the total fund.the parties did not reach a settlement,but the defense group achieved a consensus favoring settlement within the existing insurance and risk pool coverage.
following this mediation session,libby wrote to curtin,acknowledging anfic position the policy deductible but explaining that york county viewed the deductible as applying to the entire class and not to individual class members.regardless of how the deductible operated,libby warned,it was likely that a verdict would exhaust the entire in coverage afforded by the anfic policy.on that basis,libby asked that the entire be made available to conclude negotiations with plaintiffs.
anfic,through dowd,respectfully but unequivocally rejected york county interpretation of how the deductible operated.it did not comment as to libby prediction about what would happen if the case went to trial.
on september,the parties attended a second mediation session.by the end of the session,each member of the defense group had agreed to up the ante.specifically,the risk pool had authorized toward a global settlement twin cities had authorized york county had authorized in county funds and anfic had authorized when agreeing to contribute toward settlement,curtin did not communicate any restrictions on the contribution,nor did he mention that anfic intended to seek recoupment based on the policy deductible provision.
in late october,dowd sent another letter to libby admonishing that anfic would be liable only for loss in excess of on each claim.in reply,libby reiterated that anfic potential exposure exceeded regardless of which interpretation of the deductible provision prevailed.in a separate letter,marchesi made a similar observation and exhorted anfic to loosen the purse strings and increase its proposed contribution to the global settlement.
following this exchange of correspondence,libby scheduled a conference call with dowd and marchesi.this call lasted for almost an hour.the protagonists discussed at length anfic appropriate share of a global settlement.the policy deductible was not mentioned.
shortly thereafter,curtin received approval from anfic claims committee to make a contribution.the claims committee neither imposed any conditions on that authority nor stipulated that such an offer could be extended only if payment was made subject to the policy deductible.dowd then called marchesi and hiked anfic proposed contribution to,provided that all other members of the defense group contributed the amounts previously authorized.
with anfic contribution in hand,marchesi was able to settle the class action by agreeing to establish a settlement fund.the defense group funded the settlement as follows the risk pool contributed,twin cities contributed,york county contributed,and anfic contributed.the settlement extinguished all claims whether or not previously asserted by arrestees who were unlawfully at the york county jail during the class period.an express condition of the settlement was that counsel for york county provide an affidavit testimony regarding the relative lack of assets available to fund a settlement that exceeded.the parties secured court approval for the settlement,releases were expected,a judgment was entered,and the matter appeared to have been concluded.
ultimately,the district court designated claimants to receive payments from the settlement fund.each approved claimant
