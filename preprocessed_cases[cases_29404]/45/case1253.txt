in this insurance dispute,the plaintiff,lawrence levy,and the defendant,minnesota life insurance company mli,agree that levy suffers from osteoarthritis in his right knee,which prevents him from performing his occupational duties and qualifies him for disability coverage under two policies issued by mli.the parties disagree,however,on which provision of the policies applies,which,in turn,affects the duration of coverage.levy claims that he qualifies for coverage under the injury provision,which entitles him to lifetime disability benefits.mli,on the other hand,claims that levy qualifies for coverage under the sickness provision,which only entitles him to benefits he has received for the period that ended after he turned years old in.
the district court magistrate judge sidney schenkier,sitting with the parties consent,c resolved the parties for summary judgment in favor of mli.the case is now before us on levy appeal.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo.tanner jupiter realty,cir.summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the facts are without genuine dispute.in the early,mli issued two disability insurance policies to levy.the policies define disability and disabled to mean that due to sickness or injury you are unable to perform the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation.the policies define injury as a n accidental bodily injury you sustained while this policy is in force and sickness as a disease or illness which is diagnosed or treated while this policy is in force.the policies provide a maximum benefit period to age if the insured is disabled due to a sickness but lifetime benefits if the disability is due to an injury.
in,levy claims to have injured his right knee while playing basketball at a picnic.he experienced pain for or weeks,which he with.levy did not seek medical treatment for his knee until,at which point he was examined by bruce hallmann,an orthopedic surgeon.
in february,hallmann performed arthroscopic surgery on levy right knee on an outpatient basis.his preoperative diagnosis was i nternal knee.his diagnosis was c omplex degenerative tear of posterior horn of medial meniscus,and advanced chrondromalacia.hallmann noted that levy had a long history of problems with his right knee,and has had progressive difficulties with pain and clicking at the right knee.hallmann also wrote that levy had apparently injured the right knee many years ago,but underwent no specific therapeutic intervention.hallmann notes do not mention the basketball incident.
in his deposition,hallmann explained that the reference in his report to a long history of right knee problems did not mean a problem two years before the surgery because he would have probably indicated that in his notes.rather,he stated that w hen i say a long history of many years,i do usually mean just a year or two.it usually longer than that.hallmann also testified that i ndividuals can develop degenerative meniscal cartilage tears in association with osteoarthritis.he described levy degenerative tear at the time of the surgery as follows 
this was not a fresh meniscal cartilage tear.it was a matter that the cartilage had a very clear and was not a clean or clear cartilage tear.the cleavage planes were not well defined.they had already become degenerated.they had become frayed,fibrillated,of irregular character and contour.so this was not a recent tear of the medial meniscus.a nd,in fact,degenerative changes had already taken place at the tear site.
hallmann further stated that he was unable to determine,based on his medical records,whether the degenerative meniscal tear noted in his report was the result of a specific trauma or a degenerative process such as osteoarthritis.
about weeks after the arthroscopic surgery,levy returned to work and resumed his normal duties as a physician.levy continued to work for the next years,during which time he did not seek medical diagnosis or treatment for his knee.
during the early,levy coverage under mli policies lapsed due to nonpayment of premiums.to obtain reinstatement of coverage,levy made several certifications regarding his medical condition.on four occasions during to,levy certified that he ha d not suffered a disability,been injured or sick since the end of the policies premium payment grace periods.in a application for life insurance coverage with mli,levy also certified that he had made a full recovery from his arthroscopic surgery and had experienced no problems since.
in,a little over a year before the policies here were issued,levy worked at the flashner medical group,which he described as an urgent and immediate care facility with offices in mount prospect and arlington heights,illinois.levy stopped working for the flashner group on june,when it was sold to the new york life insurance company.levy did not practice for a year after the buyout because,apparently,he received,as part of the flashner buyout,a year salary from new york life.when the year ran out,levy took a position as an independent contractor with a group,wexford health services providing medical services for the illinois department of corrections at its dwight correctional center,a maximum security prison in dwight,illinois,some miles south of downtown chicago.he held that spot for months,until february,when a new contractor took over his duties at dwight.on that day,levy was years old.he has not worked since that day.
two months after leaving dwight,levy submitted a disability claim to mli in which he claimed to be disabled due to right knee pain.when mli requested documentation in support of his claim,levy sought medical attention from chadwick prodromos,an orthopedic surgeon.
after examining levy,prodromos diagnosed him with right knee djd versus medial meniscal injury.prodromos also obtained an mri on levy right knee from a radiologist,paul backas.backas reported that the mri showed t hinning,altered signal intensity and medial subluxation of body medial meniscus consistent with degenerative change with no macromeniscal tear identified.prodromos notes state that the mri would appear to be consistent with djd and not internal derangement.in the same note,prodromos stated that,based on his review of hallmann report,b oth the diagnosis and the procedure at that time certainly were consistent with levy current advanced degenerative joint disease.
in may,prodromos signed an attending physician statement aps,diagnosing levy with right knee osteoarthritis and limiting him to sedentary work.the aps was used as the proof of loss that levy submitted to mli regarding his disability.prodromos examined levy on four additional occasions during through.he completed six supplemental aps forms,each repeating his diagnosis of osteoarthritis degenerative joint disease.
in his deposition,prodromos testified regarding the origin or cause of levy osteoarthritis.he first opined that levy basketball injury caused the meniscal tear on which hallmann operated and that his knee arthritis was caused by the meniscal tear.prodromos gave a more comprehensive explanation shortly thereafter 
it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of orthopaedic surgical certainty that his severe right knee pain directly attributable to the meniscal tear,indirectly.when i saw him he was hurting because of a meniscal tear.it was occurring because the meniscal tear had caused the sequence of events of articular cartilage damage and arthrosis and pain in his knee.
prodromos also stated that a ll meniscal tears are caused by trauma,even degenerative tears.
in,david waldram,an orthopedic surgeon consulted by mli,concurred with the diagnosis of joint disease based on his review of levy medical records and the testimony of hallmann and prodromos.waldram further opined that levy osteoarthritis is not in all medical probability related to the injury of.according to waldram,the operation report contains findings consistent with degenerative arthritis and a degenerative meniscal tear,and these degenerative changes predated the basketball injury.
waldram also pointed to other medical e
