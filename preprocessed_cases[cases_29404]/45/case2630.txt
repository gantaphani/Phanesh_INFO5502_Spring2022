tawndra williams filed a class action against defendant interinsurance exchange of the automobile club exchange for breach of contract and other causes of action.she alleged exchange,in violation of insurance code section,subdivision f did not state in the automobile policy issued to her the fee it charges insureds for paying the policy annual premium in installments.
exchange filed a petition for a peremptory writ of mandate challenging the trial court orders granting williams motion for summary judgment and denying exchange motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.exchange contends the trial court erred by interpreting the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,to include fees imposed for installment payments of the annual premium williams agreed to pay the fees disclosed by exchange on her billing statement it substantially complied with section,subdivision f and even if it violated section,subdivision f,there are triable issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment for williams.because we conclude the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,does not include charges imposed for making payments of the annual premium in installments,exchange did not violate that statute and therefore williams is not entitled to summary judgment in her class action against exchange and exchange is entitled to summary judgment against williams.
factual and procedural background 
in january,williams obtained an automobile insurance policy policy from exchange.she paid the policy annual premium in one lump sum.in january,on renewal of the policy she again paid the policy annual premium in one lump sum.
in december,exchange mailed to williams a renewal declarations page for the policy and an accompanying billing statement for the annual renewal period beginning in january.the declarations page set forth the grand total premium due of and,after deduction of a policyholder dividend of,required williams to pay a net total premium of to renew her policy for another year the accompanying billing statement gave williams the option of paying the annual net premium in either one lump sum or nine monthly installments,subject to additional charges for interest at a rate of percent per year and requiring payment of only the first installment of.williams read the billing statement,understood an election to pay the annual premium in installments would subject her to interest charges,and elected to pay the annual premium in installments rather than in one lump sum.

on october,williams,on behalf of herself,others similarly situated,and the general public,filed the instant complaint against exchange alleging causes of action for breach of contract committing an unlawful business act or practice in violation of business and professions code section et violating the consumers legal remedies act,et unjust enrichment and money had and received.the premise for each cause of action was exchange alleged wrongful charging and receipt of a fee for payment of annual premiums in installments,a premium not stated in its policies in violation of section,subdivision f.
on march,the trial court overruled exchange demurrer to the complaint.the trial court subsequently granted williams motion to represent the class of all exchange automobile insurance policyholders who paid installment charges after october.
on or about august,williams filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.on august,exchange filed its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.on october,pursuant to exchange request,the trial court stayed the proceedings and referred to the california department of insurance doi the question of w hether installment fees constitute a premium as that term is used in section,subdivision f.
on april,the doi issued an opinion finding the term premium has several different and sometimes conflicting meanings depending upon the context in which it is used.it discussed the various meanings of the term premium in actuarial,accounting,industry practice,taxation,doi rate approval,and other statutory contexts.apparently finding those other meanings unhelpful in determining the meaning of the term premium for section,subdivision f purposes,the doi reasoned 
t he primary purpose of as specifically stated for the automobile line of insurance in is to prevent fraud and mistake by requiring insurers to list the basic terms of the contract.accordingly,it is the commissioner view that policyholders would be less likely to be defrauded or mistaken about the amount of premium if that term is defined in the broadest sense,in the typical way policyholders view their installment payments,the total price of obtaining coverage,including the installment fee.if that overall price varies depending on the existence of an installment fee,a policyholder will be less likely to be mistaken about the cost of insurance if the policy discloses the nature and amount of that variation.
this interpretation is consistent with ccr,which was promulgated to make certain that insurance companies charge policyholders the lowest available price for insurance coverage.for such a figure to be meaningful,the regulation uses a liberal definition that includes all other items which change the amount the insurer charges to the insured,which presumably would include installment fees.the same reasoning applies here.
accordingly,the doi concluded t he purpose of was not to calculate rates,determine tax liability,or assess the financial solvency of insurers,but to mandate the disclosure of material insurance contract terms,including the price.for the above reasons,the commissioner concludes that installment fees are a premium under,in the private passenger automobile context.the doi then noted the commissioner is giving consideration to promulgating regulations proposing legislation to clarify what charges must be disclosed under premium and to address other issues raised by this referral.
on august,the trial court granted williams motion for summary judgment and denied exchange motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.the court stated 
in reaching this ruling,the court has given the department of insurance doi opinion some deference.in yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,where,in addressing the issue of relying on an administrative agency interpretation of a statute,the court said,because an interpretation is an agency legal opinion,however expert,rather than the exercise of a delegated legislative power to make law,it commands a commensurably lesser degree of judicial deference.thus,this court is not precluded from giving some degree of deference to the doi decision in this matter.
the decided law supports the conclusion that defendant should have included the installment fees in the premium.in allstate ins.state board of equalization d,the court stated,premium in the law of insurance means the amount paid to the company for insurance.citation.the allstate court held that,the installment payment fee was actually given by the insured for his insurance.citation.id.at.
the reasoning of the allstate case applies here.defendant requires payment of the installment fee as a condition of receiving insurance.thus,the installment fees are part of the amount paid to the company for insurance.allstate,supra,d at.failure to specify those fees in the policy is a violation of insurance code section,subdivision f.this violation forms the basis for each of plaintiffs causes of action.
the court then addressed each of williams five causes of action,concluding she proved her entitlement to relief under each one.
on august,exchange filed the instant petition petition,requesting we issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the trial court to vacate its order granting williams motion for summary judgment and denying exchange motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication and to issue a new order denying williams motion for summary judgment and granting exchange motion for summary judgment.on november,we issued an order to the trial court to show cause why the relief requested by the petition should not be granted.we subsequently issued an order allowing williams to file a return to the petition and exchange to file a reply.we have received and considered those documents,together with the petition and its accompanying exhibits.
discussion 
igrounds for writ review 
exchange contends we should consider the petition merits even though a final judgment has not yet been entered because if it waited to challenge that judgment on appeal,it would be required to post an appellate bond costing millions of dollars,which could not be recovered from williams were its appeal successful 
code of civil procedure section provides the writ of mandate must be issued in all cases where there is not a plain,speedy,and adequate remedy,in the ordinary course of law to obtain writ review,a petitioner generally must show his or her remedy in the ordinary course of law is inadequate or that petitioner would suffer irreparable injury were the writ not granted.powers city of richmond cal th,d,city of half moon bay superior court th,d.however,discretionary writ review may nevertheless be appropriate where it is necessary to resolve an issue of first impression promptly and to set guidelines for bench and bar.citations.rodrigues superior court th,d see also elden superior court th,d w rit review is permissible here since the petition raises a novel issue of law.furthermore,writ review may be appropriate to prevent a needless and expensive trial and reversal citation.coulter superior court cal d,superseded by statute on another ground as noted in sakiyama amf bowling centers,th,fn,d.it may also be appropriate if the issues involved are of widespread interest brandt superior court cal d,or if resolution of the issue would result in a final disposition as to the petitioner.casterson superior court th,d.
based on exchange representation regarding the substantial cost of an appeal bond were williams to obtain a judgment awarding her represented class the amount she apparently seeks,it would seem improbable exchange could recover that cost after a successful appeal of the judgment and therefore its remedy in the ordinary course of law may be inadequate.in any event,assuming arguendo exchange has not shown its remedy on appeal would be inadequate,we nevertheless conclude one or more of the exceptional circumstances discussed above apply and warrant discretionary writ review in this case.both parties agree the question of the meaning of the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,is one of first impression.because section presumably is a consumer protection statute affecting all californians who obtain automobile insurance,that issue also is one of widespread interest.therefore,we exercise our discretion to reach the merits in this case.
summary judgment standard of review 
a fter a motion for summary judgment has been granted by a trial court,an appellate court review s the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.guz bechtel national,cal th,d,saelzler advanced group cal th,d.the purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
aguilar clarified the standards that apply to summary judgment motions under code of civil procedure section.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.generally,if all the papers submitted by the parties show there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law code civ,subd.c,the court must grant the motion for summary judgment.aguilar,supra,at,d.code of civil procedure section,subdivision o provides that a cause of action has no merit if one or more elements of that cause of action can not separately be established or a defendant establishes an affirmative defense to that cause of action.code of civil procedure section,subdivision p states 
a defendant or has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant or has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff or may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
aguilar made the following observations 
first,and generally,from commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof 
second,and generally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question 
third,and generally,how the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial i f a defendant moves for summary judgment against a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at trial,the defendant must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.
summary judgment law in california no longer requires a defendant to conclusively negate an element of a cause of action.id.at,d.it is sufficient for a defendant to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of action,which the defendant can do by showing that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at,d.summary judgment law in this state continues to require a defendant moving for summary judgment to present evidence,and not simply point out that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at,d,fn.omitted.aguilar stated 
to speak broadly,all of the foregoing discussion of summary judgment law in this state,like that of its federal counterpart,may be reduced to,and justified by,a single proposition if a party moving for summary judgment in any action would prevail at trial without submission of any issue of material fact to a trier of fact for determination,then he should prevail on summary judgment.in such a case,the court should grant the motion and avoid a trial rendered useless by nonsuit or directed verdict or similar device.citations.id.at,d,italics added.
on appellate review of an order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment,we exercise an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.the appellate court must examine only papers before the trial court when it considered the motion,and not documents filed later.citation.moreover,we construe the moving party affidavits strictly,construe the opponent affidavits liberally,and resolve doubts about the propriety of granting the motion in favor of the party opposing it.citations.seo overhead doors th,d.
the meaning of the term premium as used in section,subdivision f 
exchange contends the trial court erred by granting williams motion for summary judgment and denying its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication because the court erroneously concluded the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,includes the fee charged for making payments of the annual premium in installments.
section,enacted in,provides 
a policy shall specify 
a the parties between whom the contract is made.
b the property or life insured.
c the interest of the insured in property insured,if he is not the absolute owner thereof.
d the risks insured against.
e the period during which the insurance is to continue.
f either a statement of the premium,or if the insurance is of a character where the exact premium is only determinable upon the termination of the contract,a statement of the basis and rates upon which the final premium is to be determined and paid.italics added.
neither section nor any other provision of the insurance code defines the term premium.furthermore,the parties have not cited,nor have we found,any case that interprets the term premium as used in section,subdivision f.accordingly,it is a question of first impression whether the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,includes the fee charged for making payments of the annual premium in installments.
our task in interpreting a statute is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.citations.citation.in order to do so,w e turn first to the words of the statute themselves,recognizing that they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citations.when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous and thus not reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citations.citation.people leal cal th,d.alternatively stated,under the rules of statutory construction,i t is settled that w e are required to give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.citations.citation.stated otherwise,w hen statutory language is thus clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citations.we have declined to follow the plain meaning of a statute only when it would inevitably have frustrated the manifest purposes of the legislation as a whole or led to absurd results.citations.people belleci cal d,superseded by constitutional amendment on another ground as noted in people moore d.it is our task to construe,not to amend,the statute.in the construction of a statute the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted citation.we may not,under the guise of construction,rewrite the law or give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.
we conclude the fee exchange charges for making payments of the annual premium in installments is interest for the time value of money and the plain and ordinary meaning of the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,does not include interest charged for the time value of money.it is commonly understood that a premium is the amount paid for certain insurance for a certain period of coverage for example,in this case exchange charged williams an annual premium of for renewal of her automobile insurance coverage for the period from january through january.as section confirms,a premium is to be paid on commencement of the period of insurance coverage.section provides an insurer is entitled to payment of the premium as soon as the subject matter insured is exposed to the peril insured against.therefore,in the case of an annual period of renewal of insurance coverage,an insurer is entitled to payment of the annual premium in one lump sum at the beginning of the policy period.to the extent an insurer provides an insured with the option of paying that one lump sum in installments of partial premium payments together with interest on the unpaid premium balance,the interest charged for the time value of money for the option of making payments of premium over time is not considered part of the premium paid for insurance coverage.
in this sense,a premium is analogous to the principal amount of a loan.in a loan situation,the principal loan amount is often paid in installments of partial principal payments together with interest accrued on the unpaid principal balance.in that context,it is commonly understood,and can not reasonably be argued otherwise,that payment of the interest charged is not payment of part of the unpaid principal amount,but rather for the time value of the unpaid principal amount.the same concept of time value of money applies in this case,in which exchange provided williams with the option of paying her annual lump sum premium in installments of partial premium amounts together with interest on the unpaid premium balance 
accordingly,in the circumstances of this case,the interest charged by exchange for use of its installment payment option does not constitute a premium,as used in section,subdivision f,and therefore was not required to be disclosed in its declarations page or elsewhere in the policy.because the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,is clear and unambiguous,it is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation proffered by williams and we need not engage in further statutory construction.people leal,supra,cal th at,d,people belleci,supra,cal d at.
although we do not rely on cases from other jurisdictions in reaching our decision in this case,we note that courts in another state have considered the term premium in a like manner.one court stated the installment fees are paid not to procure an indemnification contract,but for the privilege of paying the premium over time.blanchard allstate ins.so d.accordingly,under the applicable louisiana statute,blanchard concluded these installment fees need not be disclosed on the policy.ibid.cacamo liberty mut.fire ins.so d found blanchard reasoning sound and reached the same conclusion.cacamo,at.
williams does not cite any california case or apposite case from another jurisdiction holding the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f,or otherwise for insurance policy disclosure purposes,includes interest charged for the time value of money for the option of making payments of premium over time although she cites,as the trial court did,allstate ins.state board of,supra,d,as authority supporting that position,allstate is distinguishable because it interpreted the term gross premiums for taxation purposes and,in any event,involved inapposite facts to this case.allstate stated premium in the law of insurance means the amount paid to the company for insurance.citation.id.at.in the context of taxation of insurance companies,t he gross premium,or the amount charged in a contract of insurance,ordinarily includes two elements,that is,the net premium and the loading.the loading,or the amount arbitrarily added to the net premium,is intended to cover the expenses of the company.in a stock company it may also be a source of profit and in a mutual company,a source from which dividends may be paid to the insured.citations.ibid.because t he expense of administering the insurance is a component of premium,allstate reasoned that r eimbursement of the additional expense resulting from selling the insurance on an installment basis is an essential element of the gross premium.id.at.in its circumstances involving an installment payment fee charged solely to recover the additional costs resulting from the optional installment payment program,allstate stated 
the sole basis for the imposition of the installment payment fee and the determination of its amount was the expense to the company of the additional installment collections.plaintiff made the charge of the installment payment fee directly to the insured in order that the increase of its expense from acceptance of installment premiums be passed directly to the insured.the option to the insured was whether he wanted to pay in installments.if he did,he was required to pay the installment payment charge the installment payment fee was an item of expense loading to cover the additional cost of the installment premium plan,and was in the same category as the expense loading in the cash premium the expense incident to the installment payment plan does not differ in character from other expenses included in premium.the entire cost to the policyholder arising out of the issuance and performance of the contract of insurance constitutes the taxable premium.ibid.
allstate concluded that,in its circumstances,gross premiums for taxation purposes included installment payment fees based solely on the additional costs incurred by an insurance company in offering an installment payment program.allstate ins.state board of,supra,d at.
allstate is inapposite to this case because here the installment charges in question are not based on the additional costs incurred by exchange in offering an installment payment program,but are based solely on the time value of money for use of the option of making payments of premium in installments,interest on the amount of the unpaid premium balance in williams statement of disputed material facts in opposition to exchange motion for summary judgment,she admits it is u ndisputed that exchange administrative the cost of collecting premiums paid in included in the premium amount approved by the doi and listed on policyholders declarations pages,on which the exchange does pay gross premiums tax.
although mercury casualty state bd.of equalization d.also is distinguishable from this case because it interpreted the term gross premiums in the context of taxation of insurance companies,it,unlike allstate,involved interest income that an insurance company received from installment notes and therefore is more closely analogous to the circumstances in this case.mercury,at.mercury stated 
plaintiff offers to prospective insureds the option of either paying,in advance,in cash,the annual premiums on policies written by it,or of paying part of such premiums in cash and partly by an installment note for the balance.in the latter case,the insured is charged an amount calculated to cover the increased overhead to plaintiff for handling the notes and collecting them,plus a sum equal to interest at the going rate on the principal of the notes.
plaintiff treats the face of the note as part of the gross premium and pays the gross income tax thereon it also treats the service charge as part of the premium and pays the tax thereon.it regards the interest charged as not being part of the gross premium and,in this litigation,resists the board position that it is a third element of the gross premium.we agree with the plaintiff.mercury cas.state bd.of equalization,supra,d at,italics added.
mercury reasoned 
i n those cases where an insured pays the entire advance premium in cash,plaintiff could,and would,invest the nonload part of the premium and earn a nontaxable income therefrom.it is the position of the plaintiff that,in computing the gross premium,it has satisfied its full obligation by its treatment of the service charge and the face value of the note as part of the gross premium and that the interest it collects is no more than income from an,a loan to the insured.we agree.id.at,italics added.
mercury expressly concluded allstate was factually inapposite to its case because i t did not deal with any interest charge on the delayed installments.mercury,at.
therefore,although we do not rely on taxation cases in interpreting the meaning of the term premium as used in section,subdivision f,to the extent those cases are analogous because they interpreted the term gross premiums,we conclude they support,rather than contradict,our conclusion above.in particular,we conclude mercury cas,which effectively held interest income is not part of gross premiums for taxation purposes,is more closely analogous to this case than is allstate ins,cited by williams and by the trial court in support of its order 
similarly,although williams cites two california attorney general opinions in support of her position,both opinions related to the definition of gross premiums in the context of insurance company taxation.see.therefore,those opinions are factually and legally inapposite and do not persuade us to reach a different conclusion in this case.
williams also argues we should give substantial deference to the doi opinion dated april,as discussed and quoted above,on the proper interpretation in this case of the term premium,as used in section,subdivision f.apparently finding the meanings of the terms premium and gross premiums in taxation,and other contexts unhelpful in determining the meaning of premium for section,subdivision f purposes,the doi reasoned 
t he primary purpose of as specifically stated for the automobile line of insurance in is to prevent fraud and mistake by requiring insurers to list the basic terms of the contract.accordingly,it is the commissioner view that policyholders would be less likely to be defrauded or mistaken about the amount of premium if that term is defined in the broadest sense,in the typical way policyholders view their installment payments,the total price of obtaining coverage,including the installment fee.if that overall price varies depending on the existence of an installment fee,a policyholder will be less likely to be mistaken about the cost of insurance if the policy discloses the nature and amount of that variation.
accordingly,the doi concluded t he purpose of was not to calculate rates,determine tax liability,or assess the financial solvency of insurers,but to mandate the disclosure of material insurance contract terms,including the price.for the above reasons,the commissioner concludes that installment fees are premium under,in the private passenger automobile context.in deciding the parties motions for summary judgment,the trial court expressly gave some deference to the doi opinion.
however,the trial court erred in giving deference to the doi opinion.the doi opinion was not based on any administrative construction of section,subdivision f,on the meaning of the term premium.on the contrary,it is implicit in that opinion that the doi had never before expressly addressed the specific issue in this case.as the california supreme court stated 
because the administrative policy at issue here is not a formally adopted regulation,and the board does not claim that its policy constitutes a administrative construction of the statute,we need not defer to any administrative understanding of the meaning of those statutory provisions.we determine independently the meaning of those statutory provisions.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,italics added.
