background 
trishan retained david wittwer wittwer and the buckner company to procure the renewal of trishan aviation insurance policy covering a dassault falcon b aircraft.trishan chief pilot informed wittwer that trishan sought a renewal policy that provided for pilots compliance only with the training requirements of 
company acted as the insurance broker for trishan.accordingly,wittwer contacted connie french french of to obtain a quote for the replacement policy from starr aviation.sam seybert seybert,starr aviation underwriter,determined that he could not provide a pilot warranty limited to the basic requirements listed in.as a result,seybert transmitted a quotation to french that included a pilot warranty requiring pilots to complete ground and flight courses,including simulator training,for the make and model of the covered aircraft.in a subsequent email to french,seybert clarified that the pilot warranty covered pilots sics french forwarded this information to wittwer,who understood that,under the starr aviation proposal,the schooling requirements and simulator requirements would apply to sics.
wittwer subsequently requested a binder for the policy.the binder included a pilot warranty endorsement that provided 
it is required that the aircraft is operated by a two pilot crew at all times that has been approved by the named insureds sic chief pilot.
it is further required that such pilot s must have successfully completed a ground and flight training course for the make and model operated within the past months.any such course must incorporate the use of a simulator specifically designed for the insured make and and model series.
the policy contained a nearly identical pilot warranty and exclusion f,which excluded coverage consistent with the pilot warranty provisions 
scott michael michael,trishan chief pilot,was in command of the covered aircraft during the accident.michael was unaware at the time of the accident that the federal policy contained commercial flight school and simulator training requirements for pilots.according to michael,he would have never,and would never,permit any pilot to operate any aircraft if that pilot did not meet both the applicable minimum requirements under federal regulations and any further training requirements set forth in the insurance policy covering the aircraft.
dennis piermarini piermarini served as the for the aircraft during the accident.piermarini had years and hours of flight experience with hours in jet aircraft.he also flew as in the falcon as for approximately five flights and a total of approximately nine hours of flight time.piermarini maintained that,if he had performed the simulator training,he would have learned no new information or training that would have either alerted him to any condition or contributed to any of the actions that he took 
according to michael expert witness report,piermarini received approximately hours of static cockpit simulation of procedures,emergency procedures,placement of placards,markings,instrumentation and other operations of the aircraft.michael stated that this training was very similar to simulator training,and in some cases better after conducting a check ride flight,michael believed that piermarini was well versed and procedurally accurate in all particulars of the falcons systems.piermarini also flew in the jump seat as an observer on several flight legs michael opined that piermarini failure to undergo simulator training would not have affected piermarini qualifications to operate the aircraft.
in his declaration,charles tatum tatum,trishan expert,stated that the accident would not have been prevented if the pilots had undergone simulator or ground training.in his expert report,tatum opined that piermarini hours of static cockpit training was very similar to simulator training and in some cases better tatum concluded that a full motion simulator course would not have altered piermarini qualifications in the slightest.
according to seybert,starr aviation consider ed simulator training to be for purposes of emergency training,as there are a number of emergency procedures that can easily be practiced in a flight simulator that can not be safely practiced in an actual aircraft.emphasis in the original.seybert also stated that piermarini would not have been approved as a pilot because he had only flown a total of about hours in the preceding four years 
federal denied coverage for the accident because piermarini never attended any formal course relative to any falcon aircraft in violation of the pilot warranty and exclusion f emphasis in the original.
in its first amended complaint,trishan alleged claims for breach of contract tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing reformation and declaratory judgment based on federal denial of coverage the district court held that federal denial of coverage comported with california law,as trishan did not strictly comply with the pilot warranty.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of federal,and trishan filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.discussion 
substantial compliance with the pilot warranty 
trishan asserts that summary judgment was improper because,under california law,it was not required to strictly comply with the pilot warranty to receive coverage 
there is a notable paucity of recent california supreme court precedent concerning an insured strict compliance with insurance warranties.however,the california supreme court has held that strict compliance may be required.in mckenzie scottish union ins,cal,the california supreme court determined that the insured failure to employ a watchman at a sawmill as required by a warranty precluded coverage for damage caused by a fire.the california supreme court observed 
by a warranty the insured stipulates for the absolute truth of the statement made,and the strict compliance with some promised line of conduct,upon penalty of forfeiture of his right to recover in case of loss should the statement prove untrue,or the course of conduct promised be unfulfilled.a warranty is an agreement in the nature of a condition precedent,and,like that,must be strictly complied with if the warranty be a statement of facts,it must be literally true if a stipulation that a certain act shall or shall not be done,it must be literally performed.
id.at citation omitted.although the california supreme court articulated that there was neither a literal nor a substantial compliance with the terms of the warranty,id.at,it appears that the california supreme court decision was premised on the insured failure to strictly comply with the warranty.see id.at as the evidence of plaintiff all showed affirmatively a nonfulfillment of the warranty,the court in the present instance should have granted defendant motion for a nonsuit and the verdict of the jury on precisely the same evidence was contrary to law.see also hogins supreme council of the champions of the red cross,cal,holding that failure to strictly comply with a warranty precluded coverage because t he warranty is an agreement in the nature of a condition precedent,and like that must be strictly complied with the same principles apply to all kinds of insurance.citation omitted wells,fargo pacific ins,cal,the very meaning of a warranty is,to preclude all question whether it has been substantially complied with it must be literally.citation omitted emphasis in the original 
california courts of appeal have also articulated the necessity of strict compliance with warranties.see chase indem,d,a statement in an insurance policy importing an intention to do or not to do a thing which materially affects the risk is a warranty that such act or omission will take place generally speaking,compliance with the terms of a warranty is a condition precedent to a right of recovery.citations omitted de campos state comp.ins.fund,d,holding that the insured failure to comply with an affirmative warranty precluded reimbursement because c ompliance with the terms of this warranty was a condition precedent to a right of recovery insofar as this particular risk was concerned.noncompliance defeat ed recovery.citation omitted finkbohner glens falls ins.of glens falls,new york.thus,california courts have recognized that insurance warranties require strict compliance to invoke coverage.
trishan argument is premised on the warranty being a mere condition of the insurance policy,thus requiring only substantial compliance.this argument ignores the dichotomy between conditions relating to basic coverage,such as notice provisions,and conditions,like the pilot warranty,that are an element of the fundamental risk insured.root am.equity specialty ins,th.there are differences between insuring clauses,exclusions,and conditions that should not be amalgamated into one binary question coverage yes or no under an if then analysis.id.at citation omitted emphasis in the original.
contrary to such variations in insurance provisions,trishan seeks universal application of the substantial compliance doctrine untethered from the type of warranty at issue.however,strict compliance with pilot warranties serves as a necessary corollary of aviation insurance policies.federal courts uniformly enforce pilot warranties and for good reason.pilot qualifications and experience are obviously factors bearing directly on the risk the insurer is underwriting.old republic ins.gormley,d,citations omitted.as exemplified by ins.underwriters carter,cal d,trishan approach undermines the reasons for including pilot warranties in aviation insurance policies.in ins.underwriters,the insurer denied coverage of an airplane accident because the airplane owners permitted a pilot to fly the plane.see id.at.an exclusion provided that the policy was wholly inapplicable unless the aircraft was piloted by a person whose name and qualifications were specified in the policy.id.at.the california supreme court observed that a n insurance company has the right to limit the coverage of a policy issued by it and when it has done so,the plain language of the limitation must be respected.id.citation omitted emphasis added.in upholding the insurer denial of coverage,the california supreme court opined 
it appears that the insured could not reasonably have expected the insurer to afford coverage without regard to the identity and qualifications of those persons entrusted with flying the aircraft.in view of the relatively few persons qualified to fly a plane,and the obvious hazard to the occupants and to the aircraft from flights by unqualified pilots,it is understandable that an insurer would insist on knowing who the proposed pilots were,evaluating their qualifications,and making its policy inapplicable to accidents involving pilots not disclosed to,nor approved by,the insurer.in our view,the pilot exclusion clause is unambiguous and accords with the reasonable expectations of the insured.
id.internal quotation marks omitted the california supreme court emphasis on the importance of pilot warranties persuades us that california courts would require strict compliance with the pilot warranty.see also union fire ins.of pittsburg miller,d,concluding that the denial of coverage was proper based on a pilot warranty requiring a current medical certificate.the california supreme court approach to this issue militates against trishan position that substantial compliance is universally acceptable,irrespective of the type of warranty implicated.this is particularly true in view of trishan failure to cite any case in which california courts have accepted substantial compliance with pilot warranties trishan relies on the substantial compliance doctrine utilized in cases involving statutory requirements.however,this precedent is inapposite.for example,in costa superior,cal,the california supreme court held that inadvertent irregularities in the filing of an initiative petition did not warrant removal of the initiative measure from the ballot.the california supreme court reasoning stemmed from the informational purpose of the initiative process,thus minimizing the need for strict compliance.see id.at the requirements of both the constitution and the statute are intended to and do give information to the electors who are asked to sign the initiative petitions.if that be accomplished in any given case,little more can be asked than that a substantial compliance with the law and the constitution be had,and that such compliance does no violence to a reasonable construction of the technical requirements of the law.citation and footnote reference omitted emphasis in the original.although the california supreme court did not require actual compliance with the statutory mandates,each objective or purpose of a statute must be achieved in order to satisfy the substantial compliance standard.id.at.accordingly,inadvertent,human error did not justify exclusion of the initiative from the ballot when it is apparent that the technical defect in question,as a realistic matter,did not adversely affect the integrity of the electoral process or frustrate the purposes underlying the relevant constitutional or statutory requirements.id.at.
the present appeal does not involve compliance with the informational purposes of a statutory scheme despite inadvertent,human error.id.instead,trishan failure to comply with any aspect of the required training for completely undermined federal ability to negotiate and implement the terms of its policies.if adopted,the practical effect of trishan proposition would be significant,as it would permit an insured to universally assert that only substitute performance,based on the insured subjective selection,would be necessary to receive coverage.this approach nullifies any specific requirement that an insurer has in assuming the covered risk,and generates uncertainty on the insurer part regarding compliance.see everett state farm ins,th,as modified it is,of course,well established that an insurer has a right to limit the policy coverage in plain and understandable language,and is at liberty to limit the character and extent of the risk it undertakes to assume.internal quotation marks omitted.as it negotiates the policy terms,an insurer would be unable to discern what substitutes equated to the required conditions to adopt this approach,we would have to rewrite the insurance policy in contravention of california law.see supervalu,wexford underwriting managers,th,as modified t he parties agreed to the policy language and we have no power to rewrite it.see also kwok transnation title ins,th,we do not rewrite any provision of any contract,including an insurance policy,for any purpose.citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
our decision in union fire ins.of pittsburgh california cotton credit,cir does not compel a contrary conclusion.in that case,we considered whether the insured complied with a promissory warranty requiring the keeping of certain records concerning the insured cotton crops.see id.at.without extensive analysis,we broadly observed that p rovisions requiring the keeping of records and their production upon request for inspection by the insurer are promissory warranties.substantial compliance with a promissory warranty is sufficient.id.at citations omitted.we did not resolve this issue under california law,relying instead on federal cases such as surety earl park state bank,cir.see union,at.in surety,the seventh circuit considered whether the insured complied with the recordkeeping requirements of a warranty in a burglary insurance policy.see surety,at.the seventh circuit opined that substantial compliance with recordkeeping requirements is sufficient.see id.at.notably,union and surety do not address warranties involving the actual risk upon which the insurer makes its coverage decisions.thus,it does not follow that application of the substantial compliance doctrine regarding recordkeeping implicates compliance with warranties premised on the underlying risk.given the california supreme court approach to pilot warranties,our decision in union does not control the outcome of this appeal.we conclude that substantial compliance is insufficient to satisfy pilot warranties under california law.see mckenzie,cal.at see also ins.underwriters,cal d at union fire,cal.app d at 
even if the substantial compliance doctrine applied,summary judgment was nevertheless proper because trishan did not comply with any aspect of the pilot warranty for.a common analytical thread runs through the substantial compliance cases cited by trishan the insured noncompliance was typically minor and the insured complied with at least some of the specific requirements at issue.see,mccormick sentinel life ins,d,holding that the insured failure to supply a single item of information on the claim form raised a question of fact union,at noting that the insured complied with the warranty except in one instance,through an oversight the specified records were not timely completed.california courts have rejected substantial compliance arguments where the insured completely failed to comply with a warranty or condition.see abdelhamid fire ins.exchange,th,the deficiencies in the insured proof of loss were a far cry from minor defects and no reasonable trier of fact could conclude she substantially performed her obligations or complied with the condition of her insurance contract requiring her to provide a proof of loss with supporting documentation.citation omitted s m lamp lubermens mut.cas,d,as modified holding that because there was no compliance,the insurer was not required to provide coverage,as t he court was not free to rewrite the contract or to indulge in any forced construction of its language.citation omitted 
trishan elides the fact that it did not comply with the pilot warranty training requirements for in any fashion.instead,trishan asserts that the pilot alternative training served as a substitute for the simulator training however,a complete failure to comply is not analogous to minor deficiencies.see aviation charters,at unlike the notice of claim that was intended to aid the insurance carrier in investigating,settling,and defending claims,the unambiguous exclusionary clause and the approved pilot endorsement involved in this appeal define the coverage provided.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,trishan complete failure to comply with the pilot warranty precludes coverage even under the substantial compliance doctrine.see,abdelhamid,cal.app th at s m lamp,d at.
trishan also maintains that the pilot warranty can not serve as an express warranty because of its ambiguity.trishan argument is premised on the pilot warranty usage of the term pilot s as opposed to pilots.trishan asserts that it complied with the warranty,because pilot s could be read as only requiring the chief pilot to undergo the simulator training.
policy language is ambiguous if it is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation in the context of the policy as a whole.legacy vulcan superior,th,citation reference omitted.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.carolina cas.ins.ross law group,llp,th,citation omitted.within the context of the policy,the pilot warranty contemplates that all pilots operating the aircraft must undergo the specified training,irrespective of its usage of the parenthetical.see state farm ins.jt frames,th,a n abstract ambiguity based on a semantically permissible interpretation of a word or phrase can not create coverage where none would otherwise exist.see also city of carlsbad ins.of the state of,th,j ust because language could be more precise or explicit does not mean it is ambiguous.citation omitted.
additionally,the parties negotiations reflect that were covered by the warranty.in determining whether policy language is ambiguous,we consider not only the face of the contract but also any extrinsic evidence that supports a reasonable interpretation.ggis ins,superior,th,citation omitted.the record reflects that federal explicitly conveyed to trishan representatives that must receive the simulator training.thus,trishan argument premised on the warranty alleged ambiguity is unavailing 
the district court,therefore,properly granted summary judgment because no material issue of fact was raised regarding trishan lack of compliance with the pilot warranty 
trishan claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for bad faith 
california law recognizes in every contract,including insurance policies,an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.brehm century ins,th,as modified citations omitted.in the insurance context the implied covenant requires the insurer to refrain from injuring its insured right to receive the benefits of the insurance agreement.id.citation omitted.as a general rule there can be no breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing if no benefits are due under the policy.id.summary judgment on trishan claim was proper because trishan failure to comply with the pilot warranty precluded a material issue of fact regarding coverage.see id.
trishan bad faith claim fails under california genuine dispute rule.a n insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the linchpin of a bad faith claim is that the denial of coverage was unreasonable.mccoy progressive ins,th.before an insurer can be found to have acted in bad faith for its delay or denial in the payment of policy benefits,it must be shown that the insurer acted unreasonably or without proper cause.id.citation omitted emphasis in the original.because california law does not establish that substantial compliance with the pilot warranty was sufficient for coverage,we conclude that no material issue of fact was raised regarding federal good faith assertion of its coverage position.see id.where there is a genuine issue as to the insurer liability under the policy for the claim asserted by the insured,there can be no bad faith liability imposed on the insurer for advancing its side of that dispute.citation omitted emphasis in the original see also griffin dewatering ins.of new york,th,as modified explaining that the insurer position was rooted in the literal language of the exclusion,so the insurer was going to win if a court were to apply the literal language of the exclusion.
