plaintiff luis medina appeals from the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant metropolitan life insurance company metlife.medina contends that metlife violated the employment retirement security act of erisa,et,by using an arbitrary and capricious procedure in terminating his disability benefits and refusing to grant him disability benefits.he also seeks monetary sanctions against metlife for an alleged breach of its disclosure obligations under.the district court found no violation in either of the benefits determinations.we affirm.
medina worked as a maintenance technician for abbott laboratories,in puerto rico.as an abbott employee,he participated in a disability insurance plan administered by metlife that provided both and disability benefits the plan.in june,medina ceased work due to obstructive sleep apnea and high blood pressure.shortly thereafter,he submitted a claim for disability benefits under the plan.his treating physician,hector stella,provided metlife a diagnostic report.on august,metlife informed medina that it would grant him disability benefits for a limited period,but would require additional documentation before any further benefits would be awarded.stella submitted a second evaluation on august,containing further diagnoses but little in the way of specific test results.
on several occasions over the next two months,metlife attempted to contact medina and stella by letter,phone,and fax in order to explain that more specific information was necessary and to request test results and progress notes.while attempts to reach stella directly were apparently unsuccessful,medina agreed to follow up with him about metlife need for additional medical information.on november,stella submitted his progress notes covering the period from june,to august.
in early december,metlife notified medina that it was terminating his disability benefits.in support of its decision to terminate benefits,metlife stated that the information submitted by stella was insufficient to support a finding of full disability under the plan terms the notice also described metlife attempts to obtain more detailed evidence from stella.
in late december,medina appealed to metlife to reconsider its decision,and metlife agreed to submit the claim for independent medical review.on january,medina forwarded additional progress notes and reports from stella detailing symptoms,diagnoses,and treatments.metlife referred medina entire claim file to an independent medical consultant,stephen kreitzer.on january,kreitzer issued a report in which he concluded that there are insufficient clinical findings or data to support reduction in ability to work full time or that he can not perform his medium work.on february,metlife again attempted to contact stella to ask for his thoughts on the report and,in the event of a disagreement,any evidence supporting a contrary position.it faxed this request directly to stella office,but stella apparently never received it.metlife also repeatedly informed medina that it was trying to reach stella and asked him to relay the message in order to assure a response.medina told metlife that he had already submitted all of his medical records and that stella was upset because there was nothing left to send.by,metlife had still heard nothing from stella in response to kreitzer report.
on march,after reviewing the existing medical information,findings,clinical remarks,and abbott policies,metlife concluded that the original denial of disability benefits was appropriate.it informed medina that his benefits would not be reinstated and that he had exhausted all available administrative remedies on that claim.
medina sued in the federal district court for the district of puerto rico and later filed a motion in that court for judgment on the administrative record.the district court granted summary judgment to metlife,and this appeal ensued.
denial of benefits 
medina maintains that he is entitled to both and disability benefits.as to the former,the district court reviewed the administrative record and determined that metlife did not abuse its discretion in denying the claim.as to the latter,it found that it lacked jurisdiction because medina had not yet exhausted his administrative remedies.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.stamp metro.life ins,cir.
disability benefits 
because the plan grants metlife discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,we will not overturn its decision unless it was arbitrary or capricious.metro.life.ins.glenn,d firestone tire rubber bruch,d under this generous standard,we inquire into whether metlife decision was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.stamp,at.put differently,we will uphold metlife decision to deny disability benefits if there is any reasonable basis for it.wallace johnson johnson,cir 
medina presents three arguments as to why metlife procedures in terminating his benefits should be deemed arbitrary and capricious.none are availing.
first,he alleges that kreitzer based his evaluation on false assumptions concerning the extent of his occupational demands.a metlife case manager had originally classified the maintenance technician work that medina performed as a heavy job.yet when kreitzer issued the report on which metlife relied,he stated that there are insufficient clinical findings or data to support reduction in ability to work full time or that he can not perform his medium work.emphasis added.medina now argues for the first time that the description of his job duties as medium work shows that kreitzer premised his recommendation on the belief that medina occupation was less demanding than it actually was.by failing to raise this argument in either the claims process or the district court,however,medina has waived it on appeal.stiefel,cir campbell bankboston,cir.we therefore do not address it.
second,medina claims that metlife did not accord sufficient weight to stella evaluations in considering whether his physical impairment met the plan definition of full disability.yet courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation.black decker disability plan nord,d.a plan administrator is not obligated to accept or even to give particular weight to the opinion of a claimant treating physician.med.card,cir.consequently,in the presence of conflicting evidence,it is entirely appropriate for a reviewing court to uphold the decision of the entity entitled to exercise its discretion.gannon metro.life ins,cir.
in this case,kreitzer had substantive reasons for diverging from stella assessment.in his report,kreitzer noted that most of the medical information that medina had provided through stella was not recent that many significant diagnostic tests had not been performed that it is very rare for sleep apnea to cause impairment and that there were insufficient clinical findings or data to support reduction in work ability.we conclude that these findings by an independent medical examiner gave metlife the requisite substantial evidentiary grounds for a reasonable decision in its favor.denmark liberty life assur.of boston,cir citation omitted.
third,medina claims that metlife was required to wait for stella to offer his feedback on kreitzer report before reaching a final determination.metlife alleges that it faxed a copy of the report to stella along with a solicitation for his review.the fax itself is contained in the administrative record.medina nevertheless avers that the fax must not have ever successfully reached its intended destination.according to medina,any decision that did not incorporate stella additional feedback can only be viewed as arbitrary because metlife must have considered that feedback to be absolutely necessary otherwise,medina argues,metlife would not have attempted to solicit stella reaction to begin with.
the record,however,indicates that medina was on ample notice that metlife was tr
