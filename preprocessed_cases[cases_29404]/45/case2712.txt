factual and procedural background 
the original complaints 
on december,davaloo and the filed identically worded complaints alleging causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith against state farm for damage to their properties caused by the northridge earthquake although the complaints were filed on december,at the end of section revival period,they do not mention the statute,let alone allege that davaloo and the claims satisfy the requirements for revival each complaint alleges,plaintiffs suffered insured losses as a result of the earthquake and its aftershocks and made timely claims to or had contact with the defendants in regard to their damages.aside from the caption,the complaints do not mention the parties by name,instead referring to them generically throughout as plaintiff or plaintiffs and defendants.the complaints do not provide the address of davaloo or the property,stating only the property at issue is located in california.they do not set forth the policy limits,deductible or any other terms of the insurance policy sued upon,attach a copy of the policy or even give the policy number but merely allege the policy consists of a written contract as orally amended.the complaints contain a multitude of allegations against defendants regarding the failure to pay policy benefits for damages caused by the northridge earthquake.no specifics are given with respect to a claim for policy benefits made by davaloo or the or any action taken by state farm in response to such a claim.
state farm filed demurrers to davaloo and the complaints,contending they were uncertain and failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for breach of contract or bad faith.
the first amended complaints 
on june,before the hearing on state farm demurrers,davaloo and the filed first amended complaints against state farm,again alleging causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith.see complaint may be amended once before hearing on demurrer without leave of court.the body of each first amended complaint,while still similar to one another,identifies davaloo or the as the plaintiff or plaintiffs and state farm as the defendant and provides the address of the property and the insurance policy number at issue,omitting the allegation the policy was amended orally.the first amended complaints again do not mention section but allege davaloo and the suffered insured losses as a result of the earthquake and its aftershocks and made timely claims to or had contact with the defendants in regard to their damages,within one year immediately following the earthquake.
the first amended complaints contain another list of generic allegations,some repeated from the original complaints and some different,regarding state farm failure to pay policy benefits for damages caused by the northridge earthquake and further provide,while each action may not have been employed by state farm insurance company in the case of this particular plaintiffs sic,these actions as a whole constituted a pattern of practices evidencing that defendant actions were in bad faith.as with the original complaints,the first amended complaints fail to provide any details regarding a claim for policy benefits made by davaloo or the or state farm response.
state farm demurrers and the trial court ruling 
state farm filed demurrers to davaloo and the first amended complaints,contending they are because they were filed after section revival period and do not relate back to the filing of the original complaints.according to state farm,because the original complaints were sham pleadings lacking specific factual allegations,the amended pleadings are not based on the same set of operative facts as the original complaints and thus do not satisfy the requirements for application of the doctrine.
the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend finding in each case,the original complaint was a sham pleading not containing specific information.the first amended complaint does not relate back and is.the trial court dismissed the actions 
contentions 
davaloo and the contend the causes of action against state farm for breach of contract and bad faith in the original complaints were sufficient and,therefore,the trial court erred by sustaining the demurrers to the first amended complaints without leave to amend on the ground they are.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from an order dismissing a complaint after the sustaining of a demurrer,we independently review the pleading to determine whether the facts alleged state a cause of action under any possible legal theory.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d,berger california ins.guarantee th,d.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,treat ing the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.citation.aubry,at,d.we liberally construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties.kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d.
where the complaint is defective,i n the furtherance of justice great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend his or her complaint.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.leave to amend may be granted on appeal even in the absence of a request by the plaintiff to amend the complaint.id.at,d,see,subd.a.we determine whether the plaintiff has shown in what manner he or she can amend the complaint and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.goodman kennedy cal d.l eave to amend should not be granted where amendment would be futile.vaillette fireman fund ins.th,d.
the trial court properly sustained state farm demurrer to the first amended complaints on the ground they are because they do not relate back to the filing of the original complaints 
pleading requirements and the doctrine 
a complaint must contain a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action,in ordinary and concise language,subd.a.this requirement obligates the plaintiff to allege ultimate facts that as a whole apprise the adversary of the factual basis of the claim.citations.estate of archer d.see also lim.internat.th,d.when a complaint complies with the requirement of section,subdivision a,t he existence of a legal right in an abstract form is never alleged by the plaintiff but,instead thereof,the facts from which that right arises are set forth,and the right itself is inferred therefrom.the cause of action,as it appears in the complaint when properly pleaded,will therefore always be the facts from which the plaintiff primary right and the defendant corresponding primary duty have arisen,together with the facts which constitute the defendant delict or act of wrong.citation.lodi lodi d.
the requirement that the complaint allege ultimate facts forming the basis for the plaintiff cause of action is central to the doctrine and the determination whether an amended complaint should be deemed filed as of the date of the original pleading.see bartalo superior court d.explaining essential role of requirement in application of doctrine.an amended complaint relates back to a timely filed original complaint,and thus avoids the bar of the statute of limitations,only if it rests on the same general set of facts and refers to the same offending instrumentalities,accident and injuries as the original complaint.barrington robins cal d,austin massachusetts bonding insurance cal d,where an amendment is sought after the statute of limitations has run,the amended complaint will be deemed filed as of the date of the original complaint provided recovery is sought in both pleadings on the same general set of facts.
the doctrine,therefore,requires courts to compare the factual allegations in the original and amended complaints.for example,a third amended complaint alleging a cause of action for age discrimination under the fair employment and housing act feha,et did not relate back to the filing of the original complaint because the wrongful conduct described in the discrimination claim did not arise out of the same set of facts alleged in the original complaint to support claims of breach of contract and labor code violations.kim regents of the university of california th,d.and an amended complaint alleging the decedent was electrocuted by a lamp socket and switch manufactured by one entity did not relate back to an original complaint alleging the electrocution was caused by a defective hair dryer with a different manufacturer because,although the pleadings related to a single death at a single location,they alleged different accidents and instrumentalities.coronet manufacturing superior court d.on the other hand,an amended complaint substituting a party for a fictitiously named defendant and alleging the same accident and injuries but a different cause of action and legal theory from the original complaint related back to the filing of the original complaint,and thus was not barred by the statute of limitations,because the two complaints referred to the same general set of facts.smeltzley nicholson cal d.
because the original complaints do not come close to satisfying the basic requirement,the first amended complaints do not relate back to the filing of the original complaints 
just as a plaintiff who changes the essential facts upon which recovery is sought is not entitled to the benefits of the doctrine,so too a plaintiff who files a complaint containing no operative facts at all can not subsequently amend the pleading to allege facts and a theory of recovery for the first time and claim the amended complaint should be deemed filed as of the date of the original,wholly defective complaint going from nothing to something is as much at odds with the rationale for allowing an amended pleading to relate back to the filing of the original documents as changing from one set of facts to a different set.see austin massachusetts bonding insurance,supra,cal d at fn,explaining similarity between notice aspect of modern rule permitting relation back of an amendment if recovery is sought on the same general set of facts as those alleged in the original complaint and fed.rules of civ,rule c now rule c,which permits relation back when the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading lamont wolfe d.noting examination of operative facts central to analysis of doctrine under both california law and fed.rules of civ,rule c,and holding doctrine properly applied when a defendant has had notice from the beginning that the plaintiff sets up and is trying to enforce a claim against it because of specified conduct,quoting justice holmes in cent.kinney.
in the instant cases the original complaints are so devoid of factual allegations they fail to meet section,subdivision a minimal requirement and are the functional equivalent of no complaint at all.other than in the caption,the original complaints do not name either of the plaintiffs or the defendant do not identify the property at issue by address or otherwise,merely averring it is within california not even southern california and do not provide the number of the applicable insurance policy,let alone describe its terms.the complaints contain a number of generic allegations describing the full range of improper actions any insurer theoretically could have taken in response to a claim for policy benefits for damages caused by the northridge earthquake but give no specifics of any kind as to a dispute between the plaintiff s specified in the caption and state farm.under the most liberal construction of the pleadings,the body of each of the original complaints at bottom alleges nothing more than the northridge earthquake caused harm to a resident or residents of los angeles county.such an allegation falls far short of apprising state farm of the factual basis of the claim.lim,supra,th at,d estate of archer,supra,d at.because of the complete lack of factual allegations in the original complaints,it is impossible to conclude the first amended complaints are based on the same general set of facts as the original complaints.
in holding the amended complaints do not relate back,we are relying on the totality of the deficiencies in the original complaints,rather than any single defect alone,or even a combination of several such defects it is not simply that the original complaints do not identify the parties except in the caption,property or insurance policy or that they fail to allege any specifics of davaloo or the dispute with state farm.rather,the totality of these material deficiencies leaves nothing to which the first amended complaints can be compared or to which they can relate back.mccauley howard jarvis taxpayers th,d doctrine can not be used based on the assumption the defendant is a bad egg and it is irrelevant that the act sued on was mentioned in the earlier complaint because it is the sort of mischief the defendant was inclined to get up to anyway.although there can be no rule as to when a complaint is so deficient to preclude relation back any more than there is a rule when an amended set of facts is too dissimilar to the originally pleaded set,the original complaints all their plainly insufficient 
notwithstanding davaloo and the characterization of the shortcomings in their original complaints as procedural and technical,the defects are both substantive and material.the original complaints fail to provide any information to state farm on the nature of davaloo or the claims other than they concern the northridge earthquake.indeed,it is impossible even to infer the nature of any dispute between state farm and either davaloo or the because the generic allegations of wrongdoing are contradictory.for example,the allegation that state farm denied the existence of an insurance policy is inconsistent with numerous other allegations,including that it improperly held back money it had agreed was owed on the policy and illegally altered investigative reports to pay less damages.if state farm had denied the existence of an insurance policy,it would not have conducted an investigation and falsified the reports or determined it owed benefits to its insured and then refused to pay them.the pleading inconsistencies in the original complaints highlight the absence of sufficient factual allegations to apprise state farm of the nature of the disputes at issue.see manti gunari d.although pleading inconsistent theories of recovery is permissible,a pleader can not blow hot and cold as to the facts positively stated.
davaloo and the reliance on the inclusion of the names of the parties in the caption to suggest the complaints adequately informed stat
