nancy brooks and joan silverman,as trustees of an irrevocable trust created by donald silverman and as executors of his estate,appeal from a district court decision dismissing their putative claims for breach of contract and unfair business practices against decedent life insurer,aig sunamerica life insurance company.we affirm.
background 
in may,mutual benefit life insurance company mutual issued a flexible premium adjustable life fpal insurance policy to donald silverman.the fpal policy provided,inter alia,a death benefit of provided silverman survived until at least april and a maturity date of may.mutual agreed to provide silverman with yearly reports showing the policy current cash value,cash surrender value,total paid premiums,and total assessed charges.
like most fpal policies,the mutual policy provided silverman with a type of savings and investment feature,which depended on the potential investment growth of the policy accumulated cash value acv.although silverman could increase or decrease the amount and frequency of his planned premium payments,the policy flexible premium feature,he initially committed to pay a fixed premium each year until the policy maturity date.these premium payments would be added into the acv of the policy.mutual would invest the acv,and any interest or dividends earned guaranteed not to be less than annually would be added back into the policy acv.
on the other hand,mutual periodically would reduce the policy acv to account for cash withdrawals or loans from the acv made to silverman,a monthly charge not to exceed per month for mutual administrative expenses,and the cost of insurance rate coi rate.unlike silverman fixed annual premiums,the coi rate,which reflected the current actual cost to mutual of insuring the risks to silverman life,was expected to increase over the course of the policy term 
the monthly cost of insurance rate is based on the sex,age,and rate class,of the insured.monthly cost of insurance rates will be determined by mutual annually,by earnings,mortality,persistency,and expenses,including taxes.any change in rates will be in accordance with any procedures and standards on file with the insurance department of the jurisdiction in which this policy is delivered,massachusetts.such cost of insurance rates will not be greater than those shown in the table of maximum monthly cost of insurance rates on page.
because silverman annual premium payments were fixed,whereas coi rates would increase over time,the monthly coi rate deduction from the policy acv could deplete the policy acv rapidly if,for example,the insured failed to make timely premium payments,or if the investment return on the acv was less than optimal.for the years,and,however,the policy capped the monthly coi rate that mutual could deduct at,and per of insurance,respectively.
in march,silverman assigned ownership of his fpal policy to the irrevocable trust the trust of which appellants currently serve as trustees.in,the new jersey commissioner of insurance took control of a mutual,and developed a rehabilitation plan rehabilitation plan transferring mutual assets and selected liabilities to mbl life insurance corporation mbl life.mutual policyholders,including silverman,were given the option either to receive of their policies cash surrender value,or to have their policies restructured and transferred to mbl life at their full value silverman elected the latter option.from through,mbl raised the coi rate from per of insurance to per of insurance.
in,mbl life obtained court approval pursuant to this rehabilitation plan to assign the mutual policies to appellee aig sunamerica life assurance company sunamerica.for the policy years,and,sunamerica raised the monthly cost of insurance rate on silverman fpal policy from to per of insurance.silverman died on june,and sunamerica paid the trust a death benefit of.
by letter dated may,appellants notified sunamerica,inter alia,that they believed its coi rate increases in,and must have been overcharges,given that mbl life had raised the coi rate at most by in,whereas the sunamerica coi rates for and were increased by and respectively as compared to the prior year.appellants further faulted sunamerica for failing to notify silverman that he needed to increase the amount or frequency of his premium payments in order to offset the dramatically higher coi rates being deducted from his policy acv after.
on may,sunamerica sent appellants a letter explaining that within certain limits,the owner of an fpal policy is given flexibility to determine the amount of premium he or she wants to pay,that silverman had made no premium payments in and,that sunamerica had sent annual statements to silverman showing that his premium payments were insufficient to cover the coi rate deductions from the policy acv,and yet he never requested adjustments to his premium payments.sunamerica also noted that the policy plainly provides that coi rates would increase subject to guaranteed yearly caps over the life of the policy,and that its coi rates for,and were,and,well below the policy caps,and.on july,appellants responded,stating only that sunamerica had failed to comply with their request that it provide the actual per thousand rate mortality charges for the years before sunamerica acquired the silverman policy,or as far back as you can provide.on august,sunamerica sent appellants the requested information,for policy years,and.
in february,appellants sent sunamerica a demand letter pursuant to.laws chapter,alleging that sunamerica had willful ly and knowing ly committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices by raising,without any justification,the coi rates from to,failing to warn silverman that his policy acv was being depleted,and misrepresenting that its coi increases had been pursuant to the rehabilitation plan.sunamerica responded by letter dated march,denying all of these allegations.in may,appellants,acting as of the silverman trust and estate,filed this putative diversity suit against sunamerica in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,alleging that sunamerica coi rate increases had breached the fpal policy count,breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing count,and violated the massachusetts and california unfair business practices statutes counts and.at the core of all four claims is this allegation 
upon information and belief,the coi rate increases were not made in accordance with any procedures and standards on file with the insurance department of the jurisdiction in which any of the mutual life block of policies were delivered.
emphasis added.
sunamerica moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.finding that appellants complaint failed to allege sunamerica bad faith,the district dismissed the breach of implied covenant claim in count,but deferred any ruling on the remaining counts subject to appellants submission of a supplemental pleading identifying with some specificity the provision or provisions of the contract alleged to have been breached and the manner in which they were breached.
rather than submitting the invited supplemental pleading,however,appellants filed a supplemental brief in opposition to the sunamerica motion to dismiss.appellants cited the policy provision that coi rate changes would be in accordance with any procedures and standards on file with the massachusetts division of insurance,and a state regulation which they maintained had obligated sunamerica to make such a filing as a precondition to selling fpal policies in massachusetts 
each filing for approval of a variable life insurance policy form shall include an actuarial memorandum,prepared and certified by a qualified actuary,in such form as may be described by the commissioner,which contains a description of the company methodology ies sic used to determine reserve liabilities for any guaranteed death benefits and other contingencies,including the mortality,expenses and other risks which the insurer will bear under the policy.
tit,emphasis added.appellants asserted sunamerica breached the insurance policy as modified in the rehabilitation plan by making rate increases that were not in accordance with the coi rate increase filing.sunamerica in turn promptly renewed its motion to dismiss counts,and.
the district court rejected appellants contention that.tit,which deals solely with the insurer calculation of its reserve liabilities,was the regulatory filing contemplated by the fpal policy provision that a ny change in coi rates will be in accordance with any procedures and standards on file with the insurance department of the jurisdiction in which this policy is delivered.the district court generously ordered the produce a copy of any filing it had made with the massachusetts division of insurance anent coi rates changes pursuant to the pertinent policy provision.
sunamerica produced a copy of an actuarial memorandum actuarial memorandum identical to the one that mutual and mbl life would have filed with the massachusetts division of insurance but denied that it contained any procedures and standards relevant to its calculation of coi rates,and accordingly filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining counts of appellants complaint.appellants filed a for summary judgment.
in their opposition to the sunamerica motion,appellants contended that the actuarial memorandum did contain procedures and standards for calculating coi rates.appellants cited,inter alia 
cost of insurance 
the guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates applied in the calculation of cash value under this policy are stated in the contract.the company may use modified cost of insurance rates,applied in a uniform manner to all policies in a class,which produce lower costs of insurance.use of such rates produces higher cash value than those calculated using the guaranteed rates.
actuarial memorandum section.appellants pointed out exhibit i of the actuarial memorandum,which sets forth the algebraic formula for calculating the guaranteed maximum monthly cost of insurance rate for each attained age.they cited section iii of the memorandum,which set forth the policy value formula,and indicated that coi is one of the factors in this formula,t he monthly cost of insurance for the death benefit,which depends on the net amount at risk and which is deducted on the premium processing date.id.section.appellants opposed the sunamerica contention that the actuarial memorandum is irrelevant to coi rate changes 
defendants attempt to avoid this result by arguing that the silverman policy speaks of the change in monthly coi rates and the actuarial memorandum does not.this argument fails,however,because coi,coi rates,annual coi rates,monthly coi rates,and changes to any of the preceding are all algebraically related consequently,any changes to any of the variables described above will affect all of the other variables.
appellants claimed that of the affidavit submitted by gary strunk,the actuary who provided sunamerica with a copy of the actuarial memorandum,confirm ed that the actuarial memorandum contains a calculation of coi.
appellants opposition also asserted,for the first time,that the purchase and sale agreement through which sunamerica had acquired the silverman policy contained a provision which prohibited it from changing the coi rate for the period following its purchase 
modified coi scale.mortality charges may be changed on the policy anniversary beginning months after the rehabilitation period termination date,on may,to scales reflecting the greater of a actual mortality experience and b anticipated mortality experience based on the following formulas.
purchase and sales agreement.appellants accordingly contended that sunamerica annual increases in the coi rates before may,violated the purchase and sale agreement.
finally,appellants raised,once again for the first time,the contention that sunamerica may have violated state regulations if it the policy expressly expectation as to investment earnings in calculating the coi rate changes,since a state regulation does not specify investment earnings as a permissible deduction from the acv of a fpal policy.see.tit,appellants noted that the actuarial memorandum filed with the massachusetts division of insurance does not disclose that sunamerica intended to make any investment earnings deduction.
after oral arguments on the parties,the district court granted summary judgment for sunamerica on the remaining counts of appellants complaint.
discussion 
count breach of implied duty 
appellants contend that the district court erred in granting sunamerica rule b motion to dismiss count,which alleged that sunamerica had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by fraudulently conceal ing that it had made the coi rate increases in violation of the relevant insurance policy terms by misrepresenting to the named plaintiffs and their agents several times between and the present that the rehabilitation plan authorized it to make the coi rate increases whereas the coi rate increases were governed by the insurance policy language in.they argue that the district court erroneously held that sunamerica could not have breached the implied covenant unless it breached an express contractual provision.see,speakman allmerica fin.life,d,a party may breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in every contract without breaching any express term of that contract.
we lack appellate jurisdiction to consider appellants challenge to the district court decision to dismiss count pursuant to rule b.the district court dismissed count on october.appellants notice of appeal specifies that their appeal is taken from the district court order granting summary judgment for defendant entered march exhibit a.emphasis added.notices of appeal must designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.even though notices of appeal are to be liberally construed,if the appellant chooses to designate specific determinations in his notice of than simply appealing from the entire the specified issues may be raised on appeal.constructora andrade gutierrez,am.int l ins,cir noting that t he failure to include a particular issue in a notice of appeal can be fatal to this court jurisdiction over that issue.the notice of appeal plainly did not place sunamerica on adequate notice that appellants were challenging the rule b dismissal six months prior to the grant of summary judgment on the remaining counts of the complaint 
count breach of contract 
appellants next contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for sunamerica on the claim because trialworthy issues of material fact remained as to whether the sunamerica coi rate changes for,and violated the procedures and standards set forth in the actuarial memorandum.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the party,to determine whether there are no genuinely disputed material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as matter of law.commercial union ins.pesante,cir citing.c.should sunamerica make a preliminary showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists,must bear the burden of proof at trial on each element of their breach of contract have to produce specific facts,in suitable evidentiary form,to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.clifford barnhart,cir emphasis added citation omitted.
massachusetts contract law applies in this diversity action.see umsted umsted,cir.in order to state a viable breach of contract claim under massachusetts law,plaintiffs must prove that a valid,binding contract existed,the defendant breached the terms of the contract,and the plaintiffs sustained damages as a result of the breach.see michelson digital fin,cir.plaintiffs also must do more than allege,in conclusory fashion,that the defendant breached the contract,by describing,with substantial certainty,the specific contractual promise the defendant failed to keep.see buck am.airlines,cir in a contract action,this irreducible substantial certainty minimum requires the pleader to explain what obligations were imposed on each of the parties by the alleged contract.citations omitted doyle hasbro,cir holding that c onclusory statements that hasbro and its executives failed to meet their contractual requirement,are insufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements williams astra usa,d.
the record plainly demonstrates that appellants failed to meet the substantial certainty requirement.apparently,appellants suspected that sunamerica miscalculated the coi rates for,and,based solely on the fact that,prior to sunamerica acquisition of the silverman policy in,coi rate increases had been,at most,whereas the rate increases for and had been far greater,and.arguably then,given this unexplained and dramatic differential,appellants may have had a legitimate reason for requesting sunamerica to explain the precise calculation by which it had arrived at the coi rates of and,to request sunamerica to demonstrate what factors enumerated in the policy,sex,age,rate class,earnings,mortality,persistency,expenses,and taxes were encompassed within that calculation,and the value and weight sunamerica assigned to each such factor.presumably,the insurer has exclusive control over the internal documentation of these coi rate calculations,and it is unlikely that a policyholder,unschooled as an insurance actuary,could reasonably be expected to reconstruct or divine the precise algebraic formulae employed by the insurer in making the esoteric calculations.
when they drafted their complaint,therefore,appellants had two options allege that the unexplained and dramatic increases in the coi rates beginning in were circumstantial evidence that sunamerica had miscalculated the rates,perhaps by considering factors other than sex,age,rate class,earnings,mortality,persistency,expenses,and taxes allege that sun america had failed to comply with procedures or standards on file with state regulatory agencies,the massachusetts division of insurance.as noted,appellants did not allege the former,and chose to pursue only the latter allegation upon information and belief,the coi rate increases were not made in accordance with any procedures and standards on file with the insurance department of the jurisdiction in which any of the mutual life block of policies were delivered.emphasis added.this latter information and belief allegation presupposes,however,the very had reason to know what procedures and standards were on file at the division of insurance 
in any event,unlike sunamerica calculations for the coi rates,which presumably were in sunamerica exclusive control,the division of insurance filings were accessible to appellants pursuant to massachusetts public records law.see.laws.ann.ch,providing that any person be permitted to inspect a public record on file with a state agency,and be furnished with a copy for a reasonable fee.had appellants exercised due diligence,they would have had no problem satisfying the district court repeated orders to specify what procedures and standards on file with the division of insurance sunamerica had allegedly violated.if they did not exercise due diligence,their bringing a suit against sunamerica was not based on substantial certainty,doyle,at,but on sheer speculation,both as to whether any relevant procedures and standards were on file at the division of insurance,and more importantly,as to their contents and precisely how sunamerica coi rate calculations had violated them.
the actuarial memorandum 
confronted with their ruinous pleading defect,appellants have recover some procedural footing when sunamerica complied with the district court order to produce the actuarial memorandum,it proved not to be the smoking gun appellants might have anticipated,but an irrelevancy.section of the memorandum,entitled cost of insurance,deals only with how sunamerica would calculate t he guaranteed maximum cost of insurance rates applied in the calculation of cash value under this policy,and noted that these guaranteed maximum coi rates were stated in the policy.emphasis added.section thus pertains to how sunamerica arrived at the cap coi rates of,and for years,and,and had no necessary application to how it calculated the actual coi rates of,and.exhibit i of the actuarial memorandum likewise includes the algebraic formula sunamerica used to calculate the guaranteed maximum monthly cost of insurance rate for each attained age,not the actual coi rate.emphasis added.appellants do not allege that sunamerica miscalculated the maximum coi rates of,and.
section iii of the actuarial memorandum,entitled policy value formula,demonstrates the formula by which sunamerica would calculate the policy acv.the coi rate concededly is one variable in that acv calculation along with,interest earned,the monthly expense charge and any cash withdrawals or loans to the policyholder because the coi rate is one enumerated monthly deduction from the policy acv,but this can not inform as to how the coi rate is calculated.in other words,although the formula x may tell us how to calculate the value of x,the acv,it tells us nothing useful about how to calculate the value of z,the coi rate in the first instance.instead,section iii provides only,in the most general terms,that the coi calculation depends on the net amount at risk.emphasis added.
in response,appellants simply advance the conclusory argument that coi,coi rates,annual coi rates,monthly coi rates are all algebraically related so that any changes to any of the variable will affect all of the other variables.not surprisingly,however,they make no attempt to illustrate their theory.appellants give one example t he monthly cost of insurance is just the annual cost of insurance divided by months.this simplistic example proves nothing.in the formula x,the larger the value assigned to z,the coi rate,the smaller the amount of x,acv will be and vice versa,but that arithmetic truism still does not inform us how to calculate the value for thus,the arithmetic interrelationship appellants posit is real,but irrelevant.thus,the district court properly found that the actuarial memorandum did not create a trialworthy issue of fact.
the purchase and sale agreement 
appellants also contend for the first time,in opposition to sunamerica summary judgment motion,that the purchase and sale agreement through which sunamerica had acquired the silverman policy contained a provision,entitled modified coi scale,which provided that m ortality charges may be changed on the policy anniversary beginning months after the rehabilitation period termination date,on may,purchase and sales agreement,and that sunamerica had violated this provision by increasing coi rates in,and.sunamerica responds that the terms coi scale and coi rate are not equivalent,and that it did not increase the coi scale before may,
t he plaintiff confuses the scale with the rate.the scale is,if you think of it as a staircase,we agree to keep the staircase in place of what it was costing for a thousand dollars of insurance,but in a variable life policy,or the whole life policy,you go up the stairs as you grow older and the cost of insurance increases.
whatever vagueness one arguably might perceive in sunamerica explanation of the distinction between mortality charges and coi rates,it is sufficient to note that it was incumbent on appellants,as the parties with the ultimate burden to prove breach of contract at trial,to adduce specific facts,in suitable evidentiary form,to establish the presence of a trialworthy issue.clifford,at.for example,appellants might have adduced an affidavit from an insurance actuary attesting to the essential equivalence between the terms mortality charges and coi rates.indeed,the district court expressly noted that,if appellants could prove that,within the period,sunamerica had changed the mortality tables,that would constitute a breach.on appeal,however,appellants make no such attempt,merely reiterating instead that sunamerica breached by raising its coi rates from.
expectations of investment earnings 
appellants raised,again for the first time in their reply opposition to sunamerica summary judgment motion,the contention that sunamerica may have violated.tit,see supra note,when it considered its expectation as to investment earnings in calculating the coi rate c
