opinion of the court 
in february highlands insurance company,highlands issued a policy to olympic limousine,olympic that provided olympic with commercial automobile insurance coverage,subject to a million aggregate annual deductible as to which olympic was effectively.before the policy was cancelled by highlands just seven months later,highlands found itself responsible for handling in excess of million in claims against olympic.unfortunately for highlands,olympic never paid the million deductible on those claims.even more unfortunately for highlands,olympic had also failed to pay the premium required to button up a surety arrangement that would have protected highlands against such nonpayment.
in response to those events,highlands filed a federal court diversity action against a slew of defendants,including hobbs group,llc hobbs,the insurance broker that had arranged for the underlying liability insurance policy between highlands and olympic and had also dealt with highlands in the course of the surety bond procurement process and global risk management services,global,the surety bond broker that had worked with hobbs and with proposed surety frontier insurance frontier.eventually highlands action was whittled down to three of negligent misrepresentation and negligence against hobbs and a claim of negligence against global.both hobbs and global then moved for summary judgment pursuant to.rule.after full briefing,the district court concluded that under new jersey law neither hobbs nor global owed any duty to highlands,and it therefore granted summary judgment dismissing all three claims.
highlands now appeals those rulings,and we have jurisdiction under.we hold that under new jersey law hobbs did owe a duty to highlands that rendered the latter negligence claims viable,so we reverse and remand for a trial on those claims.but we find that the district court was correct in holding that no such duty ran from global to highlands,and we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of global as a defendant.
olympic was a limousine and livery service that operated in and around manhattan.it sought out hobbs in late to act as its insurance broker in securing a new commercial automobile insurance policy to take over when olympic old policy expired in early.hobbs in turn got in touch with highlands and the parties began to discuss terms for potential coverage.after much negotiation highlands and olympic through hobbs agreed on a policy that included the following relevant provisions 
highlands would initially process and pay for claims against olympic.each month highlands would then invoice olympic for the claims it had paid and olympic would reimburse highlands,subject to a loss deductible per vehicle million coverage per vehicle rate.but under no circumstances would olympic annual reimbursement obligation to highlands exceed million.
olympic would secure a surety bond with highlands as the obligee in the amount of olympic million aggregate annual deductible 
with the expiration date of olympic existing policy approaching rapidly,hobbs communicated with global to see if it would be interested in procuring the surety bond that highlands required under its policy with olympic.global was indeed interested.working as an agent for frontier,global locked in frontier as the expected surety for olympic deductible and relayed that commitment back to hobbs.although it had already agreed to be olympic surety,frontier expressly conditioned the issuance of the actual surety bond on two events several parties were required to sign indemnification agreements,and olympic had to pay the first year premium of.
on february,the insurance policy between olympic and highlands took effect,and highlands dutifully began to pay out on olympic claims as they accrued.but although highlands then invoiced olympic for the reimbursements that olympic owed highlands under the terms of the policy,olympic did not honor its reimbursement obligation.
for a variety of reasons including highlands realization that it had exposed itself to a far greater risk than it had originally anticipated,as well as other legal compliance issues with its policy,highlands began efforts to cancel the policy with olympic as early as april.it nonetheless remained responsible for claims against olympic until september,when the cancellation took effect.
but neither hobbs nor global ever informed highlands that even though global had prepared the surety bond on frontier behalf,the bond was never executed and was ultimately cancelled flat because of olympic failure to pay the premium on the bond.highlands was completely unaware until well after it began the cancellation process with olympic that it was not protected,as the obligee under the surety bond,from the huge loss that resulted from olympic nonpayment.and it is that failure to inform that highlands asserts gives rise to hobbs and global liability.

new jersey rules of decision 
as always in diversity cases,a federal court must apply the substantive law of the forum where the state highest court has not spoken definitively on a particular issue,the federal court must make an informed prediction as to how the highest state court would decide the issue erie tompkins.clark modern group,cir.to that end the federal court may consider a wide range of reliable sources,including relevant state precedents,analogous decisions and reasoned dicta,as well as the policies and doctrinal trends informing and emerging from those decisions scotts african union methodist protestant church conference of african union first colored methodist protestant church,cir.but the court must also be mindful not to expand state law in ways not foreshadowed by state precedent city of philadelphia beretta,cir.
in new jersey as in all other jurisdictions any tort of negligence requires the plaintiff to prove that the putative tortfeasor breached a duty of care owed to plaintiff and that plaintiff suffered damages proximately caused by that breach weinberg dinger.in particular,under new jersey law negligent misrepresentation requires a showing that defendant negligently provided false information and that plaintiff incurred damages proximately caused by its reliance on that information karu feldman.in that respect a defendant may be liable because it owes a duty to any reasonably foreseeable recipient who relies on the information id.
for highlands to prevail on any of its claims,then,it must first show that the defendant being considered owed it a relevant duty of care.that determination is quintessentially a question of law for the court city check cashing,mfrs.hanover tr.
because the new jersey supreme court has not squarely addressed whether a surety bond broker owes a duty to the obligee of that bond,under erie principles we must predict whether that court would recognize such a duty under the circumstances presented here.in that respect the district court determined as a matter of law that highlands claims of negligent misrepresentation against hobbs and of negligence against hobbs and global could never succeed because new jersey does not impose a duty of care on either party with respect to highlands.we review that prediction and application of new jersey tort law de novo clark,at.
highlands relies primarily on carter,emar group,to argue that both hobbs and global owed a duty to highlands.it is conventional wisdom that an insurance broker must act with reasonable skill and diligence in performing the services of a broker with respect to its insured id.at.lapses in that duty that can give rise to liability include,but are not limited to,either failing completely to arrange for an insurance policy or delivering a policy that is void,materially deficient or otherwise does not provide the coverage the broker agreed to procure glezerman columbian mut.life ins,cir.carter,at emphasizes that although the relationship between an insured and its broker is most often contractual in nature,claims by an insured against its broker are not based on a privity relationship but are premised on the tort concept of negligence in failing to procure the appropriate coverage.that concept is fundamental to one of carter central holdings the principle that the broker duty owed to insured parties is also owed to other loss payees who although not in privity with the broker are within the zone of harm emanating from its activities id.at.
carter,id.at identifies two key elements that should guide courts in delineating the boundaries of that zone of harm foreseeability and fairness.foreseeability takes into account the relationship between the plaintiff and the broker,the nature of the risk and the defendant ability and opportunity to exercise care and avert harm id.at.and the fairness aspect requires a court to make a value judgment as to whether establishing a broker duty in relationship to a particular plaintiff is fair based on policy considerations and the public interest id.after analyzing those two aspects under the circumstances at issue there,carter,id.at ultimately held that the insurance broker in that case did owe a duty to the loss payee of the insurance policy that the broker had negligently procured for its insured.
whether the broker duty in the insurance context translates to the surety context before us requires that we consider in the first instance whether surety relationships are equivalent to insurance relationships under new jersey law.there are certainly many similarities between the two.like insurance relationships,surety relationships have three central principal obligor,the insured or obligee of the surety bond and the insurer or surety in re liquidation of integrity ins,aff.
indeed,in many contexts new jersey explicitly equates surety bonds with insurance polices.for example,a new jersey insurance rates statute expressly defines policy of insurance to include surety bonds.e.and in the liquidation of an insurance corporation,the claims of surety bondholders are accorded priority together with insurance policyholders claims in re liquidation of integrity ins.new jersey courts have also stated more generally that because it is long settled in new jersey that surety is insurance,surety bondholders are equivalent to insurance policyholders aetna cas.sur.int l,eq.
to be sure,in the case at bar hobbs was an insurance broker for olympic and procured a policy from highlands.as between those two companies olympic was the insured and highlands was the insurer.but the critical coverage for purposes of the current lawsuit is that provided or,more accurately,not provided by the surety that coverage was intended to serve highlands benefit.from that perspective olympic was to be the principal obligor,frontier was to be the surety the insurer in the surety context and highlands was to be the obligee of the surety bond the insured in the surety context.
hobbs and global staunchly maintain that even if a surety relationship equates to an insurance relationship,the carter duty was never intended to protect insurers such as highlands.but that mistakes mere form the insurance company label for substance in the context at issue in this case,highlands is not an insurer qua insurer.instead what is relevant is that highlands is an obligee on a surety bond,even though it also happens to be in the insurance business generally.
as highlands would have it,our inquiry should end with the conclusion that the carter duty extends to all surety bond brokers and issuers,so that hobbs and global necessarily owed a duty to highlands as the obligee on the surety bond.but we must of course proceed with caution when wading into the predictive erie waters,and the new jersey courts avoid treating questions of duty in a conclusory fashion.both of those things being true,we proceed beyond our determinations that new jersey law draws strong parallels between insurance policies generally and surety bonds specifically and that highlands is exactly the type of that is entitled to look to the carter analysis as a basis for determining the existence of a duty weinberg,at.instead we must proceed with the same type of analysis that the new jersey supreme court carried out in carter in evaluating the existence or nonexistence of a duty to third parties such as highlands.and for that purpose,of course,we consider hobbs and global separately.
in terms of foreseeability,the propriety of recognizing a duty of care owed by hobbs to highlands is obvious.for one thing,the technical relationship between hobbs and olympic in no way vitiates the impact of the close working relationship between hobbs and highlands in the transaction at issue,as evidenced by the nature and volume of the communications between them weinisch sawyer.next as to the nature of the risk,by definition the absence of protection for highlands in the event of olympic default is precisely the peril that would necessarily follow from the failure to have obtained the surety bond on which highlands was to be the obligee.and finally,our determination that highlands was within hobbs zone of harm is significantly influenced by the fact that hobbs had both abundant opportunities and ample ability to advise highlands that it was mistaken in its belief an entirely reasonable one that it was protected by a surety bond with frontier,a lack of protection that stemmed from olympic nonpayment of the premium on the bond carter,at.
much of highlands correspondence with hobbs clearly shows that it was under the impression that the process of securing the surety bond was progressing without a hitch.most notably,an april,from highlands to hobbs reporting on the transaction said in part we have the bond in place,an explicit communication to hobbs of highlands belief that olympic surety bond was in effect.hobbs had numerous communications with highlands after that april about a variety of other matters,but not once did hobbs mention to highlands that olympic had not paid the premium needed to cement frontier surety bond obligation 
indeed,the multiple requests for payment running from hobbs to olympic show unequivocally that throughout the course of its communications with highlands hobbs was fully aware that olympic had not paid the premium on the surety bond and that frontier would not issue the bond until that premium was paid.yet hobbs did not even make the effort to notify highlands of olympic delay in paying the premium by copying highlands on any of those communications.
at every step of the way hobbs had both the opportunity and the ability to advise highlands that it was not protected by any surety bond because olympic had not paid the premium.and its ongoing total silence invited highlands to rely on hobbs conduct that otherwise suggested the surety bond placement process had been completed as planned.without doubt highlands fell squarely within the foreseeable zone of harm from hobbs conduct president jenkins.
with foreseeability thus firmly established,we turn to the fairness branch of the carter analysis.in that regard we next look to new jersey public policy to forecast whether the new jersey supreme court would find it in the public interest to create that duty at.we conclude that it would.
that court tradition of holding insurance professionals to high standards of care confirms its strong public policy focus on protecting parties who deal with such professionals aden fortsh.true enough,highlands own involvement in the insurance industry,rather than its being a general member of the public as was involved in carter,may cut against the imposition of an actual fiduciary responsibility on hobbs part highlands see aden,at.but that does not at all control the fairness concerns at issue here,as hobbs merely calls for the e
