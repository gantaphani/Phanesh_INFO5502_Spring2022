plaintiff first aid services of san diego,first aid appeals a judgment of dismissal entered in favor of defendants california employment development department edd and california unemployment insurance appeals board board together the state after the court issued an order sustaining without leave to amend the state demurrer to first aid amended petition for a writ of administrative mandamus amended petition,which challenged the board decision that tiffany whittaker was an employee of first aid,rather than an independent contractor,and thus eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits referencing the california constitution and citing unemployment insurance code section and modern barber cal.emp.stab.com.cal d,modern barber colleges,the court found that the writ of administrative mandamus proceeding was barred because the purpose of the writ sought in first aid amended petition would be to restrain the collection of a tax.
first aid contends that the rule in modern barber colleges does not apply because the relief that first aid sought in its amended petition was not to contravene the collection of a tax that first aid had been ordered to pay,but to review the administrative determination that whittaker is an employee of first aid modern barber colleges is not applicable because it is no longer valid law the state interpretation of section of article xiii is erroneous and the state is precluded from raising the decision in modern barber colleges as a defense in this case because it failed to raise it as a defense in southwest research institute unemployment ins.appeals bd.th,d southwest research institute.
for reasons we shall explain,we hold that modern barber colleges,supra,cal d,is still valid and,together with section of article xiii and unemployment insurance code section,bars first aid writ of administrative mandamus challenge to the board determination that whittaker is an employee of first aid for unemployment compensation purposes.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual background 
first aid operates in the same fashion as a nurse registry it sends emergency medical technicians emt and registered nurses rn to operate emergency or first aid stations at various public events.typically,first aid receives a request from a client that an event will be held and a health care professional is needed to provide first aid services.the client determines the type of professional that is needed,how many are needed,the hours they must work,and the type of uniform,if any,they should wear.first aid then contacts the various licensed emt and rn listed in its books to find professionals who wish to provide the requested service.the professionals determine the type of equipment they will provide and use at the event.
whittaker is a licensed emt who was employed by an ambulance service as an emt and who also accepted assignments through first aid to work as an emt to supplement her income.she became listed with first aid when she entered into a written contract with that company in march.
procedural background 
in december whittaker filed a claim for unemployment benefits with the edd.first aid is informed and believes that whittaker listed both first aid and the ambulance service as her employers.first aid objected to the claim on the ground whittaker had never been an employee of first aid.
edd determined that whittaker was an employee of first aid and found that she had not refused suitable offers of employment without good cause and thus was not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.first aid administratively appealed,contending whittaker had refused offers of suitable employment without good cause.
in may a hearing was held before an administrative law judge the alj on first aid appeal first aid,represented by counsel,presented one witness whittaker did not appear and no evidence was presented on her behalf.the alj determined that whittaker was an employee of first aid,but reversed edd determination that whittaker was not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits.the alj found that first aid provided credible evidence that whittaker refused suitable offers of employment without good cause,and thus whittaker was indefinitely disqualified under section,subdivision b until she again makes herself available to suitable employment.
first aid appealed the alj decision to the board,which independently reviewed the administrative record.in september the board issued its decision affirming the alj decision and finding that whittaker is not ineligible for unemployment insurance benefits under section,subdivision a based on a finding that whittaker is an employee 
first aid filed its amended petition in the superior court under code of civil procedure section,seeking reversal of the board finding that whittaker was an employee of first aid and claiming the board decision was not supported by fact or law.the state challenged the amended petition by filing a demurrer on the grounds the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and thus the writ of administrative mandamus proceeding was barred by the california constitution art.xiii,by statute,and by the decision in modern barber colleges,supra,cal d.
on february,the court sustained the state demurrer without leave to amend,finding that the purpose of the writ sought in first aid amended petition would be to restrain the collection of a tax,and thus the writ of administrative mandamus proceeding was barred by the california constitution and section.in support of its decision,the court also found that this case is substantially similar to modern barber colleges,supra,cal d.first aid appeal followed.
standard of review 
the standard of review on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend is well established.the function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the pleading as a matter of law,and it raises only a question of law.citations.on a question of law,we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal.holiday matinee,rambus,th,d.

discussion 
the central issue we must decide is whether the court,in sustaining without leave to amend the state demurrer to first aid amended petition,erred in finding that the writ of administrative mandamus proceeding first aid commenced to challenge the board decision that whittaker is an employee of first aid for purposes of the unemployment insurance code,is barred by the california constitution art.xiii,statute section,and the holding of modern barber colleges,supra,cal d.we conclude the court did not err.
