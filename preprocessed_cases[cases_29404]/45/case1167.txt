in this pro se appeal,the plaintiff rosalyn caffey challenges a number of rulings by the district court in her suit to recover disability benefits under an employee welfare plan.the defendant unum life insurance company unum,which administers claims for the plaintiff disability insurance plan,initially denied caffey disability claim.caffey filed suit against unum under the employee retirement income security act erisa to compel payment of benefits.the district court granted summary judgment to unum,but the sixth circuit reversed.on remand,the district court granted summary judgment to caffey on her claim to recover benefits.on appeal,caffey argues that the district court erred in ruling that her claims were preempted by erisa that the district court erred in finding that she was not entitled to certain equitable relief that the district court erred in failing to impose a statutory penalty for unum failure to supply certain plan information on request that the district court erred in its calculation of prejudgment interest that the district court erred in declining to award postjudgment interest on its award of legal fees and prejudgment interest that the district court findings of fact concerning unum bad faith were in error and that the district court omitted one month payment of disability benefits in calculating its award.after reviewing the briefs and the record of the proceedings below,we determine that the district court erred only in failing to order payment of postjudgment interest on its prejudgment interest and attorney fees awards.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand to the district court solely for the purpose of entering an appropriate award for postjudgment interest.
facts and procedure 
factual background 
the facts giving rise to the instant dispute are fully set forth in a prior opinion of this court,caffey unum life ins,wl cir.the relevant facts are summarized below.
caffey worked as a financial analyst for the mansur financial group,mansur from september,until june.as a mansur employee,caffey participated in the company disability benefits plan the plan.unum was responsible for claims administration under the plan.the plan contained a provision excluding benefits for certain conditions.the conditions provision stated 
this policy will not cover any disability 
caused by,contributed to by,or resulting from a condition and 
which begins in the first months after an insured effective date.
a condition means a sickness or injury for which the insured received medical treatment,consultation,care or services,including diagnostic measures,or had taken prescribed drugs or medicines in the three months prior to the insured effective date.
caffey effective date,after which she was eligible for benefits under the plan,was october.caffey applied for disability benefits on july,citing severe headaches and vision problems.unum reviewed caffey medical records and discovered that caffey had received treatment for similar symptoms on august.in fact,caffey medical records revealed that she had been receiving treatment for headaches and visual anomalies for many years.physicians who examined caffey at the time of her initial claim,including valerie purvin,believed that caffey symptoms were attributable to her history of migraine.caffey,wl,at.
caffey condition failed to improve and she began to experience new symptoms such as memory loss and motion sickness.on march,caffey was diagnosed with lupus erythematosus on the basis of a positive test for a dna antibody characteristic of the disease.based upon this new information,purvin reassessed her previous determination that caffey symptoms were due to migraine,and wrote a letter stating that the headaches for which caffey was treated in july and august of must have been a manifestation of her lupus rather than a of her previous migraine.purvin letter,august.jose tord,another physician who treated caffey,also wrote a letter distinguishing caffey previous history of migraine from the onset of lupus in june of.
a unum staff physician reviewed caffey medical history and determined that her lupus was a condition,because the migraines and visual anomalies experienced in the summer of were identical to symptoms reported in august of.accordingly,unum denied caffey request for benefits in a letter dated may.caffey appealed unum decision.caffey supplied unum with letters from tord and purvin,which fixed the onset of lupus in the summer of.after additional review of caffey medical records,unum staff physician concluded that the diagnosis of lupus was incorrect and alternatively,if caffey did have lupus,that it was impossible to determine retroactively the date of onset of the disease to be in the summer of.
procedural history 
following unum denial of benefits,caffey filed suit in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee on june.caffey filed an amended complaint on january,alleging thirteen claims for relief.the claims are summarized as follows 
count one sought recovery of disability benefits under erisa.
count two alleged breach of fiduciary duties under erisa,violations of indiana state insurance law,and fraud arising from unum processing of her benefits claim.
count three alleged that unum failed to comply with plaintiff requests for plan information in violation of b.
count sought to remove unum as fiduciary of the plan pursuant to a.
count six claimed that unum should be equitably estopped from offsetting any recovery by the amount of social security payments received by plaintiff.
count seven sought an injunction requiring unum to pay disability benefits in full.
count eight sought prejudgment interest on all past due disability benefits.
count nine sought payment of legal fees.
count ten asserted a claim for damages for vexation,seeking recovery of certain money damages under erisa,g,and indiana state law.
counts eleven through fourteen asserted various claims arising under common law doctrines of fraud,bad faith,negligence,and duress arising from unum handling of plaintiff benefits claim.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court ruled in favor of unum.the court found that caffey various claims were preempted by erisa.the district court then determined that plaintiff could not show that her lupus was not a condition within the meaning of the plan.caffey filed a pro se appeal.
we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment to unum.caffey,wl,at.we noted that the district court improperly placed the burden of proof on caffey,whereas erisa places the burden of proving an exclusion from coverage in an welfare plan on the plan administrator.id.we further concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the similarity between the symptoms reported by caffey in august and those reported in the summer of established that caffey lupus was a condition.we explained 
such facts include evidence that caffey functioned ably with her migraine for more than twenty years prior to the summer of,when her headaches and visual problems so affected her that she was unable to work.simultaneously,she began to experience unusual symptoms,such as motion sickness and memory loss.in explaining the nature of her condition,letters from two of caffey treating physicians support the argument that caffey suffered from two distinct illnesses and that one of her maladies,lupus,did not set in until the summer of.
id.we remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings.
after the remand,unum requested that the district court remand to the plan administrator for reconsideration of caffey claim.the district court granted this motion.upon reconsideration,unum determined that caffey was eligible for disability benefits and was not barred by the condition provision of the plan.accordingly,unum mailed plaintiff three checks totaling,which represented unum determination of the total amount of disability benefits for the period beginning july,and ending january,reduced by the total amount of social security benefits received by caffey during that period.unum began making regular monthly disability payments to the plaintiff at that time.
caffey subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment in the district court requesting that the court enter judgment on the claims asserted in her amended complaint.in an order dated march,the district court granted plaintiff motion in part and denied it in part.the court concluded that plaintiff claims and breach of fiduciary duty claims were preempted by erisa in addition,the court rejected plaintiff claims for compensatory and punitive damages on the ground that the type of relief requested is not available under erisa.the court reserved its ruling as to plaintiff claim that unum failed to disclose plan information on request,and instructed the plaintiff to prepare a list of all documents allegedly withheld.the court also granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on her claim for benefits under the plan.the court concluded that no facts in the record showed that caffey had received treatment for lupus prior to the summer of.the court therefore found that the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the condition issue.finally,the court awarded caffey prejudgment interest and legal fees,but reserved the question of postjudgment interest pending a showing of a substantial delay between entry of judgment and payment to the plaintiff.
subsequently,the district court considered a series of motions to modify and amend its march,order.a number of these motions were addressed in an order dated june.in that order,the district court granted unum request to use a blended interest rate,based upon the method set forth in,in calculating its prejudgment interest award.based upon this method,the court awarded plaintiff in prejudgment interest.the court also considered plaintiff claim for penalties based upon unum violation of the disclosure requirements of b,as well as plaintiff renewed request for certain equitable,compensatory,and punitive relief.the court dismissed plaintiff b claim on the grounds that caffey had failed to submit a list of the documents that were not disclosed within the time frame established by the court.assuming it could consider plaintiff list of documents,the court found the plaintiff had not presented the court with any evidence that she had made a written request for the information to the plan administrator,as required by b.the court likewise denied plaintiff request for additional equitable relief on the grounds that it found no evidence of bad faith on unum part in initially denying plaintiff claim.finally,the court awarded plaintiff legal expenses and costs totaling.
in response to further motions to amend,the court entered an additional order on september.in that order,the court endorsed the method of calculating prejudgment interest proposed by the defendant and accordingly reduced its original award of prejudgment interest to.the court also denied plaintiff request for postjudgment interest on the court award of legal expenses.the court noted that defendant had provided plaintiff with a check for the full amount awarded prior to its june,order,but plaintiff had misplaced the check.finding no evidence that unum had acted in bad faith or intentionally delayed issuance of a replacement check,the court concluded that postjudgment interest was not warranted.
in its final order,entered on november,the court denied plaintiff additional motions to reconsider,finding that these motions had been addressed in previous orders.the plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
state law preemption 
caffey disputes the district court ruling that erisa preempts various aspects of indiana insurance law,including the tort of bad faith by an insurer.erisa preemption clause states that the act shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.a.the supreme court has interpreted this clause to preempt causes of action that would allow employee benefit plan beneficiaries to obtain remedies under state law that congress rejected in erisa.pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.such an interpretation is necessary,the court has instructed,to give effect to congress intent that the civil enforcement provisions of erisa a be the exclusive vehicle for actions by participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits.id.at.we have recognized the broad sweep of erisa preemption provision in relation to causes of action based upon an improper denial of benefits,noting that virtually all state law claims relating to an employee benefit plan are preempted by erisa.cromwell hca,cir.
based upon the foregoing principles,we agree with the district court conclusion that plaintiff claims are preempted by erisa.all of plaintiff claims stem from the actions of unum in the processing of her claim for benefits.it is well established that such tort and contract claims are preempted by erisa.see pilot life ins,at.claim preempted tolton american biodyne,cir finding claims for wrongful death,improper denial of benefits,medical malpractice,and insurance bad faith were preempted because defendants were determining what benefits were available to tolton under the plan cromwell,at holding claims of promissory estoppel,breach of contract,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of good faith based on denial of benefits are at the very heart of issues within the scope of erisa exclusive regulation.in its most recent pronouncement on the subject,the supreme court again confirmed that any state law provid ing a form of ultimate relief in a judicial forum that add s to the judicial remedies provided by erisa patently violates erisa policy of inducing employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities,under uniform standards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and awards when a violation has occurred.rush prudential hmo,moran,d.indisputably,plaintiffs tort and contract claims seek judicial remedies for unum failure to abide by the terms of the plan beyond what is provided in erisa.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of caffey claims.
caffey also makes a more limited claim in relation to the district court preemption rulings.she asks this court to hold that erisa does not preempt indiana decisions interpreting condition clauses in insurance contracts.see modern woodmen miles,indiana comprehensive health ins.ass dye.these decisions hold that treatment of a symptom,such as a headache,is not the same as diagnosis of a specific condition for the purposes of establishing a condition.the district court reached the same legal conclusion in its interpretation of the condition clause in the plan.at march,order at t he court concludes that plaintiff could not have received treatment,consultation,care,services,or diagnostic measures for a sickness or injury unless there was some awareness that this actual sickness or injury existed.given that the district court,applying principles,reached the same conclusion that it would have reached had it applied indiana state law,we see no basis for caffey objection.to the extent that caffey is arguing that the district court was bound to follow indiana state law in interpreting the plan,she is incorrect.federal rules of contract interpretation,not principles,guide our interpretation of employee welfare plans governed by erisa.perez aetna life ins,cir en banc.
equitable relief 
caffey appeals the district court denial of a number of claims for what she terms as equitable relief,including reinstatement of her health and life insurance benefits.caffey asserts these claims under a,which authorizes appropriate equitable relief i to redress violations or ii to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.caffey contends that restitution as part of equitable relief is not by erisa as it is not punitive or compensatory damages.reply br.at.therefore,caffey argues,unum should have been ordered to provide caffey with insurance and life since it was its of disability benefits which caused caffey to lose her health and life insurance benefits.reply br.at.
erisa does not permit recovery for the kind of losses asserted by caffey.caffey claim is based upon the consequential losses she experienced as a result of unum failure to perform under the plan.she asserts that she should be compensated for her lost health and life insurance benefits,because it was unum denial of disability insurance benefits that caused her to be unable to make the necessary premium payments on her other policies.much as we sympathize with caffey plight,such claims are not within the scope of appropriate equitable relief under a.see mertens hewitt,d.in mertens,the supreme court held that the term equitable relief in a refers only to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity such as injunction,mandamus,and restitution,but not compensatory damages.id.at.mertens made clear that compensatory and punitive damages are not considered equitable relief for the purposes of a.id.at.although the mertens court did conclude that equitable relief included restitution,the supreme court has recently explained that only traditionally equitable restitutionary remedies are available under this section.life annuity ins.knudson,d.in order to give the term equitable relief meaning,the court explained,courts must limit restitution to the return of identifiable funds or property belonging to the plaintiff and held by the is,limit restitution to the form of restitution traditionally available in equity.see also helfrich pnc bank,cir,cert.denied,d.plaintiff claim for restoration of her lost health and life insurance benefits does not fall within this narrow category of relief.we therefore affirm the district court denial of caffey claims for equitable relief.
statutory penalties for failure to provide summary plan description 
caffey next appeals the district court denial of statutory penalties under c for unum alleged failure to provide her with a summary plan description and other documents.section c provides for penalties of up to per day,at the discretion of the district court,for a plan administrator failure or refusal to comply with a request for any information which such administrator is required by this subchapter to furnish to a participant or beneficiary within days after such request.because the statute expressly grants a district court discretion in imposing penalties for an employer failure to disclose,we review only for abuse of discretion.bartling fruehauf,cir.
plaintiff claims that unum failed to provide her a summary plan description in violation of b,which provides that 
t he administrator shall,upon written request of any participant or beneficiary,furnish a copy of the latest updated summary plan description,and the latest annual report,any terminal report,the bargaining agreement,trust agreement,contract,or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated.
the district court denied plaintiff claim for statutory penalties,because plaintiff failed to provide a list of documents that she had not been provided within twenty days of the march,order as required by the district court,and because plaintiff had not shown any evidence that she made a written request to the plan administrator for such documents as required by b.in connection with the latter observation,the court noted that plaintiff had provided no citation to a docket number or exhibit entry number to assist the court in locating any such written request in the voluminous and highly disorganized record for the plaintiff suit.plaintiff argues that,as a pro se litigant,the district court should have given plaintiff the opportunity to locate proof of a written request in the record before dismissing her claim on the basis that she failed to cite a docket number.in her reply brief,plaintiff does attach a copy of an unsigned letter dated april,which appears to be from plaintiff former counsel,requesting a copy of the summary plan description from unum.
it is well established that only plan administrators are liable for statutory penalties under c.see hiney printing brantner,cir vanderklok provident life accident ins,cir.thus,we have held that an insurance company,which is not a plan administrator,can not be liable for statutory damages for failure to comply with an information request.vanderklok,at.the definition of plan administrator in erisa provides that the plan administrator is the plan sponsor unless otherwise specified in the plan.a ii.where,as is the case here,an employee benefit plan is maintained by a single employer,the plan sponsor is deemed to be the employer.see b i.in the instant case,the plan does not designate a plan administrator.therefore,erisa default provision dictates that mansur,not unum,is the plan administrator.see moran aetna life ins,cir holding that insurance company was not plan administrator for purposes of c liability where plan did not identify an administrator,leaving employer as administrator under erisa default provision.consequently,even if caffey could show that unum failed to respond to written requests for a summary plan description,unum would not be liable for statutory damages under c.we therefore affirm the district court refusal to award statutory damages.
prejudgment interest 
caffey disputes the district court calculation of prejudgment interest.although erisa does not mandate the award of prejudgment interest to prevailing plan participants,we have long recognized that the district court may do so at its discretion in accordance with general equitable principles.ford uniroyal pension plan,cir.a district court calculation of prejudgment interest is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion.id.at.
in her briefs,caffey disclaims any objection to the district court use of a blended rate of interest,which averaged the united states treasury bill interest rate over the relevant time period instead,caffey claims that the district court refused to correct a math error in its prejudgment interest calculation.caffey does not specify the nature of the math error in her briefs.it appears,however,that plaintiff objection relates to the district court denial of her motion for reconsideration of the court june,order,in which she alleged that the court calculation of prejudgment interest was short.plaintiff appears to have arrived at this conclusion by using an interest rate of to calculate the annual interest amount.although the district court showed that it used a rate of in a summary of its interest calculations attached to its september,order,the court actually determined the interest rate to be.using this interest rate,the district court calculations are correct.it appears that the district court simply rounded the rate to on its summary,but actually used in making its calculations.we therefore find caffey objection to be without merit.
to the extent that the plaintiff objects to the district court use of a model to calculate prejudgment interest,we affirm the decision of the district court.the model calculated the interest due on each monthly payment of disability benefits beginning with the date that each payment was due.caffey apparently advocated a simple interest model,which would calculate interest on the total amount of past due benefits beginning in august.as unum correctly observes,this model assumes that the entire amount of benefits due for the period from july,to january,was due in august.this assumption is incorrect,since caffey was owed only one month disability benefit in august.thus,caffey model would overcompensate her for the delayed payment by awarding interest on individual benefit payments before they were due.see id.at a n excessive prejudgment interest rate would overcompensate an erisa plaintiff,thereby transforming the award of prejudgment interest from a compensatory damage award to a punitive one in contravention of erisa remedial goal.thus,the district court use of a model was not an abuse of discretion.
postjudgment interest 
caffey next appeals the district court denial of postjudgment interest on the court award of legal expenses and prejudgment interest.under,district courts are required to award postjudgment interest.the statute provides that s uch interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment,and shall be computed daily to the date of payment.a,b.the statute mandates the imposition of interest,thus removing the award of such interest from the discretion of the district court.bricklayers pension trust fund taiariol,cir.the federal postjudgment interest statute allows interest on all money judgments,including those in erisa cases.hoover provident life accident ins,cir.
we hold that plaintiff is entitled to postjudgment interest on the district court award of prejudgment interest.the plaintiff requested such relief in her motion to the district court for postjudgment interest,although the district court did not address this claim in its september,order.a number of courts have held that postjudgment interest should be awarded on the entire amount of the judgment,including any prejudgment interest.quesinberry life ins.of,cir en banc bancamerica commercial mosher steel of,cir air separation,underwriters at lloyd of london,cir ins.of am.lexow,cir.we agree with this approach.as the supreme court has explained,t he purpose of postjudgment interest is to compensate the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant.kaiser aluminum chem.bonjorno,d quotation omitted.prejudgment interest is part of the underlying damage award and u nder,postjudgment interest should be awarded on the entire amount of the judgment.quesinberry,at.moreover,failure to award postjudgment interest on the prejudgment interest element of the damages award would require the plaintiff to bear the cost of the lost time value of her award resulting from the defendant delay in remitting payment.air separation,at.defendants would have a strong incentive to delay payment of prejudgment interest as long as possible,since they would be able to enjoy the benefit of continued use of the funds during any period of delay,and would bear a lesser financial burden once payment was ultimately made.
unum argues that any delay between judgment and payment of the prejudgment interest award was de minimis,because a check for the full amount of prejudgment interest was mailed to plaintiff approximately two weeks after the court september,order finally determining the amount of the prejudgment interest award we find unum argument to be without merit because unum incorrectly assumes that postjudgment interest did not begin to accrue until the district court september,order.application of our precedents instead dictates that postjudgment interest began to run on the district court prejudgment interest award on march,when plaintiff unconditional legal entitlement to prejudgment interest was initially established.
the supreme court has instructed that,according to the plain language of,postjudgment interest properly runs from the date of the entry of judgment.kaiser,at.unfortunately,this rule does not resolve the question of when postjudgment interest began to accrue in the instant case,because the district court issued a number of judgments relating to prejudgment interest.the court entered the first of these judgments on march.in that order,the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on her claim for disability benefits under the plan and for prejudgment interest on all past due benefit payments.the district court denied plaintiff request for postjudgment interest at that time,but reserved the right to reconsider its ruling should there be a substantial delay between entry of judgment and payment by defendant unum.at march,order at.the district court revisited the prejudgment interest issue in an order entered on june.in that order,the district court noted that its previous order awarding prejudgment interest had failed to determine the applicable interest rate and the manner in which accrued interest is to be calculated.at june,order at.the district court adopted the interest rate set by the postjudgment interest statute,and determined that prejudgment interest should be calculated based upon the total amount of benefits for the period from august through january.based upon this rate and principal amount,the court determined the total prejudgment interest award to be.the district court amended its prejudgment interest award in a subsequent order entered on september.in that order,the district court adopted the model for calculating interest advocated by unum,and consequently reduced its prejudgment interest award to.we must determine which of these three judgments triggered the postjudgment interest statute.
our inquiry begins with the supreme court decision in kaiser.in that case,the plaintiff won a jury verdict in its antitrust suit for the trebled amount of.the district court entered judgment on that verdict on august.kaiser,at.the district court subsequently vacated the jury damages award,however,based upon its conclusion that the verdict was unsupported by the evidence.id.after a limited retrial on damages,a second damages award for the trebled amount of was entered on december.id.the district court granted the defendant motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to part of the damages award,and entered a reduced damages award on january.id.on appeal,the parties disputed whether postjudgment interest should have begun to accrue at the time of the first judgment in or at the time of the second judgment following the retrial on damages in.noting that the purpose of the postjudgment interest statute is to compensate the plaintiff for the loss from the time between the ascertainment of the damage and the payment by the defendant,the court reasoned that postjudgment interest should begin to run once damages have been ascertained in a meaningful way.id.at.quotation omitted.the court concluded that damages were not meaningfully ascertained at the time of the first damages judgment,because that judgment was vacated and found to be unsupported by the evidence.it would be counterintuitive,to say the least,the court explained,to believe that congress intended postjudgment interest to be calculated from such a judgment.id.at.
