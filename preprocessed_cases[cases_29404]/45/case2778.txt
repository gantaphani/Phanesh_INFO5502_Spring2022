plaintiff insurance company appeals from an adverse judgment in its declaratory relief action to determine whether the insurance policy it issued to mike tailoring mike covered the loss suffered.
the trial court determined the loss,which occurred when a clogged sewer line running underneath mike property caused raw sewage to flow into mike basement,was covered by the policy.it concluded the loss was covered under the terms of a policy covering the discharge of pollutants caused by the discharge of water directly resulting from the breaking or cracking of a part of a system containing water.the trial court found the exclusion for damage caused by w ater that backs up from a sewer or drain was not applicable because it encompassed damage caused by water and did not include pollutants carried by water.we disagree.
we shall conclude the exclusion from coverage for w ater that backs up from a sewer or drain must be given its common sense interpretation to include the sewage that inevitably accompanies the water in a sewer.we shall reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
issued a commercial lines insurance policy to mike.under the terms of the policy,would pay for physical loss or damage to covered property caused by any covered cause of loss.the covered causes of loss are risks of direct physical loss unless the loss was excluded or limited by the policy.
the policy contains two relevant exclusions from coverage.if either one applies to the cause of loss there is no coverage 
the first exclusion is the water backup exclusion.it states in relevant part 
we will not pay for loss or damage caused directly or indirectly by any of the following.such loss or damage is excluded regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss 
water that backs up from a sewer or drain 
the second exclusion is the pollutant exclusion.it states in relevant part 
we will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following 
discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants unless the discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape is itself caused by any of the specified causes of loss.but if loss or damage by the specified causes of loss results,we will pay for the resulting damage caused by the specified causes of loss.
specified causes of loss are defined as 
fire lighting explosion windstorm or hail smoke aircraft or vehicles riot or civil commotion vandalism leakage from fire extinguishing equip ment sinkhole collapse volcanic action falling objects weight of snow,ice or sleet water damage.
water damage means accidental discharge or leakage of water or steam as the direct result of the breaking or cracking of any part of a system or appliance containing water or steam.
pollutant is defined as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes materials to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
for the purposes of this appeal,we accept the following findings of the trial court.a sewer pipe servicing mike premises and that of an adjacent property ran beneath the concrete floor of mike basement.the sewer pipe conveyed all waste water from both properties and the water contained,inter alia,grease,vegetable matter,and human excrement.the sewer pipe was connected to a pipe.the two were joined beneath the basement floor,and the pipe ascended vertically at an angle until it breached the basement floor of mike premises.at the time of the incident,the pipe was covered with a plastic cap where it exited the basement floor.
approximately to feet downstream from the plastic cap the sewer pipe had a discernible brief and abrupt change in direction.the change in direction was more likely than not the result of a break in the sewer pipe at that point.the break allowed solid matter in the waste water to collect at that point,resulting in a blockage.the blockage constricted the flow of water and sewage,causing it to accumulate upstream from the obstruction.
the pressure of the accumulating water and sewage caused the plastic cap on the pipe to fail,and the contents of the sewer line were forced up the pipe into mike basement.the water and sewage from the sewer line flooded mike basement,and the water,sewage and fumes accompanying the sewage damaged mike property.
based on these findings of fact,the trial court concluded the loss was covered notwithstanding the pollutant exclusion because the loss was one of the specified causes of loss in the form of water damage.the trial court determined the downstream break in the sewer pipe and the failure of the cap constituted accidental breaks in the system causing a discharge of water and pollutants.
the trial court further concluded the water backup exclusion did not apply because it only encompassed damage caused by water,not damage caused by the pollutants carried by water.the trial court granted judgment in mike favor on the issues of insurance coverage presented in the complaint.
discussion 
ireview of insurance policies 
absent a factual dispute,the interpretation and application of insurance contracts is an issue of law which we review de novo.century transit systems,american empire surplus lines insurance th,d.our resolution of this case rests on the interpretation of the contract language w ater that backs up from a sewer or drain,an issue of law.
a contract is to be interpreted so as to give effect to the intent of the parties at the time the contract is formed.we infer the parties intent from the written provisions of the contract.the written provisions of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage.
thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.aiu ins.superior court cal d.an ambiguity arises only if there is more than one construction in issue which is semantically permissible citation.city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,d.in the case of an insurance policy there must be an uncertainty in the application of the policy language to the facts upon which the claim of coverage is predicated.national auto.casualty ins.contreras d.citation omitted.a claim of ambiguity can not always be decided from the face of the language.it may be latent.city of sacramento public employees retirement system,supra,th at,d,citation omitted.
if there is ambiguity in an insurance contract,the ambiguous provision is to be construed in the sense the insurer believed the insured understood the provision at the time the contract was formed.aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.if this does not resolve the ambiguity,the ambiguous provision is to be resolved against the party who caused the uncertainty.ibid.ambiguities in an insurance contract are generally to be resolved in favor of coverage.ibid.
we shall conclude the meaning a lay person would ascribe to the phrase,w ater that backs up from a sewer or drain is not facially ambiguous and the record does not establish a latent ambiguity.consequently we shall apply a common sense meaning in interpreting the policy.
sewer backup exclusiona.water pollutant 
as explained,the trial court found the sewer backup exclusion inapplicable because it found the damage was caused by pollutants rather than water.notwithstanding this determination,the trial court also stated the loss was caused by water,waste,and sewage the sewer pipe conveyed and that water contained many pollutants the sewer line contained water and sewage,and the contents of the sewer line was forced up the pipe into mike basement and flooded the basement and the leakage of water constituted a specified cause of loss in the form of water damage 
the phrase w ater that backs up from a sewer or drain is facially unambiguous.it is unreasonable to assume that water in a sewer will be free from waste,contaminants,and other noxious substances that are commonly referred to as sewage.a lay person re
