steven greenberger car was damaged in an accident,and the next day his insurer,geico general insurance,estimated the damage and wrote him a check to cover his claim.greenberger accepted this payment but never repaired the car.instead,he donated the car to charity and later sued geico in state court alleging breach of contract,consumer fraud in violation of.comp.stat.et,and fraud.the suit was filed as a class action,so geico removed it to federal court under the class action fairness act,d.
though legally distinct,greenberger contract and fraud claims are all premised on the same basic factual allegation that geico systematically omits necessary repairs from its estimates in violation of the promise to restore the policyholder vehicle to its preloss condition.the district court sidestepped the question,dismissed the statutory claim,and then entered summary judgment for geico on the and fraud counts.greenberger appeals.
we affirm.all of greenberger claims are foreclosed by the illinois supreme court comprehensive decision in avery state farm mutual automobile insurance.among other important holdings,avery established the proposition that a policyholder suit against his insurer for breach of its promise to restore his car to its preloss condition can not succeed without an examination of the car.id.at.greenberger gave away his car,and without it,he can not prove that what geico paid him was inadequate to restore the car to its preloss condition.
avery also made clear that fraud claims must contain something more than reformulated allegations of a contractual breach.id.at.greenberger alleges that geico never intended to restore his car to its preloss condition and failed to disclose that it regularly breaches this contractual promise.these are allegations dressed up in the language of fraud.they can not support statutory or fraud claims.
background 
on july,greenberger,a professor and administrator at a chicago law school,was involved in an automobile accident,and his acura sustained damage to its bumper,steering box,suspension,and lower body.the next day,a geico insurance adjuster inspected the car at greenberger home and wrote him a check for minus a deductible.greenberger cashed the check but did not repair his car.five months later,a stranger approached greenberger in a parking lot and expressed interest in buying the car.greenberger permitted this prospective buyer to take the acura to a friend body shop for an estimate of what it would cost to repair it.the buyer mechanic,sarkit tokat of lake side auto rebuilders,delivered an estimate of,about higher than geico estimate.the sale was not made,however,and in december greenberger donated the car to charity without making any repairs.
exactly three years after accepting geico payment on his claim,greenberger filed this proposed lawsuit in cook county circuit court alleging breach of contract,violation of the illinois consumer fraud and deceptive practices act.comp.stat.et,and fraud he claimed that geico systematically underpays on its claims by omitting necessary repairs from estimates.this practice,he alleged,violates geico contractual promise to restore the insured vehicle to its preloss condition and constitutes statutory and fraud.geico removed the case to federal court under the class action fairness act,d cafa.
the district court dismissed the statutory claim without prejudice.greenberger amended his complaint and again the court dismissed the statutory claim,this time with prejudice,and also denied greenberger motion to file a third amended complaint.greenberger other claims,however,were allowed to proceed.the court eventually granted geico motion for summary judgment on the and fraud claims,and accordingly did not address the issue of class certification.after an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration,greenberger appealed.
at oral argument we asked counsel whether the district court failure to certify a class had any effect on the court jurisdiction.in supplemental briefing geico argued that federal jurisdiction was intact under cafa even though the district court bypassed the issue of.greenberger argued the opposite that the district court lost jurisdiction to consider his claims on the merits because it never certified the case as a class action.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
as we have noted,we raised the question of jurisdiction from the bench and ordered supplemental briefing on whether the district court failure to certify a class has any effect on federal jurisdiction.the supplementals were filed,but we have since resolved the jurisdictional issue in another case,and our jurisdiction is secure.in cunningham charter learjet,cir,we held that federal jurisdiction under cafa does not depend on class certification.id.more specifically,cunningham held that a district court denial of class certification does not oust the court jurisdiction.id.
cafa confers federal jurisdiction over certain qualifying class in which at least one member of the class is a citizen of a different state from any defendant that is,in which diversity may not be complete.id.class action is defined as any civil action filed under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule of judicial procedure authorizing an action to be brought by or more representative persons as a class action.d b emphasis added.this language,we said in cunningham,means that federal jurisdiction does not depend on whether the district court actually certifies a class.at.instead,jurisdiction is determined based on the facts at the time of filing or removal and is not lost by subsequent developments in the case.id.this understanding of cafa comports with the general principle that with immaterial exceptions jurisdiction once obtained normally is secure.id.at see also paul mercury indem.red cab.
applying cunningham here,the district court failure to certify a class has no effect on federal jurisdiction.at the time of removal,greenberger suit was a qualifying class action under cafa.that the district court sidestepped the issue of class certification does not undermine jurisdiction.we may proceed to the merits.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts and reasonable inferences in greenberger favor.trentadue redmon,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine dispute of material fact and geico is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
to prevail on his claim,greenberger has the burden of proving that the amount geico paid on his claim was insufficient to restore his car to its preloss condition.because greenberger donated his car to charity,he can not make the showing of proof required to establish a breach of geico contractual promise.this conclusion flows directly from the illinois supreme court decision in avery.see,at.
avery was a nationwide class action against state farm automobile insurance company challenging the insurer practice of not using original equipment manufacturer parts oem parts to repair its insureds vehicles.the claimed that this practice breached state farm promise to restore cars to their preloss condition and also was fraud.id.at.they won a massive award the judgment did not hold up on review in the illinois supreme court.as relevant here,the court held that the award could not be affirmed because 
in order to establish a breach of the condition promise,plaintiffs would have to show that the parts specified or used by state farm,whether oem or parts,did not restore the vehicle to its preloss condition.a necessary first step in making this showing would be to examine each class member vehicle to determine its preloss condition.
id.at.avery thus stands for the proposition that a claim for breach of an auto insurer promise to restore an insured car to its preloss condition can not succeed without an examination of the car.
greenberger attempts to distinguish avery on its facts,arguing that he is not challenging the quality of the repair work that geico provides,but rather its practice of omitting certain repairs that are needed to restore an insured vehicle to its preloss condition.this distinction is immaterial.avery establish
