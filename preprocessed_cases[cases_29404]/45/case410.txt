on december,defendant national health insurance company national issued an individual hospital surgical expense policy to plaintiff oliver bishop,iii bishop iii,on which his son,oliver bishop,iv bishop iv,as a member of his family,was insured.the policy provided coverage for certain medical expenses for bishop iii and the members of his family,including his son.but the policy excluded coverage for any loss incurred while the insured was legally i ntoxicated,defining i ntoxicated as a level of blood alcohol content that is specified in the laws defining i ntoxication in the state where the loss or cause of loss occurred.
on march,bishop iv,then years old,purchased a case of beer and a of liquor at a store in new haven,connecticut,and proceeded to a party in guilford,connecticut,where he consumed these alcoholic beverages.earlier in the evening,bishop iv had made arrangements with a designated driver to take him home after the party and this occurred at on march.within minutes after his arrival at his home,bishop iv got into his pickup truck and drove away,soon overtaking the designated driver.almost minutes from the time he left his home,at,bishop iv lost control of his vehicle and drove off the road,colliding with a stone wall and two trees.he was treated for his injuries at haven hospital,where medical personnel determined that his blood alcohol content was percent alcohol by weight.citing the intoxication exclusion in its policy,national refused to pay the in medical expenses plaintiffs incurred as a result of bishop iv accident.
in the district court the parties agreed that bishop iv conduct violated connecticut general statutes a,the connecticut drunk driving law.that law prohibited driving with a blood alcohol content exceeding percent alcohol by weight.nonetheless,the bishops insisted that the intoxication exclusion in their policy with national should not apply because the exclusion is ambiguous.the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in plaintiffs favor,ordering national to pay the bishops medical expenses.
we recognize that equitable considerations involved in weighing,on the one hand,the effect on the insurer of paying the claims against,on the other hand,the substantial medical costs incurred by the insured for his son injuries,might counsel agreement with the district court conclusion.but,equity can not be unbounded,without risking a throwback to those days in sixteenth century england light of the vast discretion exercised by the was said of the english court of chancery that equity is as long as the chancellor foot,be it long or short,on such an uncertain measure,so goes equity.see john selden,table talk frederick pollock,ed,cited in zechariah chafee,sidney post simpson,cases on equity ed.here,of course,the exclusion from coverage is contained in the written contract of insurance between the parties.it is written in plain and,we conclude,unambiguous language,and is not subject therefore to being construed on equitable principles.we must vacate.
discussion 
i principles of interpretation of an insurance policy 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,standing in place of the district court and applying the same principles of law to the facts in the case as it does.see podell citicorp diners club,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the court,resolving all ambiguities and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the party,determines there is no genuine issue of material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see alibrandi fin.outsourcing,cir per curiam.the district court had jurisdiction over this case based on diversity of bishops are connecticut domiciliaries and national is incorporated and has its principal place of business in texas.see a.the parties agree the substantive law of connecticut applies.
under connecticut law,we interpret an insurance policy as we would a contract,with the ultimate goal of determining the intent of the parties regarding the extent of coverage the insured expected to receive and what the insurer agreed to provide as disclosed by the terms of the policy.see simses am.for life and health,marcolini allstate ins.an insurer may escape its obligation to pay an insured for a loss otherwise covered in the policy by identifying a specific clause that expressly excludes the loss.john hancock mut.life ins.if an exclusionary provision is ambiguous so that an average policyholder of ordinary intelligence can reasonably read the policy as both favoring and disallowing coverage,we construe the clause in a manner most beneficial to the insured,in favor of coverage and against the insurer.see heyman assocs.ins.of state of,lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.this rule of construction is followed because the insurer as the drafter of the insurance contract bears the burden of clarity,and because the insured must have notice of the types of risk his policy covers and excludes.see hansen ohio cas.ins.if the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous,however,then its language must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning.heyman assocs,at.connecticut highest court instructs courts to refrain from import ing ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity.springdale donuts,aetna cas.sur.of.
ii alleged ambiguity in the national policy 
plaintiffs advance,and the district court accepted,the proposition that the intoxication exclusion is unclear,ambiguous and unintelligible as written.the district court pointed to the policy definition of intoxication,which refers to the level of blood alcohol content that is specified in the laws defining intoxication in connecticut,and reasoned that the word intoxication,as used in the policy,is ambiguous because no connecticut statute clearly defines intoxication by reference to a blood alcohol content level.this would seem a curious proposition,since the connecticut drunk driving law,which bishop iv admits to violating,defines the offense as driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both,or while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content,which,in turn,is defined for the purposes of this section as blood alcohol content of percent or more by weight.a emphasis added 
undeterred by this admission,plaintiffs insist that the statute does not provide an explicit legal definition of intoxication.it is their contention that the statute only describes drunk driving,but not intoxication per se,and thereby leaves open the possibility that other legal definitions of intoxication may apply.the bishops point out that connecticut law contains other definitions of intoxication that do not refer to blood alcohol content,and that even the blood alcohol content referenced in a has changed over percent to percent in,and to percent in.see.pub.acts.a.
outside of a,the district court identified the following definitions of intoxication in connecticut law a substantial disturbance of mental or physical capacities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body.discussing intoxication as a means of negating criminal intent mental or physical functioning substantially impaired as a result of the use of alcohol or drugs.intoxication in the context of provision of addiction services by the state and an abnormal mental or physical condition due to the influence of intoxicating liquors,a visible excitation of the passions and impairment of the judgment,or a derangement or impairment of physical functions and energies,which may be found w hen it is apparent that a person is under the influence of liquor,when his manner is unusual or abnormal and is reflected in his walk or conversation,when his ordinary judgment or common sense are disturbed or his usual will power temporarily suspended,when these or similar symptoms result from the use of liquor and are manifest,sanders officers club of,interpreting definition of intoxication in connecticut dram shop act.
all of these other competing definitions of intoxication,the bishops declare,make the application of national intoxication exclusion so uncertain and ambiguous that it is unintelligible and therefore unenforce
