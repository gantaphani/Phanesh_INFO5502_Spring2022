introduction 
roger proulx company proulx appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of j h marsh mclennan of utah,j h.proulx,a licensed contractor,sued j h,an insurance broker,for negligence,alleging that j h failed to add proulx as an additional insured under comprehensive general liability insurance policies issued to,to whom proulx subcontracted certain work.proulx alleged that as a result of j h failure to add proulx as an additional insured,proulx was damaged in connection with a claim made against it by turner construction company turner arising from work,which claim,proulx alleged,would have been covered by the insurance if proulx had been named as an additional insured.
in moving for summary judgment,j h contended that its failure to add proulx as an additional insured did not cause proulx any damage because turner claim against proulx would not have been covered by the policy at issue even if proulx had been an additional insured,and even if the claim had been covered,proulx suffered no damage because it had received or waived the benefits that would have been available to it as an additional insured.
the trial court granted j h summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of j h,finding that there was no genuine dispute that turner claim against proulx was expressly and solely for breach of contract,and as such sought recovery for economic damages which are not covered under the policy at issue and not for property damages which are covered under the policy.we hold that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether the insurance coverage that j h failed to obtain for proulx could have covered proulx damages.there is evidence that some of the sums turner sought to recover from proulx were due to property damage covered under the policy,that the policy would have covered proulx alleged vicarious liability to turner,and that proulx settlement of its claim against does not bar proulx claims against j j h has not otherwise established that proulx claim is legally barred.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
background 
installation and attempted repair of tank liner 
proulx subcontracted to furnish and install roofing and waterproofing on a commercial building being built on figueroa street in downtown los angeles.turner was the general contractor on the building that was known as the tower project.as part of its subcontract with turner,proulx was required to install a waterproof liner in a tank that was part of the building air conditioning system.because it did not have expertise in installing the kind of liner required under its contract with turner,proulx subcontracted the installation of the liner to.
started its work on the tank liner in september.the tank began to leak shortly after installed the liner.attempted to repair the leak,but more leaks occurred.at one point,the tank was leaking at a rate of gallons of fluid per day.
over the next year,proulx,and others made several attempts to identify the sources of the leaks and repair them.during several of those attempts the tank had to be emptied and there was damage to some of the cooling materials in the tank.while the repairs were being made,the air conditioning system could not run,and an expensive backup system was used to cool the building.the exact cause or causes of all of the leaks is unclear,although some of them may be attributable to work.
turner claim against proulx 
turner met and exchanged correspondence with proulx during the months in which the tank leaked.in memoranda of those meetings and in the correspondence,turner noted among other things that the leaks had damaged certain pumps and valves,caused the waste of nearly half a million gallons of water turner had paid for,and prevented the use of the air conditioning and other systems.
after more than a year in which and proulx were unable to repair the leaks,in january turner demanded that proulx remove and replace the liner.when proulx failed to respond to turner demand,turner declared proulx in default of the subcontract between them.the building owner subsequently contracted with another company to replace the liner.in october,turner itemized the costs associated with the leaky liner and calculated its t otal net claim against proulx.the itemized list of costs included such items as painting in office area,replace dp transmitter in valve pit,repair office area,and patch drywall,in addition to costs associated with replacing the defective waterproof liner.turner claim came to just over.proulx entered into a settlement with turner,but the form and amount of the settlement are not disclosed in the record.
proulx lack of expected coverage under insurance policies 
the subcontract between proulx and required to maintain in full force and effect a comprehensive liability insurance policy and to furnish certificates of insurance to proulx before commencing work.the subcontract also required to indemnify and hold proulx harmless against all claims,demands,and liability for damages arising out of or connected with activities and performance of its work installing the waterproof liner.
several weeks after executing the subcontract,proulx sent a letter of transmittal to,asking to forward to proulx the certificate of insurance and to list proulx as an additional insured.contacted its insurance broker,j h,and asked it to add proulx as an additional insured under general liability policy with national union fire insurance company national union.
j h issued a certificate of insurance that listed proulx as such an additional insured,and the certificate was forwarded to proulx.the j h agent who signed the certificate of insurance believed at the time she issued the certificate that insurance coverage was automatically extended to the additional insured when the certificate of insurance was sent to national union.as it turns out,her belief was incorrect.she later learned that national union would extend coverage only if j h made a specific request to a specific underwriter.because the j h agent had not made such a request,coverage under policy was not extended to proulx.
proulx was not aware that it had not been added to policy as an additional insured.on october,proulx asked to inform national union of the glycol tank leak situation.did so on october.on january,proulx attorney sent a letter to american international adjusting group,stating that proulx was named as an additional insured under policy with national union and demanding that national union resolve the claim made against proulx by turner.national union denied coverage on the ground that proulx was never added to any of policies as an additional insured.
proulx attempt to recover its alleged damages 
proulx filed the original complaint in this action in november,alleging several claims against arising from its defective work and its representations regarding its qualifications,and two claims against national union for breach of insurance contract and bad faith.the court dismissed the claims against national union on demurrer because proulx was not an insured under the national union policies.national union provided a defense to in connection with proulx lawsuit against,and paid proulx to settle proulx claims against.at some point the record is unclear,proulx amended its complaint to allege a claim for negligence against j 
j h motion for summary judgment 
j h moved for summary judgment.in its moving papers,j h challenged only the causation and damages elements of proulx claim.
j h argued that its failure to add proulx as an additional insured under policy did not cause proulx alleged damages because policy would not have covered turner claim against proulx,even if proulx had been an additional insured,for three reasons the policy obligated the insurer to defend and indemnify only if a lawsuit was filed against the insured,and turner had not filed a lawsuit the policy only covered bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence as those terms are defined in the policy,and turner claim was for economic loss for breach of contract,which claim is not covered and the policy prohibited an insured from voluntarily making a payment or settling a claim without the insurer consent,and proulx had voluntarily made payments to or settled with turner.
j h argued that proulx was not entitled to any damages as a result of j h failure to add proulx as an additional insured because the contract between proulx and,which contract proulx alleged gave rise to j h duty to add proulx as an additional insured,required only that indemnify proulx for vicarious liability proulx incurred as a result of negligence,whereas turner claim against proulx was for proulx active negligence and proulx settled the lawsuit it brought against for negligence and dismissed its causes of action with prejudice,which dismissal bars further litigation on the same subject matter.
j h separate statement of undisputed material facts was divided into four sections background facts,facts about insurance coverages,construction contracts,and settlement operates as retraxit.all of the facts in the facts about insurance coverages section related to either whether turner claim against proulx came within the insuring agreement portion of the national union policies,whether the claim was bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence or the timing of proulx notice to national union about turner claim.none of the facts related to the applicability of any of the exclusions in the policies.
the evidence submitted in support of j h motion included memoranda and correspondence in which turner appears to assert that the leaks in the tank liner caused damage to property other than the tank itself and prevented the use of the air conditioning system as well as other systems in the building.j h also submitted the declaration of a purported insurance coverage expert,who testified that no comprehensive general liability policies issued by national union to parties working in the construction business during the past years would have provided coverage for the kind of claim turner alleged against proulx.
proulx opposition 
in opposing j h motion,proulx contended that the absence of a lawsuit by turner against proulx was not dispositive because j h negligence deprived proulx of coverage and therefore proulx was in the same position as an insured whose insurer wrongfully denies coverage,it was empowered to deal with a claimant on its own before a lawsuit was filed turner claim was at least in part based upon property damage as defined in policies,caused by defective work proulx attempts to mitigate the damage being caused by the leaking tank did not vitiate coverage under the policies because they were not voluntarily incurred and they did not prejudice national union regardless of the terms of the written contract between and proulx,attempted to add proulx as an additional insured under its policies with national union and j h represented that it had accomplished it and proulx settlement with did not bar its claim against j h because the settlement covered only the harm caused by independent acts of negligence rather than the harm caused by j h negligence.
proulx submitted evidence that it had demanded that proulx be added as an additional insured under policies,and believed that it had be so added turner claim against proulx was based upon active negligence it notified,national union,and j h that proulx sought coverage under policies and national union denied coverage and that it took corrective action and incurred expenses both before and after national union was notified of the claim and denied coverage in an effort to mitigate its damages.
in reply to proulx opposition,j h submitted an additional declaration of its insurance expert regarding the scope of coverage under certain policy endorsements.j h also submitted portions of the deposition of turner person most knowledgeable witness,who testified that the document summarizing turner claim against proulx did not include costs for damages that we commonly term ripple beyond the glycol and fire tank itself.he did not,however,explain exactly what ripple damages include or exclude.he also stated that the summary of turner claim did not include any costs that proulx or had already incurred to repair the leaking tank.
the hearing and supplemental briefs 
at the hearing on j h motion,the trial court issued a written tentative ruling.in summarizing its tentative ruling at the hearing,the court explained that the national union policy would not have provided coverage because turner claim was based upon the contract between turner and proulx,and because certain exclusions b assumption of liability by contract,j restoration or repair of property on which insured performed work,m defect in insured work causing damage to impaired property,and m delay or failure to perform obligation would preclude coverage.
proulx filed a supplemental brief regarding the effect of the policy exclusions the trial court raised,asserting that there were fact questions regarding the applicability of the exclusions.j h replied to proulx supplemental brief and asserted that each of the exclusions apply and preclude coverage.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court granted j h motion on the ground that turner claim against proulx was expressly and solely for breach of contract,and as such sought recovery for economic damages and not for property damages.the court stated that the itemized claim that turner prepared,which both j h and proulx submitted in support of and opposition to the motion,may constitute evidence that there was property damage attributable to the leaking liner,but the court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because the inclusion of those items did not indicate that turner was asserting a claim for the property damage rather than the economic loss associated with repairing the damage.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal from a summary judgment,we make an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.iverson muroc unified school dist.th,d.
from commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar,italics and footnotes omitted.in addition,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact.id.if,and only if,the moving party carries that burden,the burden of production shifts to the opposing party to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.id.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.no more is called for.id.at,d.
although t he purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties pleadings in order to determine whether,despite their allegations,trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute aguilar,supra,cal th at,d,our supreme court has warned that the summary judgment procedure is drastic and should be used with caution in order that it may not become a substitute for existing methods in the determination of issues of fact eagle oil ref.prentice cal d.accordingly,declarations of the moving party are strictly construed,those of the opposing party are liberally construed,and doubts as to whether a summary judgment should be granted must be resolved in favor of the opposing party.the court focuses on issue finding it does not resolve issues of fact.the court seeks to find contradictions in the evidence,or inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,that raise a triable issue of material fact.michael los angeles county of adoptions d.
if,in deciding this appeal,we find there is no issue of material fact,we affirm the summary judgment if it is correct on any legal ground applicable to this case,whether that ground was the legal theory adopted by the trial court or not.western mutual ins.yamamoto th,d.if,on the other hand,we find that one or more triable issues of material fact exist,then we must reverse the judgment.
proulx professional negligence claim requires proulx to show that policies would have covered turner claim 
proulx cause of action against j h,a professional negligence claim,is similar to a legal malpractice claim,in that liability must be established in a.just as a plaintiff in a legal malpractice case must establish that it would have prevailed in the underlying action but for the defendant professional negligence,proulx can recover on its cause of action against j h only if it can show that,but for j h negligence,proulx would have had at least some coverage for turner claim under the national union policies.without such a showing,there is no cause of action because there are no damages caused by the breach of the professional duty.see,budd nixen cal d,the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence see also walker pacific indemnity d.cause of action against insurance agent for negligently procuring insurance in amount less than ordered by insured did not accrue until judgment was entered against insured for more than coverage amount,unless insured could show special facts to establish other injury,such as adverse credit rating based upon mere existence of unindemnified liability.thus,in addressing the causation element of proulx negligence claim in j h motion for summary judgment,j h attempted to establish that policies would not have provided coverage to proulx for turner claim if proulx had been an additional insured under those policies.
c.there was a triable issue regarding whether turner claim against proulx was for property damage 
proulx contends that there was evidence of property damage caused by work and that this evidence raises a triable issue because,regardless of turner legal theory for recovery breach of contract or tort,the damages turner sought were because of property damage,as required for coverage under insurance policies.policies provided that national union would pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies.property damage is defined as physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.to be covered under a commercial general liability cgl policy,such as the policy in this case,the property damage must be to tangible property other than the insured own work,caused by the insured defective work.see,maryland casualty reeder d.
the focus should be on the nature of the risk and the injury,in light of the policy provisions,rather than on the form of action chosen by the injured party,when determining whether a claim is covered.vandenberg superior court cal th,d,vandenberg.in aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu,the supreme court examined whether there is coverage under a cgl policy for an insured who,as a result of an injunctive relief action filed against it,may become obligated to pay for cleanup or other response costs related to the insured release of hazardous materials into the environment.looking at the because of property damage language of the cgl policy,the supreme court said that when government agencies seek to recover from an insured the reimbursement of the agencies response costs,in plain and ordinary terms such recovery is because of property damage.it is immaterial whether motivations other than protection of example,protection of the health of persons living near hazardous waste contribute to the agencies pursuit of statutory relief whatever their dominant motive,the event precipitating their legal action to require the insured to pay to clean up the hazardous material or to reimburse the agencies for their cleanup costs is contamination of property.the costs that result from such action are therefore incurred because of property damage.id.at.
in light of vandenberg and aiu,the issue here is whether at least some of the damages turner sought to recover were because of property damage as those terms are used in the insurance policies at issue,regardless of whether turner sought those damages under a contract theory or a tort theory.in moving for summary judgment,j h submitted among other things a document that on its face suggests that at least some of the damages turner sought to recover from proulx were because of property damage.that document,a summary of turner claim against proulx,lists costs associated with repairing damage to property other than the liner installed in the glycol tank,which damages apparently were caused by the leaking liner.in addition,j h submitted other documents in which reference is made to damage to other property,which damage also was caused by the leaking liner.this evidence suggests that the leaking liner caused physical injury to tangible property other than the liner itself,for which turner sought reimbursement albeit,under a breach of contract theory.thus,j h own evidence raises a triable issue regarding whether turner claim was for damages because of property damage.
because the references to damage to such property as the office area are sufficient to raise a triable issue,we do not need to resolve at this stage of the case whether damage to other items would be covered by the policies.also,we do not need to determine whether,as proulx contends,the cost to remove the leaking liner is recoverable under policies,either because the liner was incorporated into other property as in shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,d and armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d or because removal was a remedial action as in aiu,supra.because j h failed to meet its burden of production to establish that turner claim against proulx did not seek to recover for at least some physical injury to property other than the liner,damages because of property damage,j h is not entitled to summary judgment on the ground that there was no alleged property damage.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
none of the grounds j h raised in the trial court justifies summary judgment 
in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate on any other ground supported by j h separate statement of undisputed facts western mutual ins.yamamoto,supra,th at,d,we limit our review to grounds supported by the separate statement because only those facts set forth in the separate statement are relevant when determining whether summary judgment should be granted.see,united community church garcin d.a ll material facts must be set forth in the separate statement.this is the golden rule of summary adjudication if it is not set forth in the separate statement,it does not exist.both the court and the opposing party are entitled to have all the facts upon which the moving party bases its motion plainly set forth in the separate statement italics omitted.
j h raised four other grounds for summary judgment in its moving papers there would not have been any coverage under the policy because turner did not file a lawsuit against proulx,there would not have been any coverage because proulx voluntarily made payments to turner,when proulx sued it received all of the benefits it would have received from the indemnity required under the contract between proulx and,and proulx dismissal of its lawsuit against operates as a retraxit barring the instant lawsuit.in addition to these grounds,j h in its supplemental brief in support of its summary judgment motion raised certain exclusions in the insurance policies that j h contended would have barred coverage of turner claim against proulx.none of these grounds warrants summary judgment.
j h points to turner failure to file a lawsuit against proulx to recover the damages turner incurred as a result of the leaking liner and contends that,because an insurer has discr
