after a lengthy investigation of fire insurance claims presented by the plaintiffs,the defendant insurance company rejected the claims.the district court,which had jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship,entered summary judgment in favor of the company.the court held that the plaintiffs claims were barred by provisions in the insurance policies that required suit to be brought within one year after the loss.the court further held that,on the facts presented,the company invocation of the limitations provisions did not constitute bad faith.
we agree that the limitations provisions were valid under applicable state law the law of kentucky and were enforceable against the plaintiffs in the circumstances presented here.the challenged judgment will be affirmed.
the plaintiffs,homer and deborah smith,purchased homeowner and landlord insurance policies covering their residence and adjacent rental property in pike county,kentucky.the policies were issued by allstate insurance company in january of.
using substantially identical terms,the policies spelled out the steps to be taken by an insured and by allstate if a loss occurred.first,the insured had to give allstate prompt notice of the loss,produce all records reasonably requested by the company,and submit to examination under oath if requested to do so.within days after the loss,the insured was also required to submit a signed and sworn statement.if the policy covered the loss,allstate had to notify the insured within days after receiving the statement whether the company chose to repair the damaged property or to pay for the loss.a covered loss was to be settled within days after its amount was finally determined,whether by agreement,an appraisal award,or a court judgment.
the policies also contained a provision limiting the insureds right to sue allstate no suit or action may be brought against allstate unless there has been full compliance with all policy terms.any suit or action must be brought within one year after the inception of loss or damage.
the smiths insured properties were damaged by fire of suspicious origin on april.and smith promptly notified allstate of the loss.on april,allstate acknowledged receipt of notice and requested that the smiths return a completed form by july,date almost four weeks after the time limit specified in the policies.allstate april letter expressly reserved all rights,conditions defenses under the policy of insurance including the policy one year limitation of suit condition.the smiths signed a agreement in which they agreed that allstate investigation of their claim shall not waive or invalidate any of the terms or conditions of the policy.
the parties agreed that and smith would be examined under oath on july,the date by which the statements were due.allstate lawyer requested that the smiths bring to the examinations all records supporting their claim of loss.the examinations did not go forward at the agreed time,apparently because the smiths had yet to return their statements.
on august,allstate sent the smiths lawyer another form and advised him that the company could not conclude its investigation without the completed form.the letter further advised that the company would continue to require strict adherence to all policy terms and conditions and reiterated that the company specifically reserve d any and all rights defenses including the policy one year limitation of suit condition.
the smiths finally gave allstate their statements on september.on october,allstate paid grundy national bank,which held a mortgage on the smiths properties,approximately.
the smiths examinations under oath were rescheduled for october,but did not begin,for some reason,until november.it was agreed that the examinations would be completed on december,but that date fell through because of inclement weather.unhappy with the delay,the smiths lawyer threatened to file suit the day after christmas unless someone pays this claim.allstate lawyer responded with a suggestion that the examinations be completed on december.
the examinations were in fact concluded on that date,but allstate lawyer requested additional data from the smiths.some but not all of the requested information was provided in january of.although and smith were sent their examination transcripts promptly,they did not sign and return the transcripts until june.
meanwhile,in september of,allstate completed its investigation and denied the smiths claim.and smith brought suit against allstate in a kentucky court on january,than one year and nine months after the fire.allstate removed the case to federal district court,filed an answer,and asserted a for the money it had paid grundy national bank.
in due course the district court granted allstate summary judgment on the plaintiffs claim that the company had committed a breach of contract by not paying the claims in full.the court held that the limitations provision was valid and that allstate had not waived its limitations defense.
in a separate order,the court granted summary judgment to allstate on a bad faith claim asserted by the plaintiffs.finding that it would have been possible for the smiths to comply with all of the prerequisites for suit and still bring their action within one year of the loss,the court concluded that allstate invocation of the limitations provision did not constitute bad faith 
allstate counterclaim remained pending.having determined that there was no just cause for delay,however,the district court directed the entry of final judgment on the smiths claims.see rule b.and smith perfected a timely appeal.
as we have seen,the smiths insurance policies prohibited any suit from being brought more than one year after the inception of loss or damage.the fire loss occurred in april of,and the smiths did not sue allstate until january of.if the limitation was valid and enforceable,therefore,the smiths claims are barred.
contract provisions limiting the time within which an insured may sue are generally valid under kentucky law.see,edmondson pennsylvania national mutual casualty insurance,webb kentucky farm bureau insurance.in fact,a kentucky statute specifically allows foreign insurers to limit the time for commencing actions against them.see.webb,at.the statute provides that such a contractual limitations period may not be less than one year from the time when the cause of action accrues.
the logic of this provision would seem to be that allstate limitation period is not valid unless,as a matter of law,an insured cause of action accrues on the date of his or her loss.allstate,as might be expected,contends that the smiths cause of action accrued on the date of the fire.but there is a long line of kentucky cases holding in a variety of contexts that a cause of action does not accrue until the plaintiff has the right to institute and maintain a suit.see philpot stacy,forwood city of louisville,carter harlan hospital association.and under the insurance contracts at issue here,the smiths had no right to sue allstate prior to full compliance with all policy terms.we understand this to mean that the smiths could not sue until they had taken each of the steps required of them under the statements,and submitting to examination under oath.if cases such as philpot,forwood,and carter are controlling in the insurance context,therefore,the smiths cause of action could not have accrued on the date of the fire.
we are not persuaded that the philpot line of cases is controlling here.none of those cases involved,and kentucky courts have repeatedly enforced insurance contract provisions under which the time for suit began to run before the insured had a right to sue.in ashland finance hartford accident indemnity,for example,kentucky highest court gave effect to a limitations period running from discovery of the insured loss,even though the insurance contract provided that suit could not be brought for at least three months following the loss.in the subsequent case of edmondson pennsylvania national,similarly,the kentucky supreme court saw no question as to the validity of a policy provision that,like the provision at issue here,prohibited suit from being broug
