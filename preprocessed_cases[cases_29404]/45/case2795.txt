safeco insurance company of america safeco appeals from the judgment,after a nonjury trial,declaring that it breached its duty to defend and to indemnify michelle miller in a negligence action brought against her by her former boyfriend,jamey lynn parks.safeco contends it owed no duty to defend miller because she was not an insured under a homeowners policy it issued to the man with whom her mother was living when parks was injured,and because the policy excludes coverage for injuries arising out of the use of an automobile.parks and miller contend that miller meets the policy definition of an insured and that the automobile exclusion does not apply.we conclude the trial court erred in finding that safeco had a duty to defend miller.safeco reasonably declined the defense because the information then made available to safeco by its insured and other interested parties disclosed no potential that miller was an insured under the policy.accordingly,we reverse.we affirm a previously made discovery sanction order.

eddie barnette deposition testimony was consistent with these statements.he testified that,when he and gloria first moved into the townsend lane house,the guest room was in disrepair.it had no lights,bad paint and holes in the wall.the room was remodeled in january or february of.miller did not pay rent,food,utilities or other bills at his house.she was not expected to do chores.she had some overnight guests,but parks was not allowed to stay over.miller did not have a key to the house or have permission to drive eddie barnette cars.she received telephone calls at the townsend lane house on a second line that eddie barnette had installed when his father lived there.miller kept clothing on the floor of the guest room.during the time that gloria was married to eddie brother,ralph,eddie did not think of himself as miller uncle.he did not see much of miller and could not recall an occasion on which she stayed at his house from friday to sunday.eddie barnette died before the trial in the insurance bad faith matter.

the bad faith litigation 
after the arbitration award against miller was confirmed,she assigned to parks her claims against safeco.parks sued safeco for breach of contract,alleging that it failed in bad faith to settle his claims against miller within the policy limits.safeco filed a declaratory relief action,contending it owed no duty to defend or indemnify miller.miller also filed a against safeco,for bad faith refusal to defend and settle parks claims against her.the matters were consolidated.safeco moved for summary judgment,contending the auto exclusion precluded coverage for parks injuries and that miller was not an insured under the policy.both motions were denied.the parties tried the declaratory relief action to the trial court sitting without a jury.after a trial,the trial court found that safeco had a duty to defend miller and to indemnify her for the entire judgment against her.the parties agreed to stay parks and miller bad faith claims so that judgment could be entered on the declaratory relief complaint and safeco could pursue this appeal.
testimony in the bad faith litigation 
at the trial in the bad faith and declaratory relief action,michelle miller and gloria barnette testified that they had been pressured by the eddie barnette to lie in their previous testimony.barnette did not want safeco to cover parks injuries because he was afraid he would have to pay a high deductible.to avoid coverage,barnette instructed his wife and miller to say that miller rarely stayed at his house and that she was not close to him.
in their trial testimony,the women agreed that miller stayed weekends with her mother at least twice each month.as a teenager,miller acquired a habit of moving to one parent house whenever she had an argument with,or chafed against rules imposed by the other.that living arrangement would last until the next argument or unwelcome restriction,when miller would switch to the other house.she had her own room at barnette house.it was decorated and she kept furniture,clothing and other personal belongings there.she also had overnight guests at the house.miller did not have a key.on one occasion,she entered the house through a window because no one was there to let her in.

the trial court findings 
the trial court concluded that miller was an insured under the safeco policy issued to eddie barnette because she was a resident of his household and under his care.it made several factual findings to support that conclusion.among other things,the trial court found that miller was a resident of both barnette household and her father household.she was a resident of the townsend lane house because she had her own room at townsend lane,that housed her own furniture,clothing,cosmetics,photos,candles and knickknacks she had friends visit and spend the night she received telephone calls on a separate telephone number.miller was under barnette care because she did not perform chores at the house,he provided food and shelter for her,he enforced rules regarding her behavior while in his home,and he expressed concern for her well being.
the trial court also relied on miller use of the townsend lane address on a job application,a vehicle registration,a tax return and a school registration form.eddie barnette loaned miller money to enroll in a continuation high school and to buy books.he occasionally drove her to school,doctor appointments or social events like meals and movies.finally,the trial court accepted as credible the testimony of gloria barnette,who testified that eddie barnette was a better parent to michelle miller than she was.while they both established parental rules for michelle miller to follow,eddie barnette enforced the rules similar to the rules that charles miller placed on her.he required her to come in at a reasonable hour and that her boyfriend could not spend the night.she was also asked to clean up her room.all of this took place from the time of their move to townsend lane in july through february.because safeco breached its duty to defend miller,it was bound by and liable for the entire amount of the judgment entered in the parks lawsuit.
the trial court found that the safeco policy provided coverage for parks injuries because the auto exclusion did not apply.according to the trial court,miller had a special relationship to parks because she undertook to help him when he was too intoxicated to help himself.she breached her duty to parks when she abandoned him with knowledge that he could not take care of himself.her breach of duty was not dependent upon her use of either the parks or cooney vehicles.rather,the use of the vehicles merely altered the location of where parks injuries occurred.
contentions on appeal 
safeco contends that it did not owe a duty to defend miller because,at the time it declined the tender of her defense,safeco had no information demonstrating a potential that she was a resident of barnette household or in his care.it also contends that it had no duty to indemnify miller because parks injuries arise out of miller and rivera use,loading or unloading of an automobile and the auto exclusion therefore applies.parks contends safeco owed a duty to defend miller because the facts known to safeco at the time it declined the defense and those it could have learned had it conducted a more thorough investigation raised the potential that miller qualified as an insured under the policy.he contends the auto exclusion does not apply because his injuries arose out of miller negligent abandonment of him on the freeway,not her use of his car or cooney car.
standard of review 
when determining whether a particular policy provides a potential for coverage and a duty to defend,we are guided by the principle that interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.waller truck ins.exchange cal th,d.accordingly,we exercise de novo review,determining independently the meaning of the policy.cooper companies transcontinental ins.th,d.
here,the trial court also made findings of fact concerning miller visits to the insured premises and her relationship with the now deceased eddie barnette.although the findings are consistent with evidence in the trial record,we conclude they are irrelevant to the question whether safeco breached a duty to defend miller because the findings are based entirely on facts that were unknown to and concealed from safeco before safeco declined the defense.in statements,correspondence,declarations and depositions given before safeco declined the defense,all of the interested parties,including miller,her parents and named insured eddie barnette insisted that miller did not reside in barnette household and was not under his care.their statements to the contrary,whether truthful or not,were made only after safeco declined to defend miller.as a result,they are irrelevant to the question whether safeco breached a duty to defend her.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,gunderson fire ins.exchange th,d hurley construction state farm fire casualty th,d.because the facts known to safeco before it declined the defense eliminated potential coverage for parks claims against miller,we conclude safeco had no duty to defend miller 
discussion 
the duty to defend 
it is a fundamental rule of law that an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d.where the facts create no potential for coverage,however,there is no duty to defend.id.thus,when a suit against an insured alleges a claim that potentially could subject the insured to liability for covered damages,an insurer must defend unless and until the insurer can demonstrate,by reference to undisputed facts,that the claim can not be covered.in order to establish a duty to defend,an insured need only establish the existence of a potential for coverage while to avoid the duty,the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.ringler associates maryland casualty th,d.doubts concerning the potential for coverage,and therefore,the existence of a defense duty must be resolved in favor of the insured.montrose chemical superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
as our supreme court noted in montrose,whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured against a third party complaint is determined as of the time of the inception of the third party lawsuit,at,d.the insurer does so by reference to the policy,the complaint and all facts known to the insurer from any source.id.at,d.as an initial step,the allegations of the complaint are compared with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.these facts must be known by the insurer at the inception of the third party lawsuit and the duty to defend ceases as soon as it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage.gunderson fire ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.extrinsic facts obviate the insurer defense duty where they are undisputed and conclusively eliminate the potential that the policy provides coverage for the third party claim.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,montrose chemical superior court,supra cal th at,d.
barnette homeowner policy included a promise by safeco to defend and indemnify its insured.the policy provides that miller is an insured if she was a resident of barnette household and was under his care when the parks accident occurred.safeco was not obligated to provide miller with a defense unless the facts known to it revealed that she was an insured under the terms of the policy.we conclude that they did not.
determining,for insurance purposes,the residence of a child whose parents are divorced is not always a straightforward matter.such a child may have more than one residence at the same time.utley allstate ins.th,d.the term residence connotes any factual place of abode of some permanency,more than a mere temporary sojourn,quoting smith smith cal d.thus,a child who spends substantially equal amounts of time with each parent on a regularly rotating basis can be said to reside with each parent.kibbee blue ridge ins.th,d utley allstate ins,supra,th at,d national automobile casualty ins.underwood th,d safeco ins.gibson d.this understanding is consistent with dictionary definitions of the term resident as one who dwells in a place for a period of some duration and residence as a temporary or permanent dwelling place,abode,or habitation to which one intends to return as distinguished from a place of temporary sojourn or transient visit.webster new internat.dict.ed kibbee blue ridge ins,supra,th at,d.by the same token,a child who visits one parent only infrequently and does not maintain a room or personal belongings at that parent home may not be a resident of that parent home,especially where no permanent visitation schedule is in place,at,d national automobile casualty ins.underwood,supra,th at,d.
to qualify as an insured under the policy,miller must also have been a member of barnette household and under his care.the term household may be somewhat antiquated,as the trial court pointed out,but our supreme court held in island fireman fund indemnity cal d,that the term is generally synonymous with family and embraces a collection of persons as a single group,with one head,living together,a unit of permanent and domestic character,under one roof a collective body of persons living together within one curtilage,subsisting in common and directing their attention to a common object,the promotion of their mutual interests and social happiness.id.at,quoting lumbermen mutual casualty pulsifer.more recently,the court in jacobs fire ins.exchange d,followed island and held that a household includes family members and others who live together in the same place and who recognize a common source of authority or leadership to which the other members of the household are subject.thus,a head may be a father,a mother,both parents acting together,or some other person whom the members of the household recognize as their head,at,fn.
miller status as an insured.
the extrinsic facts known to safeco before it declined the defense established that miller did not meet the policy definition of an insured.first,eddie and gloria barnette represented to safeco that miller was not a resident of the insured premises.miller made the same representations to law enforcement and in her deposition in the parks lawsuit.although she used the townsend lane address for other purposes,such as her vehicle registration and some tax documents,miller never informed safeco of that fact.safeco was entitled to rely on statements by its insured and the other interested parties to conclude that miller did not reside at townsend lane.
even if the facts known to safeco raised a possibility that mil
