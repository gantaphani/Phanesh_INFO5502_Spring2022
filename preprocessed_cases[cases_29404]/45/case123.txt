in this insurance coverage dispute,centennial insurance company centennial seeks review of the district court grant of summary judgment to veterinarian robert patterson.the district court declared that centennial was obligated under an insurance policy to legally defend patterson in a lawsuit instituted against him by carol murphy.after careful consideration,we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of patterson.

in september,murphy initiated a pro se civil action in federal court against the state of maine and eighty or more defendants,including patterson,alleging various claims arising from proceedings brought against murphy by the state of maine for animal cruelty.murphy had been charged by the state with animal cruelty for not providing proper food,water,or shelter to approximately sixty animals on her farm.she sought compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief,namely,the return of all her property.
the claims against patterson arose from his alleged testimony against murphy at an animal possession hearing,which was held on march,the hearing,and also,patterson alleged examination of her animals in connection with those proceedings 
patterson submitted a copy of murphy complaint to centennial and requested that centennial tender a defense on his behalf,pursuant to the policy.centennial denied patterson request on the ground that it did not have a duty to defend or indemnify patterson with respect to the murphy suit because the suit fell outside the policy coverage.centennial then brought the instant declaratory judgment action in the federal district court for the district of maine,seeking a declaration that it did not have an obligation to defend and indemnify patterson against the claims asserted by murphy.meanwhile,patterson hired an attorney and provided for his own defense in the murphy suit.on june,while centennial action was pending before the district court,murphy complaint was dismissed with prejudice.centennial subsequent motion to dismiss this action as moot,based on the dismissal of the underlying suit,was denied on grounds that a factual dispute remained over whether patterson had incurred attorneys fees and costs and,if so,a legal dispute over whether they are recoverable from the plaintiff under a duty to defend.the parties then each filed motions for summary judgment.a magistrate judge recommended that patterson motion for summary judgment be granted,and centennial be denied,finding that centennial had a duty under the policy to defend patterson in the murphy action.on march,the district court entered an order adopting that recommendation.at that point in time,patterson had already incurred costs defending himself in the underlying murphy action,and in connection with establishing centennial duty to defend in the instant suit.centennial now appeals.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this case comes before us under our diversity jurisdiction and the parties agree that we must apply maine law to the resolution of the issues in dispute.see douglas york county,cir.
we apply de novo review to the district court decision because the issues were resolved on summary judgment and because under maine law w hether an insurer has an obligation to defend its insured against a complaint is a question of law.bucci essex ins,cir quoting elliott hanover ins,me alteration in original.
applicable law 
both centennial and patterson agree that maine law employs the comparison test to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured.see barrett paving materials,cont l ins,cir citing travelers indem.dingwell,me.the reviewing court is required to lay the underlying damage complaint alongside the insurance policy and then determine whether the pleadings are adequate to encompass an occurrence within the coverage of the policy.id.quoting dingwell,at modifications in original.under this comparison test,the insurer has a duty to defend if the underlying complaint discloses a potential or a possibility for liability within the policy coverage.bucci,at quoting elliott,at emphasis in original.in other words,g iven the possible existence of any legal or factual basis for payment under a policy,an insurer duty to defend should be decided summarily in favor of the insured.id.at quoting gibson farm family mut.ins,me emphasis in original see also ne,chi.title ins,me the insured is entitled to a defense if there exists any legal or factual basis which could be developed at trial which would obligate the insurers to pay under the policy.internal quotation marks omitted.significantly,t he duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify,and an insurer may have to defend before it is clear whether there is a duty to indemnify.bucci,at quoting commercial union ins.royal ins,me.
maine law is very clear that the inquiry under the comparison test is based exclusively on the facts as alleged rather than on the facts as they actually are.barrett paving,at quoting dingwell,at.moreover,we note that under maine law,at least in some circumstances,the duty of an insurance company to defend one count in a lawsuit imposes a duty to defend all counts.gibson,at.finally,as a general rule,a standard policy of insurance under maine law must be interpreted most strongly against the insurer.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
potential for coverage within scope of policy 
centennial argues that it had no duty to defend patterson in the murphy action because the murphy complaint did not allege a veterinary incident,as the term is defined in the policy.as noted above,the policy defines veterinary incident as any malpractice,negligent act or omission,utterance or publication of a libel or slander,or other defamatory or disparaging material i n the furnishing of professional veterinary services.in support of its position that no veterinary incident was alleged,centennial argues that a the murphy complaint makes no claims of malpractice or negligence in the furnishing of professional veterinary services and that b the murphy complaint makes no claims of libel,slander or defamation against only against certain media outlets.we disagree.
as to centennial first argument,it is true that the murphy complaint does not explicitly assert that patterson was negligent or committed malpractice in the furnishing of professional veterinary services.however,the complaint does contain several allegations of wrongful conduct by patterson that could potentially be so construed.
