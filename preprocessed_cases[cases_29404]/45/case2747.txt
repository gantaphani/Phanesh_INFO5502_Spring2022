introduction 
remedytemp,remedytemp,a general employer which provides special employers with workers or special employees,agreed to provide mark miceli to jacuzzi,jacuzzi,pursuant to a service agreement.remedytemp further agreed to keep miceli on payroll and provide workers compensation insurance.remedytemp obtained a california form workers compensation insurance policy from reliance national indemnity reliance,which included an alternate employer endorsement that specifically extended insurance coverage to special employers like jacuzzi as an additional insured.jacuzzi also obtained a california form workers compensation insurance policy for its own employees through american home assurance assurance.
miceli admittedly sustained an industrial injury while working for jacuzzi as a shipper and receiver on march.miceli filed for workers compensation and reliance provided benefits.however,on october,reliance was ordered into liquidation and the california insurance guarantee association ciga was joined to cover the claim ciga requested to be dismissed under section,subdivision c contending that the assurance policy provided other available insurance which covered miceli claim.remedytemp,jacuzzi and assurance alleged before the workers compensation appeals board wcab that their agreements complied with section and labor code section,subdivision d which limited liability and insurance coverage to the reliance policy,and ciga request for dismissal should be denied 
the wcab in banc determined that remedytemp and jacuzzi were jointly and severally liable to miceli for workers compensation,which was not changed by the agreements or statutes cited.the wcab reasoned that section was limited to insurers,which does not include ciga whose liability is strictly statutory.the wcab explained further that compliance with section,subdivision d precludes civil liability and not alternative workers compensation insurance.while the contracting parties may not have intended assurance to provide coverage and assurance did not collect premium for special employees like miceli,the assurance policy provides unlimited insurance coverage absent a separate exclusionary form endorsement obtained under the statutory scheme.the wcab concluded that the assurance policy is other available insurance under section,subdivision c,and dismissed ciga.
remedytemp,jacuzzi,assurance and casualty petition for writ of review.petitioners contend that their agreements satisfied the requirements of section and section,subdivision d,which extinguished joint and several liability and acts as exclusion of insurance coverage for special employees like miceli under the assurance policy.petitioners also assert,and the wcab determined,that the coverage provided to jacuzzi by assurance was not intended to include special employees such as miceli.the wcab finding is supported by substantial evidence and should be enforced.thus,a separate exclusionary form endorsement is not required,and ciga should not be dismissed.
based on statutory language,legislative history and judicial precedent,we agree with the wcab that employer joint and several liability to employees for workers compensation is not extinguished by compliance with section or section,subdivision d.we further agree with the wcab that section is expressly limited to insurers,which does not include ciga.
in regards to whether insurance coverage for special employees can be excluded by compliance with section,subdivision d,the legislature intended to avoid duplicate insurance and premium by authorizing insurance coverage solely by the general employer policy.as pointed out by the wcab,however,the statute does not preclude the special employer from obtaining alternative insurance protection.
the wcab resolved the apparent conflict as to what was intended under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d,by finding unlimited insurance coverage absent a separate exclusionary form endorsement that is approved by the workers compensation insurance rating bureau wcirb and department of insurance doi under the statutory scheme.however,the wcirb and doi indicate in responses to questions from this court that such endorsements have not been used for this purpose.while the wcirb and doi state that they would approve such an endorsement,they add that a careful description of the excluded special employees is also required.even though this is not expressly required by the statutory scheme,ciga contends the added requirement is routine and reasonable.nevertheless,prior notice of this requirement was not provided,and we agree with petitioners that it is too uncertain for practical guidance under the statutory scheme.therefore,we conclude that the general requirement of an exclusionary form endorsement under the statutory scheme is not applicable under the circumstances of this case.
we further conclude that alternative insurance protection for special employees like miceli was not intended under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d,which is incorporated into the policy as explained hereafter.otherwise,petitioners would have intended duplicate insurance protection that specifically insures jacuzzi as an additional insured under the alternate employer endorsement and as a named insured under the assurance policy.accordingly,we hold the assurance policy is not other available insurance under section,subdivision c and the dismissal of ciga by the wcab is reversed.
factual and procedural background 
the parties stipulated to the basic facts.pursuant to a service agreement,remedytemp,a general employer,agreed for a fee to provide special employees to jacuzzi,the special employer the service agreement further provided that remedytemp would retain the special employees on payroll,provide workers compensation insurance and hold jacuzzi harmless from claims.on or about july,remedytemp secured a california form workers compensation insurance policy through reliance.the reliance policy contained an alternate employer endorsement,which specifically extended the insurance coverage to contracted special employers such as jacuzzi.jacuzzi also insured its own workers through assurance,which issued to jacuzzi a california form workers compensation insurance policy,april edition,for the period of may,through may.
on march,mark miceli,a special employee provided by remedytemp,admittedly sustained a cut injury to his left minor ring finger while working for jacuzzi.reliance provided workers compensation benefits including surgery.however,reliance was ordered into liquidation on october,and ciga began administering miceli claim.ciga also petitioned for dismissal arguing that assurance provided other available insurance under section,subdivision c.since there were approximately similar cases involving remedytemp,reliance,and special employers and employees,the wcab consolidated the cases and issued a stay order pending a test case regarding ciga liability.miceli case was chosen.
the parties conducted discovery,which included the deposition of vincent catapano,the regional underwriting manager of assurance.catapano testified repeatedly that miceli was not covered by the assurance policy because premium had not been collected,which is based on jacuzzi payroll miceli was not covered even though the assurance policy allows retroactive premium since this is also based on jacuzzi payroll.however,catapano conceded that he was not familiar with california law,section or section,subdivision d.
the parties proceeded to trial and stipulated to the basic facts.the issues included whether ciga or assurance was liable considering sections and,section,subdivision d and the contractual agreements.the admitted evidence included the legislative histories of section and section,subdivision d the service agreement,insurance policies,and catapano deposition.
the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj determined that remedytemp and jacuzzi,as general and special employers of miceli,were jointly and severally liable for workers compensation,which is not extinguished by the agreements under section or section,subdivision d.the wcj concluded further that the assurance policy is other available insurance under section,subdivision c,and dismissed ciga.
in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that joint and several liability of general and special employers for workers compensation is well established.in addition,the plain language of section is limited to insurers,reliance became insolvent and was no longer an insurer,and ciga only pays per statute and is not an insurer according to isaacson,supra,cal d at pages,claims handling by ciga not subject to unfair practices act.in regards to section,subdivision d,the wcj reasoned that the statute was enacted to preclude civil liability,and there was no language extinguishing joint and several liability or preventing additional insurance.since the assurance policy contained no exclusion for special employees,the policy covered miceli and is other insurance under section,subdivision c,whether or not assurance chose to collect premium.the wcj also noted that there is no insurance policy exclusion for special employees in california.
remedytemp,jacuzzi,assurance and casualty petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.the contentions included that joint and several liability and insurance coverage for special employees like miceli under the assurance policy ended upon compliance with section and section,subdivision d,which is not changed by the subsequent insolvency of reliance or ciga status.moreover,jacuzzi paid premium through remedytemp and ciga collected premium from the insurers catapano also testified that the assurance policy was not intended to be other available insurance under section,subdivision c,and the wcj decision is contrary to the intent of the parties and the legislature.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj added that jacuzzi did not directly pay premium to reliance,and choosing insurers that fail and whether to indemnify are business decisions.in any event,ciga funds are unavailable if there is other applicable insurance,and the assurance policy provided unlimited coverage.
the wcab in banc affirmed the wcj.the wcab explained that general and special employers are jointly and severally liable to special employees for workers compensation under kowalski and mcfarland.although reliance as an insurer would have been solely liable under section had it remained solvent,ciga is not an insurer and its obligations are not the same as the insolvent carrier according to case law such as industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.th,d industrial indemnity and denny,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d denny instead,ciga obligations are controlled by sections et and not by section.
the wcab also interpreted section,subdivision d as shielding properly insured employers from civil,criminal or other penalties,while allowing alternative ways of securing required workers compensation insurance.the wcab reasoned that,aha assurance did not collect premiums from jacuzzi for the employees supplied by remedytemp,and it is fair to say that jacuzzi,aha,remedytemp and reliance did not expect that the aha policy would cover the temporary employees supplied to jacuzzi by remedytemp.nevertheless,the aha policy contains no explicit exclusion of the temporary employees,and the fact that aha collected no premium for them does not prevent aha from becoming liable for their workers compensation benefits.
the wcab also rejected catapano opinion that coverage was not intended without premium,since insurers never intend to cover claims of insurers which become insolvent.the wcab questioned whether the legal relationship of the parties prior to reliance insolvency is determinative,since ciga liability arises after insurer insolvency.the wcab concluded that the assurance policy is other available insurance within the meaning of section,subdivision c,and affirmed ciga dismissal.the wcab reasoned that any adverse consequences to the agreements or business of the contracting parties is best addressed by the legislature.
remedytemp,jacuzzi,assurance and casualty petition for writ of review.
jacuzzi,assurance and casualty contend that joint and several liability was extinguished by compliance with section and section,subdivision d.in regards to section,casualty argues that ciga is an insurer for insolvency,and the statute applies broadly between insurers including ciga.insurer joint and several liability also does not extend to employers under county of los angeles general employer solely liable under section.
in regards to section,subdivision d,jacuzzi argues that compliance ends any continuing employer obligation under division four of the labor code.based on the introductory broad language of the statute,for purposes of this division,including sections and,employees excluded from workers compensation under section is expanded to include special employees such as miceli.employers are similarly relieved of workers compensation obligations under sections and assurance adds that by securing workers compensation insurance through reliance,jacuzzi satisfied its obligation to special employees like miceli under section according to la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d,la jolla beach tennis club no coverage or duty to defend under workers compensation policy for civil suit alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy and employers mutual liability ins.corporation cal th,d,employers mutual remanded to determine whether subcontract provided for litigation attorney fees between subcontractor workers compensation insurer and defendant general contractor.
petitioners further contend that section and section,subdivision d are contained in the assurance policy under premium,pursuant to section et and city of torrance workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,city of torrance contract to provide workers compensation insurance intended to incorporate changes in applicable law including future amendment of section.petitioners argue that their compliance with the assurance policy terms acts as an exclusion of coverage,so that another expressed exclusion of special employees as required by the wcab is redundant.the wcab also found that the contracting parties intended only reliance to cover special employees like miceli,which should be enforced since it is supported by substantial evidence such as catapano testimony,the service agreement,alternate employment endorsement and assurance policy.even if the assurance policy language is ambiguous,the intent of the parties controls 
in addition,catapano testified that assurance did not intend coverage because premium based on payroll is precluded for special employees like miceli under the policy.premium determines coverage according to reynolds excess or secondary insurer which received premium liable retroactive premium covering first of loss not ciga covered claim,ross canadian indemnity ins.d.ross ciga not an insurer that relieves liability of secondary insurer which received premium,and industrial indemnity ciga not liable for part of cumulative injury period for which other insurers jointly and severally liable and received premium.ciga collected premium for reliance insolvency,and thus is obligated to fulfill the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer while spreading the risk.the wcab decision gives ciga a windfall while assurance is doubly burdened.
amicus curiae briefs were also filed in support of petitioners.amici emphasize the business and economic advantages provided by temporary staffing agencies,which typically provide workers compensation insurance for special employees.the wcab decision undermines industry and the intent of the parties and legislature under section and section,subdivision d.if the court affirms the wcab,the decision should be limited prospectively to avoid petitions to reopen prior awards 
ciga answers that section is expressly limited to insurers,and it is not a licensed insurer of employers for profit but pays only covered claims on behalf of insolvent insurers and the public as set forth by section.section also does not address joint and several liability of employers as stated by the supreme court in mcfarland at pages,to.although section,subdivision d addresses employer liability,the statute and legislative history limit the relief provided to civil and criminal liabilities.
ciga also contends that assurance and jacuzzi intended unlimited coverage by entering into a standard california form workers compensation insurance policy under fyne and section et a limited policy contains an exclusionary form endorsement under section et and california code of regulations,title,sections to limited coverage was not intended because the service agreement and insurance policies involved different parties and dates,and assurance was not aware of the other agreements or of the remedytemp employees.the wcab also correctly found catapano testimony of intent and coverage unreliable,because he did not know california law and was incompetent to establish jacuzzi intent.
ciga also denies that compliance with section or section,subdivision d acts as an exclusion of insurance coverage under the assurance policy.insurance policy exclusions must be conspicuous,plain and clear and the premium part of the assurance policy does not meet any of these requirements.section is also not an exclusion contained in the assurance policy because section only incorporates sections to,which begin by stating that every such contract or policy shall contain a clause in addition,section,subdivision d permits jacuzzi to acquire alternative insurance protection under the reliance policy.
ciga also disputes that premium determines outcome.assurance chose not to charge premium for business reasons,and insurers are liable regardless of premium in cases involving cumulative injury under section a trainee before being hired and paid an independent contractor ruled an employee as a matter of law coverage by estoppel or the insured inability to pay due to bankruptcy employers can avoid such results by or insuring with state compensation insurance fund nor should this court decision be limited prospectively,since the issues are of first impression and the existing rights of employees and employers are not affected so that petitions to reopen will be filed.
additional briefing requested by the court 
this court requested additional briefing from the parties in order to address the following questions.
could american home assurance have excluded special employees such as miceli from coverage under the workers compensation insurance policy by endorsement or other means if so,by what legal authority or regulation,california code of regulations,title,section et.
could american home assurance have charged premium in the event there is coverage for special employees such as miceli by endorsement or other modification to the workers compensation insurance policy if so,by what legal authority or regulation 
remedytemp responds that special employees can be excluded from insurance coverage by endorsement under the notice statutes of title and section,subdivision e the parties complied with the notice statutes and section,subdivision d since jacuzzi affirmed coverage through reliance.a separate exclusionary endorsement is unnecessary because jacuzzi knew it was protected and miceli will receive benefits.the assurance policy also precludes premium where there is proof of insurance coverage for special employees not on payroll,and the reliance policy is the proof.
jacuzzi responds that coverage for special employees like miceli can not be excluded under any circumstances,which includes the procedures under title,sections and,subdivision a on the other hand,assurance could have charged premium under section et but did not do so.
assurance answers that only a properly completed california approved form endorsement form under title,section could have been used to exclude insurance coverage for remedytemp employees.however,the service agreement is limited to certain locations and employees and if another jacuzzi location hired a remedytemp employee there could be exposure to civil liability.a form endorsement can also exclude employees by name,but this would require thousands of forms.there is no form endorsement that allows modification of the premium part of the assurance policy.
casualty adds that a limiting endorsement presumably could be drafted and approved pursuant to title,sections and.if coverage is extended to special employees such as miceli,assurance is entitled to charge additional premium under sections et.
ciga replies that only form can be used to exclude special employees like miceli under title,sections,subdivision e and,subdivision a.ciga suggests that after the phrase this policy does not insure,routine language could be added such as special employees of the named insured whose general employer,remedytemp,has secured payment of compensation for those employees pursuant to california labor code section.the doi must approve the completed form pursuant to title,section in order to charge premium for special employees like miceli,part of the assurance policy must be modified,such as by deleting the last sentence of paragraph of subpart remuneration which states,this paragraph will not apply if you give us proof that the employers of these persons lawfully secured their workers compensation obligations.
the court granted petitioners review and issued a decision affirming the wcab dismissal of ciga.the court explained that under the statutory scheme and fyne,unlimited insurance coverage was provided by the assurance policy,absent an approved form endorsement excluding coverage for special employees like miceli.thus,the assurance policy was other available insurance under section,subdivision c.
petitioners timely petitioned for rehearing alleging that assurance attempted to use form to exclude insurance coverage for special employees of another insured,which was rejected by the wcirb this court vacated its decision,granted rehearing and requested additional information from the wcirb and doi.
responses to questions posed by this court 
in connection with rehearing of this matter,the court wrote the wcirb and doi and requested written responses to the following questions.
where general and special employers are insured for workers compensation under separate policies can special employees be excluded from coverage under the special employer workers compensation insurance policy if so,can form be used to exclude coverage for special employees what information should form provide 
is there another endorsement form that should be used to exclude coverage for special employees,and what information should the form provide 
the wcirb responded that form has been rarely used in the past,but a properly completed form potentially could be used to exclude insurance coverage for special employees.the form must indicate that the special employer affirmed in writing compensation was secured through the general employer insurer.form should also provide a careful description of the excluded special employees.an insurer could draft a form endorsement that complies with the applicable regulations,or use california approved form endorsement form that excludes insurance coverage for special employees by name.
the doi agreed with the wcirb response,and added that the use of limiting and restricting endorsements should be very carefully monitored to ensure coverage for every employee.the doi suggested that the wcirb might draft a generic form to be used by insurers.
petitioners replied that workers compensation insurance and notice was provided pursuant to section,subdivision d,which supercedes the form endorsement requirements of the wcirb and doi.the requirements are also impracticable,and a careful description of the excluded special employees is vague and provides little guidance.the wcirb rejection of assurance proposed form shows that the doi regulations have never been the solution,and the use of the form is uncertain and should be prospective.
ciga replied that requiring written affirmation of insurance coverage and a careful description of exclusions have been routine requirements by the wcirb and doi for years.thus,the requirements are reasonable and should be judicially noticed by this court 
discussion 
standards for reviewa.factual findings 
a decision based on factual findings which are supported by substantial evidence is affirmed by the reviewing court however,an appellate court is not bound by factual findings that are unreasonable,illogical,improbable,or inequitable when viewed in light of the entire record and the overall statutory scheme 
interpretation of statutes 
interpretation of governing statutes or application of the law to undisputed facts is decided de novo by the appellate court,even though the wcab construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous when interpreting statutes,the legislature intent should be determined and given effect 
plain meaning 
legislative intent is generally determined from the plain or ordinary meaning of the statutory language,unless the language or intent is uncertain the statute every word and clause should be given effect so that no part or provision is useless,deprived of meaning or contradictory in addition,interpretation of the statutory language should be consistent with the purpose of the statute and the statutory framework as a whole 
legislative history 
where the statutory language or the legislature intent is uncertain,rules of construction or legislative history aid in determining legislative intent and proper interpretation even if the statutory language is clear,a court is not prohibited from considering legislative history in determining whether the literal meaning is consistent with the purpose of the statute literal construction does not prevail over legislative intent in enacting a statute,the legislature is deemed to have been aware of existing statutes and judicial decisions interpreting those statutes finally,workers compensation law is generally liberally construed with the purpose of extending benefits to industrially injured workers 
interpretation of insurance policies 
the wcab is authorized to interpret insurance policies or contracts to determine coverage in workers compensation even though interpretation of a written instrument could be characterized as a question of fact,it is really a question of law and an independent function of the reviewing court,unless interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence while insurance policies have special features and rules,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply 
general contract rules 
contracts are to be interpreted so as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting,to the extent the mutual intent is ascertainable and lawful the mutual intent of the parties is to be ascertained solely from the contract that is reduced to writing,if possible the contract language controls if clear and explicit words are to be given their ordinary and popular meaning,unless used in a special or technical way by the parties technical words are interpreted as used by persons in the profession or business to which they relate,unless clearly used differently the contract is to be interpreted as a whole so as to give effect to every part,if practicable a contract may be interpreted by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates several related contracts may be interpreted together,if between the same parties and substantially part of one transaction 
a contract provision is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions,considering the plain meaning and context extrinsic or parol evidence may be used to explain the ambiguity,contract,context or related matter an ambiguity may be construed against the party which caused the uncertainty,or consistent with the reasonable expectation of the insured in insurance matters 
in addition,written provisions may be disregarded when through fraud,mistake or accident a contract fails to express the real intention of the parties in determining whether mutual mistake has occurred,a court may consider parol or extrinsic evidence if the contract requires reformation,it is to effect the mutual intent of the parties,so long as there is no prejudice to rights acquired by third persons in good faith and for value.a third person who acquired no rights for value and was not intended as a beneficiary,can not enforce the contract and is not prejudiced from reformation 
insurance policy rules 
insurance contracts have special features and rules.insurance policies typically have insuring clauses providing coverage,and if a claim does not fall within the terms of the insuring clauses no coverage exists an insurance policy may also have specific clauses excluding coverage,which generally follow insuring clauses and are conspicuous,plain and clear insurance policy exclusions are construed narrowly,while exceptions to those exclusions are construed broadly in favor of the insured if an exclusion is consistent with the reasonable expectation of coverage by the policyholder,special rules may not apply 
incorporation of statutory language 
if an insurance policy incorporates statutory language,the language is construed to implement the intent of the legislature and not against the insurer as if ambiguous 
certain rules and principles also apply uniquely to ciga.ciga is purely statutory and the scope of ciga duties,powers and liabilities are governed by section et ciga is also an involuntary unincorporated association of california admitted insurers,and is not an insurer and does not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes nor is ciga in the business of insurance,which includes issuing policies,collecting premiums,making profits or assuming contractual obligations under section,ciga collects premium from its member insurers to the extent necessary to pay statutorily defined covered claims on behalf of insolvent insurers under sections and finally,ciga was created as a last resort of limited financial protection for insureds and the public,and not as a fund for insurance companies or 
other available insurance 
although workers compensation insurance is covered by ciga statutes ciga liability does not include a claim that is covered by other workers compensation insurance other available workers compensation insurance includes solvent insurance or of an employer that is jointly and severally liable under the labor code,such as under section 
iii.joint and several liability 
the joint and several liability of general and special employers to their employees for workers compensation is well established agreements between general and special employers do not eliminate joint and several liability to employees historically,general and special insurers that were liable for payment of a workers compensation joint and several award resolved disputes over contribution or reimbursement in an independent civil suit receipt of premium was an equitable consideration in deciding which insurer was ultimately liable 
jacuzzi,assurance and casualty contend that employer joint and several liability for workers compensation is extinguished under section.we disagree.
section begins by stating,as between insurers of general and special employers the legislative history confirms that this language was intended to limit the statute to insurers.the statute was enacted to avoid civil litigation between liable general and special insurers under american motorists and state compensation ins.fund,without affecting the injured worker rights thus,section was not intended to change joint and several liability of general and special employers to their employees for workers compensation.as ciga points out,the supreme court reached the same conclusion in county of los angeles at page,and mcfarland at page.
the statutory language further provides that employer payrolls at the time of injury,not the time of entering into the insurance contract,determine whether the general or special insurer is liable for workers compensation.in other words,general and special insurer liability continues until the time of injury,when section determines which liable insurer provides compensation.the statutory language and legislative history do not indicate insurer liability ends when the policy issues,and then is reinstated should the employee be on the insured payroll at the time of injury.
casualty claims that employer joint and several liability does not extend to insurers according to county of los angeles.however,the supreme court mechanically applied section in holding the county solely liable because it had paid the injured worker earnings at the time of injury even if section ends liability at the time of injury,ciga is correct that it is not an insurer which is bound by the statute 
section,subdivision d 
petitioners also contend that compliance with section,subdivision d extinguishes joint and several liability.again,we disagree.
jacuzzi argues that the broad language in the beginning of section,subdivision d is intended to relieve employers of workers compensation obligations,similar to sections,and.ciga counters that the language and legislative history of section,subdivision d is limited to relieving employers from civil or criminal liabilities.
although the introductory language of section,subdivision d could be interpreted as jacuzzi suggests,the statute as a whole indicates that the legislature did not intend such a broad meaning the intent of the statute is to allow employees of multiple employers to be insured under a single workers compensation policy.an employer status of being insured or does not automatically result in relief from division four obligations,such as joint and several liability for workers compensation in addition,the statute lists specific liabilities that an employer avoids for compliance,and joint and several liability is not mentioned.
we also decline to assume that by enacting section,subdivision d,the legislature impliedly expanded limiting statutes such as section moreover,sections,and concern substitution of the insurer for a liable employer by invoking procedures that were not followed in this case.
assurance similarly argues that joint and several liability is extinguished by securing payment of compensation under section,subdivision d,since this also satisfies section,la jolla beach tennis club and employers mutual.as we have stated previously,securing required workers compensation insurance does not relieve the employer of liability to the employee for benefits.on the contrary,payment of compensation under the policy is based upon jacuzzi liability to special employees such as miceli.
moreover,la jolla beach tennis club does not address employer joint and several liability for workers compensation.the supreme court at page simply confirmed that employers can secure payment of compensation under section by purchasing workers compensation insurance or.while employers mutual at page,d,adds that employers which comply with section are relieved of liability for compensation,the topic being addressed by the court is insurer subrogation and witkin is cited witkin explains that an insurer assumes employer liability under sections,and,and the employer rights are then subrogated to the insurer under section.sections,and are not determinative in this case for the reasons we stated previously.
the legislative history also clarifies the scope of section,subdivision d the legislature sought to eliminate duplicate insurance coverage and premium that is required to avoid tort liability under the rationale of douglas oil.douglas oil did not involve joint and several liability for workers compensation.
iv.the assurance policy 
petitioners contend further that the assurance policy is not other available insurance under section,subdivision c,based on the contractual intent of the parties,policy exclusions that include section and section,subdivision d,and lack of premium.ciga concurs with the wcab that the assurance policy provides unlimited coverage absent an exclusionary form endorsement under the statutory scheme.we shall apply the rules of insurance policy interpretation to determine whether the assurance policy provides other available insurance coverage within the meaning of section,subdivision c.
a.the mutual intent of jacuzzi and assurance 
briefly,the insurance policy should be interpreted so as to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties at the time of entering into the contract policy language normally determines the meaning of the policy and mutual intent of the parties if the language is ambiguous,extrinsic evidence may be used to clarify the ambiguity 
part one of the assurance policy 
under part compensation insurance,subpart b,the assurance policy states we will pay promptly when due the benefits required of you by the workers compensation law.this language would normally be construed to provide insurance coverage for workers compensation that jacuzzi legally owes its industrially injured employees according to workers compensation law as a special employer,jacuzzi is jointly and severally liable to its special employees for workers compensation which,as we have stated,is unchanged by section or section,subdivision d.
part five of the assurance policy 
petitioners argue that part of the assurance policy contains section and section,subdivision d according to section and city of torrance.even if language in part one of the assurance policy would normally extend insurance coverage to special employees,their compliance with these provisions acted as an exclusion of such coverage.therefore,the additional expressed exclusion required by the wcab is unnecessary.ciga responds that section applies only to sections through,and the premium part of the assurance policy is not an expressed exclusion of coverage that is conspicuous,plain and clear.
literally,part five of the assurance policy addresses premium subpart remuneration,paragraph permits premium based on payroll of the insured officers and employees.paragraph allows premium for all other persons whose work could result in liability under part one of the policy.the premium in paragraph is based on the insured payroll or the contract price for service and materials,unless proof is given that the employer of these persons lawfully secured workers compensation.
the assurance policy contains section 
the assurance policy language in part,subpart remuneration,appears to be based,at least in part,on section.if the employee whose work could result in part one liability is on the payroll of the general employer at the time of injury,the general insurer would be liable under section.in such a case,there would be no exposure to the special insurer or need for premium.
considering this policy language and section,we conclude that section is part of the assurance policy.inclusion by section does not appear to be limited to sections through.the assurance policy provides under part one,subpart f,that the insured is responsible for payment due to serious and willful misconduct,and section prohibits insurance for serious and willful misconduct.although we conclude that section is contained in the assurance policy,it does not mean ciga is liable.
the intent under section 
petitioners argue that their compliance with section under part of the assurance policy acted as an exclusion of insurance coverage for special employees like miceli.however,parties to a contract are presumed to have applied existing laws as well as judicial interpretations of those laws the same is true where insurance policy provisions incorporate statutory language that is required by law thus,the policy provisions pertaining to section include the meaning that employer joint and several liability to employees for workers compensation is not extinguished.moreover,exclusions of insurance coverage should be conspicuous,plain and clear and part five of the assurance policy addresses how premium is computed and collected.premium does not necessarily determine coverage finally,section only applies to insurers under county of los angeles and mcfarland,and ciga is not an insurer under isaacson.
the assurance policy contains section,subdivision d 
petitioners similarly argue that insurance coverage for special employees like miceli is excluded by their compliance with section,subdivision d,under part of the assurance policy.as we stated before,this language addresses payment of premium,and is not an expressed exclusion of insurance coverage that is conspicuous,plain and clear.in addition,section,subdivision d concerns insurance for employees of multiple employers under a single policy.while this policy language may apply to certain scenarios under section,subdivision d,the reference to payroll and other insurance seems more applicable to section.in addition,the assurance policy is a edition and section,subdivision d was enacted in.
nevertheless,part one of the assurance policy provides insurance coverage for benefits owed under workers compensation law.the workers compensation law includes the law in existence at the time the policy issues,or which is subsequently enacted if the policy language indicates this was intended by the parties the assurance policy period is after the enactment of section,subdivision d.
workers compensation law also includes division four of the labor code since section,subdivision d is contained in division four,the statute is part of the workers compensation law covered under part one of the assurance policy.
the intent under section,subdivision d 
petitioners also argue that compliance with section,subdivision d under the assurance policy means that only the reliance policy was intended to cover special employees like miceli.as pointed out by the wcab,however,section,subdivision d does not preclude alternative insurance.while the contractual agreements appear to comply with section,subdivision d,jacuzzi separately obtained the assurance policy without limiting endorsements 
petitioners argue further that the wcab in effect found that none of the contracting parties intended the assurance policy to provide coverage for special employees like miceli.petitioners assert that the wcab finding of this intent should be enforced,since it is supported by substantial evidence such as the agreements between the parties and catapano testimony.
however,the wcab statements regarding the intent of the parties is based on assurance inability to collect premium under the policy,and not due to compliance with section,subdivision d.the wcab also reasoned that insurers never intend to cover claims of insolvent insurers.
the statutory scheme for excluding insurance coverage 
since the wcab required an exclusionary form endorsement to establish the intent petitioners claim,and the wcj indicated such an endorsement is unavailable,the court requested additional briefing from the parties.the responses ranged from exclusionary form endorsements under the statutory scheme,such as form with the information required under title,section,subsection e,being applicable to inapplicable or impractical.
title,sections to seemed to set forth an established and practical statutory scheme,which could be applied to exclude insurance coverage for special employees like miceli under section,subdivision d title,section indicates that a form endorsement may be used when another california approved form endorsement is not applicable in accordance with the criteria set forth by title,section.title,section,subdivision e provides for a form endorsement that excludes insurance coverage for workers compensation,which the employer affirms in writing to the insurer is otherwise secured or legally uninsured.the insurer then submits the form endorsement with the required information to the wcirb,which in turn forwards the endorsement to the doi for approval within days under title,section.
a.the court initial decision.
the court granted review and after oral argument issued a decision,that the assurance policy and section,subdivision d should be interpreted in light of the established and practical statutory scheme for excluding insurance coverage by form endorsement we noted that in enacting section,subdivision d,the legislature is presumed to have considered the statutory scheme and judicial decisions that may affect implementation,which also applies to insurance policy language that contains the enactment as required by law we found nothing in section,subdivision d or the legislative history that indicated the legislature intended the statute to supercede or change the procedures under sections to and title,sections et.instead,the legislature most likely assumed that applicable procedures would be followed in obtaining insurance under section,subdivision d 
since nothing in the record substantiated that exclusionary form endorsements are inapplicable,or impractically require more for wcirb and doi approval than jacuzzi written affirmation special employees were covered by remedytemp insurer,the court concluded that the assurance policy provided unlimited coverage under the statutory scheme and fyne the court also concluded that absent an exclusionary form endorsement under the statutory scheme,the assurance policy was intended as alternative insurance protection,which is not foreclosed by section,subdivision d.thus,the court affirmed the wcab decision that the assurance policy is other available insurance under section,subdivision c,and the dismissal of ciga.
b.the court vacated the initial decision and granted rehearing.
petitioners timely requested rehearing based on the wcirb rejection of a form endorsement submitted by assurance in another matter.while the endorsement did not state the insured affirmed in writing that compensation was otherwise secured under title,section,subsection e,assurance response to the wcirb inquiry indicated there was other coverage.instead of clarifying further,the wcirb indicated that form was used inappropriately.
consequently,the court granted rehearing and requested input from the wcirb and doi,to address further whether form endorsements such as form are appropriate for excluding insurance coverage for special employees like miceli.the wcirb and doi provided written responses to our questions,and petitioners and ciga replied.
c.the wcirb and doi requirements.
although limiting or restricting workers compensation insurance by approved form endorsements is part of the statutory scheme the wcirb and doi indicate that it has not been the practice of industry to use such endorsements to exclude coverage for special employees.nevertheless,the wcirb and doi state that form endorsements such as form could be used in this manner,and would be approved if the required information is provided.
ciga has suggested that the informational requirements of form could have been met by assurance,by stating that payment of compensation for named insured special employees is secured by remedytemp as the general employer.assurance attempted to provide such information in another matter.however,the wcirb responded that the endorsement would be used inappropriately for this purpose,even though little else seems to be expressly required under title,sections and,subsection e,except written affirmation of other coverage by the named insured.
although the wcirb and doi acknowledge that form with such information is appropriate for excluding insurance coverage for special employees,they indicate a careful description of the excluded special employees is also required.while ciga asserts that this added requirement is routine and reasonable,the assertion is not corroborated by the record or information provided by the wcirb and doi.in addition,it is not expressly required by title,sections and,subsection e,and prior notice was not given to petitioners.we also agree with petitioners that a careful description of the excluded special employees is vague,and provides little guidance to ensure the practical compliance intended under the statutory scheme petitioners can not be held accountable for a legal requirement that is uncertain and imposed without notice,nor for omission of a form endorsement under a statutory scheme which includes such a requirement 
coverage for special employees like miceli was not intended.
the wcab and ciga do not dispute that insurance coverage for special employees can be excluded by an insurer and a special employer with its own employees.otherwise,special employers with employees such as jacuzzi may not benefit from section,subdivision d.neither the statutory language or legislative history indicate that the legislature intended to limit section,subdivision d to special employers without employees.
the wcab concluded and ciga contends that a form endorsement such as form is required under fyne in order to exclude insurance coverage for special employees like miceli.for the reasons we stated previously,an exclusionary form endorsement such as form is not applicable in this case.therefore,the wcab decision is not based on substantial evidence,and we must determine the intent under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d as if exclusionary form endorsements under the statutory scheme do not apply.this distinguishes fyne.
while section,subdivision d expressly authorizes employees of multiple employers to be insured by a single workers compensation policy,the statutory language does not preclude an employer from obtaining alternative insurance protection therefore,jacuzzi and assurance could have intended to extend or exclude insurance coverage for special employees like miceli under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d.since the language and intent of the assurance policy in this regard is ambiguous the extrinsic evidence in this case may clarify the ambiguity,policy,context or related matters 
the service agreement,reliance policy and alternate employer endorsement establish that the intent under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d,was not to extend insurance coverage to special employees such as miceli in addition to the standard california form workers compensation insurance policy,which was procured by remedytemp pursuant to the service agreement and section,subdivision d,jacuzzi was directly protected by reliance as an additional insured under the alternate employer endorsement.thus,jacuzzi did not need,nor likely intend,direct protection by assurance as a named insured under the assurance policy.this conclusion is consistent with a policyholder reasonable expectation that the same insurance protection will not be duplicated and the avoidance of duplicate insurance coverage and premium as intended by the legislature under section,subdivision d 
for the same reasons,we conclude that assurance did not intend to extend insurance coverage to special employees such as miceli under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d.ciga argues that assurance could not have formed this intent,since there is no evidence assurance was aware of the other agreements or of remedytemp employees.however,the assurance policy is a boilerplate form that was approved by the doi the assurance policy also provides for circumstances that may qualify under section,subdivision d or section.for example,part one provides coverage for benefits required by workers compensation law.under part five,an insured is not charged premium where compensation is secured by the employer of employees for which the insurer could be liable therefore,we conclude that insurance coverage for special employees such as miceli was not intended under the assurance policy and section,subdivision d.
prospective application 
petitioners have also alleged that there will be serious adverse consequences on business and the temporary staffing industry in california if the wcab decision is affirmed,and separate form endorsements that exclude coverage for special employees like miceli are required.while we have decided that exclusionary form endorsements pursuant to the statutory scheme are not required under the facts presented,we decline to hold that such endorsements may not be applicable in other cases.the parties and industry now have notice of the issues,and also have the opportunity to remedy the situation with the wcirb,doi or the legislature.
disposition 
the assurance policy does not provide workers compensation insurance coverage for special employees such as miceli,and is not other available insurance within the meaning of section,subdivision c the dismissal of ciga by the wcab is reversed,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
