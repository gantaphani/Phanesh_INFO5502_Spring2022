having concluded a general contractor was not entitled to coverage as an additional insured under a policy held by one of its subcontractors,the trial court granted summary judgment in this subrogation action in favor of the subcontractor insurer,pacific insurance company pacific.in so doing,the court distinguished our decision in acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d syufy,which addressed identical contractual language.we conclude the undisputed facts of this case satisfy the minimal causal connection required to trigger coverage under the additional insured provision at issue,and therefore we reverse the judgment.
background 
vitton construction company,vitton agreed to serve as the general contractor on a project to construct a warehouse for catalytica bay view,catalytica in east palo alto.vitton entered a subcontract agreement with pacific erectors,pei for,among other things,the c utting and installation of roof opening frames.the subcontract required pei to carry general liability insurance covering all operations by or on behalf of pei and including coverage for premises and operations products and completed operations contractual liability broad form property damage including completed operations explosion,collapse and underground hazards and personal injury liability.the subcontract further required that the general liability policy obtained by pei name vitton and the project owner as additional insureds.
a division of cna insurance companies cna issued pei a commercial general liability policy with a million limit.the policy included a blanket additional insured endorsement,which defined as an additional insured any person or organization pei was contractually obligated to add as an additional insured,provided that such a party would only be considered an additional insured with respect to liability arising out of y our work for that additional insured by or for you.in addition,the cna policy included an endorsement that specifically named vitton and the project owner as additional insureds with respect to liability arising out of pei work on the catalytica warehouse.
pei also obtained an umbrella insurance policy with a million limit from pacific.in this policy,pacific agreed to pay damages its insured became liable to pay after the limits of the insured underlying insurance were exhausted.the policy included in the definition of who is an insured parties who were covered by the underlying insurance policy.specifically,the pacific policy defined as an insured a ny person or organization who is an insured under any policy of underlying insurance,subject to all the limitations upon coverage and all other policy terms and conditions of such underlying insurance and this policy.
pursuant to its subcontract,pei laid decking for the roof structure of the catalytica warehouse and cut holes in the decking for skylights and hvac equipment both of which would be installed by another contractor.pei completed its work and left the jobsite on february.after pei left,vitton employees attached wood nailers and curbs to the roof openings but did not cover the openings themselves.on february,aaron anderson,an employee of a roofing subcontractor,was working on the roof of the catalytica warehouse when he fell through one of the uncovered holes pei had cut in the roof decking.anderson sustained serious injuries in the fall and sued vitton,pei and catalytica.anderson expert witnesses testified in deposition that the general contractor is responsible for maintaining a safe construction site,and they faulted vitton for failing to cover the roof openings,or make pei cover the roof openings,at the catalytica site.in addition,vitton president howard fuchs acknowledged that vitton,as general contractor,had a responsibility to ensure no one was hurt on the job.
the parties agreed to settle anderson case for a total sum of million.cna,as the primary insurer of pei,agreed to pay the policy limit of million,as did gerling america insurance company,the primary insurer of vitton.vitton excess insurance carrier,aiu insurance company aiu,funded the remainder of the settlement.pacific did not contribute to the settlement.vitton and aiu then brought the instant action against pacific,seeking equitable indemnity,subrogation,contribution and declaratory relief on the ground that vitton was an additional insured entitled to coverage under the umbrella policy pacific issued to pei.after pacific answered the complaint,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.in addition to maintaining vitton was an additional insured under the pacific policy,aiu argued it was entitled to recover subrogation or contribution from pacific as a matter of law.pacific argued vitton was not an additional insured covered by the policy because vitton liability for the anderson accident did not arise out of work performed by pei.the trial court agreed with pacific and granted its motion for summary judgment without reaching the question of aiu equitable rights against pacific 
discussion 
summary judgment is proper only if there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a court must strictly construe the moving party papers and liberally construe those of the opposing party to determine if they raise a triable issue of material fact.citation.calhoon lewis th,d.on appeal,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.guz bechtel national cal th,d.when there is no dispute as to the relevant facts,we exercise our independent judgment as to their legal effect.syufy,supra,th at,d.as in the syufy case,the issue before us concerns the meaning and application of language in an insurance policy,which is purely an issue of law.ibid.because pacific umbrella policy provided that coverage extended to any entity that was insured by an underlying insurance policy,the only question on appeal is whether vitton was covered under the additional insured endorsement of the cna policy.
insurance policies are construed according to the same principles that govern interpretation of other contracts.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.thus,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.citation.if possible,we infer this intent solely from the written provisions of the insurance policy.citation.if the policy language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.a policy provision is ambiguous only if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions despite the plain meaning of its terms within the context of the policy as a whole.citation.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d.if a provision is determined to be ambiguous,t he court may then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.citation.ibid.
in syufy,we applied these principles to interpret precisely the same contractual language at issue in the present,an endorsement extending coverage to a party as an additional insured but only with respect to liability arising out of your work for that insured by or for you where the terms you and your referred to the named insured.syufy,supra,th at,d.we did not specifically decide whether the language is ambiguous in light of the fact that it would be necessary to construe any such ambiguity liberally,in favor of finding coverage.id.at,d but see paul fire marine ins.american dynasty surplus lines ins.th,d finding ambiguous,with respect to the facts of the case,an additional insured endorsement that limited coverage to liability arising out of the named insured ongoing operations performed for the additional insured.based on a review of several cases,we observed california courts have consistently given a broad interpreta
