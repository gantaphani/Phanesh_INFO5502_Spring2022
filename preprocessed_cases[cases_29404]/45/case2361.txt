insurance code section provides that the applicable statute of limitations is tolled when advance or partial payment is made to an injured and unrepresented person without notifying him of the applicable limitations period.in this first impression case we hold that the tolling provisions of section apply to the limitations period for medical malpractice actions.
coastal surgical institute appeals from the judgment entered after a jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent.it contends that the trial court erroneously determined that section tolled the statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions.appellant also contends that the trial court erroneously denied its motion to conduct a bifurcated jury trial on its statute of limitations affirmative defense,and refused to instruct the jury on apportioning fault between appellant and ruhof corporation,an alleged nonparty tortfeasor.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on september,a doctor performed surgery on respondent knee at appellant surgical facility.after the surgery,respondent knee became infected.the infection was caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.this bacteria was subsequently found on a sponge manufactured by ruhof corporation ruhof that had been used to clean surgical equipment prior to respondent surgery.the bacteria that infected respondent knee had apparently survived the sterilization process performed by appellant employees.
on october,appellant paid respondent for the medical expenses he had incurred in treating the knee infection.respondent did not sign an agreement releasing appellant from liability.appellant concedes that,at the time of payment,respondent was not represented by counsel and it did not give him written notice of the applicable statute of limitations for a medical malpractice action.

section applies to medical malpractice actions 
section provides in relevant part no advance payment or partial payment of damages made by any person,or made by his insurer,as an accommodation to an injured person shall be construed as an admission of liability by the person claimed against,or of that person or the insurer recognition of such liability any person,including any insurer,who makes such an advance or partial payment,shall at the time of beginning payment,notify the recipient thereof in writing of the statute of limitations applicable to the cause of action which such recipient may bring against such person as a result of such injury failure to provide such written notice shall operate to toll any such applicable statute of limitations or time limitations from the time of such advance or partial payment until such written notice is actually given.that notification shall not be required if the recipient is represented by an attorney.
section is primarily designed to encourage early payment of damages without fear of admitting liability.citation.the legislative purpose of the written notice requirement is to prevent an injury victim from being lulled into a false sense of complacency about the need to sue because an advance or partial payment by the defendant or his insurer shows their apparent cooperativeness.citation.doe doe th.
appellant contends that section does not apply to medical malpractice actions code of civil procedure sections hereafter section and hereafter section provide statute of limitations and tolling provisions for medical malpractice cases.they are specific and unique to medical malpractice cases and no others.they are the controlling statutes in this matter and define how a medical malpractice action is tolled.there is no question that the l egislature intended that sections and are the only statutes which permit tolling of a statute of limitations in a medical malpractice case.
sections and are part of the medical injury compensation reform act micra,enacted in.belton bowers ambulance service cal th.section provides that the time for commencement of a medical malpractice action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following upon proof of fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.section provides that a medical malpractice action may not be commenced unless the defendant has been given days prior notice of the intention to commence the action,subd.a.if the notice is served within days of the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,the time for commencement of the action shall be extended days from the service of the notice,subd.d.
pursuant to belton bowers ambulance service,supra,cal th,the tolling provisions of section apply to the limitations period of section.in belton our supreme court held that a similar provision for prisoners tolled the same statute of limitations,at.the court reasoned no tolling provision outside of micra can extend the maximum time period that section establishes.citations.here,however,the plaintiff filed his complaint after the statutory period expired but well within the statute maximum.thus,he is not attempting to extend that maximum.rather,he seeks statutory tolling of the period,at.the listing of specified tolling rules in section implicitly excludes others,but these limits apply only to tolling rules which extend the total limitations period beyond three years in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following the plain language of section does not purport to limit tolling which extends the total limitations period less than or up to three years,at.
like section,section also does not purport to limit tolling that extends the limitations period.accordingly,the tolling provisions of section can extend the period of section up to a maximum of three years from the date of injury.respondent filed his complaint after the statutory period expired but well within the statute maximum.belton bowers ambulance service,supra,cal th at.
appellant asserts that,if section applies to medical malpractice actions,it was required to advise respondent when the statute of limitations would expire.such a requirement,appellant argues,would open up a can of worms.but section requires no more than that the payor notify the payee in writing of the applicable statute of limitations,not the actual expiration date.thus,it would have been sufficient if appellant had informed respondent in writing of the and periods as provided in section.at oral argument,appellant asserted that the application of section to medical malpractice actions would forever expose doctors to potential suit.not so.as indicated by our supreme court in belton bowers ambulance service,supra,cal th at,the maximum limitations period is not altered by our holding.
appellant was not entitled to a jury trial on 
its statute of limitations affirmative defense 
the trial court denied appellant motion to conduct a bifurcated jury trial on its statute of limitations affirmative defense.appellant contends that,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,this matter should have been decided by the jury because it involved disputed facts.this section provides that,if the answer in a medical malpractice action pleads that the action is barred by the stat
