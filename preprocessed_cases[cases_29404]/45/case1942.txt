the question we address here is to what extent,under california law,patent infringement claims invoke an insurers duty to defend under a commercial general liability policy.homedics,homedics,appeals the dismissal of its complaint against ace fire underwriters insurance company formerly known as cigna fire underwriters insurance company ace for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see fed.civ.pro.b.homedics was sued in federal district court for infringing the design patents of its competitor nikken,nikken.homedics claimed that nikken claims of patent infringement triggered ace duty to defend,under homedics commercial general liability policy.the district court disagreed and found that the policy at issue could not reasonably be read to include the nikken claims.the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.we agree that the underlying patent infringement suits do not invoke ace duty to defend and accordingly affirm the district court.
on november,nikken,filed a complaint in the district court for the central district of california alleging that homedics had directly infringed,contributorily infringed and induced others to infringe its patent in a certain therapeutic magnetic device,apparently used in alternative medical procedures nikken i.on november,nikken filed for a temporary restraining order and an order preliminarily enjoining homedics from selling its allegedly infringing products.in its brief in support of its motion,nikken appears to allege that homedics directly infringed its patent by offering to sell infringing products through advertising to show irreparable injury,it alleged that homedics sale of its products was severely hurting its business.nikken made similar allegations in several other documents in the patent infringement actions.
on august,nikken filed a second action nikken ii against homedics alleging infringement of a different but related patent.this action was based on similar activity as nikken 
on july,homedics brought an action in the central district of california against valley forge insurance company,transcontinental insurance company,continental insurance company and ace fire underwriters insurance company.the complaint sought damages for breach of contract and a declaration that homedics was entitled to a defense of the nikken action by the insurance companies.the case was dismissed against all defendants except ace on october.on october,the court preliminarily found that ace was obligated under its insurance policy to pay for the defense of nikken 
on november,homedics brought a second action against ace seeking a declaration that ace was obligated to defend homedics in nikken ii.homedics then moved to consolidate both its cases against ace.ace moved the court to reconsider its october,order declaring that ace was obligated to defend homedics in nikken i,in light of three significant cases recently decided in the courts of california.in a january,minute order,the district court granted homedics motion to consolidate its two cases against ace.it then reversed its october,order and dismissed both cases for failure to state a claim,under rule b.homedics took this appeal.
at all times relevant to the nikken i and nikken ii actions,homedics was covered by an ace commercial general liability policy.homedics claims that the nikken i and nikken ii actions are covered by the commercial general liability policy as the actions allege both advertising injuries and personal injuries as understood in the policy.the relevant language is laid out below

standard of review 
a dismissal under rule b is reviewed de novo.see zimmerman city of oakland,cir.dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.conley gibson,d.
choice of law 
in a diversity case,a federal district court is to apply the law of the forum state for choice of law purposes.see klaxon stentor electric.as this is an appeal from a district court sitting in california,california choice of law rules apply.
the district court stated that both california and michigan law applied to this controversy but then applied only california law as it found there was no conflict between michigan law and california law on all material issues.neither party argues that there is a conflict between california and michigan law when neither party identifies a meaningful conflict between california law and the law of another state,california courts apply california law.see shields singleton,th,d.consul,solide enterprises,cir when neither party disputes california law applies,court defers to parties glickman collins,cal d,same.we accordingly apply california law as we predict the california supreme court would,taking guidance from intermediate california appellate decisions.see arizona power,berkeley,cir.
discussion 
the precise issue in the instant appeal is not whether ace would have to pay for any money damages levied against homedics as a result of the underlying patent infringement actions.the issue here is whether ace must pay for the defense of these actions.it is well settled that,in insurance contracts,the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.horace mann ins.barbara,cal th,d.an insurer is under a duty to defend any suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.gray zurich ins,cal d,italics in original.
homedics points to two portions of its commercial general liability policy with ace to support its argument that nikken is seeking damages that are potentially within the coverage of its policy.first,it claims that nikken patent infringement claims fall within the coverage for advertising injury arising out of misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.second,it claims that nikken patent infringement claims fall within coverage for personal injury arising out of oral or written publication of material that disparages an organization goods,products or services.
advertising injury 
the question of to what extent,if any,language in commercial general liability policies insuring against advertising injuries covers patent infringement claims has been heavily litigated in recent years.see generally o strager,barry thomas newman,hornbook on insurance coverage disputes b ed.for a court to find a covered advertising injury it must find that there is a causal connection between allegations in the third party complaint and the insured advertising activities and the allegations in the third party complaint fit into one of the enumerated offenses in the commercial general liability policy that could be considered advertising injuries.see bank of the west superior court,cal th,d,mez indust.pacific ins,th,d.
all of our previous opinions that have addressed this issue reject that insurers have a duty to defend patent infringement suits on the basis of advertising injury clauses in commercial general liability policies.see,simply fresh fruit,services,cir a s a matter of law,patent infringement can not occur in the course of an insured advertising activities.everest and jennings,american motorists ins,cir.the foundational basis for the holdings in these that advertising can not give rise to a cause of action for direct patent been invalidated by recent changes in patent law.
