the university of washington medical center and seventeen other hospitals from washington state hospitals,appeal the district court judgment upholding the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary exclusion of certain populations from federal entitlement calculations.we affirm this judgment.though the patients at issue in this case are mentioned in washington medicaid plan,they are not eligible for medical assistance under that plan.
background 
medicare and medicaid 
medicare is a federally funded insurance program designed to cover older and disabled individuals.et since the,medicare has reimbursed hospitals primarily through the prospective payment system pps based upon what it would cost an efficient hospital to treat a patient with a given diagnosis.tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,stat.codified at.however,the medicare statute adjusts the pps reimbursement to account for factors that may make a provider costs higher than average.d.
the medicare disproportionate share medicare dsh adjustment increases reimbursements to hospitals that serve a disproportionately high number of medicare patients.id.d f the adjustment represents a percentage increase in a hospital reimbursement computed by adding two fractions.the first,which is not at issue in this case,represents the percentage of time a hospital spends serving medicare patients entitled to supplemental security income.id.d f vi i.the second represents 
the fraction expressed as a percentage,the numerator of which is the number of the hospital patient days which consist of patients who were eligible for medical assistance under a state plan approved under subchapter xix of the social security act,but who were not entitled to benefits under medicare,and the denominator of which is the total number the hospital patient days.
id.d f vi ii.a state plan approved under subchapter xix is the state medicaid plan.the result of this adjustment is that a hospital receives a higher reimbursement per medicare patient as it treats more medicaid patients.
medicaid is a federal grant program that encourages states to provide certain medical services on behalf of families with dependent children and on behalf of aged,blind,or disabled individuals,whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.while the program is entirely optional,to receive federal financial participation ffp for the care of the indigent,a state must meet certain requirements.see.
first,the state must submit a comprehensive plan to the secretary for approval and must meet certain other procedural requirements.b.only after the state plan is approved is the state eligible for ffp.
second,the state must provide minimum coverage for the categorically needy,generally those eligible for welfare aged,blind,or disabled individuals who are qualified for social security disability benefits and pregnant women and children.spry thompson,cir internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.it may also choose to provide such services for the medically needy,individuals who are above the poverty line but would not be if they were not assisted with medical expenses.id.internal quotation marks and footnote omitted.the secretary reimburses the state for the care of the categorically and medically needy based on the federal medical assistance percentage.a.
while the federal medical assistance percentage is the primary form of medicaid reimbursement,medicaid like medicare provides an adjustment for hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of individuals medicaid dsh.however,the funding mechanism for the medicaid dsh adjustment differs from the medicare dsh adjustment.rather than paying on a per patient basis,as in the medicare dsh adjustment,the medicaid statute allocates to each state a specific lump sum.id.f.a state medicaid plan must define how hospitals receive medicaid dsh reimbursements from that allotment.id.a.
a hospital may qualify for medicaid dsh reimbursements in one of two ways.the first is if the hospital medicaid inpatient utilization rate is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the state.id.b a.a hospital medicaid inpatient utilization rate is simply the percentage of a hospital patients who are eligible for care under the state medicaid plan.id.b.
the second is if the hospital utilization rate exceeds percent.id.b b.a hospital utilization rate is the percentage of a hospital patients who are eligible under the state medicaid plan,receive cash subsidies directly from state and local governments for medical care,or are charity patients.id.b.
because a state must define how it will distribute medicaid dsh funds,a state medicaid plan will often describe individuals who are neither categorically nor medically needy because they are either charity patients or eligible for direct cash subsidies from state or local governments.this case centers on whether such individuals can be considered eligible for medical assistance under a state plan within the meaning of d vi ii if a state uses its medicaid dsh reimbursements to indirectly fund their care.
washington medicaid plan 
washington has chosen to extend hospital care beyond the categorically and medically needy to two other groups at issue in this case the general gau and the medically indigent mi.the gau and mi populations have incomes similar to the categorically and medically needy.but the hospitals admit that they are ineligible for traditional medicaid because they are not aged,blind or disabled,and they do not have dependent children.see.
it is undisputed that these programs began as initiatives.but facing budgetary constraints in,washington sought ways to alleviate the financial burden of covering these individuals.because the gau and mi populations did not qualify for traditional medicaid,washington amended its state medicaid plan to indirectly fund their care using federal medicaid dsh dollars in doing so,it placed the supervision of the gau and mi programs under the purview of the washington department of social and health services department.this agency uses a consolidated reimbursement system,creating much of the confusion in this case.but key differences remain between medicaid reimbursements for categorically and medically needy patients and washington program for the care of the gau and mi populations.
when a hospital treats a poor patient,it submits a claim to the department.the department then determines into which,if any,of the four categories,categorically needy,medically needy,gau or mi the particular patient falls.the department then reimburses the hospital based upon a preestablished formula for the appropriate program.the department determines the reimbursement for a gau or mi patient by dividing washington medicaid dsh allotment by the anticipated number of patients covered by these programs.that is,rather than distributing medicaid dsh money to medicaid dsh hospitals through a lump sum or at higher rates for their categorically or medically needy patients,washington uses federal medicaid dsh dollars to reimburse those hospitals at a much discounted rate for what would otherwise be mi or gau patients 
the hospitals argue that because medicaid dollars subsidize the care of these individuals,they should be considered medicaid patients in the calculation of their medicare dsh reimbursements.
prior proceedings 
medicare funds are distributed to providers through a system of fiscal intermediaries,usually insurance companies.b.the hospitals sought to include their gau and mi patients in their medicare dsh reimbursement calculations.the hospitals intermediary disagreed with the hospitals interpretation of the medicare dsh statute and excluded the gau and the mi populations for fiscal years.as a result,the hospitals received a lower medicare dsh reimbursement than they expected.
the hospitals administratively appealed the intermediary decision to the provider reimbursement review board board,which hears disputes between providers and their intermediaries.a.the board found in favor of the hospitals.ordinaril
