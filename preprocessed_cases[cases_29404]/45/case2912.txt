physicians interindemnity cooperative corporation picc and physicians interindemnity trust pit collectively were formed pursuant to insurance code section.a trust fund was established and funded.subsequently,the trust fund became and many members refused to pay assessments.
appellant dale stoops stoops was a of.because of the trust fund financial situation,stoops did not receive a defense or indemnification with regard to a medical malpractice lawsuit.stoops contended that had the other members paid the money they owed for assessments,he would have been able to receive coverage for the malpractice lawsuit.stoops contended that he had the right to sue directly those members who failed to pay assessments.he sought to recover the funds he expended with regard to the medical malpractice lawsuit.
we agree with the trial court that stoops may not sue the other members directly and we affirm a judgment entered in favor of the other members.
factual and procedural background 
the trust fund,and the receivership.
picc,an interindemnity cooperative corporation,was formed to provide members protection from medical malpractice claims.each picc member signed an agreement entitled physicians interindemnity trust agreement hereinafter pit agreement and cited as pit ag,forming pit.both entities were formed and followed the dictates of insurance code section.the members paid initial contributions and thereafter paid assessments,which were deposited into a trust fund that was used to cover defense and indemnity for medical malpractice lawsuits.
in september,the pit board of trustees approved a plan of winding up and termination of pit due to a determination that an assessment of million was necessary to replenish the trust fund and to raise sufficient funds for defense and indemnity.the plan included a proposal that the members would obtain malpractice insurance through a specified insurance company.the plan was approved and pit ceased providing coverage to members for future acts.
in march,in an action brought in the los angeles superior court by the department of corporations,was ordered into receivership.
david gill gill was appointed receiver of.the order appointing receiver gave gill the authority to enforce and collect all debts of the trust and picc,including assessments thereafter,gill deemed that the trust fund had insufficient funds to pay debts to defend against,and indemnify for,malpractice claims.gill sent a letter to all members demanding assessment payments.only percent of the members responded.pit members stopped receiving coverage for malpractice lawsuits.
in july,gill filed the underlying action gill abbassi against all members of.gill sought to recover more than million,including funds owed as unpaid assessments levied by the trust board of trustees,as well as sums for receiver assessment.
approximately members of were represented by one law firm,the law firm of aguilar sebastinelli.these members appear as respondents herein.
stoops and his.
stoops was a member of.in december,deborah and peter bonilla filed a medical malpractice action against stoops.pit undertook the defense.in,the bonillas made a million demand.after learning that the case against him was one of probable liability,stoops demanded pit settle the lawsuit for an amount up to and including the million coverage limit provided in the pit agreement.pit never made a settlement offer.
stoops was among the percent of the members who responded to gill assessment demand.
gill informed stoops that an insufficient number of members had paid the assessments and pit would no longer provide a defense nor indemnification with regard to the bonilla case.stoops incurred in legal fees defending the bonilla matter.in,a jury rendered a judgment against stoops in the amount of million,plus approximately in costs.to satisfy the judgment,stoops assigned assets to the bonillas estimated to be worth million.
stoops filed a in gill abbassi against gill as receiver,pit,picc,and against the other members.in his second amended,stoops alleged causes of action.
the first and second causes of action breach of contract and tortious breach of contract alleged breached the pit agreement and insurance code section by failing to defend,settle,or provide indemnification with regard to the bonilla case,and did so in bad faith.
the third through tenth causes of action are the subject of this appeal.they are alleged against members,including respondents.three of the causes of action are for declaratory relief.the other causes of action are labeled breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,equitable estoppel,dissolution and accounting,and contribution.in essence,stoops alleges the other members,including respondents,have violated their obligations to pay assessments,thereby forcing gill to terminate the defense and indemnification of the bonilla matter.stoops has sought to recover the funds he has expended relating to the bonilla case,including expenditures for attorney fees and the adverse judgment.stoops also seeks emotional distress damages.further,he seeks declarations of rights as to whether members have personal liability for assessments,whether members were subject to supplemental assessments,and whether he can pursue those members who have failed to pay assessments.stoops also alleges he is entitled to an accounting of pit assets and liabilities.
the two demurrers and motion for judgment on the pleadings.
respondents first demurred to the ninth and tenth causes of action.this was followed by a demurrer to the third through eighth causes of action brought by two individual doctors,as well as a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the third through eighth causes of action brought by respondents.see fn.the trial court sustained both demurrers without leave to amend and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings.additionally,the trial court,on its own motion,concluded that all named,all other members,were to be included in the rulings.the result of these rulings was that stoops was foreclosed from pursuing a direct action against the other members as he had alleged in the third through tenth causes of action.the premise underlying the rulings was that the authority to collect assessments was vested in the board of trustees gill,as receiver.
on july,a judgment upon order granting motion on the pleadings and a judgment upon order sustaining demurrer were entered with regard to all named,including respondents and the two individual members.stoops appealed 
discussion 
standard of review.
our only task in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action.accordingly we assume that the complaint properly pleaded material allegations are true and give the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and all its parts in their context.citations.people ex rel.lungren superior court,supra,cal th at,d.where written documents are the foundation of an action and are attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by reference,they become a part of the complaint and may be considered on demurrer.citations.city of pomona superior court th,d.
a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made at any time either prior to the trial or at the trial itself.citation.ion equipment nelson d.such motion may be made on the same ground as those supporting a general demurrer,that the pleading at issue fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable claim or defense.mccutchen city of montclair,supra,th at,d.
stoops may not proceed directly against the other members because his third through tenth causes of action are directed at the collection of assessments.
stoops third through tenth causes of action were designed to assert claims against the other members for their failure to pay assessments.stoops believes that had these other members fulfilled their contractual obligations to pay assessments,he would have received a defense and indemnification in the bonilla lawsuit.stoops argues that he has an individual right to pursue the other members directly to collect unpaid assessments.based upon these beliefs,stoops contends the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrers and granting the motion on the pleadings.this contention is not persuasive.
we agree with the trial court that gill,acting as receiver for the pit trust fund and its board of trustees,is the only person who can pursue the collection of assessments.thus,as the trial court has ruled,stoops can not pursue his third through tenth causes of action in his.insurance code section,the pit agreement to which stoops is a party,and the order appointing gill receiver,give the responsibility of pursuing the collection of unpaid assessments to the board of trustees.since gill is acting for the board,only he may pursue members for the failure to pay assessments.
