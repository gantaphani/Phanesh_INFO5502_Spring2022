paul fire marine insurance company brought this declaratory judgment action for a ruling that it had no duty to defend its insured,compaq computer corporation compaq,in a case brought against it in texas by hal lapray lapray litigation.compaq counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that paul had such a duty and for breach of contract damages and then moved for statutory damages under texas law.the district court ruled in deciding the motions before it that paul had a duty to defend and that compaq was neither entitled to reimbursement for certain defense costs nor to statutory damages under texas law.judgment was entered accordingly,and paul appeals the district court ruling that it has a duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation.in its cross appeal compaq attacks the district court rulings on reimbursement of defense costs and statutory damages.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
compaq builds and sells computers,and paul is compaq liability insurer.on january,hal lapray brought a putative class action suit against compaq in texas state court alleging breach of contract and breach of express warranty lapray litigation.the plaintiffs alleged that they purchased compaq computers containing defective floppy diskette controllers fdcs and that the software compaq issued to fix the fdc not work and caused additional damage.another putative class action was filed on october,in the eastern district of texas by charles thurmond thurmond litigation.in addition to state law claims,the complaint in that case alleged a federal claim under the computer fraud and abuse act.yet another similar lawsuit was filed in the district of colorado sprung litigation.
compaq was covered at all relevant times by a multicover package policy issued by paul which included three separate insurance policies a technology errors and omissions liability protection policy technology e o policy,a technology commercial general liability protection policy,and a technology umbrella excess liability protection policy.this lawsuit involves provisions of the technology e o policy.
the technology e o policy states w e pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered loss that is caused by an error.the agreement defines error as an error,omission or negligent act.the policy defines damages as compensatory damages imposed by law or consequential damages,but it expressly excludes the contract price of the computer.the policy also excludes damages that result from any criminal,dishonest,fraudulent or other intentionally wrongful act or omission.the insurer duty to defend under this policy is therefore triggered when a party sues compaq alleging an error and demanding damages,as both terms are defined by the technology e o policy,so long as the damages are not the result of an intentionally wrongful act.
compaq submitted the thurmond litigation to paul in late.paul agreed to defend compaq pursuant to the technology e o policy,but reserved its right to deny coverage upon a subsequent determination that the thurmond claim was not covered by that policy.after the plaintiffs in thurmond filed their second amended complaint dropping the state law claims and alleging only the fraud claim,a claim excluded under the policy as a form of intentionally wrongful conduct,paul concluded that it had no duty to defend the lawsuit.it reached the same conclusion after reviewing an amended complaint in the sprung litigation.compaq ultimately prevailed in the thurmond litigation,which was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.see thurmond compaq computer,d.the court is not aware of the status of the sprung litigation.
in response to paul declination of coverage for the thurmond defense costs,compaq filed suit in minnesota state court seeking a declaration that paul had a duty to defend the thurmond and sprung litigations under the technology e o policy.the trial court granted summary judgment for paul because the complaints in those actions alleged only causes of action and damages resulting from compaq intentional conduct,thus not alleging an error under the technology e o policy.the minnesota court of appeals affirmed.compaq computer paul fire and marine ins,wl,unpublished.
paul then brought this action in minnesota state court seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation under the technology e o policy compaq removed the case to federal court and then filed two counterclaims one seeking a declaration that paul had a duty to defend and that compaq had no obligation to return defense costs related to the lapray action and the other seeking damages for breach of contract pursuant to the insurance policy package.paul moved for summary judgment on its complaint and compaq counterclaim compaq filed a cross motion for summary judgment in its favor on paul complaint and for partial summary judgment on its counterclaim.
the principal decision under review was issued on october.the key issues in determining if paul had a duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation was whether the lapray complaint alleged an error and demanded damages as the technology e o policy defined those terms and whether a policy exclusion applied.applying texas law the district court concluded that the complaint alleged conduct falling within the policy definition of error,that the relief sought fell within the definition of damages,and that no exclusions applied.the district court therefore held that paul had a duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation.paul fire and marine ins.compaq computer,civ,doc.
on appeal,paul argues that the district court erred in three ways.it contends that the lapray complaint does not allege an error within the meaning of the technology e o agreement,that the lapray complaint does not seek damages covered by the policy,and that the lapray complaint triggers the exclusion for losses resulting from intentional wrongful conduct.compaq supports the district court determination that paul has a duty to defend the lapray litigation but claims that the district court erred in ruling on its counterclaims.we address the background and procedural history of those rulings below.

the principal issue on appeal is whether paul has a duty to defend compaq in the underlying lapray litigation pursuant to the technology e o policy.the question of whether an insurer has a duty to defend is a legal question that we review de novo.travelers property cas.of america cas.ins,cir.
we agree with the parties that texas law governs the duty to defend analysis.under texas law an insurer has a duty to defend if any claim alleged in the pleadings is within the coverage of the policy.dresser,underwriters at lloyd,london.texas applies the eight corners or complaint allegation rule when determining an insurer duty to defend.guideone elite ins.fielder road baptist church.this rule provides that a court must consider only the factual allegations within the four corners of the third party plaintiffs complaint,together with the terms within the four corners of the insurance policy.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,merchs.fast motor lines,per curiam.the court may indulge the most liberal interpretation of the allegations of which they are susceptible and doubts as to the import of the allegations are to be resolved in favor of the insured and coverage.continental sav.ass fidelity and guar,amended on rehearing in part by cir applying texas law.
when applying the eight corners rule we must determine whether the complaint,properly construed,alleges conduct covered by the policy.guideone elite,at.we begin with the terms of the policy itself.the technology e o policy provides errors and omissions liability protection for your computer or electronic products or services.it is a claims made policy which covers defense expenses.to be covered,a claim or suit must be first made or brought while this agreement is in effect,or during a reporting period,if one applies.under the heading what this agreement covers the policy states 
technology errors and omissions policy.we pay amounts any protected person is legally required to pay as damages for covered loss that 
results from your computer or electronic products or services and 
is caused by an error committed on or after the retroactive date and before the ending date of this agreement.
thus to invoke the policy coverage,the underlying complaint must allege a loss caused by an error for which the plaintiffs request damages.the policy expressly excludes coverage for loss that results from any criminal,dishonest,fraudulent or other intentionally wrongful act or omission.
paul argues that the lapray complaint alleges intentionally wrongful conduct that falls outside the policy definition of an error.for the reasons discussed below,we disagree.
the policy defines error as any error,omission,or negligent act.because the policy uses the term error to define itself,we look to common usage.an error is a n act,assertion,or belief that unintentionally deviates from what is correct,right,or true it is a mistake.the american heritage dictionary ed first and fourth definitions in short,an error is an unintentionally incorrect act,assertion,or belief,or a mistake.thus,error under the technology e o policy encompasses intentional,acts like those associated with the breach of a contract,as well as omissions and negligent acts.see continental cas.cole.it does not,however,include intentionally wrongful conduct.
in deciding whether the lapray plaintiffs alleged an error we look to the most recent amended fourth amended complaint.compaq disagrees with this approach,arguing that each version of the complaint is relevant when determining whether the insurer has a duty to defend for the time period for which that version of the complaint was in effect.for this proposition it cites bernard gulf ins,which recognized that a judgment on an insurer duty to defend would be res judicata only as to the pleading that existed at the time the judgment was entered,not as to any later amended pleading.texas law is clear,however,that a court looks only to the latest amended pleading when evaluating an insurer duty to defend.see civ.unless the substituted instrument shall be set aside on exceptions,the instrument for which it is substituted shall no longer be regarded as a part of the pleading in the record of the cause.see paul ins.texas dep t of,the court evaluates an insurer duty to defend by reviewing only the latest amended pleading.rhodes chicago ins,cir under texas law the duty to defend is determined by examining the latest,and only the latest,amended pleadings.we therefore decline to extend the bernard rule beyond the res judicata analysis for which it was originally intended and conclude that only the fourth amended complaint is relevant for the purpose of our duty to defend analysis.
in that complaint the plaintiffs allege that each owns a compaq computer with a defective fdc,that the defective fdcs were expressly warranted by compaq,and that their claims under that express warranty were denied.see comp.they also allege that once the problem of the defective fdcs was brought to compaq attention by the filing of a lawsuit,the company issued a software fix,the softpaq,to correct the fdc defect.plaintiffs allege,however,that the softpaq is not an adequate or timely repair,that it causes corruption of data,and that it does not fix the defective fdcs.comp.a c.the complaint further states that compaq has repudiated any obligation to repair or replace the defective fdcs and that compaq is obligated to refund the full purchase price under the express warranty.comp.c.finally,the complaint states that compaq has communicated false and misleading information about the fdc defect and the softpaq and that this misrepresentation perpetuates and compounds compaq knowing breach of express warranty.comp.d.
nowhere in these factual allegations does the complaint allege that compaq engaged in intentionally wrongful conduct.there are no allegations that compaq acted knowingly or intentionally.the complaint does not allege that compaq knew,or even that it should have known,that it was selling computers with defective fdcs.there is no allegation that compaq provided the softpaq knowing that it was defective.while the allegations do claim wrongful conduct,there is no allegation that the conduct was intentionally wrongful.rather,the allegations support the inference that compaq unintentionally sold defective computers and unintentionally provided a defective product to fix the original defect.they thus fall squarely within the policy definition of error an unintentionally incorrect act 
paul argues that the phrase knowing breach in paragraph d is an allegation of intentionally wrongful conduct.that paragraph reads compaq has compounded the wrongful acts and damage to the class by communicating to some of the plaintiffs and other members of the class false and misleading information about the fdc defect and softpaq.this misrepresentation perpetuates and compounds compaq knowing breach of express warranty.emphasis added.although this sentence references a knowing breach,it does not itself allege conduct establishing that compaq knowingly or intentionally breached a contract or express warranty and,as discussed above,nowhere else does the complaint allege an intentional or knowing breach to which that sentence could be referring.we thus conclude that this use of the phrase knowing breach is a conclusory remark unsupported by any factual allegations.under texas law,courts focus only on factual allegations and disregard conclusory statements.see union fire ins,at although the pleadings allege that defendant negligently discharged the firearm,we must focus our review on the pleading factual allegations,not on legal theories asserted.
paul also contends that another use of the phrase knowing breach alleges intentionally wrongful conduct.under the heading second cause of action breach of contract and express warranty,the complaint states that s upplying defective fdcs is a breach of contract and a breach of compaq express warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.comp.in a later paragraph under that heading the complaint states defendant acts and omissions are a knowing breach of defendant express warranty and breach of contract and a producing cause of economic damages.comp.b emphasis added.paul argues that reading these phrases together is an allegation that compaq distributed defective computers with knowledge of their defect.this reading misconstrues the complaint.
paragraph is a summary of the factual allegations stating the fundamental factual assertion underlying the breach of contract and breach of express warranty supplying defective fdcs and the softpaq was a breach of contract and a breach of express warranty.this conclusion is supported by the factual allegations laid out earlier in the complaint.paragraph transitions from factual statements to requested remedies,namely specific performance.paragraph paragraph containing the knowing breach damages.like the use of this phrase in paragraph d,the statement that compaq committed a knowing breach,on which paul places decisive weight,is a conclusory statement that is unsupported by the factual allegations in the complaint,all of which are intent neutral.to read paragraph in concert with paragraph b as if it were a single factual allegation misconstrues the complaint.
because there is no allegation that compaq sold computers knowing of the fdc defect,we conclude that the sale of computers with defective fdcs is an error as defined by the technology e o policy.
the parties also dispute whether the lapray complaint alleges damages covered by the technology e o policy.the policy defines damages as compensatory damages imposed by law,consequential damages incurred by the protected person under a contract or agreement,and prejudgment interest awarded against the protected person on a judgment in connection with those compensatory or consequential damages.expressly excluded from the damages definition is the contract price of the computer or electronic products or services.
the complaint seeks as damages a full refund under compaq express warranty based on failure and refusal or inability to repair or replace,the difference in value of the computer when purchased with and without the defect,and damages for breach of the obligation to repair or replace.comp.b.the complaint disclaims any consequential damages as the result of the actual loss or corruption of data.comp.
the first damage request seeks a full refund under compaq express warranty.this request does not seek covered damages because the policy expressly excludes from the definition of damages the contract price of the computer a refund is necessarily based on the contract price.this particular request consequently does not request damages under the technology e o policy.
paul contends that the complaint does not request compensatory damages imposed by law because damages imposed by law includes only tort damages,not damages for breach of contract or express warranty.for this proposition paul relies on dicta from gulf portland cement globe indem,cir what,other than insured negligence,could render insured liable for damages imposed by law for personal injuries.we find this dicta unpersuasive.paul cited case sounded in tort,not in contract,and the insurance policy there covered liability imposed by law for personal injuries and other torts.
the technology e o policy does not cover tort liabilities,but rather other damages caused by an error.as discussed above,error under this policy includes intentional,and negligent acts like those associated with a breach of contract or express warranty.damages imposed by law under the technology e o policy thus includes damages for breach of contract and breach of warranty.
the plaintiffs also ask for the difference in value between a computer with and without the fdc defect.paul argues that this is nothing more than a request for a partial refund,but the complaint is not so limited.value is not necessarily tied to the contract price.texas courts have recognized that breach of warranty damages are measured by the difference in value of the warranted good or services with and without the defect,not the difference in price.see.bus.commerce code b the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted.melody home morrison.while the contract price is evidence of the value of an item,it is not conclusive.jhc ventures,fast trucking,abrogated on other grounds by medical city dallas,carlisle.the plaintiffs request for the difference in value is thus a request for covered damages.
webster defines compensatory damages as damages awarded to make good or compensate for an injury sustained.webster third new international dictionary the complaint demands damages for the difference in value because the plaintiffs never got what they bargained for and purchased.comp.in other words the plaintiffs request compensation for the loss of their expectation under the warranty agreement.the damages requested are therefore compensatory and within the technology e o policy coverage.
finally,paul contends that two policy exclusions preempt coverage.courts construing exclusionary clauses must adopt the construction urged by the insured as long as that construction is not unreasonable.utica ins.of texas american indem,quoting union fire ins.of pittsburgh,hudson energy.
paul again argues that the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs loss resulted from an intentionally wrongful act which the policy excludes from coverage.compaq urges us to construe an intentionally wrongful act as one motivated by malice.see state farm fire cas,construing an intentionally wrongful act exclusion to require more than reckless or wanton conduct.since the texas supreme court in state farm used that interpretation of a similar phrase when construing an intentional injury exclusion,it is not unreasonable and is relevant here.see utica,at.we have already concluded the two uses of the phrase knowing breach do not allege that compaq distributed the computers knowing of their defect and certainly do not allege malice.because the complaint does not allege that compaq committed an intentionally wrongful act,this exclusion is inapplicable.
paul next asserts that a policy exclusion precludes coverage for the claims related to computer replacement or repairs.that exclusion denies coverage for losses resulting from a delay in delivery or failure to deliver compaq computer or electronic products or services.the policy defines computer or electronic products or services as any electronic equipment or computer hardware or software developed,distributed,licensed,marketed or sold by or for compaq and any service for others,including maintenance or repair,performed or provided by or for you in connection with any electronic equipment or computer hardware or software.the policy provides an example of this exclusion application,indicating that the exclusion was intended to preclude coverage in the event of a delayed or failed delivery of a product or service after it had been promised to the insured customer 
while the complaint seeks damages for breach of the obligation to repair or replace,it contains no allegations of a product or service delivery delay or failure giving rise to damages.the complaint does not allege that compaq promised the plaintiffs that it would repair or replace their computers under the express warranty by a certain date and then reneged on that promise.rather,the alleged damages arise from the asserted breach of the express warranty.the complaint alleges that compaq rightly or it had no obligation to repair or replace the defective computers under its express warranty.the delay in delivery exclusion thus has no application here.
the complaint alleges an error and requests damages as both terms are defined by the technology e o policy and no exclusion applies.we conclude therefore that paul has a duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation under the technology e o policy.
the first issue on compaq cross appeal is whether the district court erred in denying it double duty recovery of defense costs.the double duty defense costs are those which compaq incurred during the period of time that both the thurmond and lapray actions were pending and which benefitted its defenses in both actions.compaq claims that it spent million on defense costs that inured to both actions during the period from january,the date the lapray action was filed,to march,the date the thurmond action was dismissed.see thurmond,d at.
as previously noted compaq filed a state court action in minnesota in january,seeking a declaration that paul had a duty to defend the thurmond litigation.the state court determined that paul had no duty to defend in that action,and the minnesota court of appeals affirmed.see compaq,wl,at.paul subsequently filed this declaratory judgment action in minnesota state court arguing that it had no duty to defend compaq in the lapray litigation,and compaq removed it to federal district court.
shortly after paul filed this action seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend the lapray litigation,it also filed a separate action to recover expenses it had incurred in defending the thurmond case between march,the date the thurmond plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint,and september,the date it withdrew its defense paul recoupment action compaq removed paul recoupment action to federal district court and filed a counterclaim for its remaining unpaid defense costs incurred before the thurmond second amended complaint was filed.the district court granted summary judgment for paul on compaq counterclaim,finding that because the minnesota court had held that paul had no duty to defend any part of the thurmond action,including the original and first amended complaints,the counterclaim was barred by res judicata.paul fire and marine ins.compaq computer,d.we affirmed.paul fir
