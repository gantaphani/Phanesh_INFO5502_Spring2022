specifically,in case,plaintiff appeals from the district court judgment entered on august,granting summary judgment to defendant as to the claims for reimbursement pursued by plaintiff as subrogee to peter coan and jerry williamson.the district court found that as a matter of law,plaintiff suit was time barred by the back rule under michigan no fault insurance act.comp.laws ann.in case,plaintiff appeals from the district court judgment entered on september,granting summary judgment to defendant as to the claim for reimbursement pursued by plaintiff as subrogee to andrea teagan.the district court found that the relevant michigan statute was not preempted by the employment retirement income security act erisa,a that michigan no fault act therefore applied and that under michigan federal kemper rule,plaintiff was the primary insurer.
by order of this court,the two cases,which were heard before the same district judge,were consolidated on appeal,and we now affirm the district court judgment in both cases.we have jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to,inasmuch as plaintiff claims arose under a b of erisa.
background 
this case involves a dispute over which of two potential insurance,american medical security,which is the administrator of employee welfare benefit plans or defendant,automobile club insurance association,which is a michigan automobile responsible for the payment of medical expenses paid on behalf of three individuals for injuries that they received when each was involved in separate automobile accidents.the facts relevant to each case are as follows.
on april,peter coan was injured in an automobile accident.at the time of the accident,coan was employed by daniels glass,and was a participant in its employee benefit plan.plaintiff,the administrator of the plan,paid out for medical expenses coan incurred as a result of the automobile accident.
on april,jerry williamson was injured in an automobile accident.at the time of the accident,williamson worked for c m masonry and was a participant in its employee benefit plan.plaintiff was the third party administrator of the plan and paid out for medical expenses that williamson incurred as a result of the accident.
at the time of the accidents,coan and williamson each had a valid policy of insurance with defendant aaa that included a provision for coordinated coverage.the provision provided as follows 
if the declaration certificate shows coordinated medical benefits,it is agreed that all other medical insurance or health care benefit plans available to you are your primary source of protection.
at.the subject certificates of group insurance administered by plaintiff ams provide excess coverage as follows 
excess coverage 
no benefits are payable for injury or sickness for which there is other insurance providing medical payments or medical expense coverage,regardless of whether the other coverage is primary,excess,or contingent.if we make payment on your behalf,you agree to assign to us any right you have against the other insurer.
plaintiff sought reimbursement from defendant for the medical expenses that it had paid out on behalf of coan in a letter dated december.after defendant orally invoked the back rule of michigan no fault act.comp.laws ann,to deny plaintiff request,plaintiff sent another letter to defendant dated november,again requesting reimbursement.thereafter,in a letter dated february,defendant reiterated its earlier denial of plaintiff request once again citing the back rule as the basis for doing so.
as a result of defendant denial of plaintiff requests for reimbursement,plaintiff filed suit against defendant on november,in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.on april,plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on may,defendant filed an answer to plaintiff motion for summary judgment in the nature of a for summary judgment.thereafter,on august,the district court issued a memorandum and order wherein the court concluded that the back rule was applicable based upon the michigan supreme court decision in auto club insurance association new york life ins.accordingly,the court denied plaintiff motion for summary judgment while granting defendant for summary judgment.the court opined in relevant part as follows 
the logical extension of new york life is that when ams plaintiff sued aaa defendant for reimbursement,arguing that it was secondarily liable,it essentially asserted subrogation ams is therefore subrogated to the claims of coan and williamson and ams must therefore abide by the back rule,which limits coan and williamson right to recovery.because ams sought reimbursement more than one year after the most recent allowable expenses,it can not now bring these claims against aaa.
on july,andrea teagan was injured in an automobile accident.andrea is the daughter of lillian tull and,at the time of her accident,andrea was covered under her mother employee benefit plan sponsored by temp west.plaintiff was the administrator of the plan.
effective may,and through the date of the accident,defendant insured tull under an automobile policy which provided coordinated medical coverage to tull and andrea.shortly after the july,accident,tull informed defendant that andrea was covered by tull erisa health insurance plan administered by plaintiff.on july,defendant verified with plaintiff that tull health insurance was in effect and covered andrea.
by way of letter dated july,defendant informed tull that because she had purchased coordinated medical benefits coverage from defendant,she was required to submit all medical bills to her health and accident insurer first that defendant would consider payment of expenses which her health and accident insurer rejected and that tull had one year from the date of any medical treatment to submit bills to defendant.between july,and july,plaintiff paid out to cover the cost of the medical expenses incurred by andrea as a result of the accident.
in a letter dated february,from plaintiff subrogation recovery vendor,thomas wilkes,plaintiff requested reimbursement from defendant for the amounts paid out on behalf of andrea.specifically,the letter provided in part as follows 
please be advised that we are the authorized subrogation recovery vendor for american medical security insurance company in regards to the insured,andrea teagan.
our subrogation lien is and is not a final lien amount.i have enclosed documentation supporting the current lien amount as well as our subrogation,coordination of benefits,and assignment language.we are processing more payments as this letter is being sent.
at.in a subsequent telephone conversation on march,between wilkes and defendant claims supervisor,kay nichols,wilkes requested that defendant pay cents on the dollar to settle plaintiff subrogation claim.nichols explained michigan insurance coverage to wilkes,and advised that if defendant was primarily liable,defendant would reimburse plaintiff percent.
wilkes sent a letter dated march,to nichols,and enclosed a copy of plaintiff entire policy therewith,citing several portions of that policy to support plaintiff claim,and requested prompt reimbursement from defendant to avoid litigation.subsequently,defendant claims staff reviewed plaintiff policy to ascertain whether plaintiff was primarily liable for andrea medical expenses.
by way of letter dated may,defendant forwarded plaintiff erisa plan and wilkes march,letter to attorney elaine harding of defendant legal staff,and requested her opinion as to whether plaintiff was primarily liable.harding and another attorney in defendant legal department,chris hoehn,reviewed plaintiff erisa plan and concluded that plaintiff was primarily liable for andrea medical expenses.on or about june,wilkes professed to harding that defendant owed fifty percent of the medical benefits that plaintiff was paying,and that wilkes would send harding case law in support of his position.
on or about june,defendant policy which covered andrea as well as a copy of michigan statutory back provision were faxed to wilkes wilkes then informed harding that he was researching the issue,but that he thought defendant owed fifty percent or nothing at all.on or about july,wilkes sent harding a facsimile containing the following 
a a fax cover sheet written by wilkes,which referred to the enclosed authority we have to proceed with a dec action to resolve this matter,and which offered one last chance to settle this claim and 
b a letter,which explained ams position that aaa was primarily liable,or at least liable.
thereafter,various facsimile and verbal communications were exchanged between wilkes and harding from august of,to september of.in september of,harding drafted a letter on behalf of defendant to wilkes,which memorialized defendant previous denials of plaintiff reimbursement claim.on or about october,wilkes responded and informed harding that plaintiff would settle for or whatever harding rejected wilkes offer.thereafter,harding had no further contact with wilkes concerning plaintiff reimbursement for andrea medical expenses,nor received any other communications regarding the matter,until plaintiff attorneys became involved.
in september of,defendant decided to pay tull insurance premium for tull cobra conversion policy to extend andrea health insurance coverage with plaintiff from august,to july.defendant claims that it did so in order to maintain plaintiff status as primary payor of andrea medical expenses.on october,defendant issued a check to plaintiff in the amount of as payment for the first year premium on tull conversion policy.on august,defendant issued a check to plaintiff as payment for the second year premium for tull cobra conversion policy.however,plaintiff returned defendant payment,and terminated tull health insurance coverage effective august.
on about march,defendant was advised that the matter was now being handled by plaintiff legal counsel.after an exchange of letters and other documents such as insurance plans and case law,defendant once again advised plaintiff attorneys that it was denying plaintiff reimbursement claim during a march,telephone conversation.
subsequently,on april,plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendant regarding its claim for payments made on behalf of andrea.on july,the district court entered an order consolidating this case with the case that plaintiff filed against defendant for reimbursement of payments made on behalf of coan and williamson.on january,plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment defendant replied in the form of a for summary judgment and on september,the district court issued a memorandum and order wherein the court granted defendant motion,while denying plaintiff motion for the same.in doing so,the court did not address defendant argument that plaintiff suit with respect to andrea was barred under the back rule instead,the court found that defendant was secondarily liable for payment of andrea medical bills under.comp.laws ann.a,thereby rejecting plaintiff claim that was preempted by a of erisa.specifically,the district court opined as follows 
although of michigan no fault act relates to erisa plans,it regulates insurance and thus is saved from erisa preemption by the savings clause.see northern group,auto owners ins,cir.see also fmc holliday,d metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d.the deemer clause does not apply here because,as ams concedes,the plan is not.see fmc,at.unum life ins.ward,d erisa plans are generally sheltered from state insurance regulation.thus,because it is saved from erisa preemption,of michigan act applies in this case.
the michigan court of appeals recently reached the same conclusion in american medical security allstate ins.there,ams sued allstate for reimbursement,and the material facts are indistinguishable from this case.the court of appeals stated 
t he parties agree that plaintiff group plan qualifies as an employee welfare benefit plan under erisa.the plan however,is clearly not,but rather has purchased insurance through united wisconsin.the issue is whether is preempted in a situation where the erisa plan is not but has purchased insurance coverage.we hold that it does not.
at footnote omitted.the district court also found that under federal kemper ins.health insurance,plaintiff claim failed inasmuch as in federal kemper the michigan supreme court held that when a health care plan and a insurer each seek to escape liability through competing coordination of benefits clauses,the health care plan is primarily liable and the insurer is secondarily liable.
plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal regarding the district court decisions in both cases.the appeals were consolidated by order of this court on october.
discussion 
this court reviews a district court order granting summary judgment de novo.equitable life assur.soc.poe,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
case of michigan one rule 
plaintiff argues that the district court erred in applying michigan back rule.comp.laws ann,on the basis that plaintiff claim should not be analyzed as one for subrogation under michigan no fault act,but on the basis of an action brought under erisa,a b,to recover benefits.plaintiff contends that as a a b claim,the applicable statute of limitations is six years pursuant to.comp.laws ann.for breach of contract disputes,as well as pursuant to.comp.laws ann.for general personal actions 
defendant argues that the district court properly characterized plaintiff as a subrogee to the interests of coan and williamson.however,defendant also contends that whether the causes of action pleaded in plaintiff suits are characterized as suits to obtain benefits as subrogees,or as actions brought by plaintiff to recover benefits under a b,the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendant due to the expiration of the period of limitation on recovery of benefits set forth in of the michigan no fault act 
it is undisputed that the suits filed by plaintiff seeking to recover payments made on behalf of coan and williamson were filed more than one year after the last payment made by plaintiff for medical expenses incurred by the respective parties,and that plaintiff claims would therefore be time barred if applied.the dispute,in turn,centers around which statutory provision should be applied,of michigan no fault act,or,of michigan general provisions for a personal action or breach of contract claim,in determining the appropriate limitations period.we hold that applies,thus making the applicable statute of limitations one year.
in federal kemper insurance western insurance,the michigan court of appeals opined that where an insurer,whose liability is arguably secondary to that of a primary insurer,pays the claim,it becomes subrogated to the rights of the insured.the court reasoned that a suit for subrogation brought by the secondary insurer against the primary insurer is the preferable method of handling the dispute inasmuch as the insured person is provided the benefits to which he is entitled,while the insurers are left to settle the liabilities.id.this policy is consistent with that behind michigan provisions.
moreover,the federal kemper court noted that its holding was consistent with previous decisions from the court such as home insurance rosquin,where the court held that because an insurance company which had paid property protection insurance benefits to its insured but did not sue the defendant for subrogation within the statute of limitations set forth in,its action was barred.see federal kemper,at.the court observed,as did the court in rosquin,that although the result may have appeared harsh,is clear and plaintiff is an insurance company itself and is pre
