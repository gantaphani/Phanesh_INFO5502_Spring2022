introduction 
petitioner allen entin owned two disability income insurance policies.in,entin filed a claim asserting that migraine headaches had rendered him totally disabled.entin insurer,respondent provident life and accident insurance company,agreed to pay entin benefits while investigating his claim.at the conclusion of its investigation,provident filed a declaratory relief action seeking a determination that entin was not totally disabled within the meaning of his policies.the complaint clarified that provident would continue to pay entin benefits during the pendency of the action and would not seek reimbursement of those payments.entin requested a jury trial.the trial court denied the request,concluding that provident claim was equitable in nature because provident was continuing to pay entin disability benefits during the pendency of the action.
entin filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order directing the superior court to grant his request for a jury trial.we issued an order to show cause and now conclude that the trial court erred in denying entin a jury trial.in the context of declaratory relief actions,the right to a jury trial depends on whether the issues raised in the complaint are legal or equitable in nature.provident declaratory relief claim raises factual questions pertaining to contractual rights,which are legal in nature.although provident has elected to pay entin benefits while pursuing the action,that does not transform the nature of the dispute into one arising in equity.entin is therefore entitled to a jury trial.
factual and procedural 
in,petitioner allen entin purchased a disability income insurance policy that provided benefits of per month in the event that he became totally disabled.entin also purchased an overhead expense disability policy that provided benefits up to in the event that he became totally disabled.both polices defined the term totally disabled to mean the insured is not able to perform the substantial and material duties of his occupation and the insured is receiving care by a p hysician which is appropriate for the condition causing the disability.
on september,entin filed a claim alleging that migraine headaches had rendered him incapable of performing the substantial and material duties of his occupation as an obstetrician and gynecologist.entin insurer,provident life and accident insurance company,reviewed the claim and began paying entin disability benefits under a reservation of rights.
on august,provident filed a declaratory relief action seeking a determination that entin was not entitled to disability benefits.the complaint did not raise any issue regarding the construction of the insurance policies.instead,it asserted that the parties disputed whether the evidence showed entin was totally disabled within the meaning of those p olicies.according to the allegations in the complaint,entin informed provident that the doctors whom he ha d consulted believed he was no longer capable of performing his occupation as an obstetrician and gynecologist because of migraine headaches of totally disabling proportions after receiving this information,provident conducted a medical examination of entin,reviewed his medical records and interviewed his medical care treaters.provident investigation allegedly revealed entin wa s not totally disabled within the meaning of the policies and raised substantial question s as to whether he was receiving appropriate care for his claimed medical condition as contractually required.
the complaint clarified that although provident did not believe entin was totally disabled,it would continue to pay his disability claim until the court issue d its determination of the rights and responsibilities of the parties the complaint also stated that provident would not attempt to recoup any sums paid prior to the entry of judgment.
entin filed a for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing alleging that provident declaratory relief action was part of a scheme to forc e its insureds to settle otherwise legitimate claims for less than the value of the claim.the further alleged that provident filed its action knowing that entin was entitled to benefits and would be forced to incur attorneys fees defending the charges brought against him.
provident demurred to the,arguing that entin could not pursue a claim for bad faith in the absence of a breach of the underlying insurance contract s.provident contended that the allegations in the admitted entin was still receiving disability benefits,thereby demonstrating that no breach had occurred.in his opposition,entin asserted that regardless of whether he was still receiving benefits,he had properly stated a claim for breach of the implied covenant by alleging that provident filed a a sham complaint for declaratory relief that placed a cloud on his disability benefits causing him to incur litigation expenses and emotional distress.the trial court sustained provident demurrer without leave to amend.
in february of,the parties submitted opposing briefs addressing the issue of entin right to a jury on provident declaratory relief claim.entin argued that he had a right to a jury because the case raised factual issues concerning his entitlement to contractual insurance benefits.provident,however,argued that there was no right to a jury because the underlying claim and relief sought identification of prospective right under the insurance policies is sic purely equitable in nature.on february,the trial court ordered that entin did not have a right to a jury in light of the fact that payments under the policies are ongoing.
entin filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order from this court directing the superior court to vacate its order granting a court trial and to enter a new and different order granting entin motion for a jury trial.we issued an order to show cause on april.

summary of relevant case law 
the right to a jury trial in declaratory relief actions 
the right to a jury trial is guaranteed by our constitution.cal,art.i.t he right so guaranteed,however,is the right as it existed at common law in,when the constitution was first adopted as a general proposition,t he jury trial is a matter of right in a civil action at law,but not in equity.citations if the action has to deal with ordinary rights cognizable in courts of law,it is to that extent an action at law.in determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law,the court is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved and the facts of the particular case the gist of the action.a jury trial must be granted where the gist of the action is legal,where the action is in reality cognizable at law.citations.on the other hand,if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought depends upon the application of equitable doctrines,the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.citations.although the legal or equitable nature of a cause of action ordinarily is determined by the mode of relief to be afforded citation,the prayer for relief in a particular case is not conclusive.citations.c k engineering contractors amber steel cal d,c k engineering.
our courts have frequently characterized declaratory relief actions as being equitable in nature.interinsurance exchange savior d,savior.they are,in fact,sui generis and may raise either legal or equitable issues.veale piercy d,veale.consequently,the right to a jury may not be denied simply because the action is one for declaratory relief.ibid.rather,as with other types of claims,the proper inquiry is the sometimes difficult one whether the issues raised in the action are legal or equitable in nature.manneck lawyers title ins.th,manneck.the difficulty of this task is multiplied when the relief sought is a sui generis declaration of rights in which event the court is even deprived of the advantage of considering the prayer as an indication of whether or not the claim is addressed to equity.veale,supra,d at.
federal courts have employed a slightly different inquiry to aid in determining whether the right to a jury attaches in declaratory relief actions,asking whether there would have been a right to a jury trial had the action proceeded without the declaratory judgment vehicle.see in re lockheed martin cir.as one court explained,t he right to jury trial in a declaratory judgment action depends on whether the action is simply the counterpart of a suit in equity that is,whether an action in equity could be maintained if declaratory judgment were unavailable or whether the action is merely an inverted lawsuit.james pennsylvania general ins.thus,to determine whether there is a right to jury trial in a declaratory judgment action,first it is necessary to determine in what kind of an action the issue would have come to the court if there were no declaratory judgment procedure.if there would have been a right to jury trial on the issue if it had arisen in an action other than one for a declaratory judgment,it must be tried to a jury in the declaratory action.consequently,there is no right to trial by jury if,absent the declaratory procedure,the issue would have arisen in an equitable proceeding.wright,miller mann,federal practice and procedure.ed.
cases analyzing the right to a jury in declaratory relief actions seeking a determination of insurance coverage 
several california decisions have addressed whether the right to a jury attaches in declaratory relief actions seeking a determination of insurance coverage.in state farm mutual automobile insurance superior court cal d state farm,the insured was involved in an automobile collision that left several people injured.the insurer brought a declaratory relief action to determine whether its policy covered the incident.while the case was pending,the injured parties filed personal injury actions against the insured.the trial court concluded that the right to a jury applied in both actions and consolidated the matters for trial.the jury returned a verdict against the insurer.on appeal,the insurer argued that the court erred in consolidating the matters.
although the california supreme court acknowledged that the insurer had not appealed the jury trial issue,the court concluded that the trial court had properly decided the issue,explaining the general rule is that if the issues of fact arising would have been triable by a jury as of right in an action which might have been substituted for the declaratory judgment action by either party,then there is a right to jury trial on such issues.while some prior decisions appear to hold that,regardless of the circumstances,the court in a declaratory relief action may dispose of all factual issues without a jury,such view fails to preserve the distinction between legal and equitable issues,and it must be disapproved.citation.in short,the courts will not permit the declaratory action to be used as a device to circumvent the right to a jury trial in cases where such right would be guaranteed if the proceeding were coercive rather than declaratory in nature.citations.state farm,supra,cal d at.
subsequent decisions applying state farm have concluded that there is right to a jury in declaratory relief actions involving insurance coverage disputes.for example,in allstate ins.normandie club d normandie,the defendant was involved in an accident that caused injuries to several individuals in his car.after the injured parties filed personal injury actions against the defendant and his employer,the insurer instituted a declaratory relief,seeking an adjudication that it had no duty either to defend the actions,or to pay judgments if recovered.id.at.the appellate court concluded that,under such circumstances,a jury was a matter of right because the insurer had filed an action for declaratory relief as a substitute for an action at law for breach of contract id.at.
in patterson insurance of north america d patterson,the insured was involved in an automobile collision and was sued by the occupants of the other vehicle.the insured tendered his defense to his insurer,who refused to accept the case and filed a to determine coverage under the liability insurance policy.id.at.the parties agreed to try the declaratory relief action first.the crucial issue was whether the insured automobile had been acquired to replace an older,vehicle.ibid.the trial court submitted the issue to a jury,which found that the automobile qualified for coverage.
the insurer appealed,arguing that the trial court erred in submitting the matter to the jury.the appellate court concluded that the case was controlled by the holdings in state farm and normandie where an action for declaratory relief is in effect used as a substitute for an action at law for breach of contract,a party is entitled to a jury trial as a matter of right in both state farm and normandie,an insurance company brought an action for declaratory relief to determine coverage under a liability policy and its obligation to defend a personal injury action brought against the insured.in each case the court held that a jury trial was a matter of right.the instant case is indistinguishable.the was instituted because appellant refused to provide defense for the personal injury actions as required by the policy,asserting a legal,rather than an equitable defense for its noncompliance.a jury trial was thus a matter of right.pattersion,supra,d at.
other cases have clarified that although there is generally a right to a jury trial in declaratory relief actions seeking a determination of insurance coverage,there is no reversible error in denying a jury trial if there are no factual issues for the jury to decide.for example,savior,supra,d,the defendant,paul savior,was involved in an accident with anne pisano,who owned an insurance policy.pisano insurer filed a declaratory relief complaint against savior seeking a determination that the car pisano was driving was not covered by her policy.the trial court granted the insurer motion to strike savior jury demand and the case proceeded by way of a bench trial.during the trial,the insurer presented evidence that pisano automobile was not insured until after the accident occurred.savior offered no evidence to rebut this claim and the court entered a judgment in favor of the insurer.
on appeal,savior argued that the trial court erred in depriving him of a jury trial.savior,supra,d at.the appellate court held that although the trial court committed error in denying a jury to appellant,it was not prejudicial error.id.at.the court explained that numerous prior cases had made clear that an action by an insurance company against its putative insured,seeking a declaration that no coverage exists,is one in which a jury trial is a matter of right,since the declaratory relief action has been substituted for an action at law for breach of contract.ibid.despite this finding,the court ruled that a reversal was unwarranted because the record showed the insurer had introduced evidence demonstrating the automobile was not insured when the accident occurred and the appellant had offered no evidence in rebuttal.thus,according to the court,there were no real issues to present to the jury.id.at.
in california casualty indemnity exchange frerichs th frerichs,the insurer brought an action for declaratory relief concerning the interpretation of a policy of homeowner s s insurance.id.at.the defendant in the case was injured by paul hudson,who was the insured son.at the time of the incident,hudson was house sitting for the insured,who was on vacation.the policy provided coverage to all residents of the insured household.id.at.the issue in the case was whether the definition of the term resident extended to hudson.the trial court concluded that the term was ambiguous and submitted a special verdict to the jury asking whether hudson qualified as a resident of the home.the jury concluded that he did qualify as a resident and the court entered judgment against the insurer.
on appeal,the insurer argued that the trial court erred in referring the question to the jury whether the policy term resident is ambiguous.frerichs,supra,th at.the appellate court explained that n otwithstanding that an action for declaratory relief is characterized as an action in equity,there is a right to a jury trial of material triable issues of fact concerning an inchoate breach of contract claim.citations.for example,if an insurance policy is ambiguous,and the resolution of the ambiguity turns on disputed extrinsic evidence,the dispute must be resolved by a jury upon demand.id.at.the court further concluded,however,that the undisputed facts demonstrated that the term resident was unambiguous and that hudson did not qualify as a resident.as a result,there was no proper issue to present to the jury for decision.
similarly,in equitable life assurance society berry d equitable life,an insurer sought a determination as to whether its insured was entitled to disability benefits.after a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of the insurer.the insured appealed,arguing that it was entitled to a jury trial.the appellate court rejected the argument,explaining that the jury issue was a red herring because the determinative issue in the case was the proper construction of the disability policy,which was a judicial function.id.at.
entin is entitled to a jury trial 
provident declaratory relief action is legal in nature 
provident complaint does not raise any dispute regarding the proper construction of the parties insurance policies.instead,it seeks a determination as to whether entin is totally disabled within the meaning of those policies.to resolve this issue,the finder of fact will have to decide two matters that are currently in dispute whether entin migraine headaches have rendered him unable to perform the substantial and material duties of his occupation,and whether entin is receiving appropriate care for the condition.
provident acknowledges that state farm,normandie,patterson and savior all concluded that the right to a jury applies when an insurer seeks a declaration against its insured that no coverage exists.savior,supra,d at.provident,however,argues that those holdings do not apply here because it has continued to pay entin disability benefits,thereby precluding him from pursuing a breach of contract claim in lieu of the declaratory relief action provident asserts that,under such circumstances,the action is necessarily equitable in nature.
provident argument is predicated on the assumption that,in the context of declaratory relief actions,the right to a jury trial attaches only if a party could have asserted a legal claim in place of the declaratory relief action.in determining whether the right to a jury exists,however,the proper inquiry is not whether the defendant could have actually filed a countervailing legal claim,but rather whether the issues raised in the declaratory relief action are legal or equitable in nature.manneck,supra,th at.therefore,if the gist of a declaratory relief action involves the resolution of factual issues pertaining to a plaintiff contractual rights,the defendant is entitled to a jury regardless of whether that underlying legal claim remains inchoate.see frerichs,supra,th at right to jury attaches where a declaratory relief action concern s an inchoate breach of contract claim patterson,supra,d at right to a jury trial applies when a declaratory relief action is in effect used as a substitute for an action at law.
based on the allegations in provident complaint,it is apparent that the rights involved in this case are legal in nature and do not depend upon the application of equitable doctrines.c k engineering,supra,cal d at.provident complaint raises questions of fact regarding whether entin medical condition entitles him to disability benefits under the parties insurance contracts.provident asserts that entin is not entitled to contractual benefits because it has uncovered facts demonstrating that he is not totally disabled entin,on the other hand,asserts that he is entitled to contractual benefits because his doctors have concluded that he is totally disabled.normally,t he question whether respondent was totally disabled,under the rule and terms of the policy,is a question of fact for the jury to decide from all the circumstances surrounding the employment.clark metropolitan life ins.d.
the legal nature of provident claim is also demonstrated by the fact that,without the declaratory relief mechanism,this matter would have proceeded as an action at law.provident has not identified any form of equitable claim that would have permitted it to obtain a binding ruling as to whether its decision to deny entin future benefits would constitute a breach of the insurance policies.instead,provident would have had to decide whether to continue paying entin benefits under the policies or to deny the claims,thereby forcing entin to pursue a legal claim for breach of contract.thus,without the declaratory relief mechanism,entin would be entitled to have a jury decide whether he was totally disabled.provident may not utilize the declaratory relief action to circumvent that right see state farm,supra,cal d at courts will not permit the declaratory action to be used as a device to circumvent the right to a jury trial in cases where such right would be guaranteed if the proceeding were coercive rather than declaratory in nature.citations.
provident action is not akin to a request for specific performance 
provident raises two additional arguments in support of its assertion that entin is not entitled to a jury trial.first,it contends that its claim is akin to a request for specific performance,which is an equitable remedy.second,it argues that because neither party has sought monetary damages,its claim can not be legal in nature.
provident declaratory relief claim is not akin to a request for specific performance 
provident argues that the nature of the relief in this case a declaration regarding the parties future contract rights is equivalent to a request for specific performance,unquestionably an equitable remedy.in support,provident discusses two cases,caira,supra,th and insurance company of north america amadei sand gravel amadei sand,which purportedly illustrate why a declaratory relief action seeking a determination of rights under a contract is equivalent to one for specific performance.although caira and amadei sand demonstrate that a declaratory relief action seeking a determination of contract rights may,under certain circumstances,be akin to an equitable claim for specific performance,neither case has any similarity to the present dispute.
caira,supra,th,involved a dispute over the ownership of a family company named platypus wear.laurens offner founded platypus wear and owned of its shares his two siblings owned the remaining shares.in,laurens entered into a written agreement to transfer percent of platypus wear stock to his father,franklin offner,in exchange for a loan.the agreement described various contingencies that would revert the stock to laurens.after franklin died,laurens and his siblings filed competing declaratory relief actions seeking a determination as to who owned the stock at issue in the agreement.the siblings argued that the agreement effectively transferred the stock to franklin and that it remained the property of franklin estate.laurens,however,argued that he owned the stock because the agreement had never been formalized and,even if it had,the contingencies necessary to reverse the transfer had been fulfilled.the case was submitted to a jury,which returned a ruling in favor of laurens.the trial court,however,determined that the jury findings were only advisory because the action was equitable in nature.the court then found that the disputed shares were owned by franklin estate.
on appeal,laurens argued that he had the right,under the california constitution,to a jury trial on the issue of the ownership of platypus common stock.caira,supra,th at.laurens argued that his siblings were using the declaratory relief action in the place of a breach of contract action for damages.
