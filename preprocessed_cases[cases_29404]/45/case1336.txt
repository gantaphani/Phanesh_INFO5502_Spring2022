clarence geschke purchased a supplemental cancer insurance policy that promised to reimburse him for incurred expenses for the cost of blood or blood plasma.geschke developed leukemia and required numerous blood transfusions.he later died,and his widow,irene geschke,filed an insurance claim that included in expenses for blood and charges such as laboratory testing,equipment,drugs,administrative fees,and other transfusion expenses.the insurer paid only the cost of the blood product itself,or,and denied coverage for the related charges.geschke filed suit in state court against the insurer and the association that marketed the policy to her late husband,alleging breach of contract,common law fraud,and violation of the illinois consumer fraud act icfa.the defendants removed the case to federal district court.
the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,holding that the unambiguous policy language covered only the cost of the blood itself and not other costs associated with its delivery and administration.we agree with this conclusion.the insurance policy expressly covers only incurred expenses for the cost of blood or plasma,not related transfusion charges.this coverage language is clear and unambiguous.accordingly,the insurer did not breach its contract by paying only that portion of the claim that consisted of the cost of the blood.summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the common law and statutory fraud claims was also appropriate,as there is no evidence of any false statement or deceptive act by the defendants in connection with the sale of the policy.
background 
in may clarence geschke enrolled in the air force association afa cancercare plan,a supplemental cancer insurance policy underwritten by monumental life insurance company monumental or the insurer.the policy and its associated riders provided defined benefits for certain expenses incurred in the treatment of cancer,such as hospitalization,hospice care,ambulance services,anesthesia,and blood and plasma.as is relevant here,the blood and plasma benefit rider included in geschke policy provided as follows 
upon receipt of due proof that the covered person incurred expenses for the cost of blood or blood plasma,we will pay a benefit for these expenses not to exceed the maximum benefit shown on the schedule.the expense of blood or blood plasma incurred while hospital confined,as an outpatient or in a free standing facility is eligible for this benefit.
the rider maximum benefit per illness period was,but the schedule of benefits also indicated that there was no maximum for leukemia.geschke paid a quarterly premium of for member family coverage under the policy and its associated riders.
geschke was diagnosed with leukemia in march.on or about april,he sent monumental a claim form seeking benefits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by sherman hospital in and early.the parties dispute exactly when or geschke provided monumental with documentation sufficient to establish geschke cancer diagnosis,as required by the policy,but the issue is no longer material.sadly,geschke died on june.
on october,geschke submitted an updated claim to monumental for.of that amount,related to geschke blood transfusions.in december monumental paid to geschke for hospitalization,surgical,and anesthesia charges.later,on march,monumental paid under the blood and plasma benefit rider.in a letter to geschke dated june,monumental explained that the blood and plasma benefit rider did not cover processing or administrative fees,supplies,drugs,or laboratory charges associated with the blood transfusions,and that monumental was declining to cover the remaining of the claim.
geschke never cashed monumental checks.instead,she filed suit against monumental and the afa in illinois state court,alleging breach of contract and seeking recovery of benefits under the blood and plasma benefit rider.she also alleged common law fraud and fraud under the icfa,ilcs et.the gravamen of both fraud claims is that by failing to explain that the blood and plasma benefit rider covered only the cost of blood products and not related transfusion expenses,the defendants fraudulently induced geschke to purchase the policy and pay premiums.for each of the three claims,compensatory damages were alleged to be in excess of and not more than.in addition,the two fraud claims included demands for punitive damages.monumental,a corporation chartered and located in maryland,removed the case to federal court with the consent of the afa,a corporation chartered under the laws of the district of columbia and located in virginia.thereafter the defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted 
the district court concluded that although the terms blood and plasma are not defined in the policy,a reasonable person would understand that the phrase cost of blood or blood plasma refers to the cost of the blood product itself and not to other costs associated with the administration of the blood product to a sick person.as such,the court held that monumental did not breach its contract with geschke.the court also held that geschke could not carry her burden on the common law and statutory fraud claims because no misrepresentation could be inferred from policy language that was unambiguous,and no other evidence of false statements or deception by the defendants had been presented.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
the parties did not raise the issue of the district court jurisdiction,but the defendants argued,both in the lower court and on appeal,that geschke two fraud claims did not accrue prior to geschke death and therefore abated.we asked at oral argument whether only the breach of contract claim should be considered for purposes of the requirement for diversity jurisdiction under a.we asked whether the damages potentially recoverable in the breach of contract action were above.after considering the parties supplemental briefing on this issue,we are satisfied that the district court had jurisdiction over geschke suit.
whether supplies jurisdiction must be determined at the outset of a case events after the suit begins do not affect diversity jurisdiction.johnson wattenbarger,cir citing,k n energy,d,and other cases.we therefore look to geschke first complaint,the one the defendants removed to federal court,to see whether the case satisfies the jurisdictional threshold of.each of geschke three claims sought compensatory damages in the amount of to,plus prejudgment interest.the two fraud claims each also demanded an award of punitive damages.it is the case,rather than the claim,to which the minimum applies.johnson,at.the total amount at stake was thus clearly above that mark.
whether or not the defendants could succeed with their argument that the fraud claims abated upon geschke death is immaterial to the jurisdictional question.only if it were legally impossible for geschke to win on claims totaling more than would her suit fail for want of jurisdiction.paul mercury indem.red cab.johnson,at.legal impossibility in this sense differs from the standard for dismissal for failure to state a claim under fed.civ.b that there may be a plausible argument that the plaintiff claims must fail as a matter of law does not mean the court lacks jurisdiction to consider them.bell hood.johnson,at.if it were otherwise,defendants would never win in diversity cases.they could at best achieve jurisdictional dismissals,followed by new suits in state court.johnson,at.
the defendants argument that the fraud claims failed to accrue before geschke death or that if they did accrue,did not survive his death,hardly colors this suit as a legal impossibility.though we need not decide the issue,the defendants are probably wrong about the accrual question.see knox college celotex,under illinois discovery rule,fraud claim accrues when a person knows or reasonably should know of his injury and also knows or reasonably should know that it was wrongfully caused.the question of the survival of the punitive damages aspect of the common law and statutory fraud claims is apparently unsettled in illinois.see ilcs illinois survival act west in additio
