mercury insurance company mercury appeals from the trial court order imposing in monetary sanctions after the court determined mercury claims adjuster and the lawyer it had provided to defend its policyholder in this personal injury action had failed to negotiate in good faith at a mandatory settlement conference.because neither code of civil procedure section nor california rules of court,rule nor any other statute or court rule authorizes the imposition of sanctions on a nonparty insurer in this circumstance,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying litigation 
miguel vidrio,and patricia salinas filed a lawsuit in december alleging they had been injured a year earlier when,as a result of maria hernandez negligence,the car hernandez was driving collided with the car being driven by vidrio.hernandez was insured by mercury,which provided her with a defense.
in response to a march request for a statement of damages,vidrio claimed he had suffered general damages of,medical expenses of,loss of earnings of and property damage of an undetermined amount.salinas claimed general damages of,medical expenses of and loss of earnings of.
in opposition to hernandez motion to reclassify the matter as a limited civil case,vidrio added a claim for estimated future medical expenses of and increased his claim for lost earnings to.however,his claim for general damages was reduced to.salinas,who explained she was weeks pregnant at the time of the accident and sought medical treatment because of her concern about her unborn child,added a claim for future medical costs of,but reduced her general damages claim to.the motion to reclassify was denied.
counsel for hernandez,dean chalamidas,an associate with michael hogan associates,took vidrio and salinas depositions in may.the plaintiffs were represented by jon dieringer,a contract attorney working with plaintiffs counsel of record,michael silvers.
a mediation was conducted in september,attended by the parties,counsel for plaintiffs once again,a contract attorney working with silvers,hernandez counsel chalamidas and victor ambriz,the adjuster for mercury.the case was not resolved at that time.hernandez served vidrio and salinas with settlement offers of each pursuant to section.
the mandatory settlement conference 
a mandatory settlement conference was scheduled for december.hernandez filed her mandatory settlement conference statement on december.the brief contested liability,contending vidrio car had stopped suddenly and for no reason,leaving hernandez insufficient time to avoid the collision.hernandez also disputed the nature and extent of vidrio and salinas claimed injuries,essentially arguing the accident was minor and could not be expected to cause any personal injuries and only limited damage to vidrio car repair estimated at approximately.
hernandez was represented at the mandatory settlement conference by chalamidas.mercury adjuster ambriz,who had full authority to settle the case,was also present.plaintiffs were again represented by a specially appearing contract attorney james mckanna affiliated with silvers.vidrio and salinas made settlement demands of each demands that had previously been served on counsel for hernandez pursuant to section.hernandez repeated her prior settlement offer of for each plaintiff.neither side made a,and the case did not settle.
following the settlement conference the court held a proceeding on the record at which it observed the rules of court,the local rules and the litigation guidelines published by the los angeles county bar association all mandate good faith representation by counsel as well as the authorized representative of the company,in this case mercury insurance.the court then stated,on its surface,it would appear that this case is one of damages,not liability.counsel and the adjuster came to court today unprepared to discuss damages,unprepared to discuss costs of defense,unprepared to have an intelligent conversation about how they derive a thousand dollars in total to be paid to the plaintiffs.there is an auto claim as well for repair of the vehicle of miguel vidrio,of which little or no discussion could be elicited from counsel i have every intention of imposing a monetary sanction.i find there was bad faith conduct by counsel.
the court also expressed its view hernandez counsel,chalamidas,was just a conduit for somebody,i believe,at mercury and indicated,i do want to get you personally wrapped up in this.the court then issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed,naming chalamidas,ambriz and mercury as respondents,and set a hearing for december.
the hearing on the order to show cause regarding sanctions 
chalamidas filed a declaration in response to the order to show cause in which he recited the procedural history of the case and indicated his continuing,personal involvement in the matter as counsel for hernandez and his familiarity with the issues relating to both liability and damages.chalamidas explained hernandez,who he had interviewed on several occasions,was adamant vidrio caused the accident when he stopped his vehicle for no reason.moreover,she is certain neither plaintiff was injured.chalamidas also emphasized he had prepared the mandatory settlement conference statement and personally attended the mandatory settlement conference as well as the mediation,while silvers,plaintiffs counsel of record,had made no appearances in the matter at all.chalamidas declaration also provided his perspective on the conduct of the mandatory settlement conference,asserting he and ambriz had not failed to participate meaningfully.
contract attorney mckanna filed a declaration in support of the award of sanctions,asserting,notwithstanding the absence of any settlement demand less than for each plaintiff,it became clear at the conference that the plaintiffs were willing to settle their personal injury claims for a very reasonable amount.mckanna also stated liability was clear,based on information contained in the police report of the accident,and described the various injuries sustained by vidrio and salinas.mckanna also described his preparation for the mandatory settlement conference and his billing rate and requested the award of monetary sanctions of to cover attorney fees incurred at the settlement conference and in connection with the order to show cause regarding sanctions.
at the hearing,after appearances of counsel were made,the court stated it was relying on rule former rule in conducting the proceeding.as described by the court,that rule requires a good faith offer of settlement by a defendant as part of its mandatory settlement conference statement and also requires the parties participating in the conference to comply with any additional requirements imposed by the court local rules.the court then stated it found local rule which mercury suggests,and we agree,is a misreporting of the phonetically similar local rule e there is no local rule and local rule pertinent.with respect to sanctions the court said it could rely on either section or rule,with rule being more specific to imposing sanctions relative to settlement conferences.
following the recitation of its authority for proceeding with the sanctions hearing,the court explained,what this is about today is the court perceived notion from the conduct of the adjuster and attorney representing hernandez employed by mercury insurance of not in good faith making any effort to attempt to settle the case.the court found no fault with the hernandez settlement conference statement,i thought that the brief s submitted by each side were alike,i might say,and civil,and i do appreciate that from both sides.however,the court was harshly critical of the conduct of hernandez representatives at the settlement conference itself and,in particular,the refusal to offer more money than the section offer of for each plaintiff the point is that there was no negotiations.they just came in with the firm opinion we paying a thousand dollars a t least some movement under the circumstances,and some discussion was in order.that is the reason why sanctions are being imposed.
the court noted it had elicited from chalamidas and ambriz the estimated cost of trying the case,including the costs of the expert witness an orthopedic surgeon retained on behalf of hernandez,and stated,although the proposed amount was a demand,but it would have settled the case that cost would be far in excess of,perhaps even double,the amount that the case could have settled.the court also characterized the lack of communication back to the court as uncivil and impolite.more substantively,the court indicated it believed the defense theory for contesting liability was weak and salinas,even if not vidrio,had a legitimate claim for a substantial amount in compensation for personal injuries,particularly since she was pregnant at the time of the accident t hose expenses at least have some value of which there is absolutely no discussion or willingness to discuss.
after hearing argument from counsel,the court ordered sanctions in the sum of payable directly to the court and payable to plaintiffs attorney fees incurred in connection with the sanctions hearing,not the mandatory settlement conference itself.the monetary sanctions were imposed against mercury only,not chalamidas or ambriz.articulating the basis for its order,the court stated,the manner in which this was handled in my chambers,in my opinion,was totally bad faith,totally bad faith.a minute order directing the payment of sanctions by mercury was entered on december,
mercury filed a petition for writ of mandate seeking review of the sanctions order on february.we denied the petition,explaining mercury had an adequate remedy by way of appeal following entry of a written order imposing sanctions.see barton ahmanson developments,th,d.an order,signed by the court,was entered on march,mercury thereafter filed a timely notice of appeal.

governing statutes and rules of court 
settlement conference procedure 
rule former rule governs mandatory settlement conferences.rule a permits the trial court,on its own motion or at the request of a party,to set one or more mandatory settlement conferences.rule b requires the personal attendance of t rial counsel,parties,and persons with full authority to settle the case at such conferences unless excused by the court for good cause.rule c requires each party to submit to the court a mandatory settlement conference statement the plaintiff statement must include a good faith settlement demand rule c the defendant statement a good faith offer of settlement rule c.the rule also requires the parties settlement conference statement to comply with any additional requirement imposed by local rule.
local rule d,like rule,authorizes the trial court to set a settlement conference on its own motion or at the request of any party.the rule also provides,unless expressly excused for good cause by the judge,all persons whose consent is required to effect a binding settlement shall be personally present at a scheduled settlement conference.included among such persons are the litigants unless consent of the particular litigant is not required for the settlement an authorized representative of any insurance company which has coverage involved in the case and an authorized representative of a corporation or other business or government entity which is a litigant.local rule d further specifies,attorneys for all parties appearing in the action shall attend the conference and be intimately familiar with the pertinent available evidence involving both liability and damages.such attorney shall be prepared to discuss the case in depth and,except for good cause shown,shall be the attorney who will try the case.
local rule e requires the parties to submit a written settlement conference statement containing a concise statement of the material facts of the case and the factual and legal contentions in dispute.unlike rule the local rule does not expressly require a settlement demand or offer.
b.the authority to impose sanctions 
section authorizes a judicial officer to impose reasonable monetary sanctions,not to exceed,payable to the court,for any violation of a lawful court order by a person,done without good cause or substantial justification.the section defines person to include a witness,a party,a party attorney,or both.section provides a court local rules may authorize sanctions against any counsel,a party represented by counsel,or a party if in pro se,for the failure to comply with any of the requirements of local rules properly promulgated pursuant to section 
rule b former rule b authorizes,in addition to any other sanctions permitted by law,imposition of reasonable monetary sanctions,payable to the court or an aggrieved person or both,for the failure without good cause to comply with any rule of court relating to general civil cases,unlawful detainer cases,probate proceedings,civil proceedings in the appellate division of the superior court and small claims cases.for purposes of rule,person means a party,a party attorney,a witness,and an insurer or any other individual or entity whose consent is necessary for the disposition of the case.rule d permits,in addition to the sanctions awardable under b,an order requiring payment to the aggrieved party by the person who has violated an applicable rule of the reasonable expense,including reasonable attorney fees and costs,incurred in connection with the motion for sanctions or the order to show cause.
local rule,one of a series of rules adopted as part of the los angeles superior court delay reduction program,in accordance with the provisions of the trial court delay reduction act of,et,provides the court may impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal to comply with the rules,to comply with any order made hereunder or to meet the time standards deadlines established herein.after directing counsel to various sanctions statutes in the code of civil procedure and government code,as well as to rule,local rule provides,such sanctions may be imposed on a party,if appropriate,on counsel for such party.
like local rule,local rule authorizes sanctions,including monetary sanctions,for the failure or refusal to comply with the court local rules.monetary sanctions may be imposed for such violation against any party,party attorney or witness payable to the county of los angeles.
the sanctions award against mercury was not authorized by statute or court rule 
california courts have inherent power to take appropriate action to secure compliance with its orders,to punish contempt,and to control its proceedings.bauguess paine cal d,see,subd.a e very court shall have the power to do all of the following to compel obedience to its judgments,orders,and process to control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.however,our trial courts have no inherent power to impose monetary sanctions.bauguess,at,commercial investors firmaterr th,d commercial see andrews superior court th,d punitive monetary sanction is not authorized under the inherent powers of the courts.it is a general rule that,outside of a contempt proceeding,trial courts lack inherent power to impose a monetary sanction against an attorney for misconduct in court.people muhammad th,d.
no statute authorizes the imposition of sanctions against mercury 
mercury correctly asserts no statute authorizes the imposition of sanctions against a nonparty insurer for its purported failure to participate in good faith in a mandatory settlement conference.section,the only statute cited by the trial court,is inapplicable for several reasons.first,it empowers a court to impose monetary sanctions for violation,without good cause,of a lawful court order.even if mercury did direct its adjuster and the counsel it retained for hernandez not to negotiate in good faith,that conduct did not violate any court order.second,section provides sanctions may be awarded against a person,defined to include a witness,a party,a party attorney,or both.mercury does not fall within any of those categories,and the trial court expressly declined to sanction hernandez attorney chalamidas.finally,section limits monetary sanctions to payable to the court.the awarded to plaintiffs counsel,in addition to the payable to the court,is doubly inconsistent with that express limitation.
section authorizes the superior courts to provide by local rule for sanctions,including monetary sanctions in the form of reasonable attorney fees,for failure to comply with any of the requirements of properly promulgated local rules.as discussed,the los angeles superior court has done so local rule authorizes sanctions for the failure to comply with the local rules,court orders or the delay reduction program time standards or deadlines.local rule authorizes sanctions,including monetary sanctions,for the failure or refusal to comply with the court rules.but like section,neither section nor local rules and include the authority to sanction a nonparty insurer.section addresses sanctions against counsel,a party represented by counsel,or a party if in pro se.similarly,local rule authorizes sanctions not specifically including monetary sanctions only against a party or a party counsel.local rule authorizes monetary sanctions against any party,party attorney or witness.
moreover,although local rule d provides for the mandatory attendance at a settlement conference of all persons whose consent is required to effect a binding settlement,and specifically defines that category to include an authorized representative of any insurance company which has coverage involved in the case,nothing in local rules d or e,which govern the conduct of settlement conferences,purports to require the participants,once present,to negotiate with each other.thus,neither section nor the local rules justified the award of sanctions against mercury.
b.the sanctions award was not properly based on rule 
as mercury observes in its appellate brief,rule,identified by the trial court as being more specific to imposing sanctions relative to settlement conferences,is the only possible source of authority for the sanctions imposed against it.unlike the statutes and local rules discussed above,rule expressly authorizes the court to order payment of reasonable monetary sanctions to the court,an aggrieved person or both not only by a party or the party attorney but also by an insurer or any other individual or entity whose consent is necessary for the disposition of the case for any failure without good cause to comply with applicable provisions of the california rules of court.nonetheless,mercury argues rule authorization for an award of sanctions against a nonparty insurer is invalid because it is not grounded in statute and,in any event,its conduct at the mandatory settlement conference did not violate any rule of court and is not sanctionable.although we have considerable doubt as to mercury first argument,we agree with the second and reverse the award of sanctions.
prior to july,former rule now rule provided,the failure of any person to comply with these rules,local rules,or order of the court,unless good cause is shown,or failure to participate in good faith in any conference those rules or an order of the court require,is an unlawful interference with the proceedings of the court.the court may order the person at fault to pay the opposing party reasonable expenses and counsel fees and to reimburse or make payment to the county,may order an appropriate change in the calendar status of the action,and for failure to comply with local rules may impose sanctions authorized under section of the code of civil procedure and under section b of the government code,in addition to any other sanction permitted by law.
the rule was substantially revised,effective july,in response to the court of appeal decision in commercial,supra,th,d,which reversed an award of sanctions under former rule against a lawyer who had caused a mistrial by repeatedly violating the trial court in limine rulings.after thoroughly reviewing the statutory authority governing sanctions,and particularly attorney fees as sanctions,the commercial court held former rule was invalid to the extent the rule purports to allow sanctions inconsistent with the limits and conditions provided in an applicable statute.id.at,d.the court suggested the defect in the rule could be cured by amending it to incorporate the statutory terms and conditions for sanctions awards.id.at,fn,d.
in its november,report recommending amendments to former rule to the judicial council of california the council civil and small claims advisory committee summarized the holding in commercial and proposed amending the rule although not in precisely the manner suggested by the appellate court.specifically,the revised rule,as proposed and then adopted by the judicial council,provided,in addition to any other sanctions permitted by law,the court may order a person,after written notice and an opportunity to be heard,to pay reasonable monetary sanctions to the court or an aggrieved person,or both,for failure to comply with the the rules of court governing civil pretrial and trial procedure,unless good cause is shown.the amended rule also provided for the same procedural safeguards contained in section,authorizing monetary sanctions for violations of court orders.
in proposing the rule expressly authorizing monetary sanctions for failure to comply with the civil pretrial and trial rules of the california rules of court,the civil and small claims advisory committee report explained,the judicial council is constitutionally empowered to adopt rules for court administration practice,and procedure,not inconsistent with statute.citation.unless they transcend legislative enactments,the rules and procedures adopted by the judicial council have the force of law.citation.there is presently no statute that specifically provides for the award of sanctions specifically for failure to comply with the california rules of court.because of the absence of any direct statute,it is entirely appropriate for the judicial council to exercise its authority to establish a clear sanctions rule in this area.such a rule is particularly important in light of the increased significance of civil pretrial and trial rules in the rules of court since rule preemption of local rules became effective on july.
if mercury contends the judicial council exceeded its authority by adopting a rule providing for monetary sanctions for violations of the rules of provision that,concededly,is not expressly authorized by statute,but also does not conflict with any statute see people hall cal th,d,judicial council may not adopt rules inconsistent with the governing statutes or readily determinable statutory intent see in re robin cal d,invalidating rule of court to the extent it was inconsistent with legislative intent commercial,supra,th at,d i t is settled law that in order to comply with the constitutional requirement of consistency with statutory law,a rule of court must not conflict with the statutory intent we disagree.the judicial council constitutional authority to adopt rules for court administration,practice and procedure t o improve the administration of justice cal,art.vi,subd.d,we believe,necessarily includes the concomitant authority to create the means to enforce those rules,provided only that t he rules adopted shall not be inconsistent with statute.ibid.it would simply make no sense to allow a court to impose sanctions for violations of its own orders relating to practice and procedure see,but not for violations of the more generally applicable rules of court.see datig dove books,th,fn,d w e are unaware of any legislative enactments which are contrary to former rule provision for an award of attorney fees as a sa
