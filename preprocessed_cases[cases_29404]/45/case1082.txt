bristol west insurance company changed burl and cathy mcliechey insurance policy after the mcliecheys moved into a higher risk area,received a worse credit rating,and had a two week lapse in insurance coverage due to a temporary inability to pay premiums.the mcliecheys allege,on behalf of similarly situated class members,that bristol west three justifications for changing their insurance policy violated chapter of the michigan insurance code,a statute that regulates the setting of insurance rates.see.comp.laws et.the district court dismissed the mcliecheys complaint because the statutes upon which the mcliecheys relied do not create a private cause of action.
we affirm because the two michigan statutes upon which the mcliecheys rely do not establish a cause of action.first,under michigan law,chapter of the michigan insurance code would only create a private cause of action if the remedies that chapter provided were plainly inadequate.in this case,chapter provides an adequate remedy,although not necessarily the remedy that class members most desire.second,the consumer protection act.comp.laws.et,which creates a private cause of action,does not extend to claims under chapter of the michigan insurance code.the consumer protection act does not apply to claims regarding transactions or conduct specifically authorized by statute,and chapter specifically authorizes and regulates the setting of insurance rates.
this case involves the interpretation of chapter of the michigan insurance code,also known as the essential insurance act,which regulates the setting of insurance rates.comp.laws.chapter provides that r ates shall not be excessive,inadequate,or unfairly discriminatory,defined as not reasonably justified by differences in losses,expenses,or both,or by differences in the uncertainty of loss,for the individuals or risks to which the rates apply.id.the statute lists factors that insurance companies may consider in setting automobile insurance,age of the driver,vehicle characteristics,commuting mileage,personal protection insurance,earned income,use of safety belts,and home insurance,use of locks and smoke detectors,and factors that they may not consider,sex,marital status.id.the statute also permits insurance companies to maintain statistical reporting territories and,if the commissioner of insurance agrees,utilize factors in addition to those specified in the statute.id.finally,i f uniformly applied to all its insured and if the plan is consistent with the purposes of chapter and reflects reasonably anticipated reductions in losses or expenses,an insurer may establish and maintain a premium discount plan utilizing additional factors.id.
chapter also establishes a remedial scheme.if a person has reason to believe that an insurer has improperly denied him or her insurance or has charged an incorrect premium for that insurance,that person is entitled to a private informal conference with the insurer and to a review before the c ommissioner,if the conference fails to resolve the dispute.id.see also id.if the insurer refuses to meet or the insurer proposed resolution of the claim is unsatisfactory,the person shall be entitled to a determination of the matter by the c ommissioner,who shall by rule establish a procedure for determination which shall be reasonably calculated to resolve these matters informally and as rapidly as possible,while protecting the interests of both the person and the insurer.id.the person may then request that the commissioner proceed to hear the matter as a contested case,and may then seek judicial review.flumignan detroit auto.as discussed in more detail below,the mcliecheys argue that the statute remedial scheme is plainly inadequate,thus triggering the inference under michigan law that the legislature intended to create a private cause of action.
plaintiffs filed a class action in the kent county circuit court,alleging that bristol west breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,violated the michigan consumer protection act.comp.laws et,and violated the michigan essential insurance act.comp.laws et.chapter of the michigan insurance code.relying on diversity jurisdiction,and removal,bristol west filed a notice of removal on july,to remove the case to federal court,and,on july,filed a motion to dismiss.
the federal district court dismissed all three claims in the mcliecheys complaint.first,the district court dismissed the count alleging a violation of chapter because the remedial scheme in chapter was not plainly inadequate,and chapter,therefore,did not create a private cause of action.second,the district court dismissed the mcliecheys consumer protection act claim because that act does not apply to bristol west decisions,which fell under the michigan insurance code.third,the district court dismissed the class good faith and fair dealing claim,a decision that the mcliecheys do not challenge on appeal.finally,the district court noted that dismissal was warranted on the alternative grounds of exhaustion of administrative remedies and primary jurisdiction,grounds that we do not reach here.
on appeal,the mcliecheys challenge the district court decision to dismiss the chapter claim,arguing that the remedy that chapter provides is plainly inadequate,and,therefore,the courts should infer that the michigan legislature intended to create a private cause of action.they also challenge the district court decision to dismiss the consumer protection act claim,arguing that the michigan insurance code did not specifically authorize bristol west behavior and that the consumer protection act,therefore,provides them with a cause of action.both arguments are without merit and the mcliecheys can not pursue a private cause of action against bristol west under either chapter or the consumer protection act.
first,chapter does not create a private cause of action because its remedial scheme is not plainly inadequate.under michigan law,where a statute gives new rights and prescribes new remedies,such remedies must be strictly pursued and a party seeking a remedy under the act is confined to the remedy conferred thereby and to that only.mcclements ford motor,amended,quoting monroe beverage stroh brewery.because chapter does not explicitly provide for a private cause of action,courts will interpret the statute as creating one only if the statutory remedial scheme is plainly inadequate,see aviation,capital region airport,or provide s no means of enforcement,see,premier support.the parties fundamentally disagree over whether michigan case law supports the proposition that chapter remedial scheme is plainly inadequate,but agree that there is no case directly on point.
michigan cases do suggest,however,that the remedies in chapter are not plainly inadequate.in mcclements,for example,the michigan supreme court ruled that an employee could not bring a common law claim for negligent retention in the context of a workplace sexual harassment claim.at.the statute at issue provided a remedial scheme that included only a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages,or both,and not a common law claim of negligent retention.id.quoting.comp.laws.the michigan supreme court,finding the remedial scheme adequate,construed the statute narrowly and did not allow the plaintiff to recover under a cause of action that the statute did not provide.in,the michigan court of appeals decided that an employer whose employee was injured by a tortfeasor could not sue the third party for damages in the form of increased worker compensation premiums and lost profits.at.the michigan statute in only permitted the employer to recover from the tortfeasor for benefits that the employer paid to the injured employee,and not for the increased premiums.id.at.because the statute permitted the employer to obtain some relief but not all the relief that the employer sought,the court reasoned that the statute remedies were not plainly inadequate.id.at.
like the statutes in mcclements and,chapter provides a remedial scheme for the mcliecheys,and like the remedial scheme in mcclements and,the remedial scheme does not provide the plaintiff with the ideal remedy a claim
