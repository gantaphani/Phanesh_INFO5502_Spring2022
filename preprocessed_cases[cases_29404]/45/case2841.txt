when a claimant seeks workers compensation benefits from the california insurance guarantee association ciga for a claim arising out of a car accident,is ciga entitled to a credit for underinsured motorist benefits the claimant received for the same accident yes.
scott mangum,the claimant in this workers compensation case,was injured in a car accident.after collecting in underinsured motorist benefits from his automobile insurance carrier,mangum sought workers compensation benefits for the accident.while his claim was pending,the workers compensation carrier for mangum employer became insolvent,and ciga stepped in to cover the obligations of the insolvent carrier.the workers compensation appeals board wcab refused to give ciga an credit for the underinsured motorist benefits mangum had received because it found no statutory provision for such a credit.
we conclude the statutes governing ciga do allow ciga to claim a credit for the underinsured motorist benefits mangum received for the accident.accordingly,we will annul the wcab decision and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in july,while returning to the office after running an errand for his employer,scott mangum injured his spine in a car accident.at the time of the injury,his employer workers compensation carrier was superior national insurance company.
sometime before april,mangum settled with the other driver automobile insurance carrier for the policy limit of.in august,mangum received an additional from his own automobile insurance carrier,which represented payment of mangum underinsured motorist coverage limit of less the recovered from the other driver insurance.
it was not until that mangum learned his injury was industrially related and filed a workers compensation claim.mangum originally believed the accident was not covered by workers compensation because,after completing the errand for his employer,he had gone to the bank and stopped for lunch before returning to the office.
in august,a workers compensation administrative law judge wcj found mangum had suffered a compensable injury to his spine.on reconsideration,the wcab upheld that finding.
while the petition for reconsideration was pending,a court found superior national was insolvent and ordered the carrier liquidated.this order triggered ciga involvement.see,american nat.ins.low th,d.ciga general purpose is to pay the obligations of an insolvent insurer.reynolds california ins.guarantee d,d.
ciga was subsequently joined as a party defendant in the workers compensation proceeding.based on mangum receipt of the from his automobile insurer,ciga petitioned the wcj for a credit pursuant to subdivision c of insurance code section section c.that section provides in relevant part if damages against uninsured motorists are recoverable by the claimant from his or her own insurer,the applicable limits of the uninsured motorists coverage shall be a credit against a covered claim payable under this article.c.ciga contended the reference in section c to uninsured motorist coverage must be construed to include underinsured motorist coverage the wcj disagreed.
ciga petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,renewing its claim for a credit under section c.in the alternative,ciga also argued that the first in workers compensation benefits due mangum was not a covered claim payable by ciga under subdivision c of insurance code section section c because that amount was covered by other insurance available to,his underinsured motorist insurance.section c specifically excludes from the definition of a covered claim payable by ciga any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured.c i.
the wcab granted reconsideration and affirmed the wcj decision.the wcab concluded that i f ciga were correct about its argument regarding insurance code section c to include underinsured coverage,there would be no need for insurance code section c which refers only to uninsured motorist.if c were intended to apply to underinsured coverage,it would so provide.there is no such provision.therefore,we find no statutory provision for the credit sought by ciga.
ciga petitioned this court for a writ of review.we granted ciga petition to determine the lawfulness of the wcab decision following reconsideration.
discussion 
on review of a decision by the wcab,we decide questions of statutory interpretation de novo.telles transport,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
the question here is whether the statutes governing,either section c or section c allow ciga to claim a credit for underinsured motorist benefits a claimant receives for the same accident that gives rise to his claim for workers compensation benefits.for the reasons that follow,we conclude the answer is yes.
we begin with some basic tenets of statutory construction.it is a settled principle in california law that when statutory language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,and courts should not indulge in it.citation.however,despite the general rule that ambiguity is a condition precedent to interpretation,t he literal meaning of the words of a statute may be disregarded to avoid absurd results or to give effect to manifest purposes that,in the light of the statute legislative history,appear from its provisions considered as a whole.california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.
statutes governing ciga 
with these principles in mind,we turn to the statutes governing ciga.established in under the guarantee act of the,ciga provides insolvency insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.citations.although funded by a compulsory membership of insurance companies doing business in california,ciga was created to provide a limited form of protection for insureds and the public,not to provide a fund to protect insurance carriers.citations.ciga role in guaranteeing workers compensation claims is therefore limited 
ciga is not,and was not created to act as,an ordinary insurance company.citation.it is a statutory entity that depends on the guarantee act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers,duties,and protections.citation.ciga issues no policies,collects no premiums,makes no profits,and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.citation.ciga duties are not with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.citation.instead,ciga authority and liability in discharging its statutorily circumscribed duties are limited to paying the amount of covered claims.citations.ciga is authorized by statute to pay only covered claims of an insolvent insurer,those determined by the legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public.citation.citation.ciga has the statutory authority to deny a noncovered claim.citation.denny workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
covered claims section c 
since covered claims are not coextensive with an insolvent insurer obligations under its policies,ciga can not and does not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.citation.indeed,ciga is expressly forbidden to do so except where the claim at issue is a covered claim.citation.it necessarily follows that ciga first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a covered claim.citation.it is unequivocally clear the scope of ciga rights and duties turns on the definition of covered claim.citation.denny workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.
subdivision c of insurance code section defines the term covered claim to include,in the case of a policy of workers compensation insurance,the obligations of an insolvent insurer to provide workers compensation benefits under the workers compensation law of this state.thus,mangum claim for workers compensation benefits from ciga falls within the general definition of a covered claim ciga must pay.section c,however,specifically excludes from a covered claim any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by the provisions of this ar
