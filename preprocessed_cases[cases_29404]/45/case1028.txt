on november,thomas kovach was riding his motorcycle while intoxicated,ran a stop sign,and collided with another vehicle in the intersection.he sustained severe injuries that led to the amputation of his left leg below the knee.kovach was insured under an accidental death and dismemberment ad d insurance policy provided by his wife employer hereafter referred to as the plan.he and his wife rebecca filed a claim with zurich american insurance company,the administrator of the plan,for dismemberment benefits.zurich denied the kovaches claim after determining that kovach injuries were caused by his drunk driving and therefore not covered as an accidental occurrence under the plan.
the kovaches brought a claim under the employee retirement income security act,erisa,that challenged zurich denial of coverage.applying a deferential standard,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of zurich.on appeal,the kovaches argue that the district court should have applied a de novo standard of review because zurich improperly delegated its decisionmaking authority to an outside lawyer,and zurich denial of their claim was improper under either standard.although we reject the kovaches first argument,we agree with their second.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for the entry of a judgment in favor of the kovaches.
background 
a.the ad d policy 
rebecca kovach enrolled in the plan through her employer,keycorp.zurich,as the plan administrator,was responsible for the processing and payment of claims under the plan and was the claims fiduciary.the ad d coverage paid benefits for losses,including dismemberment,resulting from an injury according to the following definition 
injury means a bodily injury directly caused by accidental means which is independent of all other causes,results from a hazard,and occurs while the covered person is insured under this policy.
although the term accidental is not defined,the plan includes several explicit exclusions,including the following 
a loss shall not be a covered loss if it is caused by,contributed to,or resulted from 
suicide,attempted suicide,or a purposeful wound 
skydiving,parasailing,hangglinding sic,or any similar activity 
kovach policy provided for up to of coverage.in the case of an amputated limb,the policy paid.kovach was covered under his wife policy.
b.kovach accident and resulting amputation 
on november,kovach was involved in a collision while riding his motorcycle in ravenna,ohio.according to the crash report filed by the responding officer,kovach ran a stop sign at a intersection and was struck by a car.kovach was taken to robinson memorial hospital in portage county to be stabilized.based on the severity of his injuries,he was then flown via medivac helicopter to the cleveland metrohealth medical center.the doctors were unable to save kovach left leg,which they amputated just below the knee.
kovach admission report from metrohealth noted that a blood sample taken at robinson memorial hospital after the accident and tested by an outside lab showed that kovach had a blood alcohol content bac of well over the legal limit in ohio of.see a.metrohealth took its own sample of kovach blood sometime after his arrival.those results showed a bac of and also showed the presence of opiates and benzodiazepines.the kovaches contend that the positive drug test was due to medically administered valium and morphine given to kovach after the accident,a contention not refuted by the record.
zurich denial of the kovaches ad d claim 
kovach and his wife timely filed a dismemberment claim with zurich in december.the claim was based on kovach amputation.zurich subsequently retained the services of cs claims group,an independent investigation firm,to obtain kovach hospital and toxicology records,as well as the records from all of his treating physicians.upon receiving the metrohealth records and noting kovach bac,zurich decreased its reserves on the claim from to in anticipation that the claim would be denied.zurich then hired an attorney,daniel maguire,to review kovach file and to draft a denial letter based on the policy provisions if maguire agreed that the claim should be denied.the insurer letter to maguire noted that kovach was the operator of a motorcycle that appears to have run a stop sign and hit another vehicle in the intersection and was intoxicated at the time of loss.
maguire agreed with zurich inclination that the claim should be denied and prepared an opinion letter that discussed the applicable caselaw,concluding that no benefits were payable.zurich subsequently authorized a denial of the benefits.it sent a denial letter to the kovaches in march using language taken from maguire opinion letter.the denial letter explained that zurich had concluded that kovach injury was not due to an accident under the terms of the plan because kovach a was driving with almost twice the legal bac,b had tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines,and c had,according to the police officer responding to the accident,run a stop sign and thereby initiated the crash.zurich thus reasoned that the injury was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving while under the influence of alcohol and possibly drugs.citing several federal decisions upholding the denial of ad d benefits under allegedly similar circumstances,zurich also concluded that the facts supported the application of the policy exclusion.
the kovaches timely appealed zurich initial denial of the claim to the insurer erisa review committee.they submitted what they characterized as newly discovered relevant evidence in the form of kovach affidavit,which asserted that the other driver,not he,ran the stop sign.zurich responded by clarifying that the kovaches were not presenting newly discovered evidence,but rather a different version of the events surrounding the incident.zurich nevertheless noted that it had decided to stay the appeal in order to clarify the issue of which party was at fault for the collision.
to investigate the fault issue,zurich again retained cs claims group,to obtain the ravenna police department final traffic crash report.the report confirmed that kovach had been cited for a violation and had tested positive for drugs based on the metrohealth test results.zurich had previously seen only the initial accident report,which lacked these details.after reviewing this information,zurich erisa review committee informed the kovaches counsel that it had affirmed the denial of benefits.
d.the lawsuit 
the kovaches filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio in august.they named both zurich and kovach employer,keycorp,as defendants.keycorp was dismissed as a defendant shortly thereafter.the parties subsequently filed for judgment based upon the administrative record.in september,the district court issued an order upholding zurich denial of benefits.the kovaches have timely appealed that order.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court disposition of an erisa action based upon the administrative record,and apply the same legal standard as the district court.wilkins baptist healthcare,cir.as discussed in part.below,the district court in this case appropriately reviewed the kovaches suit under the standard because the plan granted discretionary authority to zurich as the plan administrator to interpret the plan terms and to determine its benefits.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d establishing the standard of review in erisa cases where the plan administrator has discretionary authority glenn metlife.ins,cir applying firestone standard of review.
under the standard,we must uphold the administrator decision if the administrator interpretation of the plan provisions is reasonable.morrison marsh mclennan,cir citing firestone,at.but the arbitrary and capricious standard is not a rubber stamp of the administrator decision.glenn,at.rather,it requires us to review the quality and quantity of the evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.mcdonald.life ins,cir.
zurich retention of maguire does not alter the applicable standard of review 
the parties agree that the plan gives zurich discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.as noted above,this vesting of discretionary authority in zurich would typically lead us to apply an standard of review.but the kovaches argue that,even where a plan vests the administrator with discretion,a de novo review of claim determinations is required if an entity or person other than the one authorized by the plan renders the decision.see sanford harvard,cir holding that where an unauthorized body that does not have fiduciary discretion to determine benefits eligibility renders such a decision,review is not warranted.the kovaches contend that de novo review should apply in this case because zurich improperly delegated its discretionary authority to construe the plan and determine coverage to maguire,an outside attorney who was not authorized by the plan to act in such a fiduciary capacity.
the district court properly rejected this argument.nothing in the record indicates that zurich in fact delegated to maguire its authority to construe the plan or make a determination of whether to pay the kovaches claim.zurich initially set aside of reserves for the claim,the full amount that the kovaches would have been entitled to if their claim had been allowed.but after zurich received kovach medical and toxicology records,it reduced the reserves to because this matter may be a potential denial.zurich letter to maguire seeking a legal opinion stated e nclosed please find copy of the file for your review and if in agreement,the drafting of the denial based on policy provisions.after receiving maguire opinion letter,patricia lane of zurich communicated to the claims specialist assigned to the claim you have my authority to deny the claim and prepare and release the letter of denial today.the claim denial sent to the kovaches incorporated language from maguire opinion letter,but was on zurich letterhead and was signed on behalf of the company.zurich,not maguire,made the final decision regarding the kovaches claim.
to the extent that the kovaches argue that de novo review should apply because zurich use of an outside expert advisor was not explicitly authorized by the plan,that argument is not properly before us because the kovaches did not raise it before the district court.see chandler jones,cir it is a principle of appellate review that appellate courts do not address claims not properly presented below.but this contention,even if it were properly before us,lacks any support in the caselaw.zurich retention of outside counsel to assist it in its claim determination would in fact seem to demonstrate that it took the process seriously and attempted to ensure that its decision had a strong legal basis.see,karras first colony life ins.pension plan,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,t he fact that the plan administrator hired and relied upon outside legal counsel bolsters its final conclusion.
the kovaches have not demonstrated that zurich retention of maguire amounted to the sort of improper delegation of authority that would require us to apply a de novo standard of review to zurich decision.we will thus proceed to examine zurich denial of the kovaches claim under the standard.
zurich denial of coverage 
zurich denied coverage because it determined that kovach injuries were not the result of an accident,but were the reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving while highly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs.moreover,zurich decided that kovach injuries fell under the plan exclusion because he intentionally ingested a significant quantity of alcohol and apparently opiates and benzodiazepines,and his injury occurred as a result of polysubstance intoxication.zurich based this conclusion on a body of federal common law from within this circuit addressing allegedly similar scenarios.
we note at the outset that drunk driving is,dangerous,and easily avoidable.but,as will be discussed in more detail below,so are many other activities that contribute to wrecks that a typical policyholder would consider accidental.we must thus refrain from allowing our moral judgments about drunk driving to influence our review of zurich interpretation of the relevant plan provisions.
whether lennon controls 
the sole published decision of this court that has dealt with the issues now before us is lennon metropolitan life insurance,cir.that case involved what the court described as grossly negligent,reckless drunk driving,id.at,and resulted in three separate lead,a concurrence,and a dissent.lennon was insured under an personal accident insurance pai policy.on the day in question,he drove his car at a high rate of speed the wrong way down a portion of a divided street,losing control of his vehicle.the car hit a curb,flew into the air,and slammed into a brick wall,killing lennon.lennon bac was later measured at,more than three times the legal limit in effect at the time and high enough to render him only.see blood alcohol levels and metabolism.html.death has been documented to occur at bacs starting at.id.
lennon pai policy provided in pertinent part as follows 
if,while insured for personal accident insurance,an insured sustains accidental bodily injuries,and within one year thereafter shall have suffered loss of life as a direct result of such bodily injuries independently of all other causes,metlife shall pay the benefit specified for such losses.
lennon,at alterations in original.metlife denied benefits to lennon estate,noting in its denial letter that lennon bac was three times the legal limit and that t he act of driving impaired rendered the infliction of serious injury or death reasonably foreseeable and,hence,not accidental.id.at.it thus concluded that lennon death was not directly the result of accidental injuries,independent of all other causes.id.
the lead opinion concluded that metlife had not acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying coverage for lennon death.id.at.borrowing terminology from tort law,the lead opinion characterized lennon behavior as grossly negligent.id.at.it therefore reasoned that in extreme cases courts may treat wanton misconduct more like an intentional tort than like negligence,id.quoting dan dobbs,the law of torts,at,and that a plan administrator could similarly treat such conduct as not accidental under a policy that only covers accidents.lennon,at.
the lead lennon opinion also stated that the number of cases holding that drunk driving wrecks are not accidents independently supports the conclusion that metlife determination was not arbitrary and capricious.id.at collecting cases.on this point,the concurring opinion agreed.id.at boggs,concurring.importantly,though,the lead opinion specifically cautioned that 
we do not reach the question of whether a fiduciary can reasonably deny accidental benefits for an injury that results from any negligent or any illegal behavior,or from driving while only somewhat impaired.
id.at emphasis added.the concurring opinion,moreover,made clear that the majority holding did not reach the question of whether to approve or disapprove of metlife use of a reasonably likely to occur standard for defining what is an accident,and further noted that its conclusion was based on the set of facts presented here id.at.
although the insightful analyses from all three of the lennon opinions are highly informative for our present review,lennon is distinguishable and therefore not controlling.the most obvious distinction is the disparity between lennon and kovach bacs versus.lennon bac was more than twice that of kovach and more than four times the legal limit in place at the time of kovach wreck.the lead lennon opinion further acknowledged that drivers with levels above the legal limit as a group are far more likely to arrive home safely than drivers who are extremely drunk.at emphasis added citing stamp metro.life ins,d,the statistics are meaningless in this context they do not consider the degree of his intoxication.for this reason,the lennon majority refused to impose a blanket standard allowing insurers to consider injuries resulting from any wreck in which the driver is intoxicated as nonaccidental.id.at.compared to the dangerously high level of intoxication involved in lennon,kovach intoxication appears to fall into the somewhat impaired category that lennon declined to address.
lennon is distinct from the case before us in other ways as well.the lead opinion was careful to note that the circumstances of lennon crash were extreme 
this case involved extremely high content,the manner in which lennon car flew off the road,the lack of an alternative explanation for the death,and lennon driving the wrong way down the rendered at least reasonable metlife conclusions that lennon did not die as a result of an accident under the plan.
id.at.we agree with the lennon lead opinion that driving the wrong way down a street while drunk to the point of,and at a rate of speed so fast that the vehicle is on the verge of becoming airborne,amounts to a level of recklessness that would render the resulting injuries highly likely,and therefore not accidental.
the facts surrounding kovach crash,however,are nowhere near as dramatic as those in lennon.besides driving while a level less than half that of only other thing that kovach did was run a stop sign,something done with unfortunate frequency by sober drivers.there is no indication in the record that kovach was traveling at an abnormally high rate of speed or driving in an otherwise risky manner.
finally,we note that zurich did could relied on lennon in its review of the kovaches claim.the lennon opinion was issued more than a year after the kovachs claim was formally denied by zurich.
our dissenting colleague,however,contends that we have overlooked two critical factors in our analysis that kovach was riding a motorcycle,which the dissent characterizes as an especially dangerous form of transportation,and that he was intoxicated on opiates at the time of the accident.dissenting op.at according to the dissent,these two overlooked factors establish that kovach behavior was as risky as lennon,and that an accident under such circumstances was highly likely to occur.dissenting op.at,but the record does not support either contention.
first,with regard to the motorcycle argument,the statistics cited by the dissent show at most an increased likelihood of death or injury during a motorcycle crash,not an increased likelihood of a crash as an initial matter.dissenting op.at but the latter,not the former,is the relevant event in the instant case.moreover,in making its coverage decision,zurich did not rely on the fact that kovach was on a motorcycle when the accident occurred,so whether a motorcycle is a particularly dangerous form of transportation is irrelevant to our analysis.see shelby county health care majestic star casino,llc,cir holding that a plan administrator can not support its argument on appeal with a fact not relied upon in its initial coverage determination.
second,the dissent infers that vicodin,an opiate,was in kovach system at the time of the accident because he had a prescription for the drug.dissenting op.at but a prescription alone is not sufficient proof that kovach was actually taking the drug,or that it was still in his system at the time of the accident.the physicians desk reference cited by the dissent simply states that vicodin may impair mental or physical abilities.dissenting op.at this is not proof that it did so for kovach,and certainly does not show that the collision was highly likely to occur even if some of the drug was still in his system at the time of the accident.see part.below for a discussion of the highly likely standard to be applied in determining whether an event is accidental.
furthermore,zurich could have obtained the relevant records from the robinson memorial hospital the first hospital to which kovach was taken if it had wanted to,records that would have allegedly established that kovach was on vicodin at the time of the accident.zurich apparently decided not to pursue the issue despite the fact that it had the burden of proving that kovach was under the influence of vicodin at the time of the accident.moreover,because zurich did not pursue the matter and did not rely on the argument in denying coverage,it is not relevant to our analysis.see majestic star casino,llc,at.
zurich definition of accidental 
having determined that lennon does not control the case before us,we are left to examine zurich denial of benefits based on its interpretation of the term accidental as not including wrecks.our task is not to address whether that decision was correct.instead,the question before us is whether it was arbitrary and capricious.we answer that question in the affirmative.
the central focus of our review is whether zurich interpretation of the term accidental,as used in the plan,was reasonable.see morrison marsh mclennan,cir stating that an administrator interpretation of plan provisions will be upheld if it is reasonable.erisa requires that benefit plans must be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.a.accordingly,i n interpreting a plan,the administrator must adhere to the plain meaning of its language as it would be construed by an ordinary person.morgan skf usa,cir.a n insured should not have to consult a long line of case law or law review articles and treatises to determine the coverage he or she is purchasing under an insurance policy.walker metro.life ins,supp d,quoting harrell minnesota mut.life ins.
ordinary meaning 
we have little doubt that an ordinary person would characterize kovach collision at the intersection to be an accident.webster dictionary offers the following pertinent definition of the word accidental 
a occurring unexpectedly or by chance b happening without intent or through carelessness and often with unfortunate results 
kovach wreck clearly fits this definition in that he did not expect or intend to hit another vehicle.rather,he carelessly or,more accurately,a stop sign,with the unfortunate result that he was injured in the ensuing collision.
a hypothetical witness placing a call to report kovach crash would almost certainly have reported that he or she had just seen an accident.indeed,zurich own language throughout the administrative record reflects that kovach wreck was considered to be an accident in the ordinary sense of the word.in particular,the company frequently referred to the crash as an accident in its own documentation regarding the claim 
committee determined that the issue regarding which party was at fault for the accident which resulted in the insured loss requires further clarification.
the committee deferred its decision pending receipt of clarification from the relevant law enforcement authorities regarding which party was at fault in the accident at issue.

upon receipt of the medical records from robinson hospital and driving record,loss will be referred for legal coverage opinion,as the claimant was intoxicated at the time of the accident.
emphasis added.
zurich reliance on caselaw 
zurich defends its interpretation of the word accidental almost entirely on the basis that it relied on a body of caselaw holding that wrecks are not accidents for erisa purposes.but in this case,where kovach intoxication and the circumstances of his accident were by no means extreme as they were in lennon,we conclude that zurich was unreasonable in relying solely on caselaw to justify its denial of benefits to the kovaches.this court has held,in the erisa context,that even under the highly deferential standard,courts have 
an obligation under erisa to review the administrative record in order to determine whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily and capriciously in making erisa benefits determinations.this obligation inherently includes some review of the quality and quantity of the evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.otherwise,courts would be rendered to nothing more than rubber stamps for any plan administrator decision even under the deferential review we will not uphold a termination when there is an absence of reasoning in the record to support it.
mcdonald.life ins,cir citation omitted.moreover,the cases zurich relied upon in its denial of metropolitan life insurance,cir nelson sun life assurance of canada,walker metropolitan life insurance,d,miller international,cates metropolitan life insurance,d,and fowler metropolitan life insurance,do not uniformly support zurich position.
the only sixth circuit opinion cited in the denial letter,jones metropolitan life,did not even involve intoxication,and in fact supports the kovaches.there,the court concluded that metlife acted arbitrarily and capriciously by interpreting the term accident in a manner that excluded coverage where the plaintiff,a nurse,injured her knee while bending down to administer first aid to a patient.it thus added an eligibility requirement that the injury be caused by an external force or event under the guise of interpreting the term accident that does not exist in either the plan documents or federal common law.at.further,in walker metropolitan life,the insured had a bac of substantially higher than kovach and was driving at a high rate of speed when he crashed into a wall.d at.and the injured driver in miller had a bac of.at,while the insured in fowler metropolitan life had a bac of.at.finally,the policy in cates metropolitan life excluded injuries resulting from the use of any drug or medicine.there,the administrator concluded in its denial letter that alcohol is considered by the medical community to be a drug.d at.no such exclusion is present in the kovaches ad d policy.the district court in cates,without providing any analysis,upheld the insurer denial of the claim on the basis that the insured injuries were reasonably foreseeable at a bac of and therefore nonaccidental.id.at.
zurich is essentially left with only two decisions involving facts generally analogous to kovach sun life.at upholding the denial of benefits to an insured who was involved in a wreck while driving with a bac of,and cates metropolitan life.but having to place all of its eggs in the basket of these two lower court decisions one of which,cates,is factually distinguishable because of the drug exclusion to deny the kovaches claim was unreasonable in light of the decision in harrell metropolitan life insurance,d,which reached the opposite result.there,the insured died in a wreck and was found to have a bac of.id.at.the district court rejected the plan administrator argument that the death was not accidental,holding that,to allow denial of benefits when a bad result is reasonably foreseeable undermines a common conception of accidental injuries,and therefore could violate erisa requirement that benefit plans be written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.id.at quoting a.
the foreseeability of injury 
zurich has offered no evidence whatsoever about the foreseeability of harm to kovach based on his bac of.perhaps the reason that it did not do so is that its outright exclusion of collisions from its definition of accidental is not born out by the statistics,as aptly summarized in the lennon dissent 
a ccording to the national highway traffic safety administration,people died in motor vehicle crashes in,a figure that accounts for percent of all deaths that year.the federal bureau of investigation uniform crime report indicates that an estimated motorists were arrested for driving under the influence that year.finally,the substance abuse and mental health services administration,in a report issued september,found an estimated million persons nationwide took trips during.even assuming only million trips occurred that year,a mere percent of impaired motorists were arrested,while percent died in incidents.thus,injury or death most certainly can not be deemed a highly likely consequence of driving while intoxicated.see west aetna life ins,d,what common knowledge should actually tell a person driving while intoxicated is that he or she is far more likely to be arrested for driving while intoxicated than to die or be injured in an alcohol related automobile crash,and far more likely to arrive home than to be either arrested,injured,or killed.
lennon,at clay,dissenting.
the lennon dissent employed a conservative estimate of the number of drunk drivers per year that was more than three times less than the actual estimate provided by the substance abuse and mental health services administration.using the full million figure results in a death rate of only of one percent.these statistics should not be taken as a dismissal of the tragic consequences of wrecks instead,they are intended to show only that the likelihood of serious injury or death for each person who drives while intoxicated is something far less than reasonably foreseeable the standard used by zurich in denying the kovach claim.
other risky activities 
we also note that zurich definition of accidental,which excludes activities that render the risk of serious injury reasonably foreseeable,would bar accidental injury coverage in numerous situations in which the typical policyholder would expect to be covered.for example,a driver who runs off the road while typing a text message into a mobile phone would certainly consider himself or herself to have been involved in an accident,and would therefore expect to be entitled to benefits under an policy.but the new york times recently reported on a virginia tech study showing that text messaging increased a driver risk of collision by times.matt richtel,in study,texting lifts crash risk by large margin,times,july.moreover,a study of young drivers in england found that reaction times of young drivers were reduced by text messaging three times more than by drinking alcohol to the legal limit.helen nugent,texting while driving is more dangerous than,london times,september.
a driver also substantially increases his or her risk of a collision by driving while fatigued,see lori yerdon,fatigued driving comparable to drunk driving,army combat center news release,june,available at tabid driving at excessive speeds,see synthesis of safety research related to speed and speed limits.gov safety speed speed.htm and driving after taking certain medications,notably antihistamines,opioids,and muscarinic antagonists,see for transport,road safety report medicines and the potential for unwanted sleepiness in drivers,available at.note that we do not endorse the results of the cited studies these citations are included only to bolster the intuitive notion that the risk of driving can be substantially increased when drivers engage in common activities that do not carry the moral stigma of drunk driving.
if zurich denied coverage for injuries involving the above factors on the basis that they were not caused by an accident,we would likely conclude that its decision was arbitrary and capricious in light of a typical policyholder expectations.we see no reason not to reach the same conclusion based on the kovaches legitimate expectations in the present case.
lack of a specific exclusion 
zurich could have easily added an exclusion in the plan for driving while intoxicated if it had wished to do so,but it did not.the sheer number of court cases nationwide involving disputes over claims by drunk drivers certainly would have put it on notice that it would likely face claims under its ad d policies based on injuries sustained in collisions.zurich did,however,include specific exceptions for skydiving,parasailing,hangglinding sic,or any similar activity.but under the reasonably foreseeable injury standard that zurich employed to deny the kovaches claim,these exclusions would be unnecessary and redundant because all of the listed activities involve a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury.see restatement second of contracts a a n interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect.
in effect,zurich definition of the term accidental has added an eligibility requirement,an exclusion that is not in the plan.based on the facts of the current case,that renders its interpretation of the plan arbitrary and capricious.see jones metro.life.ins,cir in this case,metlife added an eligibility requirement under the guise of interpreting the term accident that does not exist in either the plan documents or federal common law therefore,metlife interpretation of the plan is arbitrary and capricious.we also note that to the extent zurich relied on the presence of drugs in kovach blood samples to deny coverage,where the record provides no basis to find that these drugs were present before the accident,that reliance is a further indication of an arbitrary and capricious decision.
wickman standard 
given the varying interpretations of the word accidental that have been employed by the district courts in this circuit,compare nelson sun life assurance of canada,applying a reasonable foreseeability standard with harrell metropolitan life insurance,d,applying a highly likely to occur standard,the time is ripe for this court to adopt a uniform standard for determining whether an injury is accidental in erisa cases where the word is not otherwise defined in the applicable policy.after giving this matter considerable thought,we adopt the key holding announced in the seminal first circuit case of wickman northwestern national insurance,cir.this key holding consists of asking whether a reasonable person,with background and characteristics similar to the insured,would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured intentional conduct.id.at.
as stated by the concurring opinion in lennon,
wickman standard is a high bar,and arguably many collisions involving a drunk driver would not meet it as a number of courts have noted,the number of drunk driving arrests swamps the number of drunk driving injuries or deaths,making it difficult to conclude that an injurious collision is highly likely to occur as a result of driving while intoxicated.
the dissent,however,asserts that t he combination of alcohol and vicodin made it even more likely that a traffic collision would occur,rendering kovach behavior all the more reckless.dissenting op.at emphasis added.driving while intoxicated concededly makes a collision more likely to occur than if the driver is not intoxicated,but this does not mean that a collision under such circumstances is highly likely.solely for the purpose of illustration,and without any pretense of being statistically accurate,let us hypothetically assume that a sober driver has a probability of a collision.by contrast,assume that driving while intoxicated results in a probability of a collision,leading to the conclusion that a collision is more likely to occur while driving intoxicated.
but to reach the level of more likely than not,the probability of an accident would,by definition,have to be in excess of.and because highly likely,which is necessary under the wickman standard to obviate zurich liability for an accidental injury,obviously means a good bit more probable than simply more likely than not,one might contemplate a or higher probability before the average person would be persuaded that a collision was highly likely to occur.so even if the factors relied on by the dissent made kovach accident more likely,that is not sufficient to meet the wickman standard and thereby relieve zurich of its policy obligations.
the dissent criticizes this analysis by citing stamp metropolitan life insurance,st cir,for the proposition that the highly likely standard is not wedded to the more likely than not standard.dissenting op.at stamp is distinguishable from the present case,however,because the insured in stamp,like the insured in lennon,was driving with a bac of more than three times the legal limit.stamp.at.thus,stamp behavior was materially closer to the extreme behavior at issue in lennon than kovach.this material distinction in circumstances precisely meshes with a key point stressed by the majority opinion in stamp that 
courts have emphasized the decedent level of intoxication when determining that a plan administrator denial of benefits was reasonable we endorse this approach.the wickman analysis does not require a categorical determination that all deaths are per se accidental or nonaccidental.rather,it leads us to consider the circumstances of the fatal event in question.
id.at internal citations omitted.
we further believe that the russian roulette example cited in stamp and by the dissent is inapposite because playing russian roulette has zero social utility,whereas using motorized transportation to move about has a very high level of social utility.in sum,riding a motorcycle while somewhat impaired as opposed to being grossly intoxicated may make an accident more likely to occur,but the risk of such an accident is not so overwhelmingly disproportionate when compared to the social utility involved,see id.at citation omitted,that an ordinary person would consider a collision involving the impaired driver as nonaccidental.
the solution for insurance companies like zurich is simple add an express exclusion in policies covering accidental injuries for driving while under the influence of alcohol,or for any other risky activity that the company wishes to exclude.policyholders would thus be able to form reasonable expectations about what type of coverage they are purchasing without having to make sense of conflicting bodies of caselaw that deal with obscure issues of contractual interpretation.had zurich included such an exclusion in first place,this litigation would have been entirely unnecessary.
conclusion 
zurich decision to deny benefits to the kovaches was contrary to the everyday meaning of the word accidental as it would be understood by a typical policyholder,and was based almost entirely on a body of largely distinguishable district court cases.further,zurich estimation of the foreseeability of kovach injuries is undermined by statistics showing that the likelihood of a wreck for an individual driving at less than extreme levels of intoxication is exceedingly small as a percentage of all such driving expeditions,and arguably represents zurich improper insertion of moral judgments into its analysis of the plan provisions.this observation is born out by the fact that insureds would almost certainly expect to be covered for injuries resulting from many other activities that are at least as risky as driving while intoxicated,such as driving while text messaging or while.
in sum,kovach injuries were not highly likely to occur as a result of his intoxication,in contrast to the injuries that were highly likely to occur under the facts in lennon.zurich interpretation of the plan provisions amounts to an additional,unwritten exclusion for all injuries,which is not permitted under even the most deferential standard of review.for all of these reasons,we conclude that zurich denial of coverage based on kovach injuries being nonaccidental was unreasonable in light of the plan provisions,and thus arbitrary and capricious.see morrison marsh mclennan,cir.
f.the exclusion 
the alternate explanation offered by zurich for its denial of coverage to the kovaches was that kovach injuries fell under the plan provision.the relevant language provides that no benefits are payable if the loss is caused by or connected with a purposeful wound.zurich reasons that kovach injury resulted from his intentional act of becoming drunk and operating a motorcycle,and was therefore.
the eighth circuit,sitting en banc,rejected an identical argument in king hartford life accident insurance,cir en banc.there,the insured had died in a motorcycle accident with a bac of.id.at.that court held,and we agree,that t he most natural reading of the exclusion for injuries contributed to by intentionally injury does not include injuries that were unintended by the participant,but which were contributed to by alcohol intoxication.id.at.although kovach acted intentionally in drinking to excess and then riding his motorcycle,nothing in the record indicates that he did so with a mind towards harming himself.zurich interpretation of the exclusion in question conflates intentional actions with intentional results.kovach injuries,in other words,were the result of the collision,not simply a consequence of his acts of drinking and driving.after all,o ne rarely thinks of a drunk driver who arrives home safely as an injured party.id.kovach intoxication likely contributed to the collision,but to define his excessive drinking as a purposely wound would be an illogical and startling construction.id.zurich denial of the kovaches claim on this basis was therefore arbitrary and capricious.
appropriate proceedings on remand 
this leaves us with a choice as to the appropriate proceedings on remand.in erisa cases,appellate courts have the power either to send the matter back to the plan administrator for further consideration or to make a final decision on the merits.cook liberty life assurance,st cir once a court finds that an administrator has acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying a claim for benefits,the court can either remand the case to the administrator for a renewed evaluation of the claimant case,or it can award a retroactive reinstatement of benefits.this court has frequently awarded benefits outright in lieu of a remand for reconsideration by the plan administrator.see,cooper life ins.of,cir w e find no need to remand this matter for additional consideration by lina because of our conclusion that cooper has clearly established that she is disabled under the plan.kalish liberty mut.liberty life assurance,cir concluding that the appropriate remedy was an immediate award of benefits rather than a remand to allow the plan administrator to consider evidence that it had previously ignored.
the case before us has no unresolved factual issues instead,its resolution revolves around the proper interpretation of the plan question of law that we have answered in the kovaches favor.having determined that kovach collision falls within the definition of accidental and is not subject to the exclusion,we thus conclude that the proper disposition of this case is an award of benefits to the kovaches.see canseco const.laborers pension trust,cir concluding that no remand is necessary where no new factual determinations remain.
iii.conclusion 
for all of the reasons set forth above,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for the entry of a judgment in favor of the kovaches.
i would affirm the district court decision.the majority lengthy opinion raises many arguments that i feel compelled to address but,ultimately,i view this as an unfortunate but fairly simple case.when thomas kovach decided to mount his motorcycle and drive it on crowded roadways,with a blood alcohol content bac nearly double the legal limit,he engaged in behavior that made it reasonably foreseeable and highly likely that he would be injured as a result of his choices.it was,therefore,not arbitrary and capricious for zurich to determine that the ensuing traffic collision was not accidental and to deny his claim.
initially,i emphasize that our review of this case is governed by the arbitrary and capricious standard.the arbitrary and capricious standard requires this panel to uphold the plan administrator decision,if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence,baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir,and if the decision is rational in light of the plan provisions.jones metro.life ins,cir quoting yeager reliance standard life ins,cir.furthermore,plan administrators have great leeway in interpreting ambiguous terms.moos square d,cir citing cook pension plan for salaried employees of cyclops,cir.despite paying lip service to the correct standard of review,the majority analysis smacks of a much more rigid standard of review,and concludes with an impermissible substitution of its judgment for that of the plan administrator.
furthermore,i find that the majority analysis overlooks two crucial factors kovach was driving a motorcycle at the time of the accident,an especially dangerous form of transportation,and it was not arbitrary and capricious for zurich to conclude that,in addition to having a bac nearly twice the legal limit,kovach was also intoxicated on opiates at the time of the accident.
zurich finding of opiate use 
zurich decision to partially base its denial of kovach claim on the conclusion that kovach was under the influence of opiates at the time of the traffic collision was the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and was supported by substantial evidence.administrative record finding kovach death not accidental because it was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of driving while highly intoxicated and under the influence of drugs.a number of considerations support zurich determination that kovach was on opiates at the time of the traffic collision the toxicology report showing a positive test for opiates,evidence indicating kovach regularly used vicodin prior to the traffic collision,kovach failure during zurich review of his claim to dispute zurich findings or provide clarifying evidence.kovach can not fail to dispute zurich findings and then expect factual ambiguities in the record to be resolved in his favor on appeal.see perry simplicity eng g,cir noting that the primary goal of erisa is to provide a method for workers and beneficiaries to resolve disputes over benefits inexpensively and expeditiously and concluding that the claimant had not presented sufficient evidence on a key issue to the plan administrator until he was before the district court and,therefore,that denial was proper marks newcourt credit group,cir the scope of the district court and this court review of the denial of benefits is limited to the administrative record available to the plan administrators when the final decision was made.
the administrative record shows that metrohealth medical center tested kovach blood at the time of his admission,and the results were positive for opiates.during the processing of his claim,kovach did not deny or contest with contrary evidence,zurich finding that his use of opiates contributed to the collision,and that he was on drugs at the time of the traffic collision.see instead,it is only in his arguments before this court and the district court that kovach now claims that the opiates in his system were the result of drugs administered to him by medical personnel after the traffic collision.appellant br.at.the only evidence he cites for this,and the only evidence in the administrative record,is the notation by metrohealth life flight personnel who took him from robinson memorial hospital,where he was initially admitted after the traffic collision,to metrohealth,the notation indicated that morphine,an opiate,was administered to kovach during the flight.
however,there is documented evidence in the administrative record in the form of kovach admission report at metrohealth,which zurich had to consider and which supports its determination that kovach was on opiates at the time of the accident.kovach admission report from metrohealth lists all of the medications that he was on at the time he was admitted.this information was provided to medical personnel at metrohealth by kovach,his family,or other medical personnel to enable them to accurately treat him.the admission report clearly shows that,for months before the collision,kovach had been prescribed instructions to take it every six hours.the report also shows kovach frequent refills of his vicodin prescription,including his most recent refill,just eighteen days before the collision,and it certainly provided another reasonable explanation for the positive opiate tests in his bloodstream and provided substantial evidence for zurich to conclude that kovach was under the influence of opiates at the time of the collision.id.
the evidence in the record,when coupled with kovach conduct before the plan administrator substantiates the reasonableness of zurich finding that kovach was on opiates at the time of the collision,and its decision to base the denial of his claim in part on this factor.the use of even a legally prescribed opiate like vicodin,in conjunction with alcohol,made it even more reasonably foreseeable or highly likely that kovach ability to safely drive his motorcycle would be significantly impaired.see physicians desk reference,ed.vicodin,like all narcotics,may impair the mental physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery patients should be cautioned accordingly.alcohol and other cns central nervous system depressants may produce an additive cns depression,when taken with this combination product,and should be avoided.hence,zurich findings that kovach voluntarily and intentionally ingested opiates before driving his motorcycle reasonably supported its conclusion that his claimed injuries were caused not by an accident but by deliberate or reckless misconduct.
despite the fact that it was decided after zurich denied kovach claim,the reasoning employed in lennon,a closely analogous case,extends to this case.see lennon metropolitan life ins,cir upholding a plan administrator finding that a motorist high risk behavior while driving drunk was not accidental and provided a valid ground to deny his beneficiary claim.the majority endeavors to distinguish lennon but,despite these efforts,the fact remains that kovach engaged in the same type of voluntary high risk behavior exhibited in lennon behavior that meant it was not arbitrary and capricious for the plan administrator to find that his traffic collision was not an accident.the majority finds particular significance in the fact that lennon bac level was more than double kovach bac in this case.however,kovach bac was still nearly double the legal limit at the time of his admission to robinson memorial hospital.thus,like lennon,kovach was illegally driving with a bac well above the state presumption for intoxication the bac levels have been set by the state legislature.it is the legislature,and not this court on a case to case comparison method,that determines when someone is too drunk to drive.by legislative judgment kovach,like lennon,was too drunk to drive.see phelps positive action tool,ohio,the legislature,on the basis of extensive research into the problem of drunken drivers,has determined and statutorily established that a blood alcohol level of percent has an adverse effect on an individual coordination and control and that an individual with that blood alcohol level is incapable of safely operating a motor vehicle.furthermore,zurich reasonably found that kovach was on opiates when his collision occurred.the combination of alcohol and vicodin made it even more likely that a traffic collision would occur,rendering kovach behavior all the more reckless 
the majority also distinguishes lennon by noting that,in addition to drunk driving,the only other thing kovach did out of the ordinary was drive through a stop sign.in contrast,lennon drove the wrong way up a one way street at a high rate of speed.however,running a stop sign at a crowded intersection,like driving at a high rate of speed up a one way street,is a voluntary illegal act.thus,even though kovach activities were different from the activities of the claimant in lennon,they were also similar in that they were voluntary,illegal activities.under ohio law,driving drunk no matter how drunk and driving through a stop sign no matter how common it is are both illegal activities.
in attempting to show that kovach behavior was less risky then lennon,the majority ignores another voluntary decision that kovach made,the decision to ride a motorcycle while intoxicated.both statistically and logically,a motorcycle is a more dangerous form of transportation than a car.the national center for statistics and analysis released data on traffic safety showing that,per vehicle mile traveled in,motorcyclists were times more likely than passenger car occupants to die in a motor vehicle traffic crash and times more likely to be injured.hwy.traffic safety,center for statistics and analysis,traffic safety facts data,dot hs,at.driving a motorcycle is a voluntary decision that substantially enhances the risk of a death or injury.
when the decision to drive a motorcycle is coupled with the decision to drive while intoxicated,the risk of an injury further increases.the national highway safety administration has published a report describing the increased risks of driving a motorcycle,as compared to other motor vehicles,while intoxicated f or example,in automobile driver fatalities in the united states were alcohol related during.in comparison,a higher proportion of motorcycle rider fatalities in were related to alcohol in the same year.dep t of,hwy.traffic safety,effects of alcohol on motorcycle riding skills final report,dot hs,traffic finding also that impairing effects on riding performance were evidenced at a bac level of,the legal limit in ohio.thus,kovach decision to drive a motorcycle while intoxicated greatly enhanced the risk of harm in a manner analogous to the facts presented in lennon,and justified as reasonable zurich decision to deny his claim.
zurich definition of accidental 
even apart from lennon,zurich decision can not reasonably be deemed arbitrary and capricious.under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the plan administrator decision does not have to follow a particular test,rather the plan administrator need only use a test that follows a deliberate,principled reasoning process.see lennon,at if the administrator decision here were subject to the district court de novo review,its rejection of these cases in favor of the stricter standard advanced in wickman or some other standard entirely might have been appropriate.but when it reviews under an arbitrary and capricious standard,the district court can not simply substitute its judgment for that of the administrator boggs,concurring citing motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the united states,state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
the wickman standard 
zurich based its decision to deny coverage on an interpretation of accidental,the key term in the policy,that was not arbitrary and capricious.although not obligated to,zurich already used a test that incorporated the wickman standard the majority now adopts and applies 
under applicable case law,an injury is accidental if it is neither subjectively expected nor objectively foreseeable.jones metro.life ins,cir.a death or injury is objectively foreseeable if a reasonable person with a background and characteristics similar to the insured,would have viewed the resulting injury or death as substantially certain or highly likely to result from the conduct.
zurich denial letter this is,essentially,the same wickman standard that the majority adopts.wickman northwestern ins,cir the court looked first to the subjective reasonable expectations of the insured when the policy was purchased and,if there is insufficient evidence on this point,then the court looked to whether a reasonable person,with background and characteristics similar to the insured,would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured intentional conduct.in fact,it is difficult to see how objectively foreseeable the term zurich used to define the wickman standard and the reasonably foreseeable language used throughout the denial letter are conflicting standards.instead,it appears that zurich used objectively foreseeable as shorthand for the objective prong of the wickman standard and reasonable foreseeable as shorthand for the combined objective and subjective prongs required by wickman.thus,the phrase reasonably foreseeable,as used by zurich,is practically equivalent to the wickman standard,combining both its subjective and objective prongs.
moreover,even if reasonable foreseeable is not a fair proxy for the wickman standard,the majority in wickman concluded that,l egally,should have known is synonymous with,if not even a higher standard than,the reasonable expectation standard we promulgated above.similarly,substantially likely to occur is an equivalent,if not tougher,standard to highly likely to occur.at emphasis added.thus,wickman itself recognized that its standard could be expressed in different words that represented an equivalent or higher standard.again,it is difficult to see how the reasonably foreseeable language zuri
