the primary issue in this case is whether mega life and health insurance company mega can rescind a life insurance policy issued by it on the ground that the insured overstated her income in the application for the policy.we conclude that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether mega had a good faith underwriting policy which would have caused it to reject her application,or reduce the amount of coverage afforded,had it had known the insured true income.we also conclude that the district court properly determined that an autopsy was performed within the meaning of the policy accidental death and dismemberment rider.

material either to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the insurer or 
the insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract,or would not have issued a policy or contract at the premium rate as applied for,or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise.

the district court held that,in order to be eligible for rescission or reduction of coverage under a,mega must provide what it has not provided,namely,a rational basis for how its risk varied with pieniozek income at.the court found that such a rational basis was conspicuously absent,and held that mega had not presented a prima facie case on this issue,and granted summary judgment in favor of pieniozek.at.

pieniozek argues that the district court was correct in holding that a impliedly requires that the insurer basis for rescission under a be rational.mega contends that the statute and related case law contain no such requirement.we are cited no authority that supports the district court holding that a requires that an insurer have a rational basis for the underwriting policy at issue.rather,a contains only a good faith requirement.
pieniozek argues that summary judgment in his favor should be affirmed because mega can point to no document with its name on it that articulates a policy of tying coverage to an applicant income.in fact,nothing in the mega agent guide mentions an income multiplier.mega counters that it has advanced sufficient evidence,through deposition and affidavit testimony,that it did have such a policy,even if it could not point to a specific
