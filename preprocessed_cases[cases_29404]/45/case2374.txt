this appeal concerns a dispute between respondent children hospital central california hospital,and appellants blue cross of california and blue cross of california partnership plan,blue cross,over the reasonable value of the emergency medical services provided by hospital to medi cal beneficiaries enrolled in blue cross medi cal managed care plan.the services at issue were rendered during a month period when hospital and blue cross did not have a written contract that covered those beneficiaries.
blue cross paid hospital approximately million based on the medi cal rates paid by the government.however,hospital demanded its full billed charges of million.the jury found there was an contract between hospital and blue cross and awarded hospital approximately million,the difference between the full billed charges and the million blue cross had already paid.
blue cross contends the damages award was the result of erroneous discovery and evidence rulings that were predicated on the trial court misconstruction of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a b hereafter section a b.this regulation defines reimbursement of a claim for providers as the payment of the reasonable and customary value for the health care services rendered.a b.this value is based on several factors.according to blue cross,the trial court incorrectly concluded that section a b provided the exclusive standard for determining the reasonable and customary value of the medical services in this action.blue cross is correct.because of this error,the evidence of the reasonable and customary value was improperly limited to hospital full billed charges.this error was prejudicial.accordingly,the case will be reversed and remanded for a retrial on damages.
background 
hospital specializes in providing medical services to children.approximately percent of hospital patients are in medi cal programs.hospital has a contract with the california department of health care services dhcs,the responsible state agency,to render services to the majority of these medi cal patients in the fee for service medi cal plan.under this program,hospital is paid the average california medical assistance commission cmac rate for the geographic region for the services it performs.
however,hospital also serves medi cal patients who are enrolled in a medi cal managed care plan.unlike the fee for service plan,with a managed care plan the dhcs does not pay for services actually rendered.rather,the dhcs pays a fixed rate per person per month to the health plan,whether or not services are rendered.lackner department of health services th,fn.when services are rendered,the health plan pays the provider.
blue cross contracts with the dhcs to provide a medi cal managed care plan.accordingly,the dhcs pays blue cross a negotiated rate per month per beneficiary enrolled in blue cross plan.in turn,blue cross manages that beneficiary health care service needs.this management includes entering into contracts with various health care providers.
up until july,hospital and blue cross had a written contract setting rates for inpatient and outpatient medical services provided to blue cross medi cal beneficiaries.however,after that contract expired on july,the parties were unable to agree on the contract terms.eventually,the parties entered into a new contract effective june.accordingly,there was a month period during which hospital and blue cross had no written contract.
during this period,hospital was required to provide emergency services to blue cross medi cal beneficiaries under federal and state law.a hospital with an emergency department must provide a patient with an appropriate medical screening examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize any emergency medical condition without regard to the patient insurance or ability to pay.a,b health.further,a hospital generally may not transfer or discharge a patient until it has been determined that the emergency medical condition has been stabilized.c and e health,subd.j and.
blue cross,as a medi cal managed care organization,had a corresponding obligation to pay for emergency services rendered to the medi cal beneficiaries enrolled in its plan during the period.b a health,prospect medical group,northridge emergency medical group cal th,prospect.this obligation continued until such time as the enrollees could be transferred to a contracted provider or discharged.welf,subd.a.hospital,as the provider of those emergency services without a contract with blue cross,was required to accept as payment in full the amount the dhcs would have paid directly for emergency services under the medi cal fee for service system,the average cmac rate.b d.
however,once the treating provider has determined that the emergency medical condition has been stabilized,a medi cal managed care organization obligation to pay for emergency services ends and the organization may require prior authorization as a prerequisite for payment for necessary medical care.health,subd.c.i f the hospital emergency department or emergency physician fails to obtain prior authorization,the managed care organization may deny reimbursement,tit,subd.a.but,upon receipt of a request from an out of contract hospital for authorization for medical care,the medi cal managed care organization must render a decision within minutes,or the request shall be deemed to be approved.ibid.
here,during the period,blue cross medi cal beneficiaries received emergency care at hospital followed by inpatient medical services.blue cross paid hospital for the emergency medical care at the average cmac rate as required by statute.these payments are not in dispute.
hospital also submitted claims to blue cross for the services provided to the blue cross medi cal beneficiaries.blue cross paid those claims at the average cmac rate of per day.when in october,the dhcs established a new cmac rate of per day retroactive to services rendered on or after january,blue cross made an additional payment to hospital covering the difference.in total,blue cross paid to hospital for services provided to blue cross medi cal beneficiaries during the period.
hospital filed this action in july seeking additional payments from blue cross.hospital alleged that it had provided emergency and medical services to blue cross medi cal beneficiaries during the period it had timely requested from blue cross to provide services to these beneficiaries and blue cross had failed to either appropriately respond or arrange for the patients transfer,or had approved the requests.hospital further alleged that,by its actions,blue cross had impliedly agreed to pay the reasonable and customary value for all the services provided to its medi cal beneficiaries.
in alleging that it was entitled to the reasonable and customary value for these services,hospital relied on section a b.this regulation provides that,for providers,the reimbursement of a claim means 
the payment of the reasonable and customary value for the health care services rendered based upon statistically credible information that is updated at least annually and takes into consideration i the provider training,qualifications,and length of time in practice ii the nature of the services provided iii the fees usually charged by the provider iv prevailing provider rates charged in the general geographic area in which the services were rendered v other aspects of the economics of the medical provider practice that are relevant and vi any unusual circumstances in the case a b.
according to hospital,this reasonable and customary value is the total amount of the charges it billed blue cross.blue cross denied hospital allegations.
hospital maintains a uniform schedule of the charges it bills for all procedures,services,and goods provided to patients.this schedule is known as a charge master.hospital charge masters for and included more than line items.
the charge master is filed annually with the state of california and is available to the public.hospital uses its charge master to create summary and itemized bills for each patient who receives services.the charges are the same for every patient.nevertheless,in and,less than five percent of the payors paid hospital the full billed charges.
hospital updates its charge master and increases its prices each year.in determining the percentage price increase for all of the line items,hospital looks at a variety of global factors,including its overall cost structure,financial position,and contracts.hospital does not examine each line item individually.rather,hospital periodically spot checks certain items and compares those prices to the prices being charged by peer hospitals.
in early discovery,blue cross propounded requests for admissions to hospital.blue cross asked hospital to admit that,during the period,every written contract between hospital and a health insurer or health plan provided that hospital would accept less than its full billed charges as payment for services and that hospital had no written contract that provided it would receive its full billed charges for such services.hospital objected to these requests on the ground that contracted rates were irrelevant for the determination of reasonable and customary value under section a b.
thereafter,in a set of special interrogatories,blue cross asked hospital to provide both the number of patients in and receiving care for whom hospital received its full billed charges as payment and the name of any medi cal managed care organization that paid hospital full billed charges for services.hospital objected to these interrogatories on the ground that actual payments were irrelevant to the reasonable and customary value of the services.
blue cross moved to compel responses to the above discovery requests.the trial court denied blue cross motions on the ground that the evidence sought was irrelevant.the court concluded that fees usually charged,one of the section a b factors,does not mean payments accepted.
hospital filed several motions in limine regarding the scope of the evidence that blue cross would be permitted to present at trial on the reasonable value of the services rendered to the medi cal beneficiaries.hospital first sought an order confirming that the test set forth in section a b was the applicable standard for calculating the reasonable and customary value for the medical care it provided.hospital then requested the trial court to preclude blue cross from introducing evidence of the rates accepted by or paid to hospital by other payors the medi cal and medicare fee for service rates paid by the government and hospital service specific costs.hospital additionally sought to exclude testimony from blue cross retained expert,henry miller,on the ground that miller did not consider or use the test in reaching his opinion on the reasonable and customary value of the services at issue.rather,miller opined that the medi cal fee for service rate in place during the period was the reasonable and customary rate that should be paid by blue cross for services provided to its medi cal beneficiaries.
the trial court granted these motions.the court confirmed that section a b was the exclusive standard for calculating the reasonable and customary rate that blue cross had to pay hospital for the services.the court then applied this standard and excluded any evidence,argument,or comment that the rates accepted or paid by other payors are reasonable and customary or otherwise limit what blue cross must pay to hospital.similarly,the court excluded argument that rates paid by the government are reasonable and customary or otherwise limit the amount blue cross must pay hospital.the court also excluded any evidence of cost information as a basis to set reasonable and customary charges finding that cost was not part of the test and that it did not relate to value.regarding miller expert testimony,the trial court deferred its ruling pending an evidence code section hearing to determine whether miller opinion was based on the test.
at trial,hospital supported its damages claim by presenting the amount of its full billed charges and applying the section a b test to those charges.hospital chief financial officer,michelle waldron,testified regarding hospital qualifications,training,and experience the nature of the services rendered the charges themselves the market limitations on the yearly increase in charges and the economics of operating hospital,noting that the payments for the percent of hospital patients who are medi cal beneficiaries do not cover hospital overall costs of providing services to those beneficiaries.hospital expert witness,michael heil,testified that,when compared to other comparable hospitals,hospital charges were generally in the midrange or below.thus,the hospital argued its full billed charges represented the reasonable and customary value of the services provided.however,for all hospitals,the billed charges are the highest amounts that are ever received for the services.
the jury was instructed on damages based on section a b.the jury was first told 
if you find that blue cross authorized or is deemed to have authorized children hospital to provide care services to the blue cross medi cal members at issue,blue cross was required to pay children hospital the reasonable and customary value of those services.that the value might be reflected by the bill submitted by children hospital,or the amount blue cross paid,or some amount lesser than,greater than,or in between those amounts.
the jury was then instructed that,if it found the care was authorized,blue cross was required to pay hospital the reasonable and customary value for the services rendered taking into consideration the section a b factors.however,in accordance with the trial court pretrial evidence rulings,the jury was cautioned that r ates accepted by children hospital or paid to children hospital may not be considered when determining the reasonable and customary value of services provided and that r ates paid by the government may not be considered in calculating the reasonable and customary value of services that are the subject of this lawsuit.
the jury found that hospital provided notice to blue cross and received authorization to provide care to the patients at issue.the jury further concluded that the parties entered into an contract,blue cross breached the contract,and hospital was harmed by the breach.the jury awarded hospital damages of,the amount of hospital full billed charges less the amount that blue cross had already paid.
judgment was entered for hospital in the principal sum of plus prejudgment interest of.

section is titled claims settlement practices.this regulation is authorized by health and safety code sections and.these statutes impose procedural requirements on claim processing and subject health care service plans to disciplinary action and penalties for failure to timely comply with those requirements.california medical aetna healthcare of california,th.
the dmhc explained in its initial statement of reasons that section was necessary to clearly define terms relating to claim settlement and reimbursement,and provide procedures for plans and providers to prevent unreasonable delays in payment of provider claims.further,the dmhc wanted to clarify the meaning of unfair payment practices and the term complete and accurate claim.
as outlined above,section a b defines reimbursement of a claim for providers.such reimbursement means the payment of the reasonable and customary value for the health care services rendered.the reasonable and customary value is to be based upon statistically credible information that is updated at least annually and takes six factors into consideration.these factors are i the provider training,qualifications,and length of time in practice ii the nature of the services provided iii the fees usually charged by the provider iv prevailing provider rates charged in the general geographic area in which the services were rendered v other aspects of the economics of the medical provider practice that are relevant and vi any unusual circumstances in the case.a b.
in defining reasonable and customary value,the dmhc incorporated language from gould workers comp.appeals bd.th gould.in that case,gould,a psychiatrist in west los angeles,treated employees who had sustained industrial psychiatric injuries during their employment as police officers.gould submitted bills for his services that exceeded the medical fee schedule adopted by the division of workers compensation.the workers compensation appeals board wcab found in favor of the employer ruling that the official medical fee schedule should be used i n the absence of a showing of extraordinary factors justifying higher fees.gould,supra,th at.
the court of appeal annulled the wcab decisions.the court concluded the wcab had applied an incorrect burden of proof in deciding whether gould was entitled to fees in excess of the schedule.the court remanded the matter for a determination of whether gould fees for the psychotherapy sessions were reasonable.the court stated that,in deciding whether fees in excess of the schedule are reasonable,the wcab may consider evidence regarding the medical provider training,qualifications,and length of time in practice the nature of the services provided the fees usually charged by the medical provider the fees usually charged in the general geographical area in which the services were rendered other aspects of the economics of the medical provider practice that are relevant and any unusual circumstances in the case.gould,supra,th at,italics added,fn.omitted.
the dmhc solicited public comments four times in connection with the adoption of section.in both its responses to the comments and its final statement of reasons,the dmhc emphasized that the definition of what constitutes reimbursement of a claim in section,subdivision a was not intended to alter or change existing california law 
in responding to comments,the dmhc refused to specifically set reimbursement amounts.for example,the dmhc rejected suggestions that providers should either be reimbursed at percent of their billed charges or be reimbursed based on medicare or medicaid fee schedules.rather,the dmhc explained that california law requires payors to reimburse providers based upon the reasonable and customary value of the services rendered.the dmhc observed that a provider usual charges are not determinative of the fair and reasonable value and that government programs are not designed to reimburse the provider for the fair and reasonable value of the services.
the dmhc further noted that the regulations are intended to set forth the minimum payment criteria to ensure compliance with the knox keene act claims payment and dispute resolution standards italics added,and that,to the extent providers wish to pursue other common law or statutory remedies,they may seek redress in the courts.according to the dmhc,this regulation accurately reflects california law and incorporates the concept of quantum meruit.
in the final statement of reasons for section,the dmhc explained that the intent was to establish a methodology for determining the reasonable value of health care services by providers but that the criteria specified do not dictate a specific payment rate.rather,the payor is required to calculate the appropriate reimbursement based on statistically credible information that takes the gould factors into consideration.if a payor fulfills its claims payment obligation using these criteria,the dmhc will consider the payor compliant with health and safety code sections and,the reimbursement of the claim will be deemed timely.however,the definition is not a substitute for traditional forums for contract dispute resolution.if a provider disputes the payor calculation of the fair and reasonable value of the health care services he has rendered,the provider is free to seek resolution of that dispute in a court of law or through any other available civil remedy.
in sum,in adopting section a b,the dmhc established the minimum criteria for reimbursement of a claim,not the exclusive criteria.the dmhc refused to set specific amounts noting that neither billed charges nor government rates are determinative of the reasonable value of the medical services.rather,the dmhc intended that reasonable value be based on the concept of quantum meruit and that value disputes be resolved by the courts.in fact,the dmhc has acknowledged that,unlike the courts,it lacks the authority to set specific reimbursement rates under theories of quantum meruit and the jurisdiction to enforce a reimbursement determination on both the provider and the health plan.bell,supra,th at.
c.the section a b factors are not the exclusive measure of value.
as recognized by the dmhc,section a b directive to pay providers the reasonable and customary value of their services embodies the concept of quantum meruit.quantum meruit refers to the principle that the law implies a promise to pay for services performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously rendered.huskinson brown wolf cal th.the measure of recovery in quantum meruit is the reasonable value of the services,provided they were of direct benefit to the defendant.palmer gregg cal d.the burden is on the person making the quantum meruit claim to show the value of the services.miller campbell,warburton,fitzsimmons,smith,mendel pastore th.

in determining value in quantum meruit cases,courts accept a wide variety of evidence.for example,the party suing for compensation may testify as to the value of his services or offer expert testimony.however,such evidence is not required and is not binding on the trier of fact.culver adjustment bureau hawkins constr.d.evidence of value can also be shown through agreements to pay and accept a particular price.oliver campbell cal d,watson wood dimension,d,watson.the court may consider the price agreed upon by the parties as a criterion in ascertaining the reasonable value of services performed.watson,supra,d at.accordingly,in an action for the reasonable value of services,a written contract providing for an agreed price is admissible in evidence.parker maier brewing d.additionally,evidence of a professional customary charges and earnings is relevant and admissible to demonstrate the value of the services rendered.citron fields d.
as can be seen from the above examples,the facts and circumstances of the particular case dictate what evidence is relevant to show the reasonable market value of the services at issue,the price that would be agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller negotiating at arm length.specific criteria might or might not be appropriate for a given set of facts.
thus,while the gould court set forth a comprehensive set of factors for the situation presented there,those factors are not exclusive or necessarily appropriate in all cases.in gould,the service provider,a psy
