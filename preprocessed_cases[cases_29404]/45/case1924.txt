donald carter carter and his daughter kathryn carter katie appeal the district court order vacating an arbitration award against health net of california health net,an insurance company,on the ground that the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction over health net.the carters argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the opposing petitions to vacate and confirm the arbitration award because neither presented a federal question.we agree,and remand this case to the district court for remand to state court 
on a member enrollment and change form provided by his employer,grafil,donald carter selected the preferred provider organization ppo insurance product as his health insurance plan.the header of the form included the logo health net california health plan,while the fine print on the form stated that health net life insurance hnl would be the underwriter for the flex net and ppo insurance plans,and health net would underwrite the other plans.the form also included a mandatory arbitration clause requiring each to submit to arbitration any dispute,except medical malpractice,regarding the performance,interpretation or breach of the agreement between him or an enrolled family member and health net,hnl,or physicians participating in the plan.hnl is a subsidiary of health net and under an administrative services agreement,hnl retained health net to serve as the contract administrator for the ppo plan.
as a result of carter selection of the ppo plan,hnl issued a certificate of insurance certificate outlining the coverage provided by the insurance plan.the certificate stated,inter alia,that hnl agrees to provide benefits as described in this certificate to the subscriber and eligible family members.with regard to arbitration,it stated that any dispute or controversy concerning the construction,interpretation,performance,or breach of this certificate arising between the employer,a subscriber or eligible family member and hnl shall be submitted to arbitration under the appropriate rules of the american arbitration association,and that the arbitral award shall be governed by applicable state and federal statutory and case law.
six months after selecting the ppo plan,carter asked for a of medical insurance benefits for dental surgery proposed for his daughter,katie.the request was submitted to health net as plan administrator.health net determined that no medical benefits were available for katie jawbone reconstructive surgery.after an appeal by the carters,health net issued its final decision denying coverage for katie treatment.in both communications,health net reminded carter that his sole recourse was arbitration of his claim through the american arbitration association aaa.
the carters initiated arbitration to recover the cost of katie surgery.though their initial demand for arbitration named only health net as a defendant,they later asked to amend the demand to add hnl as a new defendant.the arbitrator granted the request,but subsequently reversed the decision when the carters withdrew their request to add hnl.hnl was dismissed without prejudice,over its protests that it was the real party in interest,in that it was the party in contractual privity with claimant employer,and the underwriter for the employer medical benefits plan,and the arbitration proceeded against health net alone.
the arbitrator issued interim and final awards in favor of the carters.the carters filed a petition in california superior court under the california arbitration act,cal.civ.proc.code et,to confirm the arbitration award against health net,and requested attorney fees incurred in relation to this petition pursuant to the applicable provisions of erisa.health net removed the case to federal court,where the carters motion to remand to state court was denied.health net then petitioned to vacate the arbitration award,also under the california arbitration act,on the grounds that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority,had refused to hear material evidence,and had failed to disqualify himself for appearance of bias.citing american builder ass,d,the district court sua sponte requested briefing on the issue of whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the parties to the arbitration.in its final order,the court vacated the arbitration award,holding that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by exercising jurisdiction over and issuing an award against health net,because it was not a signatory to the arbitration agreement contained in the certificate of insurance.the carters filed a timely notice of appeal.
we review decisions on subject matter jurisdiction de novo.arizona pub.serv.aspaas,cir.it is that even when a petition is brought under the federal arbitration act faa,a petitioner seeking to confirm or vacate an arbitration award in federal court must establish an independent basis for federal jurisdiction.southland keating,d noting that w hile the federal arbitration act creates federal substantive law requiring the parties to honor arbitration agreements,it does not create any independent jurisdiction moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d same garrett merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir discussing supreme court cases and collecting ninth circuit precedent and cases from other circuits applying this jurisdictional principle.in this case,where the petitions to confirm and vacate the arbitration award are brought under a state arbitration statute,it is even clearer that the parties must establish either diversity or federal question jurisdiction before a federal court may hear their claims.
diversity of citizenship is absent in this case the carters are residents of california,and health net is a california corporation.thus,in order for the district court to have exercised valid jurisdiction over the case,the petitions must have presented a federal question.health net offers two arguments in support of its assertion that the district court had federal question jurisdiction first,that the carters made a specific request for affirmative relief under erisa by requesting attorney fees under g of that statute,g and second,that the carters asserted claims of a uniquely federal character in the underlying dispute.
a request for attorney fees can not be a basis for federal jurisdiction.section g is a classic provision,similar to that invoked in cases brought under.compare g in any action under this title the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney fee and costs of action to either party,with b in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of section the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.we have previously held that fee shifting provisions can not themselves confer subject matter jurisdiction that is otherwise absent.in re knight,cir quoting branson nott,cir,and extending branson holding to requests for attorney fees under g of erisa.
the valid exercise of federal question jurisdiction therefore depended upon the substantive claims raised in the carters petition to confirm the award.if the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition,it could not have exercised jurisdiction based on the request for fees.see id.at.on its face,the carters petition raised no federal question,relying instead on california arbitration law as the basis for confirmation.apart from the invocation of erisa provision discussed above,the only federal claims involved in the case were those raised in the underlying arbitration.
health net second argument supporting jurisdiction,based on the uniquely federal character of those claims,is also unpersuasive.since no case in this circuit has discussed federal question jurisdiction in the context of a state arbitration statute,we must look to cases analyzing federal statutes governing arbitration.the parties offer two choices the labor management relations act lmra,and the faa.for the reasons set forth below,we find the cases construing the faa persuasive,and extend their reasoning to petitions brought under state arbitration statutes.
in johnson england,a case relied upon by health net,we held that an action to compel arbitration of a labor contract dispute was within federal jurisdiction under the lmra,and therefore removable under,cir.we specifically rejected the appellants argument that the petition and complaint raised solely issues of state law and sought only a remedy,and held that removal was proper since in effect a of the lmra operated to preempt this field of law,a fair construction of the complaint here filed must be that it is necessarily one pursuant to a.id.at.a similar approach was adopted by the district court in this case,which relied upon erisa complete of the underlying subject matter of the dispute to ground its exercise of jurisdiction.
health net reliance on johnson is misplaced.unlike the faa or state arbitration statutes,the lmra can be used as a basis for federal question jurisdiction over actions to compel arbitration,as well as petitions to confirm or vacate arbitration awards.see united broth.of carpenters and joiners,local desert palace,cir noting that the district court had federal question jurisdiction over an action to compel arbitration under of the lmra,see also mulvaney,sheet metal workers int l ass n,local,cir per curiam noting that a conferred federal question jurisdiction over action to vacate arbitration award brown witco,cir holding that jurisdiction extends to suits seeking to enforce an arbitration award,and citing carrion enterprise ass n,metal trades branch local union,cir,and cleveland porca,cir.indeed,arbitration of labor disputes is unique the faa and its requirement of an independent basis for federal jurisdiction do not apply at all to arbitration of disputes under the lmra.see united paperworkers int l union misco,d.for questions of jurisdiction over petitions invoking solely a state arbitration statute,therefore,the appropriate parallel can not be to the statute that itself provides federal question jurisdiction.cases involving the lmra are simply inapplicable.
our cases discussing the faa,the federal statute that requires parties to establish federal jurisdiction independently,are more helpful.in luong circuit city stores,we followed four other circuits in holding that of the faa,which lists the grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award,does not create federal question jurisdiction even when the underlying arbitration involves a federal question,cir citing greenberg bear,stearns,cir,cert.denied,d kasap folger nolan fleming douglas,minor prudential,cir ford hamilton,cir.
as the jurisprudence of this and other circuits demonstrates,this holding is not limited to petitions to vacate under.see,perpetual,tang,cir holding that district court erred in determining that conferred jurisdiction to confirm an arbitration award rendered in dispute concerning securities law collins blue cross blue shield of,cir n either the faa nor the underlying arbitrated ada claim provide s an independent basis of federal jurisdiction in an action to confirm or vacate an arbitration award.see also atomic united nuclear,cir a pplicants who seek confirmation of an arbitration award under must demonstrate independent grounds of federal subject matter jurisdiction.blue cross of cal.anesthesia care assocs.med.group,cir recognizing a substantial body of case law from four circuits,under which the existence of a federal question in the underlying dispute is not sufficient to create subject matter jurisdiction over a petition to compel arbitration under of the faa,but declining to adopt this approach as unnecessary to the disposition of the case.with reasoning equally applicable to petitions to confirm awards under of the faa,the second circuit concluded that in petitions brought under and of the act,
there is no necessary link between the requested relief and the character of the underlying dispute.for example,a petition to compel arbitration because the dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause,or to vacate an award because the arbitrators exceeded their powers under that clause,will turn on the interpretation of the clause,regardless of whether the actual dispute implicates any federal laws.accordingly,the fact that the arbitration concerns issues of federal law does not,standing alone,confer subject matter jurisdiction on a federal district court to review the arbitral award.
greenberg,at.a clear jurisdictional principle has emerged from these cases the presence of federal questions in an underlying arbitration is insufficient to provide an independent basis for federal question jurisdiction to review an arbitration award under the faa.
our analysis does not end there,however.luong also adopted greenberg qualification of this general principle,where the second circuit held that federal jurisdiction may still lie if the ultimate disposition of the matter by the federal court necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law,such as when the petition primarily asserts as grounds for vacatur the arbitrator manifest disregard of federal law.id.internal quotation marks omitted see luong,at.the greenberg court did not consider its holding an exception to the general jurisdictional principle,but rather a logical extension of the complaint rule and a corollary to the idea that underlying federal issues are insufficient 
in our view,under these standards,whether or not a petition to vacate under raises a substantial federal question turns on the ground for the petitioner challenge to the award.
greenberg,at.in luong,we held that a federal question for purposes of subject matter jurisdiction must be presented in a petition.at.we explained our adoption of the second circuit approach by noting that greenberg makes a forceful case for why the ground asserted in the petition to vacate makes a difference for purposes of federal question jurisdiction,because a claim of manifest disregard,unlike the grounds for vacatur specifically listed in,so immerses the federal court in questions of federal law and their proper application that federal question subject matter jurisdiction is present.id.at emphasis in original quoting greenberg,at.under our faa jurisprudence,therefore,it is not the presence of federal issues in an underlying arbitration that determines whether federal question jurisdiction exists,but rather the grounds asserted for federal review in a petition.similarly,petitioners relying on state arbitration statutes must establish in their petitions for confirmation or vacatur that the ultimate disposition of the matter by the federal court necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.greenberg,at internal quotation marks omitted see also perpetual,at clarifying greenberg,and holding that mere allegation of manifest disregard is insufficient to confer federal question jurisdiction if federal claims are completely without merit yokeno mafnas,cir holding that federal question jurisdiction is unavailable where federal claim is patently without merit quoting brock writers guild of,west,cir,which relied on duke power carolina envtl.study group,d.
the petitions at issue in this case do not raise substantial questions of federal law.the certificate of insurance states that the california arbitration act governs any motion to vacate,modify or correct an award issued in connection with the policy.the carters petition to confirm the award was brought in california superior court,and primarily invoked provisions of the california arbitration act.the carters only reference to a federal statute was their previously discussed request for attorney fees,which was insufficient to give the district court jurisdiction over the case.no other federal question was raised by the carters petition.
nor was health net petition to vacate the award a basis for federal question jurisdiction.this petition,first brought in district court after health net successfully defended removal,relied solely on california law,and argued that the award should be vacated because the arbitrator exceeded his powers by failing to conform the award to erisa requirements he refused to hear material evidence and he failed to disqualify himself for appearance of bias.the statutory citations provided were to the r
