plaintiff janet block appeals from the summary judgment entered against her and in favor of defendants golden eagle insurance corporation golden eagle,clarendon insurance company clarendon and blue ridge insurance company blue ridge on block complaint for declaratory relief,breach of contract and insurance bad faith she contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the insurers had a duty to defend block under the insurance policies at issue.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
we garner the following facts from the material presented in connection with the judgment motions filed by the parties.most of the facts are undisputed.block owned certain real property located within the north long beach redevelopment project area.block property consisted of two vacant lots,which sat atop an abandoned oil well the property pursuant to a redevelopment plan,the redevelopment agency of the city of long beach the agency sought to acquire the property by eminent domain.on february,the agency offered block per lot as just compensation for the property.this price reflected an appraised value of for both lots,reduced by,which was the estimated cost to remediate the environmental problems associated with the property.block disputed the agency assessment of fair market value and its estimate of the cost to remediate.the agency eventually increased its offer to,but block maintained the property had a surface value of per lot,plus improvements consisting of a subsurface oil well bore pipe,plus oil and mineral rights estimated at between and,plus drilling rights estimated at between and.
in october,the agency filed an eminent domain action against block seeking to condemn the property in fee simple.block.on june,the eminent domain action was resolved with a stipulated judgment and final order of condemnation pursuant to which block received a total of.
meanwhile,during the relevant time period,block maintained property insurance on her residence,which included coverage for vacant land owned by her.specifically,from july,through july,she was insured by blue ridge from july,through july,by clarendon and from july,through july,by golden eagle.block believed that the agency reduction of its offer to buy the property in an amount equal to the estimated cost to remediate environmental damages constituted a claim for damages by the agency against block.accordingly,on september,before the eminent domain complaint was filed,block notified golden eagle of the agency claim upon the property.on july,block tendered defense of the eminent domain action to golden eagle.in a letter dated june,golden eagle denied the tender for the reason that the eminent domain action did not constitute bodily injury,property damage or occurrence as those terms were defined in the policy of insurance.block retendered the claim,and golden eagle denied it again on september.
on september,while still pressing golden eagle to accept the defense of the eminent domain action,block tendered that defense to both clarendon and blue ridge.both refused to defend the action.
block filed this action on october.the operative second amended complaint,in which block named the three insurers as defendants,was filed on july.on september,block filed motions for summary judgment against the three defendants.each insurer filed its own motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication of the fact that the insurers did not owe block a duty to defend or indemnify 
the motions were heard together on january.in a written tentative ruling,the trial court granted each of the insurers motions,therefore finding block motion moot.at the hearing,counsel for block principally argued that the remediation costs constituted damages whether,they took the form of outright reimbursements or reduced compensation.the insurers countered that the eminent domain action involved a determination of the fair market value of the property,and the condition of the property was simply one factor to take into account in determining the fair market value.after taking the matter under submission,the trial court issued a written ruling on january,in which it granted summary judgment in favor of the insurers.the trial court observed that each of the insurance policies had virtually identical provisions regarding defense and indemnification of claims or suits brought against the insured for bodily injury or property damage caused by a covered occurrence.it rejected block argument that the eminent domain action constituted a claim for damages because the reduced compensation reflected the anticipated cost to remediate the property,reasoning that no governmental entity was seeking to impose cleanup costs upon block,nor was any such agency seeking to recover from block remediation costs expended by the agency.since block was not legally liable for any damages within the meaning of the policies,there was no duty to defend or indemnify.the trial court concluded that the eminent domain action was neither a suit or claim for damages,but was rather a proceeding to determine just compensation.
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted when a moving party establishes the right to the entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.the moving party bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.id.at,d,fns.omitted.where all of the evidence presented by the plaintiff shows the existence of an element of the offense only as likely or even less likely than the nonexistence of that element,the court must grant the defendant motion for summary judgment because a reasonable trier of fact could not find for the plaintiff in such a case.id.at,d.even where the element at issue can be proved by inferences,the inference of the existence of the element must be more likely than the inference of its nonexistence.an inference is reasonable if and only if it implies the existence of an element more likely than the nonexistence of that element.ibid.

discussion 
there was no potential liability for property damage,and thus no duty to defend 
block contends the insurers had a duty to defend her in the eminent domain action.she argues that such duty arose from the fact that the agency sought to reduce the fair market value of the property by the estimated cost of remediating the environmental condition of the property.these remediation costs,she argues,constituted damages for which block was legally liable within the meaning of the policies.we disagree.
as noted by our supreme court in montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose,the principles governing adjudication of an insurer duty to defend are familiar.a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.citation.t he carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.id.at,d,italics in original.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.citation.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.citation.citation.as one court of appeal has put it,f or an insurer,the existence of a duty to defend turns not upon the ultimate adjudication of coverage under its policy of insurance,but upon those facts known by the insurer at the inception of a third party lawsuit.citation.hence,the duty may exist even where coverage is in doubt and ultimately does not develop.citation.citation.the defense duty is a continuing one,arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded citation,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage ibid.
an insurance policy is a contract.under statutory rules of contract interpretation,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage citation,controls judicial interpretation.citation.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.citations.in the insurance context,we generally resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.citations.similarly,we generally interpret the coverage clauses of insurance policies broadly,protecting the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.fn.omitted.citations.aiu ins.superior court cal d,aiu see also gray zurich insurance cal d.accordingly,any doubt as to whether the facts establish the existence of a duty to defend must be resolved in the insured favor.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.
here,there is no dispute that the insurance policies are virtually identical in their relevant provisions.for example,golden eagle policy provides,in pertinent part,as follows section coverages coverage liability if a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies,we will.pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable.damages include prejudgment interest awarded against the insured and.provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice,even if the suit is groundless,false or fraudulent italics added.according to the policy.occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage.property damage means physical injury to,destruction of,or loss of use of tangible property.we set forth the exact language of each of the other insurers policy provisions in the margin 
the term damage is not defined in any of the policies.in aiu,supra,cal d,the issue was whether sums an insured was held obligated to pay in third party lawsuits by various government agencies seeking to compel the insured both to pay the cost of environmental remediation incurred by the agencies,as well as additional costs incurred by the insured to clean up hazardous waste on its property,were damages under the policies.the court in aiu answered this question in the affirmative id.at,damages includes costs of remediation and mitigation of hazardous waste sites,damages includes costs of compliance with injunctive relief.in concluding that these sums constituted damages,the court in aiu looked to civil code section every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another,may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money,which is called damages aiu,at,and considered various dictionary definitions of the term damages.it observed whatever their semantic differences,the statutory and dictionary definitions of damages share several basic concepts.each requires there to be compensation,in money,recovered by a party for loss or detriment it has suffered through the acts of another.id.at,fns.omitted.applying this definition,the court held that an insured obligation to reimburse the agencies for response costs constituted damages because such costs constituted losses or detriment suffered by the agencies and the insured reimbursement constituted monetary compensation for such losses.id.at.it held further that,although environmental injunctions requiring remedial and mitigative action do not readily fit into the foregoing definition of damages because they do not involve monetary compensation of a loss or detriment,they nevertheless result in costs that constitute damages under the policies,because they are equivalent or alternative remedies to response costs,the property owner is required to clean up the property itself,rather than reimbursing the government for its cleanup costs and an insured would reasonably expect equal coverage for such equivalent or alternative remedies.id.at.the court in aiu,observed,however,that costs incurred to pay for measures taken to avoid future release of hazardous waste are not covered under cgl policies because no property damage had yet occurred.id.at.
block reliance on aiu for the proposition that the eminent domain action was a claim for damages because the agency sought to reduce the market value of the property in the amount of the estimated remediation costs,is misplaced.in aiu,the insured was legally obligated to compensate the agencies in money for a loss or detriment,a basic concept of damages.aiu,supra,cal d at.in holding that the cost of compliance with injunctions to clean up hazardous waste was covered under the policies,the court in aiu noted that such costs do not readily satisfy the statutory or dictionary definitions of damages.id.at.it nevertheless held such costs were covered under the policies,reasoning that it was unlikely the parties to the insurance contract intended to cover reimbursement costs but not injunctive relief where the injunctive relief is incurred for exactly the same purpose as the response costs.ibid.here,block was not legally obligated to compensate the agency in money as a result of any loss or detriment suffered by the agency.nor was she legally obligated to incur any clean up expenses,an alternate remedy to compensating the agency for its response costs.accordingly,block suffered no damages.as the court in aiu recognized,an insured could reasonably expect to be covered for having to compensate a governmental agency for response costs or,alternatively,for the costs the insured itself is compelled to incur to cleanup an environmental condition on its property.we believe there is nothing in the language of the policies present here that would cause an insured reasonably to expect there was coverage against the simple diminution in the market value of its property resulting from the condition of that property,even if it were related to the environmental condition of the property 
block reliance on transport indemnity cal th,d,aerojet,for a contrary result is not persuasive.relying on aiu,the court in aerojet observed that an insurer liability under a cgl policy is not narrowly confined to money that the insured must give under law as compensation to third parties,but may also include money that the insured must itself expend in equity in order to provide relief of the same sort.italics added.here,block was not required to expend any money to third parties.on the contrary,it was the agency that was compensating block for the taking of her property.the amount of that loss was calculated by considering the diminution in value of the property as a result of its environmental condition.
nor would it be appropriate to treat the diminution in value of the property because of its environmental condition as a constructive expenditure.black law dictionary ed defines expenditure as.the act or process of paying out disbursement.a sum paid out,at.it defines constructive as legally imputed having an effect in law though not necessarily in fact.courts usually give something a constructive effect for equitable reasons,at.we see no reason to treat diminution in value of property because of environmental conditions as a constructive expenditure.this would essentially convert a liability policy to one that insures against a diminution in market value.such a construction would dramatically change the nature of the insurance policies at issue here,and would not comport with the parties reasonable expectations.aiu,supra,cal d at.
we are also not persuaded that construction protective services,tig specialty ins.cal th,d,cps,is helpful to block.she argues that cps stands for the proposition that the remediation costs by which the market value of the property was reduced constituted a setoff claim for damages that creates a duty to defend.in that case,the issue was whether a cgl policy that obligates an insurer to defend and indemnify its insured against suits seeking damages thereby obligates the insurer to defend and indemnify the insured against a setoff claim asserted under code of civil procedure section section defendant in a suit for money may assert an otherwise for money as an affirmative defense.cps,at,d.because of the procedural posture of that appeal from the sustaining of a court in cps did not resolve the issue.observing that,for accounting purposes,a monetary recovery on a suit for damages was no different than a setoff against another debt,the court expressly declined to answer whether a setoff claim should therefore be treated as a suit for damages.instead,it held that cps complaint adequately stated a prima facie right to relief in an action based on a written contract,a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.citation.cps complaint satisfactorily alleged that the insurance policy obligated the insurer to defend and indemnify cps against suits seeking damages,and that under the terms of the policy,the contractor setoff claim fell within the scope of that contractual obligation.whether cps can prove these allegations that is,whether its interpretation of the applicable contractual language is correct in light of what we have said here remains to be seen,but the allegations are sufficient to establish a prima facie right to relief.the insurer may move for judgment on the pleadings or summary judgment,raising the same arguments it raised in its demurrer,and in support of its motion may provide the court with a copy of the insurance policy in question.id.at,d.
cps is inapposite.first,this case comes to us after summary judgment,not after a demurrer.accordingly,the insurance policies,the pleadings in the eminent domain action and other evidence of the sort that was not before the court in cps,are in the record here.thus,we are not faced with determining whether block has established a prima facie issue in whether the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find that block potentially suffered an insured loss,a condition precedent to the duty to defend.second,there is no section setoff claim here.rather,block seeks to analogize the diminution in value because of the environmental condition of the property to a setoff claim.but the two are not analogous.the setoff claim in cps,like the clean up costs and response costs in aiu,involved a forced money expenditure by the insured the insured was allegedly liable for the damage caused by the fire.as we have already discussed,block is not liable for any money expenditure the underlying case involved only a determination of the fair market value of the property 
also unavailing is block reliance on redevelopment agency salvation army th,d salvation army,for the proposition that the estimated remediation costs constituted damages because the agency could have sued block to clean up the property the issue in that case was whether the redevelopment agency had satisfied the legal requirements for recovery of the costs it actually incurred to remediate the environmental condition of the property.there was no issue of insurance coverage.here,the agency did not proceed against block under the applicable state laws authorizing reimbursements to state agencies.accordingly,salvation army is inapposite.
we are also unpersuaded by block reliance on treatises for the proposition that there was a duty to defend because the reduction in value constituted a setoff claim the treatises she cites do not suggest that a reduction in market value for the cost of remediation constitutes a section setoff claim,only that the cost of remediation will be offset against the market value of the property.moreover,in their reference to insurance coverage,they do not discuss the distinction between a property owner who is compelled to expend money to cleanup reimburse governmental response costs,and a property owner whose property is simply diminished in market value because of the environmental condition of the property,but is not compelled to pay out any money.by failing to discuss the difference,the secondary sources do not help us.
our conclusion that the policies at issue did not insure against a diminution in market value as a result of the property environmental condition because such diminution in value does not constitute damages within the meaning of those policies is consistent with fresno economy import used cars,united states fid.guar.d.fresno,in which the court held that the diminution in the value of a product by reason of a defective part or faulty workmanship does not constitute property damage within the meaning of the standard insuring clause.in fresno,the insured car dealer sought declaratory relief arising out of its insurer refusal to defend two third party lawsuits against the insured,which sought damages for negligent misrepresentation and breach of the implied warranty of fitness as to cars purchased from the insured.the court in fresno concluded that the third party complaints set forth no facts which constitute an allegation of personal injury or property damage t he damage caused by the alleged misrepresentations was to the plaintiffs pecuniary loss caused by the fact that plaintiffs did not receive full value for the money paid for the purchase and lease of the automobiles.such loss of anticipated value does not constitute an injury to or destruction of tangible personal property as defined in the policy.id.at.by parity of reasoning,a loss of market value attributable to the environmental condition of property does not constitute damages under the policies at issue.
there was no potential liability for personal injury,and thus no duty to defend 
block contends there was potential liability under the personal injury coverage in the policies.she argues that,under martin marietta insurance of north america th,d martin marietta,the cost to remediate soil and groundwater and to the old oil well avoided potential claims by third parties,such as adjacent landowners.we find martin marietta inapplicable.
in the world of liability insurance,personal injury coverage applies to injury which arises out of the commission of certain enumerated acts or offenses.citations.coverage thus is triggered by the offense,not the injury or damage which a plaintiff suffers.fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d.the offense with which we are concerned is wrongful entry,which includes trespass claims.ibid.in martin marietta,the insured was the subject of actions by various governmental agencies to compel it to remediate groundwater and other contamination emanating from a number of sites.the insured tendered the claim to its insurer.the insurer moved for summary adjudication on the grounds that the claims were not because of personal injury as that term was defined in the insurance policies,and that it therefore had no duty to defend or indemnify.martin marietta,supra,th at,d.the trial court agreed and granted summary judgment.id.at,d.the court of appeal reversed,reasoning that the claims against the insured were based in part on nuisance and trespass on lands owned by individuals,businesses,and,perhaps,governmental entities.id.at,d.accordingly,such claims raise a potential for coverage under language giving coverage for wrongful entry and other invasion of the right of private occupancy.id.at,d.
this case involves no claims that have been or might be made by others,including adjacent landowners.accordingly,martin marietta
