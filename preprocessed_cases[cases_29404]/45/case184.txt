background 
a.the plan 
in connection with his employment with financial services firm donnelley sons company donnelley,wright was covered as a participant under donnelley group benefits plan the plan.benefits under the short term disability std portion of the plan are administered by hartford and funded by donnelley through a trust.app.at.benefits under the long term disability ltd portion of the plan are administered by hartford and funded in full by an insurance policy issued by hartford.id.the plan states that,hartford has sole authority to approve or reject claims according to the program rules,and follow through with the erisa appeals process.id.at.benefits are not payable unless,among other requirements,an employee submits proof of loss satisfactory to the hartford.id.at.
wright application for std benefits 
on june,wright took a medical leave from work,claiming he was suffering from headaches and irregular memory loss which prevented him from carrying out his job functions.see app.at.wright subsequently applied for std benefits in accordance with the plan provisions.id.at.wright submitted attending physician statements aps from his primary care physician,maurice cohen,and his psychologist,ron michaud.see id.at id.at.both michaud and cohen reported that wright subjective symptoms were memory problems.see id.at id.at.cohen recommended that wright be kept out of work pending the results of neuropsychological testing.id.at.michaud indicated that wright ability for sustained concentration has severely impaired current job performance.id.at.he declined to indicate any specific psychiatric impairments,stating that it was unclear if the process is psychiatric or neurological.id.based on this information,hartford granted wright std benefits through july.id.at.pending results of the neuropsychological testing,hartford extended wright std benefits through august.id.at.
in a status report to hartford,on august,cohen diagnosed wright with memory loss and indicated the necessity of additional neurological testing.see id.at.cohen again recommended that wright not return to work until an appropriate diagnosis was made.id.by letter dated august,hartford notified wright that it was extending his std benefits through september.id.at.the letter further stated 
if you remain disabled beyond september,your physician must submit supporting medical information to our office.this must include the specific results of your july and august,tests.we will also require an evaluation by your primary care physician that addresses a specific diagnosis,restrictions and limitations that prevent you from returning to work,your treatment plan and any changes in your treatment,and a return to work plan.
on september,cohen provided another update to hartford,explaining that wright had difficulty finding a neuropsychologist covered by his health insurance but finally was able to schedule an appointment with ann avery for october,id.at.based on this information,hartford extended std benefits until october,to allow time for his physicians to review the results of avery testing.see id.at.
on october,after reviewing the results of avery neuropsychological assessment of wright,cohen submitted a new aps to hartford,which addressed for the first time the level of wright psychiatric impairments.see id.at.cohen indicated an impairment of less severe than m oderate impairment in occupational functioning but more severe than slight difficulty.id.cohen also telephoned hartford and explained avery tests showed that wright short term memory is good but that wright had weakness recalling long term events and narriatives sic.id.at.cohen further reported that an mri was normal and there was no diagnosis for wright yet.id.at.hartford extended wright std benefits until october,pending the results of wright examination by a new psychiatrist,clive dalby.
on october,dalby submitted an aps to hartford diagnosing wright with amnestic syndrome not otherwise specified.id.at.dalby indicated that wright suffered severe short term memory loss thought blocking,and described this as causing a moderate impairment in occupational functioning,but did not specify such limitation.id.
wright application for ltd benefits 
wright applied for ltd benefits on november.meanwhile,hartford referred wright std claim to one of its behavioral health case managers for review.the case manager noted that t he only thing we have with all of these tests that were reportedly done is wright memory loss there are not other impairment sic noted and the info does indicate how severe or mild that memory loss is as substantiated by neuropsychological testing.id.at.
concluding that there was no sufficient medical evidence of the severity of wright reported symptoms or any occupational limitations,hartford denied wright std benefits effective october.see id.at.on the same day,hartford denied wright ltd claim,because its conclusion that wright was not prevented from performing his job meant that one prerequisite under the ltd portion of the plan disability throughout the elimination period was not satisfied.see id.at.in its denial letters,hartford specifically invited wright to submit test results and reports which document deficits in short term memory and how it affects your occupational functioning beyond october.see id.at id.at.
wright first appeal 
on december,wright appealed hartford initial denial.see id.at.wright provided explanatory statements by himself and his wife as well as the neuropsychological assessment of avery dated october,and a december,letter of dalby,indicating dalby conclusion that wright was disabled from performing his occupation.see id.at id.at.hartford considered this additional evidence,as well as a job description submitted by wright employer.see id.at.by letter dated march,hartford reaffirmed its denial,claiming that the documents submitted did not provide any medical evidence regarding the severity of any cognitive deficits suffered by wright and,thus,did not establish any specific occupational limitations.id.at.hartford found the results of the neuropsychological testing is sic consistent with an ability to perform the essential duties of wright occupation.id.
wright second appeal 
wright filed a second appeal on june,in which he submitted an aps from a new neurologist,bryan lieberman.see id.at.lieberman diagnosed wright with sleep apnea and memory disorder.see id.at.in describing wright cognitive deficit,lieberman termed it a neurologic cognitive disorder including impaired memory,attention,and executive function,as well as daytime somnolence,and fatigue.id.lieberman concluded that the above deficit disables wright for his as a software engineer.id.
hartford referred wright entire file to two independent medical examiners at the university disability consortium for.alvin mcelveen,neurologist,and milton jay,neuropsychologist.upon review of wright case file,mcelveen concluded that sleep apnea had been documented thus the medical evidence support ed cognitive impairment as a result of the physical conditions present on.mcelveen referred to jay report for an assessment of the effect of any impairments on wright cognitive functioning.id.at.jay concluded that,although sleep apnea had been confirmed by a polysomnogram ordered by lieberman,the medical evidence did not confirm that the apnea was causing even mild difficulties in cognition secondary to interrupted sleep and subsequent fatigue.id.at.
based on the opinions of jay and mcelveen,the additional medical records from cohen and lieberman,the information submitted by wright in his appeal,and all the other information already in the claim file,hartford reiterated its denial on october.hartford reasoned that even assuming minor cognitive difficulties existed,none were severe enough to prevent wright from performing the essential functions of his occupation.see id.at.
district court 
wright filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new hampshire on june.wright claimed that hartford acted under an inherent conflict of interest because it both administered and funded the ltd benefits.wright also alleged that hartford acted under an actual conflict of interest,evidenced by its bad faith in handling wright claims for std and ltd benefits.hartford conflict of interest,according to wright,required a less deferential review of hartford denial of wright benefits.furthermore,even under deferential arbitrary and capricious review,according to wright,hartford denials of std and ltd benefits were not based upon substantial evidence,reasonably sufficient to support hartford decisions.
defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on february,and wright filed a cross motion for summary judgment on march.after extensive oral argument,the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and denied wright motion for summary judgment on june.the district court considered but rejected wright claim that hartford acted out of an improper financial motivation.the court similarly rejected wright other arguments for heightened scrutiny of hartford decisions.applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the district court found that,despite some contradictory evidence,substantial evidence existed to support hartford decision that any cognitive deficits were minor and not disabling.the court entered a final judgment on june.wright filed a timely notice of appeal on july.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see boardman prudential ins.of,cir.the district court generally reviews an erisa plan administrator benefits determinations de novo.allen adage,cir.if,however,by its terms,the erisa plan grants the plan administrator discretionary authority in the determination of eligibility for benefits,the administrator decision must be upheld unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.doyle paul revere life ins,cir.
the operative inquiry under arbitrary,capricious or abuse of discretion review is whether the aggregate evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party,could support a rational determination that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily in denying the claim for benefits.twomey delta airlines pension plan,cir citing leahy raytheon,cir.a decision to deny benefits to a beneficiary will be upheld if the administrator decision was reasoned and supported by substantial evidence.gannon metro.life ins,cir see also boardman,at holding that a district court can overturn an administrator termination decision only if the insurer eligibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it internal citation omitted.evidence is substantial when it is reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion.id.evidence contrary to an administrator decision does not make the decision unreasonable,provided substantial evidence supports the decision.see gannon,at see also doyle,at sufficiency,of course,does not disappear merely by reason of contradictory evidence.
in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard,however,the existence of a conflict of interest on the part of the administrator is a factor which must be considered.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.in this circuit,if a court concludes there is an improper motivation amounting to a conflict of interest,the court may cede a diminished degree of no deference at the administrator determinations.leahy,at.however,a chimerical,imagined,or conjectural conflict will not strip the fiduciary determination of the deference that otherwise would be due.id.if no conflict of interest is apparent,a court must proceed to ensure that the decision was not objectively unreasonable in light of the available evidence,recognizing that the existence of a potential conflict of interest will affect the court determination of what was reasonable conduct by the insurer under the circumstances,at.
here,there is no dispute that the plan confers discretion on the plan administrator.see app.at.the parties disagree,however,as to whether hartford labored under a conflict of interest.thus,before addressing the substantive merits of the district court decision,it is necessary to determine whether there was a conflict of interest,such that the district court should have considered this as a factor in its arbitrary and capricious review.
conflict of interest 
wright argues that hartford labored under a conflict of interest,as evidenced by its dual status as payor of benefits and administrator with respect to the ltd benefits and other factors that wright claims evidence an improper motivation.
upon a de novo review of the evidence,we conclude that the district court properly rejected wright claims that hartford acted under a conflict of interest.
conflict based on status 
turning first to wright structural conflict of interest claim,the district court concluded that,although hartford clearly had a financial incentive to maximize profits with respect to the ltd plan,which it fully insured,the potential that it would deny claims based on was not alone sufficient to alter the standard of review.see app.at.under the law of this circuit,t he fact that the plan administrator will have to pay the plaintiff claim out of its own assets does not change the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.glista unum life ins.of,cir noting that simply because a plan administrator has to pay a claim does not deprive the administrator of discretion when the terms of the plan grant discretion see also doe travelers ins,cir doyle,at.
in,the court acknowledged that an insurer does have a conflict of sorts when a finding of eligibility means that the insurer will have to pay benefits out of its own pocket,but determined that the market presents competing incentives that substantially minimize the apparent conflict of interest.at.in doyle,the court identified the competing incentives,explaining that employers have benefit plans to please employees and,consequently,will not want to keep an overly insurer.at.thus,according to the court,an insurer could hardly sell policies if it is too severe in administering them.doe,at.
wright acknowledges this precedent but argues that the rationale relied upon in these decisions overstates the ability of market forces to minimize the apparent conflict.the district court similarly was troubled by what it deemed the false premise that an erisa plan administrator that also has a financial stake in the benefit decisions can act as a disinterested trustee.bound by precedent,however,the court properly declined to apply a less deferential standard due to the alleged structural conflict 
conflict based on improper motivation 
having rejected wright structural conflict of interest argument,the district court turned to an examination of wright claims that hartford was improperly motivated,see doyle,at,finding each unpersuasive.on appeal,wright claims that the district court erred in failing to find a conflict of interest on the part of hartford based on the timing of the benefit denial,coming immediately before hartford would be financially exposed under the ltd plan the fact that the medical evidence supporting wright claim was never reviewed by a physician prior to hartford denial of the std and ltd claims on november,the fact that the same examiner made both the std and ltd benefit determinations the fact that hartford did not have a copy of wright job description prior to its denial of std and ltd benefits on november,and hartford refusal to fulfill wright requests for certain documentary evidence concerning his claim.
timing of denial of std and ltd benefits 
wright claims that the timing of the rejection of both his std and ltd benefits as the ltd benefit date was approaching demonstrated an actual conflict of interest.according to wright,hartford granted std benefits to wright when it did not have a financial stake in the payment of benefits and then den
