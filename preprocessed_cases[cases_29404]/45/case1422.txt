after the death of his wife sylvia morris,andrew hotaling,sued chubb sovereign life insurance company and jefferson pilot financial life insurance company collectively chubb for million alleging that a life insurance policy issued by chubb and covering his deceased wife was in effect at the time of her death.the primary issue both at trial and on appeal is whether chubb complied with.comp stat,which requires all life insurance companies licensed to operate within illinois to send notices to their policyholders before allowing a life insurance policy to lapse after a bench trial,the district court found that chubb had complied with the illinois statute and entered judgment in favor of chubb.we affirm.
background 
on may,sylvia morris purchased a universal life insurance policy from chubb which provided life insurance coverage of million.the policy required an annual premium of to be paid on or before the eighth day of may each year.additionally,the policy specifically provided that i f the premium is not paid within the grace period,this policy will lapse or terminate without value.when morris purchased the policy in,she paid the first year premium in advance.it is undisputed that during the following year,chubb sent a notice to sylvia morris and the premium was timely paid by her husband,andrew hotaling.this dispute arises because hotaling claims that chubb failed to send a notice to his wife the third year that is,in.
a.the policy lapses 
it should be noted at the outset that at the bench trial chubb was unable to produce a copy of the notice it allegedly sent to sylvia morris prior to lapsing her policy nor did the carrier introduce the testimony of an employee who specifically recalled sending morris a notice despite the absence of a copy of the actual notice sent to morris,chubb maintains that it sent such a notice to morris on april,in the normal course of its business.hotaling testified at trial that he did not receive such a notice and that he would have been aware if morris had received such a notice because he was in charge of paying their family bills.
chubb additionally asserts that in june it sent a lapse pending letter to morris alerting her to the fact that her life insurance policy would lapse if a premium payment was not received within the policy grace period.chubb introduced a copy of this letter at trial,which reads in relevant part 
dear morris,
currently your policy does not have enough value to cover the monthly expenses due on may.we are concerned that your policy will lapse without value on july,unless you take immediate action.
the minimum payment is.please understand that if this policy lapses,you are losing the financial security and protection this insurance coverage provides you.
please do let this policy lapse,contact your chubb sovereign life representative listed below or a customer service representative today.
hotaling denies that either he or his wife ever received a letter of this nature from chubb.
according to hotaling trial testimony,neither he nor his wife was aware that anything was amiss regarding her life insurance coverage until receiving a lapse letter from chubb dated july,which stated that her policy had lapsed due to of premiums.the lapse letter stated 
we regret to inform you that your policy coverage with chubb sovereign life insurance company is no longer in force because we did not receive your past due premium as prescribed by your policy.we are sorry that you have made this decision to leave our company.
please give careful consideration to reinstating this valuable policy protection.you may have the option of continuing this coverage by completing reinstatement requirements and paying the past due premium of.your chubb sovereign life representative listed below or a customer service representative would be available to answer your questions and guide you through this process.
on july,three weeks after receiving the lapse letter,morris phoned chubb and requested reinstatement forms pursuant to the information contained in the final lapse letter of july.chubb forwarded morris the necessary paperwork the following day,august.the reinstatement letter and application forms chubb mailed to morris stated that,for purposes of underwriting,morris would be required to undergo and pass a medical examination prior to the reinstatement of her policy.morris scheduled the required medical exam for august.tragically,before the medical examination date arrived,morris was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer,rendering her uninsurable.morris died less than five weeks later.
procedural history 
following morris death,hotaling requested that chubb disburse the benefits he was entitled to receive under the terms of morris policy.chubb refused hotaling request for payment,maintaining that morris policy had lapsed prior to her death due to her failure to pay her premium before the expiration of the policy grace period on july.hotaling countered that chubb could not validly lapse the policy because morris had never received a notice alerting her that the policy was about to lapse as required by the illinois insurance code.thereafter,hotaling filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county,illinois,on december,alleging that chubb had violated.comp.stat.
after chubb removed the case to federal court,a bench trial was held on december.at trial,hotaling testified that he had never received a notice from chubb or the letter,and argued that the failure to send a notice pursuant to illinois law prevented chubb from legally lapsing morris policy.
chubb,on the other hand,claimed it had complied with the statute by mailing a notice to morris,but admitted that it could not produce any witnesses who could testify that they recalled placing morris specific notice in the mail.chubb,however,did introduce testimony and evidence explaining its usual procedures that insure that notices are mailed to all customers,such as morris,who have failed to pay their premiums due in a timely fashion.chubb called ronald reed,an assistant of information technology at chubb,who testified that chubb utilized a computer system which automatically handles the billing of the premium as in the case of the policy of sylvia morris.after hearing reed testimony and related paperwork documenting chubb business practices used to notify its customers of delinquent premium payments,the trial judge made the following findings of fact based on reed testimony 
the fact issue in the case was whether the statutorily required notice ilcs was mailed by chubb to morris.chubb has an almost fully automated system of mailing premium notices and other correspondence to the holders of its universal life policies.it is set up to bill days in advance.in order to generate these premium notices and other correspondence,chubb has contracted with management applied programming map,a firm located in santa barbara,california.the process starts when the chubb computer in concord,new hampshire,which is programmed to generate a list of all policies that premium notices are to be sent sic that date.the chubb computer is connected by leased line with the map computer and the list,or abstract,is transferred electronically to california.in turn the map computer is programmed to print the name of the insured,the policy number,the premium amount due,and the due date,on forms.the premium due notices are checked for quality control,to insure readability,then checked to make sure that the number of notices is in close agreement with the number that should be there.they do not do an actual count because they do approximately notices a day.the notices then go to the mail room where a machine automatically folds the notices,and stuffs them into window envelopes.the notices are then postage metered and taken to a mail drop where they are picked up by the post office.
two extracts are generated,one by chubb,which is the list that is transferred to map.map in turn generates a list of all notices printed by it.the map list can only be generated if the initial transmission from chubb has been successful.the map computer is programmed to refuse to print the notices if the system inadvertently fails to print one or more of the notices.neither map nor chubb,however,keep a duplicate of the actual premium notices sent.chubb however does keep a copy of all other correspondence to the policy holder,such as lapse warnings and lapse notices.
according to chubb records the premium notice process for morris policy commenced in concord,new hampshire,at est on april,and was received at map in california,at pst,april,minutes later.the notice was printed and programmed to contain the name of the insured,the insured mailing address,the policy number,the premium due date,and a statement that if payments were not made that the policy would lapse and all payments would be forfeited and the policy would be void.
chubb exhibit 
chubb also called wendalyn chase,another assistant at chubb,to testify regarding the procedures used to contact policyholders regarding premium payments.in the course of her testimony,chubb introduced over plaintiff objection an exhibit consisting of eight pages of policy and premium information dealing with the policyholders whose names appear on the april,billing extract list both before and after sylvia morris name.this exhibit,marked as defendant exhibit,reveals that the individuals listed directly before and after morris on the april,billing extract list made premium payments to chubb on may,and may,respectively.
at the conclusion of receiving evidence,the trial judge asked the parties to submit written final arguments.he specifically stated 
the question here,the one question i have are three alternatives here that could have happened.one is they hotaling and morris got the notice and either lost it or disregarded it or whatever.another one is that no notice was ever sent out.the third one is that it was sent out and never got there.what sic the ramifications of that you might comment on that in your arguments.
after receiving the parties written arguments and weighing the evidence at trial,the district court entered judgment for chubb stating 
the question therefore is whether the record contains sufficient evidence to show by a preponderance of the evidence that chubb actually mailed the premium notice to morris.both chubb and map employ electronic means in order to send out premium notices.in this day and age this is not unexpected direct evidence of mailing or testimony of the mail clerk is not necessary,given the routine nature of the mailing of such notices provided there is some corroboration.kolias state farm mutual automobile ins,d.the issue is therefore whether there is sufficient corroborating evidence to sustain chubb burden of proof on the issue.the corroborating evidence that chubb submitted consisted of evidence that the policy holder directly before morris and the policy holder directly after her on the extract generated by chubb and sent to map apparently received their notices of premium due because the premium payments were received by chubb on may,and may,respectively.this evidence coupled with the evidence that the computer program was designed to print all or none of the premium notices gives the court a basis to believe that it is more probably true than not true that the premium notices were printed and placed in the mail by map as testified to by wayne hayes of map.thus,assuming that neither morris nor hotaling received the premium notice,it is more probably true that it was misdirected or lost by the post office.
the judge then went on and concluded that chubb complied with ilcs and that the policy had lapsed for of the premium.
ii.analysis 
receipt of defendant exhibit 
on appeal,hotaling argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing chubb to introduce in evidence defendant exhibit,which consists of eight pages of policy and premium information regarding a list of those policyholders whose notices were printed at the same time morris notice was printed.as discussed earlier,chubb did not disclose its intent to use these documents until one week before trial,which was after the court discovery deadline contained in its final pretrial order.accordingly,hotaling had only five working days to review the potential impact of the policyholder payment information contained in the exhibit.hotaling,therefore,argues that chubb late disclosure of exhibit unfairly prejudiced him because he had no opportunity to explore the nature of the documents or their significance.
standard of review 
we have consistently held that decisions to receive or bar the admission of evidence at trial as well as the decision to modify a final pretrial order are matters that rest within the sound discretion of the trial court.sadowski bombardier limited,cir.in sadowski,we explained 
trial judges must be permitted wide latitude in guiding cases through preparatory stages,and their decisions as to the extent that pretrial activity should prevent introduction of otherwise competent and relevant testimony at trial must not be disturbed unless it is demonstrated that they have clearly abused the broad discretion vested in them the determination as to whether or not parties should be held to pretrial orders is a matter for the discretion of district court judges.

as this court has explained,we afford great deference to a judge evidentiary rulings 
because of the trial judge exposure to the witnesses and the evidence as a whole,and because of the judge familiarity with the case and ability to gauge the impact of the evidence in the context of the entire proceeding.indeed,a ppellants who challenge evidentiary rulings of the district court are like rich men who wish to enter the kingdom their prospects compare with those of camels who wish to pass through the eye of the needle.because we give special deference to the rulings of the trial judge,a defendant obviously carries a heavy burden.

relevance of defendant exhibit 
defendant exhibit reveals that the persons listed directly before and after morris on the april,billing extract list made premium payments to chubb on may,and may,respectively.with the knowledge that those policyholders whose names appeared directly before and after morris on the billing extract made payments shortly after the notices were printed,the trial judge could reasonably conclude that map mailed,and these two policyholders received,the notices that were printed on april,and map mailed sylvia morris a notice because her notice was processed at the same time that map mailed a notice to the other individuals listed before and after her on the billing extract.furthermore,the fact that such payments were made shortly after chubb processed and mailed notices,most certainly,allows a reasonable factfinder to conclude that chubb mailed all of the notices processed on april,including the one addressed to sylvia morris.this is especially true given the fact that map computer program was designed to print all or none of the notices.therefore,we are of the opinion that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing chubb to introduce defendant exhibit into evidence 
b.the illinois premium notice statute 
standard of review 
the trial judge concluded chubb had complied with ilcs with the presentation of evidence that it had mailed a notice to morris in the ordinary course of its business practices.in reaching this conclusion,the judge determined that there was no need for chubb to offer either a copy of the actual notice sent to morris or the testimony of an individual who specifically recalled sending a notice to morris.hotaling appeals and claims that evidence of a company customary practices is insufficient to prove that a notice was addressed and mailed under ilcs.as this is a question of statutory interpretat
