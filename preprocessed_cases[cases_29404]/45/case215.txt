we agree with the district court that addamax complaints,read in conjunction with all relevant extrinsic evidence cited by osf,neither stated nor adumbrated a claim for damages resulting from a personal injury or advertising injury defined in the policies.consequently,we conclude that had no duty to defend the addamax litigation,and we affirm the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to.
background 
organized in by seven computer hardware and software companies the sponsors,pursuant to the national cooperative research act of,osf was tasked with designing and marketing a operating system known as that would become an industry standard for unix users.to induce other companies to develop components for its operating system,osf formulated various requests for technology rfts,which essentially offered competing suppliers the opportunity to submit their products to be integrated into the operating system.
one necessary component of the operating system was security software.in november,osf solicited two software developers,addamax corporation addamax and secureware,to submit their security technologies for evaluation.roughly one year later,osf selected secureware security technology to be incorporated into.
in april,addamax counsel sent a demand letter to osf claiming that its decision to bundle secureware software into violated federal and state antitrust laws,and threatening litigation if the alleged violations were not remedied.when osf failed to respond to these demands,addamax filed a complaint against osf and two of its sponsors,and digital electric corporation.addamax alleged that the sponsors and members of osf were a buyers cartel that conspired to coerce software makers into offering their products to osf at prices below fair market value the complaint summarized addamax claims as follows 
this is an action to recover damages and obtain permanent injunctive relief against the open software foundation,osf,digital equipment corporation dec,and company for violations of federal and state antitrust laws,unfair trade practice law,and the common law of the commonwealth of massachusetts osf acts as an illegal cartel through which its sponsors have illegally combined,contracted,or conspired to exercise their aggregate market power by,among other things,fixing prices for the software technology osf acquires from software developers setting a price ceiling in certain software markets allocating product markets among the sponsors and boycotting certain independent software developers,including addamax.the net effect,among others,of the defendants activities has been and will be to unlawfully and unreasonably restrain trade,substantially lessen competition among purchasers of software,drive independent software developers out of business,and reinforce the strong market positions of osf and its sponsors.
of the nine counts in the complaint,the first seven were based on federal or state antitrust statutes.the eighth count alleged that osf operations constituted unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of.laws ch,and chapter.the ninth count alleged that osf and its sponsors intentionally and improperly interfered with addamax actual contractual relations and prospective contractual relations.approximately two years after filing its original complaint,addamax filed an amended complaint to include,inter alia,more detailed allegations describing and illustrating osf practice of coercing independent software vendors to license their products at prices 
osf and hp successfully defended the addamax suit.we found that antitrust violations,even if they were assumed to have occurred,were not a material cause of addamax failure in the line of business at issue,and accordingly affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment to osf.addamax open software,cir.
anticipating the costs of defending the addamax suit,osf corporate counsel sent a letter to on march,requesting that they defend the claim pursuant to the primary and excess liability policies issued by.in a memorandum appended to the letter,osf associate general counsel,sue schlener,argued that the addamax claims were covered by osf policy with under the advertising injury or personal injury clauses of the policies.after consulting outside counsel,notified osf on august,that it did not consider any of the claims to fall within the coverage furnished by the primary and excess liability policies,and therefore declined to accept tender of the defense.
approximately six years later,osf filed this lawsuit against while addamax appeal in the underlying action was still pending before this court.claiming that had a duty to defend the addamax claim,osf requested a declaratory judgment to this effect as well as damages in the amount of reasonable defense costs.osf specifically contended that addamax suit alluded to personal injuries,including defamation,and advertising injuries,including unfair competition and asserted that since both types of claims were listed in general and excess liability policies,had a duty to defend.in a thoughtful opinion,the district court found both arguments unpersuasive and granted motion for summary judgment.osf appeals,arguing that both the personal injury and advertising injury clauses of the gcl triggered a duty to defend.
ii.interpreting the policies 
like most other jurisdictions,massachusetts imposes a broad duty to defend on insurers i t is axiomatic that an insurance company duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.boston symphony orchestra commercial union ins.the supreme judicial court sjc has observed that the duty to defend is based on the facts alleged in the complaint and those facts which are known by the insurer.boston symphony,at.thus,the insurer must accept tender of a defense if the complaints state or adumbrate a covered claim when read in light of extrinsic facts bearing some relevance to the allegations that the plaintiff did not specifically include in the complaint,but were nonetheless known or readily knowable by the insurer when the defense was tendered 
t he question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend actions against the insured is decided by matching the complaint with the policy provisions if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,the insurer must undertake the defense otherwise stated,the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of allegations of the complaint,and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.
continental cas.gilbane,quoting sterilite continental cas,citations and footnote omitted.
determining whether complaints adumbrate a claim can be a difficult interpretive exercise.osf and advance widely varying accounts of how the court,applying massachusetts law,is to analyze the complaints and facts extrinsic to them when envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of allegations of the complaint.continental cas,at.argues that even if facts exist extrinsic to the complaint which,if they were pleaded,would trigger coverage t here is no duty to defend if the allegations of the complaint are unambiguously outside the scope of policy coverage.osf rejects this characterization of massachusetts law and largely rests its case on the proposition that had a duty to defend osf because addamax could have sued for a covered personal or advertising injury on the basis of facts outside the complaints that were known or readily knowable by the insurer.state mut.life assurance lumbermens mut.cas.
massachusetts courts generally use extrinsic facts such as those set forth in demand letters to the insurer to aid interpretation of the complaint,and not as independent factual predicates for a duty to defend.in attempting to envisag e what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of allegations of the complaint,the insurer must examine the plaintiff allegations in conjunction with facts that it knows or readily should know in order to determine whether coverage exists under the policy.boston symphony,at.however,the insured can not,in the absence of a complaint that requires coverage,force its insurer to defend the insured by simply telling the insurer facts that would create coverage.id.at see also kilgore resumix.lexis,finding no duty to defend where defamatory utterance was neither alleged nor implied,and amendment of the complaint to state a defamation claim was a mere possibility.
the language of boston symphony undercuts osf position that facts extrinsic to the plaintiff allegations in the complaints,uncovered at any stage of the underlying action,can independently trigger a duty to defend that does not arise from the allegations of the complaints,however sketchily stated.indeed,the sjc envisioned a limited role for extrinsic facts in liability insurance cases we hold only that an insurer must give consideration to facts outside the complaint when it considers the allegations in the complaint to determine if coverage exists.boston symphony,at.this holding is consistent with prior massachusetts decisions emphasizing that there is no duty to defend if,at the time the claims were advanced,the insurer could reasonably have concluded that no aspect of the claims fell within the scope of coverage.millipore travelers indem,cir citing polaroid travelers indem,emphasis added.thus,while the insurer can generally determine its duty to defend after the plaintiff submits the initial version of his complaint,the duty to defend may occasionally arise during a later phase in the underlying action if the plaintiff obtains leave to amend and adds allegations that trigger coverage.consequently,until there is an unalterable determination as to the nature of the underlying claim,any declaration of rights concerning the insurer duty to defend can not be conclusive.lumbermens mut.cas.belleville.
we therefore treat the extrinsic facts known or readily knowable to as an aid to interpreting the addamax complaints.we do not consider them as independent grounds for a duty to defend.functioning in this limited role,extrinsic facts work in tandem with the adumbrate standard to add substance and meaning to skeletal claims only adumbrated in the complaint.these facts,brought to the insurer attention in a timely fashion by the insured,aid the insurer informed review of the tender of defense by painting a fuller picture of the underlying action.
however,extrinsic facts can also be misused by insureds seeking to transform a skeletal claim in the underlying complaint into an allegation arguably covered by the liability policy but unrelated to an actual claim in the complaint.employed in this way,extrinsic facts could stretch the terms of the liability policy to encompass lawsuits beyond the contemplation of the parties when they contracted for the insurance.hence,we must be mindful of the sjc admonition in boston symphony that the insured can not,in the absence of a complaint that requires coverage,force its insurers to defend the insured by simply telling the insurer facts that would create coverage.boston symphony,at.
we now discuss each of the two contested clauses of the policies in turn.
iii.advertising injury 
osf argues that addamax suit was covered under the advertising injury provisions of the primary and excess insurance policies in effect at the time of osf announcement of the selection of secureware.the pivotal definition in the primary policy reads as follows 
advertising injury means injury arising out of an offense committed during the policy period occurring in the course of the named insured advertising activities,if such injury arises out of libel,slander,defamation,violation of right of privacy,piracy,unfair competition,or infringement of copyright,title or slogan.
the umbrella policy providing excess coverage similarly covers damages resulting from 
advertising ing injury arising out of one or more of the following acts committed during the policy period by or for the named insured in any advertisement,publicity article,broadcast or telecast 
a libel,slander or defamation 
b infringement of copyright or of title or of slogan 
c piracy or unfair competition or idea misappropriation under an implied contract 
d invasion of the right of privacy.
of all the acts listed in the advertising injury provisions of the two policies,only unfair competition is invoked by osf as an underlying cause of the advertising injuries adumbrated in the addamax complaints.in interpreting the phrase unfair competition,we note that courts are generally obliged to construe ambiguous terms in an insurance contract in favor of the insured.see kenneth york john whelan,insurance law,ed discussing the doctrine of contra proferentum.bay transp.auth.allianz ins,recognizing the doctrine in massachusetts law.yet this rule does not operate here because the phrase unfair competition as used in the policies is not ambiguous.see.bay transp,at declining to follow the doctrine of contra proferentum because the relevant policy language was not ambiguous.as the district court found,the term unfair competition in the policies refer s to conduct that causes confusion on the part of consumers,such as palming off or passing off.osf,wl,at see also american bar association section of litigation,model jury instructions business torts litigation.it is settled in massachusetts that the gravamen of an unfair competition claim is the likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source of the goods or services.datacomm interface,computerworld,
given the meaning of the term unfair competition in massachusetts law,the leading case in the commonwealth interpreting the phrase unfair competition in a general commercial liability insurance policy not surprisingly limits the injury to palming off.see smartfoods,northbrook prop.cas,unfair competition,in its common law signification,implies palming off.palming off is an attempt by one person to induce customers to believe that his products are actually those of another.kazmaier wooten,cir quoting remco indus.toyomenka,aff,cir.by contrast,addamax blames osf for not using addamax software in its operating system,and attributes this decision to an illegal scheme of monopolization and.whereas palming off involves the illicit identification or association of the defendant product with the plaintiff,addamax major grievance is that osf disassociated itself from addamax,thereby foreclosing the company participation in a large segment of the unix software market.thus the addamax complaint is not reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that it indicated or adumbrated a claim for unfair competition.
massachusetts decision to construe the advertising injury of unfair competition in a general commercial liability insurance policy as equivalent in scope to the state common law tort of the same name reflects the approach of a majority of jurisdictions.see atlantic mut.ins.brotech,collecting cases standard fire ins.people church of fresno,cir gencor,wausau underwriters ins.pine top ins.public util.dist.qsp,aetna cas.sur,bank of the west superior court,cal th,d.in fact,at the time osf and signed the relevant insurance contracts,all federal court decisions but one had been consistent in their support of the common law definition of unfair competition as palming off or passing off,that is,usurping the commercial advantage of another by deceptively substituting one own goods for those of the competitor.terri keville,advertising injury coverage an overview,cal,
osf nonetheless contends that addamax complaint triggered a duty to defend under the advertising injury clauses of the policies because several claims in the addamax antitrust,chapter,and interference with business relations unfair competition in common parlance.the district court acknowledged that,in a general sense,such violations might be thought of as a species of unfair competition because they entail methods of competition that are illegal and thus unfair.osf,wl,at.however,it ultimately found osf argument unpersuasive because the insurance contract is a legal document,and parties signing it should expect that a legal term used in the policy will be accorded the meaning that the courts have given it.id.we agree.a treatise on the topic reinforces the district court analysis 
in its general sense,unfair competition is defined as all dishonest or fraudulent rivalry in trade and commerce black law dictionary,thus encompassing a potentially large number of different offenses 
however,the definition of unfair competition quoted above goes on to state that the term is particularly applied to the practice of endeavoring to substitute one own goods or products in the markets for those of another having an established reputation and extensive sales,by means of imitating or counterfeiting the name,title,size,shape,or distinctive peculiarities of the article,or the shape,color,label,wrapper,or general appearance of the package the imitation being carried far enough to mislead the general public or deceive an unwary purchaser,and yet not amounting to an absolute counterfeit or to the infringement of a or.in this more limited meaning,which seems more likely to be applicable in the context of advertising injury,unfair competition is much the same as misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business.
jeffrey stempel,law of insurance contract disputes,at ed quoting donald malecki and arthur flitner,commercial general liability.
the relevant sections of the policies define covered advertising injuries as those arising out of libel,slander,defamation,violation of right of privacy,piracy,unfair competition,or infringement of copyright,title or slogan in the general policy and a libel,slander or defamation b infringement of copyright or of title or of slogan c piracy or unfair competition or idea misappropriation under an implied contract d invasion of the right of privacy in the excess policy.applying the interpretive principle of noscitur a sociis to language in an almost identical gcl policy,the seventh circuit observed that 
a word sometimes picks up meaning from its neighbors and all the other terms in the list of wrongs insured under the rubric of advertising injury concern the misuse of information,as befits the word advertising.piracy and the infringement of copyrights,titles presumably of books,songs,products,services,and so forth,and slogans advertising and other are simply different forms of theft broadly conceived of information.and defamation involves the use of false information,while invasion of the right of privacy the use of true,though sometimes misleading or offensive,information.libel and slander are the two halves of defamation i f tortious interference and similar claims are covered by the policy,the policy has a bulge not easy to make sense of or to attribute to the deliberate choice of the parties.

the terms surrounding unfair competition in the advertising injury provisions of the usf g policies exclusively denote communicative harms injuries that occur as a direct result of communication,not illegal courses of conduct that merely involve communication.we are not persuaded by the appellant attempt to apply the latter gloss to the term,just as the seventh circuit was unmoved by the same tactic in w e find it highly implausible to suppose that unfair competition in a list of torts otherwise concerned mainly with harmful speech in various forms defamation,invasion of the right of privacy,copyright infringement would sweep under the policy a general,albeit only prima facie,liability for antitrust damages and other causes of action not constituted by communicative harms.id.at 
iv.personal injury 
the only terms in the personal injury sections of the two policies that possibly pertain to addamax suit are harms caused by communication.the harms are defined as 
injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses committed during the policy period a publication or utterance a of a libel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material,or b a publication or utterance in violation of an individual right of privacy except publications or utterances in the course of or related to advertising,broadcasting,publishing or telecasting activities conducted by or on behalf of the named insured shall not be deemed personal injury.
the umbrella policy providing excess coverage similarly covers damages from 
injury arising out of b the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or other defamatory or disparaging material or a publication or utterance in violation of an individual right of privacy except publications or utterances in the course of or related to advertising activities.
addamax makes no reference to a claim for defamation or disparagement in either of its complaints or in its initial demand letter to osf.nonetheless,osf argues that the complaints,considered in light of extrinsic evidence either provided to or readily knowable by,adumbrate defamation and disparagement claims.see continental cas,at if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,the insurer must undertake the defense.
maneuvering within the interpretive boundaries of the adumbrate standard,see supra note,osf insists that liability coverage is triggered under the personal injury provisions of its policies on the theory that addamax damages allegedly occurred,at least in part,because the communications by osf to its sponsors and members about the selection of secureware as superior lowered addamax in rank and estimation.osf further contends that such allegedly false statements could prejudice the plaintiff in the conduct of its business and therefore are sufficient to state a claim for disparagement as to products and defamation as to the source of these goods under massachusetts law.
as noted,osf personal injury coverage extends to liability from injuries arising out of other defamatory or disparaging material,and not just to liability for defamation and disparagement actions themselves.interpreting this phrase in a similar gcl policy,the sjc observed that d isparage means,among other things,to lower in rank and estimation by actions or words,or to speak slightingly of.boston symphony,at quoting webster new international dictionary of the english language ed.
osf contends that all of addamax its antitrust,chapter,and tortious interference based at least in part on words and actions of osf that explicitly or implicitly lowered addamax in rank and estimation.osf initial tender of the defense arguably alerted to the publication of disparaging and defamatory materials in various forms osf advertisements promoting the rft process generally,the rft process itself,a security rationale document that identified addamax and secureware as the two companies competing in the security rf and justified osf selection of the secureware product,additional advertising after the completion of the security rft announcing the selection of secureware and touting the impartiality of the rft process,and other unspecified publications referred to in addamax complaint lauding the superior capabilities of secureware.osf of the defense through this declaratory judgment action disclosed a sixth source of defamatory or disparaging of addamax impending bankruptcy in the wake of its loss to secureware in the rft.
we assume arguendo that these facts,identified in the addamax complaints or extrinsic to them,constituted disparaging or defamatory
