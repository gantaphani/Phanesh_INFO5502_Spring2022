in this appeal,gray insurance company gray appeals from an adverse summary judgment entered against it in an insurance indemnification dispute among various insurance defendants.the underlying claim giving rise to an insurance payment obligation was the death of kerry roberts,who died when he fell through the top of an oil storage tank which he was repairing.surviving family members sued both the owner and the production operator of the storage tank,energy development corporation edc,and grasso production management,grasso,respectively.these defendants then filed complaints against roberts employer,production management control systems pmcs and its insurance company,the gray insurance company gray,seeking indemnity pursuant to the master service agreement between pmcs and edc.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of edc and grasso.
factual and procedural background 
kerry roberts,an employee of pmcs,was killed installing a fire protection device on the top of an oil storage tank owned by edc when the top of the storage tank collapsed and he fell through and ultimately drowned in the oil stored therein.roberts was sent to the storage tank by edc and grasso,both of which had prior knowledge that the top of the storage tank might be defective since only months prior,a grasso employee knee had gone through the top of a companion storage tank.the storage tank at issue was located on edc platform facility in a canal in west delta block,which is located in plaquemines parish,louisiana.edc classifies its platform as an offshore facility but the west delta block facility is located in waters within the state of louisiana.
pmcs limits its services to performing work such as the installation,repair,and testing of safety systems on oil and gas production platforms.the work done on april,the day of the accident,was performed pursuant to a verbal work order issued four days earlier for the installation of a fire safety device on the tank and platform.the work order was issued from the edc facility in plaquemines,louisiana.
edc and pmcs had previously entered into a form master service agreement msa on may,which agreement was prepared by edc and was quite similar to the msa entered into by edc and grasso.the msa did not bind edc to perform any work at all for pmcs and did not identify specific dates,time,or places for performance.the msa did,though,contain an indemnity provision which required pmcs to carry million in general liability coverage and to designate edc and edc subcontractors as additional insureds.the form msa also contained a choice of law provision,which provided as follows 
this contract shall be governed by general maritime law of the united states,wherever permissible.otherwise,the laws of the state of texas shall apply,excluding,however,any such law which would direct the application of the law of a different jurisdiction.
pmcs is a louisiana corporation domiciled in louisiana and edc is a new jersey corporation with corporate offices in ardmore,oklahoma.the record reveals that most of the work performed by pmcs was done in louisiana or in her waters,and a very small portion was performed at a facility in the outer continental shelf in the waters offshore of texas,but none was performed in either texas or her territorial waters.
the insurance provisions of both the and the msas required the contractee general comprehensive liability policy to provide that edc be covered as an additional insured under the policy.each of these entities had general liability policies as follows pmcs had a million primary policy and a million excess policy,both issued by gray edc primary policy was issued by lloyd for and grasso primary policy was issued by lloyd for and it carried an excess policy in the amount of,also issued by lloyd.both pmcs and grasso excess policies provide that any entity insured under the primary policy is also covered under the excess policy.undisputedly,each primary policy also contains a provision that a party becomes an additional insured when that status is required by any contract with the named insured.an endorsement on the gray primary policy also contains a schedule of companies to whom primary coverage is to apply.neither edc nor grasso is listed as one of the in the schedule to whom the endorsement explicitly refers.
when the roberts family sued edc and grasso for the death of kerry roberts,edc and grasso filed complaints against pmcs and its insurer,gray,for msa contractual indemnification.pmcs denied the claims and asserted in the alternative that if indemnity was owed edc,it was to be shared with grasso,and that if additional insured status was declared,it would be shared with edc and grasso insurers.
the federal district court originally granted summary judgment to pmcs and gray based on the louisiana oilfield indemnity act loia,and dismissed edc and grasso complaints.edc and grasso then settled the underlying claims of the roberts family against them,with edc paying the family and grasso paying.edc and grasso then appealed the district court dismissal of their claims against pmcs and gray.
in roberts energy development,cir,a prior panel of our court affirmed the district court finding that the contract at issue pertained to a well and that the loia would bar edc and grasso claims,but it remanded to the district court for reconsideration of the district court determination regarding the choice of law provision in the msa.specifically,the prior panel remanded for a consideration of whether the loia rendered unenforceable the agreement choice of law provision.the prior panel observed that,in a diversity case,the forum state conflict laws govern resolution of the enforceability of a choice of law provision,and thus,it remanded for consideration of the viability of the agreement choice of law provisions in light of louisiana conflict articles,and.see roberts,at.
on remand,the district court concluded that the choice of law provision in the msa,selecting texas law,was enforceable and that as a result,the loia did not apply.the district court also concluded that while a contractual indemnity clause is otherwise barred by the texas oilfield act toaia.civ.prac.vernon supp,an additional insured requirement,like that found in the msa at issue in this case,does not violate the toaia and is valid and enforceable.the court went on to conclude that grasso policy would not provide coverage because roberts was not a grasso employee.additionally,the district court ruled that edc and grasso would share equally the reimbursement from the million gray primary policy,that edc primary policy would absorb the shortfall after receiving the from gray,and that since grasso primary policy had been exhausted by prior claims,gray excess policy was to cover the additional liability amount of,which was beyond the grasso would receive from gray primary policy.all told,gray was ordered to pay edc and to pay grasso.
gray has now timely appealed all adverse rulings made against it by the district court.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying all of the same standards applicable in the district court.see sherrod american airlines,cir.summary judgment under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure is appropriate only if 
the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
here,the material facts are not in dispute and our disposition hinges on the application of the undisputed facts to the law determined applicable.it is not disputed that should louisiana law be determined applicable pursuant to the louisiana conflicts articles,the loia would bar any claims against gray by edc and grasso for contribution or indemnity.
pursuant to our prior panel remand,the district court first set about to reconsider whether the choice of law provision in the msa between pmcs and edc,which provision selected texas law as applying except for those such laws which would direct the application of the law of a different jurisdiction,was enforceable in light of the loia.pursuant to the remand order,the district court analyzed the enforceability of the choice of law provision under louisiana conflicts articles.the district court noted that the decision upon which it had previously relied in determining that louisiana law governed the dispute,that is matte zapata offshore,cir,was inapplicable,as noted in the prior panel remand order,because the holding in matte resulted from the fact that the application of louisiana law in that case was mandated by the applicability of the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,which act the district court concluded is inapplicable to this case because the accident at issue occurred in louisiana state waters and not on the outer continental shelf 
the district court,therefore,turned to an application of louisiana conflicts articles to determine whether the parties choice of law provision was enforceable.the provisions applicable to the choice of law provision in this case are articles,and of the louisiana civil code.we explained the relevant inquiry under louisiana law in roberts as follows 
under the louisiana conflicts articles,we look first to article which states 
all other issues of conventional obligations are governed by the law expressly chosen or clearly relied upon by the parties,except to the extent that law contravenes the public policy of the state whose law would otherwise be applicable under article.
thus,we next turn to article to determine which state law would otherwise be applicable to the agreement.article states 
except as otherwise provided in this title,an issue of conventional obligation is governed by the law of the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law were not applied to that issue.
that state is determined by evaluating the strength and pertinence of the relevant polices of the involved state in light of the pertinent contacts of each state to the parties and the transaction,including the place of negotiation,formation and performance of the contract,the location of the object of the contract,and the place of domicile,habitual residence,or business of the parties the nature,type,and purpose of the contract and the polices referred to in article,as well as the policies of facilitating the orderly planning of transactions,of promoting multistate commercial intercourse,and of protecting one party from undue imposition by the other.
article guides us in balancing the policies of the states 
except as otherwise provided in this book,an issue in a case having contacts with other states is governed by the law of the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law were not applied to that issue.
that state is determined by evaluating the strength and pertinence of the relevant policies of all involved states in the light of the relationship of each state to the parties and the dispute and the policies and needs of the interstate and international system,including the policies of upholding the justified expectations of parties and of minimizing the adverse consequences that might follow from subjecting a party to the law of more than one state.
the revision comments to articles and provide helpful instructions to courts using these articles.the comments emphasize that the objective of the choice of law analysis is to identify the state whose policies would be most seriously impaired if its law is not applied to that issue.revision comments a.the comments to article list two steps to follow in making this determination.the first is to identify the relevant policies of the involved states.the next step is to evaluate the strength and pertinence of these policies in light of the three factors listed in the second paragraph of article.revision comments d.
roberts,at.
in simplest terms,we must first determine which state law would be otherwise applicable in the absence of the choice of law provision.we then determine whether application of the chosen law would contravene the otherwise applicable state public policy.our overall objective is to determine the state whose policies would be more seriously impaired if its law was not applied,and this is done by comparing the strength and pertinence of the competing states policies in light of the various factors set forth in article.
in its assessment of the conflicts articles,the district court concluded that louisiana explicit public policy against indemnity agreements stated in the loia,though strong,was but one of many other factors which guided its decision,and the other factors weighed more heavily in favor of selecting texas as the appropriate law to govern.the district court concluded that texas law would otherwise be applicable under article,and as a consequence,the application of texas law would not offend any texas public policy.in making its determination that texas law would be otherwise applicable under article,the district court relied on the following factors both edc and pmcs had significant contacts with texas edc has its principal place of business in houston and pmcs maintains a houston operations office to which all correspondence regarding the msa was to be sent the parties contemplated that work orders would be performed in both louisiana and texas the choice of law provision was bargained for by the parties additional policies of louisiana encourage the facilitating of ventures and the location of the accident was not dispositive.the district court also relied on what it perceived as our implicit recognition of the propriety of selecting texas law over that of louisiana based on application of the louisiana conflicts provisions and in spite of the loia in american ins.apache,cir.august,per curiam unpublished citing to our unpublished decision in american,the district court thus concluded that there is no doubt that texas law should apply to the underlying agreement between pmcs and edc.
gray argues on appeal that the primary inquiry required by article is whether application of the chosen state law would contravene the public policy of the state whose law would otherwise be applicable under article.arguing that louisiana law would be otherwise applicable under article,gray asserts that permitting the indemnity arrangement in this case would directly contravene the proviso in the loia that it is the intent of the legislature by this section to declare null and void and against public policy of the state of louisiana indemnification agreements requiring defense indemnification of principals with respect to oilfield accidents.a.in that section,the legislature declared that an inequity is foisted on certain contractors and their employees by the defense or indemnity provisions,either or both,contained in some agreements pertaining to wells for oil,gas,or water id.
gray argues that the public policy of louisiana is clearly and unambiguously stated in the loia and there is no explicit statement of the public policy of texas on any pertinent issue cited by either the district court or the appellees.gray cites to cherokee pump,aurora pump,cir,in which a panel of our court noted that unlike the loia,the louisiana repurchase statute at issue in that case did not contain an explicit embodiment of state public policy.gray notes that in matte,we stated 
t he public policy of louisiana is clear,certain,and unambiguous.any provision which purports to provide a defense or indemnity to an indemnitee for claims of injury or death alleged to have been caused by the indemnitee negligence is void and unenforceable.
it is gray position that considering the factors set forth in article,and the relative strengths of the policies of both texas and louisiana,louisiana has a stronger interest in,and policy for,protecting its like pmcs,from indemnity provisions like the one found in the msa.gray also argues that considering the verbal work order and not the msa as the operative agreement even more strongly favors selection of louisiana,and it points to our prior panel statement that t he oral work order is the relevant agreement for determining this issue of whether
