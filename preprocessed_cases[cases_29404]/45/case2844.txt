introduction 
on may,petitioner and defendant,huffy corporation,filed a mandate petition which seeks to set aside an order denying its motion in an insurance coverage dispute in two related cases pending in the respondent court.defendant filed its mandate petition along with pages of sealed exhibits.concerned that such a number of pages of sealed exhibits in an ordinary coverage dispute might be inconsistent with established california law,we afforded the parties an opportunity to brief the issue of whether any or all of the documents should be sealed.only defendant responded to our inquiry concerning the sealing of the documents.recognizing the legal untenability of arguing that all pages should remain sealed,defendant narrowed its list of papers it desired to have remain under seal.plaintiffs and real parties in interest have interposed no objection to the unsealing of any of the documents.we now conclude that none of the documents may remain sealed.the pages of exhibits are ordered returned to defense counsel.defendant shall have days to file any documents it desires but they may not be filed under seal.
ii.procedural history 
on december,plaintiffs,winterthur swiss insurance company,paul international uk limited,turegum insurance company,stronghold insurance company limited,excess insurance company limited,compagnie belge generale,cna reinsurance of london,and underwriters at lloyd,london severally subscribing liability insurance policy numbers,and,filed a declaratory relief complaint against defendant and codefendants,yasuda fire marine insurance company,and the dominion insurance company limited.plaintiffs alleged defendant had demanded they provide insurance coverage for claims arising from chemicals in the groundwater near a former manufacturing site located at west foothill boulevard in azusa,california defend certain toxic tort actions pending in the respondent court represent it in negotiations with the environmental protection agency as well as state and local authorities concerning remediation of the baldwin park operable unit of the san gabriel superfund site defend it in connection with a federal superfund lawsuit and indemnify it for costs and expenses associated with the san gabriel superfund site.further,it was alleged defendant was involved in negotiations with the environmental protection agency over cleanup at the san gabriel superfund site.in june,the environmental protection agency was alleged to have issued an administrative order to defendant and other entities to develop a cleanup plan.defendant was alleged to have made payments of in connection with the superfund site negotiations.
defendant purchased primary and excess third party insurance policies.plaintiffs acknowledged that they had issued excess third party insurance policies naming defendant as an insured.in june,defendant demanded that plaintiffs provide a defense and indemnification in connection with administrative proceedings and litigation concerning the alleged spills.plaintiffs alleged after reviewing defendant documents and discussing defendant claim with its representatives,plaintiffs responded to defendant demand by letter dated july.in that letter,plaintiffs reviewed the available facts,described the relevant policy terms and conditions,and advised defendant of their determination that they did not have any obligation to provide a defense and,as presented by defendant,that they had no obligation to indemnify defendant for any sum relating to the aforementioned claims.there had been an exchange of correspondence concerning the litigation and a new toxic tort action had been filed against defendant.based on these facts,plaintiffs sought a declaration,in part because defendant primary insurance coverage had not yet been exhausted,that they had no duty to defend lawsuits and various administrative actions indemnify defendant in the lawsuits or administrative proceedings and indemnify defendant in the lawsuits.to date,defendant has not answered the complaint.
on october,defendant and all other parties filed in the respondent court a stipulation for a protective order.the protective order stipulation was to apply to another case as well as the present one.in the other case,defendant sued of its insurers.huffy corporation chicago insurance,no.the present case and case no.were deemed to be related cases pursuant to the respondent court local rule f 
the stipulation provided there was a dispute between defendant and its insurers defendant contended that its insurers provided excess coverage to its primary policies defendant insurers contended that they had no such excess coverage duties document production demands had been exchanged and it was anticipated future discovery requests would be served.the stipulation further provided t he parties agree that the information exchanged between the parties and the discovery requests in this action in the related case may,in some instances,seek confidential business information,including but not limited to commercial information about the parties operations methodologies,business strategies,invoices for legal and consulting services,trade secrets or trade sensitive information,confidential research,propriety commercial or financial information sensitive or private information,including agreements or other writings pertaining to joint defense,work product or privileges hereinafter collectively referred to as protected information all of which the parties wish to be governed by this protective order the stipulation set forth the procedure by which documents would be subject to the protective order.when a party reasonably and in good faith believed a document qualified as protected information under the terms of the stipulation,it could be subject to the protective order.all that was necessary for a party under these circumstances to make a document subject to the protective order was to stamp it confidential.the stipulation set forth similar ways to make magnetic media,physical exhibits,and deposition testimony subject to the protective order.the stipulation also identified how derivative information adduced from documents and other data subject to the protective order was to remain confidential.
the october,stipulation further imposed nondisclosure duties on the parties to the present lawsuit and the related case.the stipulation stated in part,protected information shall disclosed or made available only to the court including its employees and the jury,to counsel for a party including the paralegal,clerical,and secretarial staff employed by such counsel,and to qualified persons the stipulation identified in some detail those persons who could be given access to the documents and they included employees,consultants,mediators,court reporters,videographers,and witnesses.there were other aspects of the october,stipulation which are not directly pertinent to the issue before us.
in terms of the issue before us,the crucial provisions of the october,stipulation relate to the filing of law and motion documents in the respondent court.at one point,the stipulation states,i t is the intent of the parties that this protective order apply to this action and to the related cases and cover any exchanges of material resulting from discovery request served in this action and the related case,and related law and motion proceedings in this action the related case.italics added.at another point,the october,stipulation describes how law and motion papers are to be filed under seal filing under seal.protected information may be submitted to the court only in connection with this action or the related action,and only as follows a a party who lodges or files any document containing protected information shall do so in a sealed envelope,or otherwise in accordance with local or state rules,including but not limited to rule of court section et,governing the filing of materials under seal.b the envelope shall bear the caption of this case on a legend as follows subject to court order.the papers contained in this envelope have been designated protected information,are subject to a protective order issued by the court,and may not be examined,displayed,revealed,or copied except by the court,or pursuant to court order.c no such sealed material shall be opened except for use by the judge or jury hearing the matter and solely for such use.following such use,the material shall be resealed.this order shall not prevent the use by any party of protected information at trial,subject to rules to be established by the court.the stipulation further provided that even if protected materials were used at trial,the parties retained the duty to maintain confidentiality.original italics,underscore and capitalization.
the stipulation was executed by defendant counsel as well as by the attorneys for the other parties in this and the related case.the respondent court signed the stipulation under the words,it is so ordered.no findings were made by the respondent court as required by california rules of court,rule d through e 
on may,defendant filed its mandate petition.the mandate petition,which contains extensive references to sealed documents,was not filed under seal.accompanying defendant mandate petition were pages of exhibits,all of which were filed under seal.as noted previously,under the terms of the october,stipulation,if a law and motion document refers to sealed document,the papers must be filed in the respondent court under seal.because the documents were filed under seal in the respondent court,the clerk of this court was required to file them under seal.rule c we reviewed the documents noting that among the papers were copies of notices of motion,proofs of service,copies of opinions readily available on the internet and in law libraries,and points and authorities which discussed well established rules of insurance coverage law.as permitted by rule f,we directed the parties to explain why any or all of the documents should remain sealed.
in response to our order,and recognizing it was legally untenable to argue all pages should remain sealed,defendant has submitted a request to seal portions of documents and the entirety of one agreement.the documents defendant seeks to seal consist of portions of its motion its separate statement of undisputed facts in support of its motion its supporting declarations and other evidence in support of its motion plaintiffs opposition to its motion plaintiffs opposition separate statement its opposition to plaintiff motion its opposition separate statement to plaintiffs motion interrogatory answers filed by it in opposition to plaintiffs motion its opposition separate statement to plaintiffs motion a declaration filed by one of its employees which is part of the evidence filed in opposition to its motion legal analysis appearing in plaintiffs reply memorandum in response to its motion and plaintiffs reply separate statement.defendant also seeks to seal the entirety of its settlement agreement with one of its primary insurers.the primary insurer is not a party to the present case.
the grounds asserted for sealing the foregoing documents is as follows the documents that defendant requests remain under seal contain information that may harm defendant business interests,privacy rights,and,if disclosed,would violate confidentiality agreements with numerous third parties and impinge upon the and attorney work product privileges.specifically,defendant is a party to two confidentiality agreements in a separate matter relating to the settlement of four environmental lawsuits.defendant is also a member of a joint defense group in the fourteen pending toxic tort lawsuits.these lawsuits are discussed at length in the mandate petition.the importance of the confidentiality agreements and the joint defense group can not be understated.the two separate confidentiality agreements relating to the settlement of the four environmental lawsuits were necessary in order for parties to agree to fund the joint groundwater supply project benefiting the entire san gabriel valley.the confidential joint defense agreement in the toxic tort lawsuits has financially enabled defendant,and many other parties,to adequately defend against claims brought by thousands of plaintiffs while some of those defendants,including defendant,fund the groundwater and up in that area.the e xhibits that defendant seeks to have remain under seal contain information that is subject to the confidentiality agreements joint defense agreement in the underlying lawsuits.the joint defense agreement is not one of the documents plaintiff seeks to have sealed.nor is the joint defense agreement an exhibit in this case.additionally,plaintiff argued that certain portions of the documents contained confidential attorney information relating to a former facility.further,defendant contended,the information reflects defendant counsel evaluation of the case by revealing the identity of the witness with knowledge of events that defendant counsel deemed relevant and important to this case.
iii.discussion 
disclosure principles 
the present case involves the question of whether to allow documents filed in support of the mandate petition to remain sealed.we addressed this issue in related circumstances in universal city studios,superior court th,where the trial court had refused to seal documents and the defendant sought to compel their sealing.in universal city studios,we concluded none of the documents the defendant sought to seal could be sealed given controlling california law.we described the controlling legal authority as follows in nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,d,the california supreme court identified the constitutional requirements applicable to a request to seal court records as follows b efore substantive courtroom proceedings are closed or transcripts are ordered sealed,a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.original italics fns.omitted.in terms of trial courts,the judicial council promulgated rules and which govern sealing requests in the trial courts in order to comply with the constitutional standards set forth in the nbc subsidiary decision.in re providian credit card cases th,fn.d jud.council of,advisory com,reprinted at pt.west,rules supp.foll.rule.for reviewing courts,the judicial council promulgated rule.as in the case of rules and,rule was adopted in response to the nbc subsidiary decision.jud.council of,advisory com,reprinted at pt.west,rules supp.foll.rule.universal city studios,superior court,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
b.the respondent court sealing order 
before proceeding to analysis of the merits of defendant modified sealing request,we address the effect of the respondent court order that any law and motion papers must be filed in their entirety under seal when they refer to a document the parties had deemed confidential.in the decision of in re providian credit card cases,supra,th at pages,d,the court of appeal held that a trial court order unsealing records must be reviewed for an abuse of discretion.the present case involves a different question.we are not directly reviewing the respondent court sealing order.we are not ordering the respondent court to change its stipulated sealing order.rather,we are addressing the question of whether this court records must be made available to the public given the showing made by defendant.we are proceeding pursuant to rule f which permits us to unseal records which were sealed in the trial court.see fn,ante.because these are records maintained by the clerk of this court,we engage in independent review of that matter.
the respondent court order is entitled to no weight on this issue.the respondent court order seals the entirety of any law and motion papers which refer to a document deemed confidential by the parties which is disclosed as part of the discovery process.no findings were made by the respondent court.the sealing order therefore fails to comply with the findings requirements set identified in nbc
