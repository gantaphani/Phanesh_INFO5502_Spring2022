at issue in this appeal is whether defendant american family mutual insurance afm had a duty to defend and indemnify its insured,plaintiff david cidrillo pompa,with respect to a action brought against him.afm argues that pompa plea of guilty to negligent homicide for the conduct that gave rise to the action triggers the exclusion in his homeowner insurance policy.pompa counters that the exclusion applies only to a conviction after trial,that public policy bars the exclusion,and that colorado law does not permit consideration of his conviction in determining the duty to defend when the complaint makes no mention of it.we reject pompa arguments and affirm the judgment of the district court that afm had no duty to defend or indemnify pompa.
background 
in september pompa and steven domianus had an altercation that resulted in domianus death.pompa pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide in may.domianus heirs then filed a action against pompa in colorado state court.pompa,a holder of homeowner insurance with afm,requested it to defend the civil action.afm,relying on the and exclusions in pompa insurance policy,denied that it owed pompa a duty of defense or indemnification.a judgment was entered against pompa in the amount of,plus costs.pompa,unable to satisfy the judgment,then entered into a settlement agreement with domianus heirs in which he agreed to bring an action against afm and assign to them the bulk of the proceeds he obtained.
pompa filed an action in colorado state court against afm,alleging breach of contract,willful breach of contract,and breach of insurance contract.afm removed the suit to the united states district court for the district of colorado under and filed a motion for summary judgment,claiming that under the policy exclusion it had no duty to defend pompa.that exclusion provides that afm will not cover bodily injury or property damage arising out of violation of any criminal law for which any insured is convicted.at.the defense provision of the contract states that afm will provide a defense at its expense i f a suit is brought against any insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this policy applies.id.at.
pompa responded with three arguments why the exclusion did not apply.first,he contended that the exclusion applies only when the insured has been convicted by a jury.he argued that the phrase for which any insured is convicted is ambiguous because it could be referring only to convictions obtained after trial,as opposed to those obtained through guilty pleas,and that any ambiguity had to be resolved in favor of coverage.second,he contended that applying the exclusion would violate public policy because virtually any act creating liability could be prosecuted as a criminal offense,depending on the exercise of discretion by the prosecutor.third,he argued that the complaint rule,which holds that the determination of an insurer duty to defend must be based solely on the allegations of the complaint,precluded the court from considering his conviction for negligent homicide because the complaint did not allege that he had been convicted of any crime.the district court rejected these arguments and granted summary judgment to afm.pompa renews these three arguments on appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard that governs the district court.see simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.the parties agree that there are no factual disputes and that we must apply the substantive law of colorado.as we shall see,the colorado supreme court has not addressed the specific issues raised in this appeal,so we must predict how that court would rule.see rash intermediate,cir where the state highest court has not addressed the issue presented,the federal court must determine what decision the state court would make if faced with the same facts and issue.internal quotation marks omitted.
interpretation of the exclusion 
pompa argues that the exclusion is ambiguous because the word convicted has two meanings.he acknowledges that it could refer to any conviction,whether obtained by guilty plea or after trial,but contends that it could also refer only to convictions after a trial.the district court erred,he asserts,in choosing the more expansive interpretation over his reasonable narrower interpretation.we disagree.
colorado law requires that ambiguities in an insurance policy be construed in favor of the insured,state farm mut.auto.ins.stein.the prerequisite to application of this rule is a determination that the policy is ambiguous.terms used in a contract are ambiguous when they are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation.hecla mining ins.the mere fact that the parties disagree on the meaning of a term does not establish ambiguity.see cas.great sw.fire ins.nor can a policy term be read in isolation to create an ambiguity in the policy as a whole where none exists.union ins.houtz.in construing a term,a court should ascertain what a person of ordinary intelligence would understand the term to mean,stein,at,giving words their plain meaning according to common usage.allstate ins.starke.
to support their interpretations of the word conviction,both parties quote dictionary definitions.afm offers the act or process of judicially finding someone guilty of a crime the state of having been proved guilty.black law dictionary ed.pompa,in turn,points to in a general sense,the result of a criminal trial which ends in a judgment or sentence that the accused is guilty as charged.black law dictionary ed.he asserts that his definition appearance in a leading legal dictionary compels the conclusion that his interpretation is reasonable and the term thus ambiguous.dictionaries,however,are imperfect yardsticks of ambiguity.new castle county hartford accident indem,cir.a word may take on a variety of meanings in different contexts.dictionaries can inform us of all the accepted meanings,but not which of those meanings fits in a particular context.as one court perceptively observed 
the mere fact that a word has more than one dictionary meaning,or that the parties disagree about the meaning,does not necessarily make the word ambiguous if the court concludes that only one meaning applies in the context and comports with the parties objectively reasonable expectations.thus it is inappropriate to create ambiguity by simply finding two different dictionary definitions of a word dictionary definitions can shed only partial light on the reasonable understanding of an insured with regard to words in the context of a particular insurance policy.
sprangers greatway ins,citation and footnote omitted.in particular,construction of a potentially ambiguous term in an provision requires consideration of the purpose of the provision.see branscum am.cmty.mut.ins,a court should consider the purpose of a policy in construing a policy term.
the undoubted purpose of the exclusion is to avoid extending coverage to liability stemming from acts that the government has decided to prosecute criminally and has prosecuted successfully.there would be no reason for the afm policy to distinguish between a conviction obtained by a guilty plea and a conviction obtained after a trial.pompa argues that an insured who is innocent of a crime may decide to plead guilty to a lesser offense rather than face the risk of being convicted of a more serious crime.but we are not persuaded that an insurer,or even an insured,would think that a guilty plea is so much less reliable than a trial verdict that a plea should be treated differently than a verdict for purposes of this policy exclusion.
pompa sole case support for the distinction consists of decisions that distinguish between a guilty plea and a conviction at trial when resolving whether issue preclusion applies in a later civil case.see generally state farm fire cas.fullerton,cir listing cases.the underlying rationale for issue preclusion,however,rests not so much on views regarding reliability as on concerns about excessive use of judicial resources a party that has actually litigated an issue should not be given an extra bite at the apple.thus,a party that has stipulated to a fact in a civil case which would ordinarily be an indication that the fact is indisputable is not barred by doctrine from challenging the fact in later litigation because it has not yet actually litigated the issue.see restatement second of judgments cmt.e.the point in the cases relied upon by pompa is not that one who pleads guilty is not convicted of the crime rather,it is that guilt was not actually litigated to arrive at the conviction,just as a stipulated fact was not actually litigated to arrive at a civil judgment.see,rawling city of new haven,plea is not entitled to effect because a plea is not the product of actual litigation aetna cas.sur.niziolek,n o issue is actually litigated since the defendant declines to contest his guilt in any way.brackets and internal quotation marks omitted restatement second of judgments cmt b similar.in any event,none of the cases cited by pompa states that a guilty plea is not a conviction.
not only has pompa failed to provide a reason why the insurance company would want to exclude guilty pleas from the definition of convicted in the policy,but he has made no effort to show why an insured would prefer the more limited definition in acquiring the policy.to be sure,the narrower definition could result in coverage that would otherwise be excluded.consider,however,the quandary in which that definition would place an insured accused of a crime.the pressure to plead guilty escalates when the insured knows that he will not receive insurance protection if he opts for a trial of the criminal charges and is convicted.for example,the desire to preserve his reputation could be overborne by a feeling of responsibility toward the economic of his family.we doubt that a potential purchaser of the policy would be particularly pleased to learn that if he is charged with a crime,all he would need to do to preserve coverage is plead guilty.
there being only one reasonable interpretation of the word convicted in this policy,we conclude that the district court did not err in holding that the policy unambiguously excluded coverage for the conduct for which pompa pleaded guilty.
public policy 
pompa next argues that even if the exclusion is not ambiguous,it nonetheless violates public policy.an exclusion that encompasses negligent conduct,he contends,defeats the reasonable expectations of the insured as to coverage because the purpose of purchasing liability insurance is to shield against liability arising from negligent acts and most negligent acts are a violation of some criminal law.he asserts that it is contrary to public policy to allow an exclusion that eviscerate s coverage for such a large class of otherwise covered negligent acts.aplt.br.at.we are not persuaded.
to begin with,to the extent that pompa asserts that his crime was one of simple negligence,he is incorrect.the offense was criminally negligent homicide,which is defined as caus ing the death of another person by conduct amounting to criminal negligence.ann.under colorado law,a person acts with criminal negligence when,through a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise,he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result will occur or that a circumstance exists.id.thus,criminally negligent homicide requires a failure to perceive,through a gross deviation from the standard of reasonable care,a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death will result from certain conduct.people shaw.simple negligence will not suffice.
moreover,pompa argument is not supported by colorado case law.ordinarily,limitations on insurance coverage are acceptable.see proprietors ins.colorado courts have held only two types of exclusions in insurance policies to violate public policy.one is exclusions that attempt to dilute,condition,or limit statutorily mandated coverage.farmers ins.exch.dotson,internal quotation marks omitted.but pompa has not pointed to any colorado statute that proscribes a exclusion or that mandates coverage for acts covered by such an exclusion.
the second type consists of exclusions that render coverage illusory,in effect allow ing the insurer to receive premiums when realistically it is not incurring any risk of liability,at.the court suggested that a provision in an aircraft insurance policy that denied coverage if an accident occurred while the aircraft was in violation of any federal aviation administration faa regulation might violate public policy.such a provision would eliminate any risk of liability because it is virtually impossible for a plane crash to occur without violating at least one faa regulation.see id.likewise,an exclusion that nullified coverage for all negligent acts would strip coverage from essentially every case in which liability might arise.but the exclusion leaves the vast majority of otherwise covered conduct,all negligent acts for which the insured is not criminally convicted.indeed,the colorado court of appeals upheld a provision excluding coverage for criminal acts because it did not eviscerate the grant clause,but merely exclude d a reasonable subset of resulting from criminal acts.allstate ins.juniel.see also horace mann ins.peters,exclusion did not nullify all of policy coverage.
accordingly,we conclude that a colorado court would not find afm exclusion to be void as contrary to public policy.
c.the complaint rule 
finally,pompa contends that the district court erred in considering a fact extrinsic to the,his conviction of negligent reject his claim that afm had a duty to defend him in the litigation.his contention derives from a doctrine variously called the complaint rule,the comparison test,the four corners rule,or the eight corners rule referring to both the complaint and the policy.under the complaint rule,the insurer duty to defend is determined by examination of solely the policy and the complaint.
the complaint rule applies only when the insurer has failed to provide a defense throughout the underlying litigation.when the insurer has provided that defense presumably under a reservation of rights and then seeks to recover defense costs from the insured,the insurer may rely on facts outside of the complaint to show that the incident resulting in liability was not covered by the policy.cotter am.empire surplus lines ins,emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.but if the insurer wishes to avoid the cost of a defense before the underlying litigation has by simply refusing to defend or by bringing a declaratory judgment action while the litigation is duty to defend is determined under the complaint rule.see id.at.that determination is made as follows 
an insurer duty to defend arises when the underlying complaint against the insurer alleges any facts that might fall within the coverage of the policy.the actual liability of the insured to the claimant is not the criterion which places upon the insurance company the obligation to defend.rather,the obligation to defend arises from allegations in the complaint,which if sustained,would impose a liability covered by the policy.where the insurer duty to defend is not apparent from the pleadings in the case against the insured,but the allegations do state a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage,or there is some doubt as to whether a theory of recovery within the policy coverage has been pleaded,the insurer must accept the defense of the claim.

the colorado supreme court has articulated two reasons for adopting the complaint rule.first,the rule protects the insured legitimate expectation of a defense.id.at quoting hecla,at.because of that legitimate expectation,the risk of the uncertainty of coverage should fall on the insurer.that is,the insured should not have to bear the burden of advancing the costs of defense just because there is a possibil
