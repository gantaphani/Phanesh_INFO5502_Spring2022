mary pat rooks,a registered nurse,purchased professional liability insurance from american casualty of reading,pennsylvania acc with a policy limit of million per occurrence.she also qualified as an insured under a policy issued by health care indemnity,hci to her employer with a limit of million per occurrence.in may she was named as a defendant in a action filed in oklahoma state court,and she sought coverage under both policies.this litigation concerns the apportionment of liability between the two insurers.
that apportionment depends on the nature of the two policies.the pertinent definitions were provided by the oklahoma supreme court in equity mutual insurance spring valley wholesale nursery,
primary coverage is provided when,under the terms of the policy,the insurer is liable without regard to any other insurance coverage available.excess coverage or secondary coverage is provided when,under the terms of the policy,the insurer is liable for a loss only after any primary been exhausted an escape clause,also known as a no liability clause,disclaims any and all liability if other insurance is available.
footnotes omitted.the district court held that both policies provided excess coverage to rooks for professional liability,and that the acc policy did not have an escape clause.applying the doctrine of equitable contribution,the court ruled that each insurer should pay its share of both the underlying loss and the defense costs.we affirm,agreeing with the court characterization of the policies and the application of equitable contribution.
the acc policy coverage agreement is what would be expected for primary coverage.it states 
we will pay all amounts up to the limit of liability which you become legally obligated to pay as a result of injury or damage.in addition to the limit of liability,we will also pay claim expenses.the injury or damage must be caused by a medical incident arising out of the supplying of,or failure to supply,professional services by you,or by anyone for whose professional acts or omissions you are legally responsible.
vol.at.the relevant limit of liability provision also reads as it would in a primary policy 
each claim 
the limit of liability stated on the certificate of insurance for each claim is the limit of our liability for all injury or damage arising out of,or in connection with,the same or related medical incident.
id.at.so does the defense and settlement clause 
we have the right and will defend any claim.we will 
do this even if any of the charges of the claim are groundless,false or fraudulent and 
investigate and settle any claim,as we feel appropriate.
our payment of the limit of liability ends our duty to defend or settle.we have no duty to defend any claims not covered by this policy.
id.at.the other insurance clause,however,which precedes the above policy provisions,limits coverage when other insurance applies 
any loss resulting from any claim insured under any other insurance policy or risk transfer instrument,including but not limited to,retentions,deductibles,or other alternative arrangements,which applies to this loss,shall be paid first by those instruments,policies or other arrangements.this insurance will not serve as primary insurance where there is other applicable insurance.it is the intent of this policy to apply only to loss which is more than the total limit of all deductibles,limits of liability,amounts or other valid and collectible insurance or risk transfer arrangements,whether primary,contributory,excess,contingent,or otherwise.this insurance will not contribute with any other applicable insurance.in no event will we pay more than our limit of liability.
these provisions do not apply to other insurance policies or risk transfer arrangements written as specific excess insurance over the limits of liability of this policy.
the hci policy insuring agreements,like acc coverage agreement,suggests primary coverage 
hci will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to which the policy applies,caused by an occurrence that is,an act or omission arising out of the provision of health care services during the policy period.
vol.at see id.at defining occurrence.the provision also states that hci shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking such damages even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless,false,or fraudulent.id.at.unlike acc provision,however,the hci limits of liability section includes language limiting coverage when there is other insurance 
i n any state or country where there exists a state fund or where other primary insurance has been purchased for purpose of providing compensation for patient injury and for which application has been made and for which coverage is included in this policy,the limits of liability shall apply excess over any other valid and collectible insurance.
id.at.the policy other insurance clause repeats the point 
if other insurance not afforded by the company is available to any insured covering an occurrence also covered hereunder,the insurance afforded hereunder shall be excess of and not contribute with such other insurance.amounts collectible under a trust plan or any other program are other insurance for the purposes of this policy.this article vi,paragraph,does not apply to excess insurance written specifically to be in excess of this policy.nothing contained herein shall be construed to make this policy subject to terms,conditions,and limitations of any other insurance.
acc and hci disagreed about their respective obligations under their policies.acc filed a action in the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma,claiming that the loss and expenses should be split between acc and hci on a basis.hci responded that it provided excess coverage only that the acc policy,whose clause was an escape clause rather than an clause,provided primary coverage and that therefore acc was not entitled to a contribution from hci.
on for summary judgment,the district court concluded that both policies provided excess coverage,that the clauses in the policies were irreconcilable,and that the indemnity payments and defense costs must therefore be shared on a pro rata basis according to the ratio each respective policy limit bears to the cumulative limit of all concurrent policies that is,hci is liable for of defense costs and indemnity payments and acc is liable for the remaining.id.at quoting equity mutual,at.hci appeals.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same legal standard that the district court was required to use.see carpenter boeing,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the parties agree that their dispute is governed by the substantive law of oklahoma.see stickley state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.
proration of liability 
if two policies cover the same risk for the same insured,but neither provides primary coverage,an excess clause controls over an escape clause and conflicting other insurance clauses cancel each other,equity mutual,at,with the loss shared by the insurers on a pro rata basis,id.at.
the district court interpreted both the hci and acc policies as providing only excess coverage.there is no dispute on appeal that this is a proper description of the hci policy.but hci challenges that description of the acc policy.it contends that acc policy was a primary policy.it argues that unlike its policy,the only language in acc policy that limits coverage when another policy applies is language buried in its clause.aplt.br.at.alternatively,it argues that the limiting language in the acc policy is an escape clause.following oklahoma law regarding construction of insurance policies,we disagree.
an insurance policy is to be treated as a contract and will be enforced according to its terms.equity mutual,at.under oklahoma l
