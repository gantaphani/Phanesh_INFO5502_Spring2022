this appeal arises out of a by the city of watsonville city against respondents patrick and jill corrigan and michael tansy,who were partners in developing and marketing residential properties in watsonville.the trial court ruled that respondents had no duty to reimburse the city for the costs and fees it had incurred in defending the underlying action,because the city had failed to tender its defense to respondents.on appeal,the city contends that tender was not a prerequisite for reimbursement under the parties indemnity agreement,under statutory and case law,and under the circumstances presented in this case.we agree that the contract,construed in accordance with civil code section,did not require tender,and we therefore must reverse the judgment.
background 
in early and three sets of plaintiffs sued multiple defendants,including respondents and the city,for damages related to soil instability and landslides on the property they had bought from respondents or other defendants.the causes of action against the city contained allegations of negligent maintenance of its property,nuisance,and inverse condemnation.the city against respondents,among others,seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of contract and failure to maintain the property.the city specific allegations against respondents consisted of contractual indemnity for the city defense costs and any judgment that might result.the city further alleged breach of an agreement by respondents and other to have the city named as an insured in their liability and policies.
these cases were consolidated for trial,and eventually the plaintiffs arrived at a settlement with the city and respondents.the court ordered that all claims for indemnity or contribution be dismissed,except for those seeking express indemnity.on january,by stipulation,the indemnification issues between the city and respondents were bifurcated for trial.
at the trial on february,the city sought to recover,the amount of the settlement that farmers insurance had paid to the plaintiffs on the city behalf the city also claimed the costs and attorney fees it had incurred in defending the lawsuits respondents argued that the city had suffered no damages and lacked standing even to raise the issue of reimbursement,as it had made no settlement payment to the plaintiffs.as to attorney fees,respondents maintained that civil code section,subdivision,obligated them to defend the city if asked,but if no request was made,then the city could conduct its own defense at its own expense and recover only whatever it had paid by way of settlement or judgment.
the superior court ruled that the city had a duty to request a defense under the duty to defend provision of the indemnification agreement.having made a conscious decision not to use tansy or the corrigans counsel,the city was not then entitled to pass the defense bill on to the indemnitors.the court also determined apparently adopting the rationale advanced by respondents that the paid to plaintiffs by farmers insurance was not recoverable.in the ensuing judgment,the court concluded that respondents owed nothing to the city and dismissed the city against respondents.
the city urges reversal of the judgment on multiple grounds.we need address only the first,as it is dispositive of the appeal.
discussion 
the city primary argument is that the parties indemnity agreement,construed in accordance with civil code section and applicable case law,did not require the city to tender its defense or otherwise give notice of the claim to respondents in order for them to be accountable for the costs of the city defense.rather,the only effect the failure to tender has on the city indemnity claim is that it affects the burden of proof on the issue.
section sets forth rules that guide the construction of contracts of indemnity.these rules are as much a part of an indemnity agreement as those set out therein,unless a contrary intention appears.gribaldo,jacobs,jones associates agrippina versicherunges cal d,gribaldo see also goodman severin d.indemnitee may not recover the expenses of his defense unless the agreement so provides or unless there is pleading and proof which brings the claim therefor within the provisions of subdivision,section.if,however,the agreement indicates a contrary intention of the parties,the interpretive rules in section are not controlling on that point.
as relevant here,the statute provides.upon an indemnity against liability,expressly,or in other equivalent terms,the person indemnified is entitled to recover upon becoming liable.upon an indemnity against claims,or demands,or damages,or costs,expressly,or in other equivalent terms,the person indemnified is not entitled to recover without payment thereof.an indemnity against claims,or demands,or liability,expressly,or in other equivalent terms,embraces the costs of defense against such claims,demands,or liability incurred in good faith,and in the exercise of a reasonable discretion.the person indemnifying is bound,on request of the person indemnified,to defend actions or proceedings brought against the latter in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity,but the person indemnified has the right to conduct such defenses,if he chooses to do so.if,after request,the person indemnifying neglects to defend the person indemnified,a recovery against the latter suffered by him in good faith,is conclusive in his favor against the former.if the person indemnifying,whether he is a principal or a surety in the agreement,has not reasonable notice of the action or proceeding against the person indemnified,or is not allowed to control its defense,judgment against the latter is only presumptive evidence against the former 
at issue here are two agreements describing the improvement projects to be performed by respondents.the first,executed in july between patrick corrigan and the city,required corrigan,as developer,to hold the city harmless from any claims for damage resulting from the project operations.it further stated that corrigan shall defend the city from any lawsuits based on such claims the agreement between the city and both patrick corrigan and michael tansy collectively called developer similarly stated that developer shall defend,indemnify and hold city harmless from damage claims and shall defend the city from lawsuits arising from project operations.
the city contends that the plain language of these two agreements,construed as they must be under the rules of interpretation set forth in civil code,as well as the case law regarding interpretation of such agreements,establish es that there was no need for the city to tender its defense to respondents for reimbursement to be required.the city points out that the indemnity language is very simple and does not state anything to the contrary to.the city therefore we section is applicable without any contractual modification.
in his trial briefs tansy agreed with the city that nothing in the agreements indicated an intention contrary to section,subdivision.tansy faulted the city for failing to distinguish between the duty to indemnify and the duty to defend.in tansy view,the city was free to conduct its own defense,in accordance with subdivision,but if it chose to do that,it was then obligated to bear the cost.corrigan argued that the same rules should be applied in this case as in insurance cases,where the duty to defend commences upon tender of the defense.he relied on gribaldo,supra,cal d,in asserting that section,subdivision,prohibits a party from recovering defense costs without first requesting that the other party furnish a defense.
on appeal,respondents adhere to the position that gribaldo,together with general principles applicable in insurance contexts,compels a construction of section to allow defense costs to an indemnitee only after he or she first requests a defense.we can not agree.indemnity agreements are not construed like liability insurance policies.the liability insurer receives a premium for protecting its insured against damage or liability from generally defined risks.heppler peters th,d.the insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured after
