background 
on september,kurt was driving a chevrolet suburban in which kirk was a passenger kurt lost control of the vehicle,causing it to roll over.kirk suffered a broken neck in the accident and was rendered a quadriplegic.kurt sustained a broken wrist.
at the time of the accident,kurt and the suburban were insured under an automobile liability insurance policy issued by liberty mutual,policy no.the policy.the policy provided state minimum liability limits and basic pip coverage.bannister purchased the policy after meeting with doug maxey,a liberty mutual sales representative,on march.bannister and maxey met for approximately thirty minutes at bannister workplace.during the course of the meeting,bannister completed an automobile policy application and the fourth page of a colorado pip coverage options disclosure form pip disclosure form.the latter form states in pertinent part 
you may elect to purchase an added pip medical expenses option,and sic added pip work loss option,or a combination of these two options applying to you and any family member for a reasonable increase in premium.if you elect either of the following,the per person limit of benefits is increased to per person for any one accident.
appellants app.at.bannister declined each of the apip options and signed at the bottom of the page.
at the end of the meeting,maxey gave bannister a thick folder of documents for her review.at her deposition,bannister testified she could not recall what specific documents were contained in the folder.at his deposition,maxey testified he could not recall bannister folder specifically but always provided applicants with the pip disclosure form,not just the signature page,and the colorado automobile insurance summary disclosure form summary disclosure form.
following brennan farmers alliance mutual insurance company,liberty mutual issued its pip endorsement,which specified the apip benefits available for purchase extended to pedestrians and guest occupants.liberty mutual claims it sent the pip endorsement to kurt and bannister in february or march along with the renewal documents for the policy,but did not submit evidence to the district court to establish the fact of mailing 
on september,appellants filed a complaint against liberty mutual seeking declaratory relief and reformation on the ground its offer of apip benefits violated caara.they also alleged breach of contract,statutory and common law bad faith breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
liberty mutual filed a motion for summary judgment arguing appellants were not entitled to reformation because it made a statutorily compliant offer of apip benefits.it argued if appellants were entitled to reformation,the apip benefits should be subject to a aggregate cap.
appellants filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing they were entitled to reformation because liberty mutual offer of apip benefits violated three provisions of caara.a repealed effective july,which states the insurer must provide a written explanation of all available pip coverage prior to issuing a policy,which states the insurer must provide a summary disclosure form to the insured at the point of sale and.a,which requires every insurer to offer enhanced benefits for inclusion in a complying policy,in addition to the basic coverages at the option of the named insured.they also claimed the offer was insufficient under allstate insurance company parfrey,
the district court granted liberty mutual motion for summary judgment and denied appellants motion for partial summary judgment.warren liberty mut.fire ins,d.the court held liberty mutual offer of apip benefits did not violate a or because bannister received the pip disclosure form and the summary disclosure form at the point of sale.it also determined the offer did not violate parfrey because under the totality of the circumstances,defendant offer was reasonably calculated to permit bannister to make an informed decision.id.at quotations omitted.
the court did,however,hold liberty mutual offer violated a because the pip disclosure form did not offer apip benefits to guest occupants and pedestrians and there was insufficient evidence to establish kurt and bannister received the pip endorsement prior to the accident.nevertheless,it concluded appellants were not entitled to reformation because bannister was offered and declined apip benefits that would have covered both kirk and kurt.because appellants were not entitled to reformation,the court granted summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on appellants remaining claims.the court explained in the absence of a viable ground for reformation of the policy to incorporate a higher level of benefits,appellants have no valid basis for their remaining claims.id.at.
ii.discussion 
appellants contend the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of liberty mutual on their a,and parfrey claims,and denying reformation.liberty mutual contends we should affirm the district court denial of reformation because bannister was offered apip benefits that would have covered both kirk and kurt.in the alternative,liberty mutual argues we should affirm because it did not violate a.it claims it was not required to identify the specific categories of persons eligible for apip benefits under hill allstate ins,cir.it also argues it did not violate a because any defect in the pip disclosure form was remedied by the pip endorsement.appellants argue if the policy is reformed,the reformed policy should not be subject to a aggregate cap and their claims for breach of contract,willful and wanton statutory bad faith,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and common law bad faith should be reinstated.
we review an award of summary judgment de novo,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party.reid geico ins,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.if there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute,we then determine if the substantive law was correctly applied by the district court.osgood state farm mut.auto.ins,cir.since this case is grounded on diversity jurisdiction,the substantive law of colorado governs.blanke alexander,cir.
a,and parfrey 
appellants contend there was a material issue of fact regarding whether bannister received the pip disclosure form and the summary disclosure form at the point of sale,precluding summary judgment on their a,and parfrey claims.we disagree.maxey testified he routinely provided insurance applicants with the pip disclosure form and the summary disclosure form.testimony from an insurance agent that it was his usual practice to provide certain documents to insurance applicants constitutes relevant evidence that his conduct on the occasion he met with the insured was in conformity with that routine practice.morris travelers indem.of,cir.maxey testimony was uncontroverted by bannister testimony that she could not recall what documents she received.
even if the court had found an issue of fact regarding bannister receipt of the pip disclosure form and the summary disclosure form,liberty mutual would still have been entitled to summary judgment on appellants claim the offer of apip benefits violated a because the a requirement is inapplicable
