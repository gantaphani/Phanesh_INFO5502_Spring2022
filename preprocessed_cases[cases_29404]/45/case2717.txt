discussion 
on appeal from an order denying a motion under section,we engage in a process.first,we determine whether the defendant made a threshold showing that the cause of action triggers the statute.if this condition is met,we consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.we review each step of the process independently.jespersen th,d.
we begin by determining whether olaes cause of action arose from acts in furtherance of defendants right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b.nationwide bears the burden on this issue.gallimore state farm fire casualty ins.th,d.
as used in section,subdivision e,a protected act includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
to fall within the purview of section,nationwide must demonstrate that the speech olaes complains injured him falls within one of these four categories.weinberg feisel th,d weinberg.
the parties offer differing interpretations of the language of section,subdivision e defining a protected act as any written or oral statement made before,or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by,a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding or body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law.it is the latter clause,any other official proceeding authorized by law,that forms the heart of this dispute.nationwide contends its procedure for investigating employee sexual harassment complaints qualifies as an official proceeding authorized by law.defamatory statements made in the course of the proceeding are privileged.olaes claims a private workplace investigation is not an official proceeding as delineated by section.
to resolve this conflict,we must ascertain the meaning of official proceeding authorized by law as used in section.the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.in determining this intent,we first look to the language of the statute,giving effect to its plain meaning.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.heavenly valley el dorado county bd.of equalization th,d.we possess no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intent that is not expressed.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon.
in construing a statute,we give words their usual and ordinary meaning.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.we do not consider words in isolation,but consider all the statutory language and construe that language as a unified whole.shaddox bertani th,d.
helpfully,the supreme court and the statute itself provide us with the basic legislative intent underlying section.section codifies the legislature desire to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,a participation that should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to effectuate this goal,the legislature instructs that section shall be construed broadly,subd.a equilon,supra,cal th at,d.
with these precepts in mind,we turn to the language official proceeding authorized by law.nationwide argues the phrase under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law explicitly includes nongovernmental proceedings.in support,nationwide cites a definition of official as belonging or relating to the discharge of duties and authorized by a government.according to nationwide,its sexual harassment procedure is authorized and required by the legislature.
olaes counters with a definition of official as of or relating to a duty,charge,or position conferred by an exercise of governmental authority and for a public purpose.olaes argues the usual and ordinary meaning of official connotes governmental or public,not private or nongovernmental.
nationwide also contends the phrase any other official proceeding authorized by law as used in section,subdivision e and is meaningless and surplusage if it does not refer to private proceedings.according to nationwide,to give meaning to the phrase the statute must be construed to apply to nongovernmental proceedings.nationwide reads legislative,executive,or judicial as encompassing the entire universe of governmental,leaving nongovernmental proceedings as the other official proceedings authorized by law.
we find this construction tortuous at best and illogical at worst.section represents the legislature effort to protect and encourage participation in matters of public interest.defamation suits aimed at chilling speech on such matters run afoul of section and are subject to a motion to strike.the legislature carefully delineated the forums in which speech is to be encouraged and protected legislative,executive,or judicial proceedings,or any other official proceeding authorized by law.reading any other official proceeding in context reveals the legislature intended to protect speech concerning matters of public interest in a governmental forum,regardless of label.
our analysis of cases construing the phrase other official proceedings as used in civil code section,former subdivision now subdivision b bolsters this interpretation.prior to its amendment in,civil code section,subdivision b provided for an absolute privilege for publications made in any legislative or judicial proceeding,or in any other official proceeding authorized by law.in hackethal weissbein cal d,hackethal,the supreme court considered the phrase other official proceeding and determined the use of official was probably intended to deny application of the absolute privilege to nongovernmental proceedings.id.at.the court found statements made in a hospital peer review proceeding were not absolutely privileged.
in a dissent,justice tobriner urged that proceedings conducted by a medical peer review authority should be shielded by the privilege,because such proceedings were reviewable by administrative mandate.hackethal,supra,cal d at.following hackethal,the l
