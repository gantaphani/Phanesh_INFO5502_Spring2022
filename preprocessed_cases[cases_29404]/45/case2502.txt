factual and procedural background 
background 
this litigation is part of the aftermath of a fraudulent loan scheme by chl mortgage group,chl,now in chapter bankruptcy,and chl president laurence seidenfeld,who pleaded guilty to certain fraud offenses and is currently in federal prison.access is one of the victims of chl fraud.
access is a company that facilitates or warehouses real property loans for a short period between the time a mortgage broker originates a loan with a borrower and the time the mortgage broker sells the loan to an investor in the secondary mortgage market.chl,a mortgage broker that issued residential mortgage loans to individual borrowers,was a client of access between and pursuant to master repurchase agreements.
in the master repurchase agreement mra,chl agreed to originate mortgage loans to individual borrowers and then sell the loans to access.chl would obtain a promissory note and a deed of trust from the borrower as collateral for the loan,and then sell the note and assign the deed of trust to access.within a certain period of time,chl was required to repurchase the loan from access for sale and delivery to a predesignated investor in the secondary mortgage market.
chl was required to send certain mortgage documents to access,including the original mortgage note,endorsed in blank by chl,the original mortgage certified by the title company or closing agent to be a true copy of the original instrument sent for recording,an original mortgagee title insurance commitment for each mortgage securing each loan,with chl name,mortgagor name,title policy amount and loan amount correctly delineated in schedule a,paragraph one,no adverse liens,encroachments or overlapping of improvements and the inclusion of all valid schedules a,b,c and d and insuring provisions and an original mortgage assignment duly executed by chl in blank.
the mra also provided that at chl election,the purchase price for a loan could be funded by access issuing its own check or wire transfer directly to the title company or closing agent account on behalf of chl,provided that chl faxed to access all specified documents and access had verified to its satisfaction that chl and the title company or closing agent were in possession of all mortgage documents relating to the loan,and had agreed to deliver all items to access within three business days following the funding of the loan.if access provided funds to close a loan and the loan did not close,chl was required to arrange for the return of the funds to access promptly.
at issue here are two chl loans that access allegedly purchased pursuant to the mra.specifically,chl made one loan in the principal sum of to a borrower named martin esparza and one loan in the principal sum of was made to borrowers named ajmer and daljit gill.each promissory note in the principal sum of the loan from the named borrower to chl was secured by a deed of trust on real properties allegedly held by the named borrowers as owners.after agreeing to purchase the loans,access wired moneys directly to an escrow account created for the esparza loan by the alliance title company and an escrow account created for the gill loan by the ticor title company.at each loan closing,the escrow agents released the moneys as a payoff to chl,who was to use the moneys to refinance the named borrowers existing loans.first american issued title insurance policies for the mortgage loans with chl designated as the named insured.however,chl never disbursed any funds either directly to the named borrowers or otherwise used the funds to pay off any existing loans of the named borrowers 
while the promissory notes and trust deeds were in access possession,the named borrowers failed to make any payments to access,and chl failed to repurchase the notes and trust deeds regarding the esparza and gill loans as required by the mra.access,as for chl,recorded assignments of the esparza and gill deeds of trust.
access sought to recover its funds by foreclosing the mortgage purportedly securing the esparza loan after advising chl bankruptcy trustee of its intention to commence the foreclosure proceeding.the esparza property was sold for.access right to any money from the foreclosure sale has been challenged in a pending lawsuit commenced by hsbc mortgage services in contra costa county superior court.access tendered its claim for litigation defense costs in the hsbc case to first american,which has refused to defend access in that case.
access also commenced a proceeding to foreclose the mortgage purportedly securing the gill loan.that proceeding was aborted after access received the gills affidavit declaring they had not signed the promissory note or the deed of trust,and they threatened litigation if access proceeded with the foreclosure.the gills commenced an action to quiet title against access on the ground that the loan documents were forgeries.access tendered its claim for litigation defense costs in the gill case to first american,which has refused to defend access in that case.
litigation under review 
in the litigation before us,first american sought declaratory relief that it had no duty under its title insurance policies issued to chl to defend or indemnify access,on several grounds,including that access did not meet the definition of an insured under the policies.access answered first american complaint,and filed a third amended,the operative pleading,seeking declaratory relief regarding its rights under the policies.access alleged it was chl assignee,and,and therefore,was an insured under the policies.access also sought monetary damages for breach of contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing based upon first american refusal to reimburse access for its losses and litigation defense costs.
first american and access filed competing motions for summary judgment and adjudication to resolve the parties rights and obligations under the policies.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of first american,declaring that the title insurer had no duty to defend or indemnify access.the court held that access was not an insured and therefore,it was not entitled to coverage under the policies.the court dismissed access request for declaratory relief and its causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing relating to the esparza and gill loans.access then voluntarily dismissed with prejudice the remaining causes of action in its third amended.access timely appeals from the judgment entered in favor of first american.

the legislature has carved out three classes of insurance to cover land title insurance,mortgage insurance,and mortgage guaranty insurance.title insurance insures losses suffered by reason of a liens or encumbrances on,or defects in the title to said property b invalidity or unenforceability of any liens or encumbrances thereon or c incorrectness of searches relating to the title.mortgage insurance insures the payment of authorized real estate securities,and mortgage guaranty insurance insures against financial losses by reason of nonpayment of principal,interest,and other sums agreed to be paid under the terms of any note secured by a mortgage,deed of trust,or other instrument constituting a first lien on real estate,subd.a.each class of insurance serves a different purpose,and together they protect california real estate marketplace.radian guaranty,garamendi th,d.
in california,t itle insurance is a contract for indemnity under which the insurer is obligated to indemnify the insured against losses sustained in the event that a specific contingency,the discovery of a lien or encumbrance affecting title,occurs.citations.accordingly,when the contingency insured against under the policy occurs,the title insurer is not,by that fact alone,liable to the insured for damages in contract or tort,but rather is obligated to indemnify the insured under the terms of the policy.when the policy insures the lien of a deed of trust and the insured lien is junior to a lien undisclosed but insured against by the policy,the compensable loss is limited by the terms and conditions of the policy.citations.cale transamerica title insurance d.
at issue here is whether access is an insured as defined under the title insurance policies issued by first american.each policy provides that an insured is the insured named in schedule a,which is chl in each schedule a.the policy,in pertinent part,also defines an insured as i the owner of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage and each successor in ownership of the indebtedness the policy does not define the word indebtedness.
access argues that the word indebtedness as used in the policy is ambiguous because there is no definition of the word,and there is no explicit requirement that the indebtedness must be valid.given the ambiguity,access contends the word indebtedness should be broadly construed so as to include its transfer of funds through escrows to chl to pay off or refinance loans to the named borrowers.we conclude that access arguments are unavailing.
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.if the contract language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation,national union fire ins.cal th,d.

we reject access argument that the word indebtedness as used in the title insurance policy should be read as simply referring to the act of money changing hands,which would include access transfer of funds through the escrows to chl.the word indebtedness can not be read in isolation as referring to any indebtedness.it must be construed in light of the surrounding words,namely,the owner of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage,or the successor in ownership of the indebtedness,as well as the other parts of the policy.each policy schedule a,describes the insured mortgage as a deed of trust from the named borrower either esparza or the gills to chl executed and recorded on specific dates to secure an indebtedness from the named borrower to chl in a specific amount.thus,the indebtedness referred to in the definition of an insured can only be reasonably read as referring to the indebtedness between the named borrower either esparza or the gills and chl,and not the transfer of funds by access through the escrows to chl 
additionally,we conclude that in order for an entity to meet the definition of an insured under the title insurance policy issued by first american,there must be an existing indebtedness between the named borrower and the lender.we reject access argument that there is no need for there to be an existing indebtedness because the policy language does not contain any express qualification of the word indebtedness.the word indebtedness does not require any qualifying language.unless there is an existing indebtedness between the named borrower and lender the mortgage has no existence.coon shry cal.thus,as it has been recognized,where an insured is defined as the owner of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage and each successor to ownership of the indebtedness,there must have been a valid underlying indebtedness in existence in order for the title insurer to be liable under its policy.mcclellan realty institutional investors trust,affd.without opinion cir.

in the absence of any ambiguity in the policy,we do not apply the rule that the coverage of an insurance policy must be interpreted to include coverage the public may reasonably expect.stearns title ins.trust d.in any event,as we now discuss,the reasonable expectations of the parties would not support coverage for access losses and litigation defense costs relating to the esparza and gill loans.
first american title insurance policies insure only against losses sustained or incurred by the insured by reason of t he invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of the insured mortgage upon the title.access argues that it is the defects in the lien instruments which give rise to coverage in this case,and not the forged promissory notes.we disagree.any losses suffered by access are not due to defects in the title or mortgage liens,but are entirely due to the failure of an existing indebtedness between the named borrowers and chl.see blackhawk prod.credit chicago title,if the interest held by the insured mortgagee was valueless without the superior lien,it can not claim any lost value because the lien existed.this is so because even if title had been perfect and the liens existed as they should have been insured by the policies,access would be in the same position as it currently stands.the liens would not be subject to foreclosure because no indebtedness existed between the named borrowers and chl.alternatively,if the named borrowers had received the benefit of the loans,then the deeds of trust would have been enforceable.pacific am.const.security union title utah.consequently,the losses suffered by access are not the result of the invalidity or unenforceability of the lien of the insured mortgage upon the title.
