jesus garcia adames,the owner of a truck,leased two trailers from black diamond asphalt,black diamond,a material supplier and trucking company,and contracted with black diamond to transport freight for the company.the contracts required adames to maintain liability insurance naming black diamond as an additional insured,and to indemnify and hold it harmless for any liability arising out of adames performance of the contracts.
while hauling freight for black diamond,adames was involved in an accident that killed one person and injured another.after the accident,adames liability insurer was declared insolvent,and the california insurance guarantee association ciga undertook the insurer obligations,et further section references are to the insurance code unless otherwise specified.
a personal injury and wrongful death action ensued,alleging black diamond was adames employer and was responsible for his torts under the doctrine of respondeat superior.black diamond,which was for the costs of defense and the first million in damages,filed a against adames for indemnity.however,when ciga provided authorities purporting to show that an indemnity cause of action can not be maintained against the insured of an insolvent insurer,black diamond dismissed the without prejudice.
the litigation positions of the parties then changed.adames,who had been contesting liability,agreed with the plaintiffs that he would admit liability in return for a promise not to execute a judgment against his personal assets.when it learned of the agreement,black diamond sought to vacate its dismissal of the or to file a new for indemnity.
the trial court ruled that,under the laws applicable to ciga,a for indemnity may not be maintained against the insured of an insolvent insurer.
black diamond purports to appeal,claiming its is permissible and that,if the laws applicable to ciga preclude such a claim,they are unconstitutional to that extent.
the appeal must be dismissed because it is from a nonappealable order.however,exercising our discretion to treat the appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate,we conclude the laws relating to ciga do not preclude black diamond from filing its.
as we will explain,ciga was established to protect members of the public from the insolvency of insurers by spreading throughout the insurance industry a loss suffered by an insured as the result of his insurer insolvency.ciga accomplishes this purpose by assessing its member insurers to cover claims obtained against such an insured,while excluding coverage where payment would inure to the benefit of a solvent insurer.thus,an insurer may not file a for indemnity against the insured of an insolvent insurer,except to the extent the claim exceeds the limits of the insured policy.but the laws applying to ciga are not intended to protect member insurers against contribution to a loss by shifting the burden of the loss to a member of the public who otherwise has no insurance available to cover the loss.black diamond is not an insurer,and its retention limit is not insurance available to it.thus,to the extent of its personal liability,black diamond is not seeking any payment or benefit on behalf of,or that will inure to,the benefit of an insurer.consequently,the law does not preclude black diamond from seeking indemnification from adames.
discussion 
black diamond sought,but the trial court denied,leave to assert its claim against adames by vacating the dismissal of its or by filing a new.the order from which black diamond purports to appeal is a nonappealable order and,therefore,the purported appeal must be dismissed.miller stein d.
nevertheless,we have the discretion to treat the purported appeal as a petition for a writ of mandate.olson cory cal d,hetrick associates,summit construction maintenance th,d.such discretion should be exercised sparingly and only in unusual circumstances.olson cory,supra,cal d at.
the circumstances in this case warrant such an exercise of discretion.first,the sole reason the trial court refused to allow black diamond to pursue its for indemnity was the court conclusion that the laws applicable to ciga preclude such a.this presents a pure question of law second,as we will explain in the next portion of this opinion,the trial court was wrong.black diamond can seek indemnification from adames,whether by or in a separate action,and purposes of judicial economy and efficiency militate in favor of a so the rights and liabilities of the parties can be resolved in one proceeding rather than through successive lawsuits.third,it appears adames may have been led to believe that by admitting liability in return for a promise the plaintiffs will not execute a judgment against him,he will avoid personal liability for their damages.if so,adames was misadvised because the laws applicable to ciga and the dismissal of this purported appeal would not,in themselves,protect him against potentially ruinous personal liability from an indemnity action by black diamond.resolving the issues now would enable adames to take such steps as he can to protect his personal interests.
this brings us to another procedural issue.on the eve of oral argument in this court,the parties reached a settlement and asked us to dismiss the appeal with prejudice,all parties to bear their own costs.however,they acknowledged at oral argument that this case raises an issue of continuing public interest,which is likely to recur in the future.thus,in the interest of public policy and clarification of the law,we exercise our discretion to retain jurisdiction and decide the issue on the merits even though the parties settlement and request for dismissal would normally render the matter moot.burch george cal th,fn,d,lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d,people west coast shows,d.of course,the settlement means we can provide no meaningful relief by issuing a peremptory writ of mandate.therefore,having resolved the legal issue presented by treating the purported appeal as a petition for writ of mandate,we will dismiss it as moot.see daly superior court cal d,west coast shows,supra,d at.
