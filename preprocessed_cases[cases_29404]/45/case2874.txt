discussion 
background 
this case involves the common hospital practice of asserting a lien on a patient tort recovery even though the patient direct obligation to the hospital has been satisfied by the patient own medical insurance provider 
beginning during the great depression of the,states began to enact hospital lien statutes in an attempt to ameliorate the losses incurred upon treatment of insolvent persons.see calder,florida hospital lien laws,hereafter calder.by,about states had such laws.id.at.
in,california passed its own hospital lien act,codified at sections through.see stats,ch.although amended and expanded in,the original law provided for a lien for the reasonable and necessary charges of emergency care in excess of provided to any person injured by reason of an accident or wrongful act not covered by workers compensation if the person asserts or maintains a claim against another for damages on account of his injuries former.emergency care was defined as that provided within hours.ibid.the lien was limited to percent of the patient recovery by judgment,compromise,or settlement agreement.see former mercy hospital medical center farmers ins.group of companies cal th,d,mercy hospital.
the original purpose of hospital lien acts nationwide was to assure hospitals a source of payment for the medical care they provide d to nonpaying or indigent accident victims.calder at.california statute was no different.as stated in a committee report prepared in connection with the amendments the author states that hospitals,including those that operate trauma centers,treat accident victims,many of whom are uninsured.many hospitals have problems keeping their emergency rooms open because a large proportion of accident victims are uninsured.the purpose of this bill is to make it possible for hospitals to seek payment,particularly from insurance companies whose clients have accidentally or negligently hurt another person assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.may.
the amendments see stats,ch,abolished the distinction between emergency and other hospital treatment the lien was available for the reasonable and necessary charges of the hospital.the hospital lien law has not been amended since.
it is widely understood that much has changed in the area of charges for hospital care since,and even since.as insurance companies sought to contain growth in the cost of hospitalization,through preferred provider agreements and health maintenance organizations,there has opened an increasingly wider gap between hospitals usual and customary charges and the amount actually paid for such services by health insurers.see fong,scripps clinic plans to alter hmo pacts,san diego,wl fong,hospital rates up since,san diego july,wl.
the practice of seeking payment from the patient for amounts not covered either by deductibles or insurance company payment is known as balance billing.the practice first became controversial in the context of the federal medicaid law,since administrators of those programs were the most aggressive in reducing payment to hospitals for treatment of participants in the medicaid program.palumbo myers d.
many contracts between health insurers and hospitals now provide that the hospital will not seek to bridge the gap between stated charges and payments from the insurer by making a claim against the insured.see,whiteside tenet healthcare th,d nishihama city and county of san francisco th,d.
as the gap between usual and customary charges and the discounted rate paid by insurers continued to grow,treatment of insured patients began to look increasingly like treatment of uninsured patients,at least from the hospitals fiscal point of view.see hundley,bleeding money,petersburg times,wl.a notice of benefits entered as an exhibit in the present case,for example,shows that appellant insurer paid including appellant copayment in settlement of usual and customary charges of.faced with shortfall similar in many ways to the shortfall addressed by the original hospital lien acts,hospitals have turned to the assertion of liens under those same hospital lien laws.
in,as a result of complaints about inequitable balance billing by health care associations,the legislature considered the more limited issue of contract liens asserted by those associations and acted to place limits on the extent of such liens in the balance billing context.see see assem.com.on judiciary,com.bill analysis of bill reg.sess.june.at that time,a group of plaintiffs lawyers urged the legislature to reexamine the entire area of health care liens.id.at.the group pointed out a federal district court case from texas holding that the texas hospital lien act did not permit a balance billing lien by a hospital paid in full at its contract rate by the patient medical insurer medicare.see satsky united states.the legislature,however,chose not to address statutory liens at that time 
public policy and statutory interpretation 
while it may well be fair and equitable for an indigent or otherwise nonpaying patient to share up to half of his or her tort recovery with a hospital that has provided for his or her care,the issue of fairness and equity becomes somewhat clouded when the patient,through purchase of health insurance,has made prior arrangements with the hospital to pay for treatment he or she may need at a future time.such a patient may have purchased medical insurance specifically to limit his or her exposure for medical costs to the deductibles and copayments stated in the insurance policy.
similarly,it may well be fair as a matter of policy to require a patient who asserts a claim for,and recovers,damages for the usual and customary charges for his or her medical treatment to actually pay those usual and customary charges.but the issue of fairness becomes clouded when the patient recovers less than the full value of his or her injury as defined by usual principles of tort law,for example,through a settlement that does not differentiate among the various elements of the damages claim that would be presented to a jury.
in these various circumstances,one party may well perceive that other parties received a windfall,no matter how the situation is resolved.if the patient is able to claim and recover the full usual and customary hospital charges,he may be perceived as reaping a windfall if he is not required to pay that over to the hospital.see hanif housing authority d.if the patient damages claim is limited to actual,discounted payments to the hospital under a contract with a medical insurer,the tortfeasor may be perceived as reaping a windfall.see lee,reasonable medical treatment means actual cost summer defense comment suggesting tort defense attorneys can achieve a reduction of both special and general damages by limiting plaintiffs to proof of actual medical costs.if the hospital is paid both its contract rate,which it has agreed will fully discharge the bill for services,and its usual and customary charges merely because there is a solvent tortfeasor,the hospital may be perceived as reaping a windfall.see welf,subd.a any provider of health care services who obtains a label or copy from the card or other proof of eligibility pursuant to this chapter shall not seek reimbursement nor attempt to obtain payment for the cost of those covered health care services from the eligible applicant or recipient,or any person other than the department or third party payer who provides a contractual or legal entitlement to health care services.
our task in construing a statute,however,is not to supplant the legislature view of fairness or good public policy but,instead,is to implement the law in accordance with the legislature intent.see droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d.in the present case it seems reasonably clear that the legislature,in originally enacting the hospital lien act,did not contemplate its application in the context of balance billing,because the gap between insurance payments for services and usual and customary charges for services was not yet of problematical dimensions.calder at.when the lien act was amended in,there was no indication in the available legislative history that the applicability of the act in the balance billing situation was considered in any manner.
on occasion,courts must determine from the overall purpose and the legislative history and intent of a statute its applicability in circumstances not directly addressed by the language of the law.regents of university of california superior court cal th,d,spangler memel cal d.this is such a case.the question presented is whether the hospital lien act permits a hospital to assert a lien for the unpaid balance of its usual and customary charges after payment by a medical insurer of the full contract obligation for those charges.in answering this question,we are not writing on a blank slate.
in swanson john regional medical center th,d swanson,division six of the second appellate district of the court of appeal considered the same issue presented to us in the present case.the swanson opinion concluded that the hospital statutory lien was not extinguished by payment of discounted charges by the patient medical insurer.id.at,d.impliedly,swanson concluded that the hospital lien exists for any portion of a patient hospital bill not covered by the patient medical insurance.see id.at,d.
two premises are key to swanson analysis the court cites as authority for each premise mercy hospital,supra,cal th,d.first,swanson rejects the idea that a lien only secures payment of an underlying debt or obligation the hospital lien under civil code section is a statutory lien and does not require that the patient owe the hospital a debt.swanson,supra,th at,d,citing mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.second,swanson concludes the hospital lien is not a charge against the patient.to the contrary,it is a statutory medical lien in favor of a hospital against third persons liable for the patient injuries.swanson,supra,th at,d,quoting from mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.
from these two premises,swanson concludes w e are bound by the holding in mercy hospital.because the legislature has determined that hospital liens are exempt from balanc e billing limits,we may not override that determination.swanson,supra,th at,d.
we believe the swanson court miscontrues mercy hospital thus its reliance thereon is misplaced,and the two premises it draws from that opinion are erroneous.instead,as we shall explain,we believe the statute should not be construed to cut the hospital lien free from the mooring of the underlying debt to which it rightfully attaches.
mercy hospital 
mercy hospital concerned the breach by a tortfeasor insurance company of its duty under section to pay to a hospital the amount of the hospital section lien claimed in the notice,or so much thereof as can be satisfied out of percent of the moneys due under any final judgment,compromise,or settlement agreement after paying any prior liens.the question before the court was whether the tortfeasor insurer,who distributed settlement proceeds without paying the lien,was liable for the entire amount of the lien or was liable for the limited,percent portion it should have paid to the hospital.see mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.although not expressly stated,it appears from the court factual summary that the injured party was uninsured and that he made no payments on his hospital bill.see id.at,d.
the supreme court began its discussion by quoting section a lien is a charge imposed in some mode other than by a transfer in trust upon specific property by which it is made security for the performance of an act.we note that this definition is applicable to title of the civil code,which includes section,the hospital lien provision.the court then stated there are various types of personal property liens the one at issue in this case is a statutory nonpossessory lien.mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.
the mercy hospital opinion then notes that the hospital lien is merely one tool the hospital may employ sections through are not exclusive,and the hospital may still proceed directly against the patient for any unpaid balance.mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.the court states that the apparent purpose of former section was to secure part of the patient recovery from liable third persons to pay his or her hospital bill,while ensuring that the patient retained sufficient funds to address other losses resulting from the tortious injury.ibid.later,the opinion notes legislative history to the effect that the hospital lien act originally was apparently enacted in response to a california hospital association membership survey that revealed at least was lost as a result of injured persons collecting a judgment or settlement and failing to discharge any portion of the hospital bill.citation.mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d,italics added by the mercy hospital.
not only is the mercy hospital court description of hospital liens fully consistent with the legislative history disclosing a focus of the hospital lien act on uninsured or insolvent patients,it also expressly includes the hospital lien as among those statutory liens securing the performance of an act.as such,the lien is merely an incident of the underlying debt or obligation.lewis booth cal d.and while the statute creates a direct obligation of an insurer or tortfeasor who ignores its obligations under section,that is not the obligation the lien secures.the section obligation is enforced not through a lien,but by suit against the insurer or tortfeasor,as was done in mercy hospital.
we now turn to the passages relied upon by the swanson opinion.for the proposition that stare decisis establishes that the hospital lien exists independently of any debt owed by the patient to the hospital,swanson cites the following passage from mercy hospital whatever principles might generally apply to liens,former section is a statutory,not a common law,lien.the legislature is,of course,free to define and limit such a lien,and has done so in this case.mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.read in context,the limitation to which the court refers is the limit of the tortfeasor lien liability to percent of the settlement.the court was not referring to a legislative expansion of common law liens to make the hospital lien exist free from any underlying debt of the patient to the hospital.
the second passage relied upon by swanson,its quotation from page of the mercy hospital opinion,seems equally misplaced.swanson quotes the mercy hospital court as stating the hospital lien is a statutory medical lien in favor of a hospital against third persons liable for the patient injuries.mercy hospital,supra,cal th at,d.the full passage states mercy lien is provided for and defined by sections through.these sections,enacted in,were california first statutory medical lien in favor of a hospital against third persons liable for the patient injuries.sections through are not exclusive,and the hospital may still proceed directly against the patient for any unpaid balance.ibid.the passage is immediately preceded by the following sentence here,of course,we address the parameters of a lien that compensates a hospital for providing medical services to an injured person by giving the hospital a direct right to a certain percentage of specific property otherwise accruing to that person,italics added.
taking this entire passage in context,we can not agree that it establishes that a statutory hospital lien is not a charge against the patient,as swanson concludes.see swanson,supra,th at,d.instead,mercy hospital recognizes that the hospital lien attaches to property that otherwise belongs to the patient.while it attaches to that property right when it is in the hands of the tortfeasor or insurer,it only does so because of the patient right and interest in that property.compare whiteside tenet healthcare,supra,th at,d amounts payable by patient insurance company directly to hospital are not property of the patient.
respondent view of the text and legislative history 
respondent does not attempt to explain swanson holding when viewed in the full context of the discussion in mercy hospital.instead,respondent cites as support for its the hospital lien exists without regard to an underlying passage in the senate judiciary committee analysis in the hearing report on senate bill,which created section governing balance billing in the context of contract liens of health maintenance organizations.
the passage from the bill analysis states that the bill to create section does not intend to limit hospital liens now available under civil code section,nor would it affect liens that a treating medical service provider may assert independently of a health care service plan or disability insurer we omit the brief discussion of the texas case described above,in which the court held that payment of the insurance contract billing extinguished the hospital lien for the covered services.although in california hospitals have an independent right to assert a lien under civil code section,this case merely illustrates how the area of health care liens is evolving,as more and more consumers become aware of and challenge billing practices of health care service plans.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended april,italics added.
the statement in the committee analysis is the equivalent of obiter dicta in a judicial opinion it is a statement made in passing,not purporting to decide the matter stated and not necessary to the holding of the opinion.see stockton theatres palermo cal d.the statement does not cite authority for its claim and is irrelevant to the discussion of the actual purposes of the bill before the committee.we do not believe the analyst statement reflects california law.
respondent next contends that the plain text,purpose and legislative history of the hospital lien act do not support any restrictions on the hospital ability to levy liens thereunder.initial capitalization omitted.respondent assertion that section has a clear and unambiguous meaning is erroneous section is ambiguous and requires judicial interpretation.
first,the phrase reasonable and necessary charges is not defined in the statute and,as far as we can discern,is not a phrase with a fixed usage in the law or in the medical services industry.the traditional formulation for a hospital charges is that such charges are usual and customary or reasonable and customary.see,van ness blue cross of california th,d.the traditional formulation for the medical services provided by the hospital is that they were medically necessary or reasonable and necessary.see,county of san diego state of california cal th,d.in the ordinary use of language,charges that are usual and customary might well be synonymous with reasonable charges,but one might wonder about the use of necessary to further describe the reasonable charges.see eden hospital dist.belshé th,d citing medicaid regulation requiring that costs be necessary and proper as distinct from requirement that services be reasonable and necessary.
it would seem that under a reading of the statute,the charges can not be deemed necessary in any usual sense of the word such charges are not necessary to obtain services for the patient because he or she has an existing contract right to such services at the rates provided by the medical insurance policy and,under the terms of the various provider agreements,the debt arising from exercise of this right is fully and completely satisfied by the insurer payment of the contract rate for such services.
in addition,the plain language of the hospital lien act,as respondent would read it,does not require the hospital to deduct from its lien amount any payments,partial or otherwise,it receives toward payment of the reasonable and necessary charges for services provided to the patient.thus,as stated by respondent in its trial brief in the court below under common law lien theory,a lien may only be levied as a means of securing an obligation or indebtedness however,in this case,sjch levied a statutory lien against a third party.the major limitation under this statutory lien is that it has to be levied for reasonable and necessary medical charges.obligation or indebtedness is not a contingency.italics added.
presumably,respondent would not overtly assert its right to be paid by the patient medical insurer as well as to be paid in full by each tortfeasor who can be held responsible for the patient injury.presumably,whether through an exegesis of reasonable or necessary,or both,respondent would contend that the statute impliedly limits it to a single payment for its full charges.but the point is,the plain language of the statute,if viewed as rendering the patient debt or obligation to the hospital irrelevant,does not express any such limitation.the only limitation expressed in the hospital lien act is the percent of net recovery limit contained in section.any other limitation must be introduced through statutory construction.
the silence of the legislative history 
a striking absence from the available legislative history undermines respondent interpretation of the hospital lien act.we may view the matter through the lens of an example an uninsured hospital patient incurs a bill of.upon discharge,the patient goes to the hospital finance office and says,i can pay you now or per month for months.take one or the other,or sue me.the hospital representative elects to accept as full payment of the patient bill.the next day,however,the hospital files a lien for against the patient potential recovery from the tortfeasor who put the patient in the hospital.does the hospital lien law,on its face,allow or disallow such a lien would such a lien comport with the purpose and history of the hospital lien act 
we think,based on the purposes of the act as disclosed in the available legislative history,the hospital lien act did not,and was not intended to,rewrite california law of accord and satisfaction in such a manner as to permit the hospital to assert a lien in the foregoing circumstances.see statutory principles of accord and satisfaction.nor do we see any indication in the language,purpose,or history of the law that would effect such a change if the compromise were reached with,and the discounted charges were paid by,the patient relatives,church,or medical insurer.
whether it makes the choice at the time of entering into a provider contract with a medical insurer or in negotiations with the patient after services have been provided to a particular patient,it is the hospital choice to accept or refuse the level of payment offered by the payor.in either case,we see nothing in the statute designed to relieve a hospital of its choice to provide services at a price below the usual and customary charges for such services.
the documentary evidence in the present case 
it is of some interest,in this regard,to examine the language of the documents in the record in the present case.
when appellant was billed for usual and customary charges of in,he received from the insurer a notice that the insurer had paid on the bill.the amount ineligible column of the notice,indicating an amount of,was marked with code.at the foot of the notice,code is explained as follows this amount is the ccn discount received for using a ccn facility this amount will be written off by the facility.this written off balance is,however,the primary basis for the hospital lien filed against appellant recovery in his action against the tortfeasor who put him in the hospital.hospital officials testified that the debt was written off only for the hospital accounting purposes.
the contract between the hospital and ccn provides that the hospital agrees to provide services for the reimbursement amounts set forth in the contract.reimbursement amounts is defined as payment in full to contract hospital for inpatient and outpatient services provided to a beneficiary pursuant to payor agreements 
while this contract does provide that it is not the intention of either ccn or contract hospital that beneficiaries occupy the position of intended third party beneficiaries of the obligations assumed by either party to this contract,the contract also provides that contract hospital hereby specifically authorizes ccn to act in its behalf in contracting for the provision of inpatient services and outpatient services at the reimbursement amounts set forth elsewhere in the contract.pursuant to this authority as agent for the hospital,ccn entered into its contract with appellant medical insurer.that contract,which contains no similar exclusion of the insureds as beneficiaries,states that the insurer agrees to reimburse the preferred providers according to the reimbursement amounts specified in ccn provider agreements.those reimbursement amounts include deductible and copayment amounts and shall constitute payment in full for health care services provided to beneficiaries by ccn providers.respondent summary claim that it is not bound by this contract is frivolous 
ccn also provides a patient manual to insureds participating in the medical insurance program offered by the beer wholesalers association.that manual explains ccn is a voluntary,optional program for you.each time you need care,you decide whether to use a ccn preferred provider.some advantages of choosing ccn providers are that they will collect only patient copayments deductibles,coinsurance and noncovered services,not the full amount of the charges the manual also states that the insured will receive an explanation of benefits from your health plan which should show both the billed charges and the ccn contract rates for services.you are not responsible to pay the difference between these amounts.
the trial court concluded that section should not be interpreted to implement these contract limitations on the patient obligation to the hospital because public policy does not mandate that plaintiff should have the benefit of a windfall from the third party tort feasor in the form of recovery of the full charge billing of the hospital where discounted access to health care has been provided by the hospital contract with health insurance carrier.similarly,in its trial brief,respondent took the position that the lien procedure merely seeks to intercept payments parnell claims to have incurred as medical expenses which he did not incur,up to the market value of the hospital services.
the first problem with both statements is that the pleadings do not disclose that appellant here pled and proved in an action against the tortfeasor that he had medical bills from this hospital in excess of the amounts paid by his medical insurer,nor that he prayed for duplicate recovery of what the medical insurer paid the hospital the second problem is that the interpretation of a statute is not an ad hoc exercise that is to be based upon the facts of one case in isolation from the universe of cases to which the statute potentially may be applicable the third problem is that,granting that the equities might favor respondent if the facts were as the statements presuppose,there is no proposed construction of the statute that would be limited to the situation described while excluding the class of cases in which the award or settlement does not compensate the injured patient for all his or her compensable losses in addition to the usual and customary charges he or she did not incur.
based on the foregoing considerations,we conclude a hospital that has received full payment for services under the terms of its contract with a medical insurance provider is not entitled to file a lien to recover the difference between that payment and the hospital usual and customary charges for similar services.because section does not authorize a lien in those circumstances,the judgment of the trial court must be reversed.
issues not presented by this appeal 
not decided in the trial court and unbriefed on this appeal is the issue of litigation immunity for the filing of notices of liens.section,subdivision b,undoubtedly precludes certain of appellant causes of action to the extent they are based on the filing of such notice.see communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.at a minimum,however,the litigation privilege does not bar appellant from seeking declaratory relief,including declaratory relief construing the applicability of a statute in particular circumstances.see wilton mountain wood homeowners th,d lane city of redondo beach d.
on this appeal,we will not attempt to sort out the causes of action and types of relief to which appellant may be entitled.we hold only that,based on the pleadings before the trial court,appellant has stated a cause of action for declaratory relief under the unfair practices act bus,and the judgment against him,dismissing this action,was erroneous.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views expressed in this opinion.appellant is awarded costs on appeal.
the court took the motion under submission and then,by stipulation,conducted a trial sitting without a jury,limited to liability and equitable issues.during the trial,the parties stipulated to various facts for purpose of the motion.other evidence was received for purposes of the trial only.at the close of trial,the court took the matter under submission.the ensuing statement of decision determined only the motion for judgment on the pleadings,and the judgment as entered conformed to that ruling.
we recognize that at least two cases raising this issue are currently pending before the supreme court.mcmeans scripps health,review granted,olszewski scripps health,review granted.
a former collections supervisor for respondent testified that three or four years before trial,which was held in,respondent stopped filing liens against patients with blue cross medical insurance because there was an objection from blue cross based upon,i believe,the contract between that insurer and respondent.it is not clear whether the parties considered this information as submitted in conjunction with the motion for judgment on the pleadings.see fn,ante.
the various contracts require appellant medical insurer to enc
