this case presents the question of whether real party in interest christopher closson christopher can recover on a tort claim for fraud based on the issuance of a health insurance policy by petitioner mega life and health insurance company mega life to christopher deceased wife,kathy closson kathy.we hold that although christopher properly sues as kathy representative to receive all damages legally available on her behalf,he has no separate and individual tort claim based on the policy.accordingly,we will grant mega life petition and command the superior court of riverside county to grant summary adjudication in favor of mega life on the complaint cause of action for fraud.
statement of facts 
most of the relevant facts are uncomplicated and undisputed.with respect to defendant mega life,the first amended complaint alleges that mega life misrepresented the coverage offered by its policy and concealed certain facts relevant to kathy,as christopher would have it,the decision to purchase the policy.the policy named her as the primary insured and listed her three children as covered dependents kathy alone signed the application for the policy.the policy was allegedly touted as providing excellent benefits,equivalent to or better than those offered by kathy previous policy.however,it is alleged that the policy in fact provided minimal benefits,leaving kathy medical bills unpaid.christopher also alleges that after kathy death,he was pursued by creditors and struggled to pay the medical debts 
following kathy death,christopher brought the action in his individual capacity as well as in the capacity of successor in interest.see code civ,defining decedent successor in interest,defining successor of the decedent code civ,granting to the successor the right to sue if no probate has been commenced.there is no dispute that christopher,as successor to kathy,is entitled to recover most of the damages that were incurred and recoverable by kathy the question is whether any wrongs by mega life in connection with the sale or issuance of the policy to kathy give rise to an independent claim for injury to christopher.
mega life motion for summary adjudication of the fraud causes of action was based on the legal premise that christopher simply had no cause of action.in response,christopher pointed to evidence that he had participated in the decision to select the mega life policy,it was a joint decision,and premium payments were made from community funds.
the trial court denied mega life motion for summary adjudication,opining that christopher did have standing to seek recovery on his own behalf.
discussion 
first,we will address christopher argument that we should permit him to sue on his own behalf because,absent such a remedy,he will be unable to recover for the emotional distress,which he alleges mega life wrongful conduct caused him to suffer we do not agree that the point is dispositive in christopher favor.
it is often is codified in california f or every wrong there is a remedy.but this statute does not create substantive rights or an unbounded right to damages.county of san luis obispo abalone alliance d.county of san luis obispo.instead,this wholesome maxim of jurisprudence can obviously have no application to any but legal wrongs or those wrongs for which the law authorizes or sanctions redress.finch western nat.bank,cited in county of san luis obispo,at.a tort involves a violation of a legal duty,imposed by statute,contract,or otherwise,owed by the defendant to the person injured.without such a duty,any injury is damnum absque injuria injury without wrong.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,citing biakanja irving cal d.the proposition that courts should strain to provide remedies for every wrong in the moral sense flies directly in the face of this longstanding authority that only legal wrongs must be redressed.
california courts have explicitly rejected the concept of universal duty.it must not be forgotten that duty got into our law for the very purpose of combatting what was then feared to be a dangerous delusion,that the law might countenance legal redress for all foreseeable harm.county of san luis obispo,supra,d at,quoting dillon legg cal d,dillon.instead,whether to recognize a new legal wrong or tort is often governed by policy factors.see medical center superior court cal th,d.in making these determinations,both the courts and the legislature must weigh concepts of public policy,as well as problems inherent in measuring loss,and floodgates concerns,in addition to the traditional element of foreseeability.see elden sheldon cal d.
as a result of these weighings,modern law,if not replete with examples of wrongs for which there is no remedy,at least offers numerous examples.thus,although a spouse may sue for loss of consortium deriving from the injury to his or her spouse,an unmarried cohabitant may not.rodriguez bethlehem steel cal d,elden sheldon,supra,cal d at.although it is easily foreseeable that a child may suffer grievous harm when a parent is personally badly to a spouse loss of recovery is allowed to a child for damages based on the immediate injury to a parent.borer american airlines,cal d,zwicker altamont emergency room physicians medical group th,d.and,while that same child may recover for personal distress if he or she witnesses the injury to the parent,a sibling who is not present at the moment of injury can not.see dillon,supra,cal d,and subsequent cases.
in a relatively recent case,the supreme court recognized that the act of intentional spoliation of evidence is an unqualified wrong.however,pointing out the difficult and speculative nature of proving what the destroyed evidence would have shown,and also noting the costs of meritless litigation,it declined to allow recovery in tort medical center superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
distinctions are also made with respect to the type of damages or rights that will be recognized.for example,in an action brought on behalf of a deceased plaintiff,as a rule,all appropriate damages may be damages for pain and suffering may not.code civ.and as a final example,a foster child or dependent stepchild may recover for the wrongful death of a parent,but except in specific circumstances they are not heirs with respect to inheritance from an intestate parent.see and code civ,subds.b,c,estate of joseph cal th,d,passim.
hence,it is simply not true that we are required to allow christopher to sue mega life for fraud in order to ensure that he can recover for his emotional distress damages.we would only be required to do so by existing law and precedent if such is lacking,recognition of such a right depends on policy considerations.we therefore move on to an analysis of the existing law.
in the trial court,mega life relied most heavily on hatchwell blue shield of california d.hatchwell,which is factually quite similar to the case at bar.in hatchwell,a husband and wife sued the insurer over an alleged failure to pay medical benefits to the insured husband.the complaint contained causes of action based on contract,bad faith,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of warranty,negligence,and fraud.as is true here,the wife asserted that she had been part of the policy decision and that premiums were paid from community funds.
the trial court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment against the wife on the ground of lack of standing and the court of appeal affirmed.it rejected the wife arguments that her status either as an intended beneficiary,a dependent beneficiary,or a coinsured gave her the right or power to sue based on the contract.hatchwell,supra,d at.it also rejected the argument that the payment of premiums from community funds was a significant factor favoring relief.id.at.see also austero,supra,d at.rejecting the argument that because community funds had been used to pay policy premiums,the wife could sue for bad faith based on the insurer denial of benefits to the husband.
the trial court here believed that hatchwell was distinguishable because christopher sues in tort for fraud,and christopher also argues strenuously that for this reason hatchwell is not direct precedent.we do not agree.as noted above,the complaint in hatchwell did include causes of action for fraud and the torts of breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith.the defendant insurer moved for summary judgment,which was granted,thus disposing of all causes of action.although the court opinion focuses on contract issues and language,the holding that the wife had no standing to sue necessarily applied to the tort causes of action.under the principles of stare decisis,the trial court erred in failing to follow hatchwell.auto equity sales,superior court cal d,see cuccia superior court th,d.
we,of course,are not bound by the decision of a sister court of appeal.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.but w e respect stare decisis,however,which serves the important goals of stability in the law and predictability of decision.thus,we ordinarily follow the decisions of other districts without good reason to disagree.greyhound lines,county of santa clara d.in this case,we find no reason to depart from the holding in hatchwell and find the result in that case to be equally appropriate in the specific context of a tort claim for fraud.
we begin by examining the legal underpinnings for the conclusion that hatchwell correctly reflects current california law with respect to christopher claim.the crucial issue in any analysis of tort liability is whether the defendant breached a duty owed to the plaintiff.the question is one of law for the court to determine.knight jewett cal th,d.in our case,christopher contends that mega life,through its agents,breached a duty to him not to misrepresent the terms of the policy and mega life intention to provide benefits and thereby incurred liability to him.he is wrong.christopher can not establish the necessary element of legal reliance.
the rule is that e very action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest,except as otherwise provided by statute.code civ.the elements of a cause of action for fraud are well established and not in dispute a misrepresentation or actionable concealment of fact knowledge of falsity or the duty of disclosure intent to defraud or induce reliance and actual reliance by the plaintiff,small fritz companies,cal th,d.the plaintiff must allege and prove that he actually relied upon the misrepresentations,and that in the absence of fraud,would not have entered into the contract or other transaction.schauer mandarin gems of,th,d schauer.
we will assume,arguendo,that mega life agent directed his alleged misrepresentations concealments at christopher as well as kathy,and that it was intended that both should believe them to be true.we will also assume that christopher did in fact assume that the statements by mega life agent were true when he discussed the matter with his wife.the fatal difficulty is that christopher was a stranger to the insurance contract,and any reliance by him could not have caused him to alter his position to his injury or risk.put another way,mega life simply owed no duty to a person who was not the prospective party to the insurance contract.
we realize that it is not always necessary that a fraudulent misrepresentation be made to the intended actor.california follows section of the restatement second of torts in imposing liability upon the maker of a fraudulent misrepresentation to a who intends that a repeat it to b,where b is the actor and injured party.see geernaert mitchell th,d seller who misrepresented facts about home defects to buyer could be liable to subsequent buyer if he anticipated that the misrepresentations would be repeated.similarly,california recognizes the rule of section that a fraudulent representation intended to defraud any member of the public or a particular class of persons may give rise to liability in favor of anyone who detrimentally relies on the representation,whether it was directly communicated or not.bily arthur young cal th,d,bily dealing with auditor liability to third persons who act in reliance on information in the audit report see also rest d torts.but these rules are of no assistance to christopher because it remains the injured who has cause to sue.
insofar as christopher argues or at least insinuates that his recommendations were a causative influence on kathy decision,we consider the point irrelevant.indeed,the argument that christopher approval was somehow legally significant sounds oddly paternalistic in this century.similarly,his assertion in the return that he purchased the insurance for his wife is not legally accurate.in his response to mega life separate statement code civ,subd.b,christopher the initial premium was paid with community funds.nor did he purchase it for her.kathy was evidently a competent adult able to contract on her own behalf,and she did so.she thereby changed her her detriment,according to the allegations of the securing health insurance from mega life instead of from another company.christopher made no application for insurance and did not receive an allegedly deficient policy or coverage.he did not change his legal position to his detriment 
a case which we find more helpful than those upon which christopher relies is schauer,supra,th,d.in that case,a,accompanied by his fiancée,purchased an engagement ring presumably in reliance on misrepresentations as to its quality.after the couple divorced,the for fraud.the court of appeal rejected her claim,noting that it was the husband who relied on the representation and entered into the contract of sale.h e retained the right,if any,to sue for actual fraud.id.at,d italics added.implicit in the latter part of the quoted statement is that it was only the husband who retained the right to sue so it is here 
whichever way it is framed,under existing law the result is the life simply owed no duty to be truthful to christopher when there was no possibility that he would detrimentally change his position,and christopher in fact did not take detrimental action in reliance on any fraud or concealment 
thus,we conclude that california law does not recognize a cause of action in christopher with respect to the misrepresentations allegedly made by mega life its agent.the last question is whether we should create such a cause of,that is,a duty in mega life.we conclude that it is neither necessary nor advisable to do so.
in determining whether to recognize a new tort,courts are governed by general considerations of policy medical center superior court,supra,cal th at,d,and we assume that the same applies to a determination whether to extend a recognized duty to new plaintiffs.we focus on whether existing law provides an adequate redress for the wrongs allegedly committed by mega life 
as we have stated,christopher appears in the action wearing two hats as kathy successor and in his individual capacity.kathy,had she lived,would have had viable claims for breach of contract and fraud,which would have permitted her to recover pecuniary damages such as unrecompensed medical expenses.as noted above,the parties dispute whether emotional distress damages would be recoverable in connection with the fraud alleged here,but kathy would at least have been eligible to pursue such damages.thus,had kathy lived,there can be little dispute that she could have recovered full compensation for her injury.furthermore,she could have sought punitive damages for the fraud,subd.a.
with one exception,all damages that would have been recoverable by kathy,including punitive damages,may be recovered by christopher as her successor.insofar as he is responsible to pay her medical bills out of community property see,the payment may be satisfied out of the recovery he obtains on her behalf and individual recovery is not necessary.it is true that,as her successor,he can not recover for her emotional distress.code civ.however,in our view,this does not mean that he must be allowed to recover for his own.the legislative decision that damages for physical suffering are personal and do not survive is not an unfairness that must be circumvented by creating a right to such damages in a surviving family member.christopher,as kathy successor,can seek all damages suffered by kathy,which the legislature has authorized.
furthermore,a
