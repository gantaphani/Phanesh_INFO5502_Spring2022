this case involves parallel judicial proceedings,one in state court and the other in federal court.each was initiated by readylink healthcare,readylink,and each contended that a decision by the commissioner of the california department of insurance commissioner was preempted by internal revenue service irs regulations.the federal district court abstained,relying on younger harris.while this appeal from the district court judgment was pending,the california court of appeal rejected readylink preemption claim,and the california supreme court denied review 
applying the supreme court guidance in sprint communications,jacobs,d,we find that the district court erred by abstaining.however,because issue preclusion now bars readylink claim,we affirm the judgment dismissing the complaint.
background 
readylink provides temporary nurses for medical facilities.from to,readylink purchased workers compensation insurance from the state compensation insurance fund scif.see cal.although a creature of california statutes,scif is an insurer on the same basis as any private carrier offering workers compensation insurance.stephens,state comp.ins.fund,th,d.
when scif audited readylink for the policy year,it found that readylink had failed to report certain per diem payments to employees as payroll,and billed readylink for an additional premium of.readylink appealed that decision to the california department of insurance,see cal.f,and an administrative law judge alj approved scif premium calculation.
the alj first found that the california workers compensation uniform statistical reporting plan usrp which scif used to calculate readylink premium rates,exempts payments for additional living expenses not normally assumed from payroll.because readylink per diem payments were not tied to the expenses that nurses accrued while working away from their homes,the alj concluded that the payments were actually wages.in doing so,the alj rejected readylink argument that the usrp should be interpreted consistently with irs per diem reporting rules.the commissioner affirmed and designated the decision as precedential.
readylink then petitioned the los angeles superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus pursuant to california code of civil procedure.it alleged,among other things,that the commissioner should have followed irs reporting rules in interpreting the usrp.the superior court denied relief.readylink appealed to the california court of appeal,expressly arguing that irs regulations preempted the commissioner decision.
while the state court appeal was pending,readylink filed this putative class action against scif and the commissioner in the central district of california.the federal complaint alleged that irs regulations preempted the commissioner decision,requested both declaratory and injunctive relief,and asserted various damage claims.after scif moved to dismiss the complaint,the district court ordered supplemental briefing to address possible abstention under younger and colorado river water conservation district united states,d.the district court then dismissed the federal preemption claim on younger grounds and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.readylink appealed.
as readylink appeal to this court was pending,the california court of appeal affirmed the superior court denial of mandamus,expressly holding that the commissioner decision was not preempted by federal law.readylink health care,jones,th,d.the california supreme court denied readylink subsequent petition for review.
ii.younger abstention 
the district court had jurisdiction over readylink complaint under,see verizon.pub.serv.comm of,d,and we have jurisdiction over this appeal under,see agriesti mgm grand hotels,cir.we review the district court younger determination de novo.gilbertson albright,cir en banc.
in younger harris,the supreme court reaffirmed the principle that federal courts sitting in equity can not,absent exceptional circumstances,enjoin pending state criminal proceedings.at.the court,citing comity concerns,later extended the younger principle to civil enforcement actions akin to criminal proceedings,huffman pursue,d,and to suits challenging the core of the administration of a state judicial system,juidice vail,d.
the court subsequent opinion in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar ass n,d,found abstention appropriate when there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding,those proceedings implicate important state interests,and there is an adequate opportunity in the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.id.at.our ensuing decisions concluded that the three middlesex factors controlled younger abstention in civil actions.see,meredith oregon,cir fresh int l agric.labor relations,cir.and,although not a threshold element,we identified a fourth requirement the requested relief must seek to enjoin or have the practical effect of enjoining ongoing state proceedings.amerisourcebergen roden,cir gilbertson,at citing samuels mackell,d.
but,our decisions have sent mixed signals on whether younger remains limited to criminal cases,quasicriminal actions,and orders involving the administration of a state judicial system.a number of our opinions suggested that,notwithstanding middlesex,younger applies only to those three types of proceedings.see,logan bank nat.ass n,cir potrero hills landfill,cnty.of solano,cir martori.distribs.james massengale,cir,abrogated on other grounds,ohio civ.rights comm dayton christian,d.others,however,implied that district courts must abstain in any action when the middlesex factors are present.see,delta dental plan of,mendoza,cir fresh int l,at.
we also have been less than clear on whether younger applies only to proceedings.compare potrero hills,at o ur case law clearly demonstrates that the first younger prong may be satisfied even when the ongoing state proceeding involves only private litigants,with san jose silicon valley chamber of commerce political action comm.city of san jose,cir we must abstain under younger if four requirements are met a proceeding is ongoing.
sprint resolved these interpretive dilemmas,squarely holding that younger abstention is limited to the three exceptional categories of cases identified in new orleans public service,council of new orleans nopsi,d.sprint.at.those cases are parallel,pending state criminal proceeding s,state civil proceedings that are akin to criminal prosecutions,and state civil proceedings that implicate a state interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts.id.at.
for orders at the core of the judicial process,the underlying state proceeding plainly need not have been initiated by the state.see juidice,at,pennzoil texaco,d.for civil enforcement actions that are akin to criminal proceedings,however,a state actor is routinely a party to the state proceeding and often initiates the action,the proceedings are characteristically initiated to sanction the federal plaintiff for some wrongful act,and i nvestigations are commonly involved,often culminating in the filing of a formal complaint or charges.sprint.at.
in civil cases,therefore,younger abstention is appropriate only when the state proceedings are ongoing,are enforcement actions or involve a state interest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its courts,implicate an important state interest,and allow litigants to raise federal challenges.see sprint.at gilbertson,at.if these threshold elements are met,we then consider whether the federal action would have the practical effect of enjoining the state proceedings and whether an exception to younger applies.see gilbertson,at.each element must be satisfied,amerisourcebergen,at,and the date for determining whether younger applies is the date the federal action is filed,gilbertson,at.
the state proceedings here did not fall within the three exceptional categories of cases identified in sprint and nopsi.first,obviously they were not parallel state criminal proceedings.
second,neither the commissioner approval of scif premium calculation nor the los angeles superior court affirmance was an order at the core of california court system,juidice,at,im
