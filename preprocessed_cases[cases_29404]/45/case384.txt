background 
in may,lerner leased a new car from mercedes benz credit corporation mbcc.to protect itself from damages arising out of the use of the leased car,mbcc maintained insurance coverage with allianz.isabella signed the lease agreement lease as a dimitry agreed to be the guarantor.the lease required the lessees to obtain liability insurance for the vehicle in the amount of at least per person and per occurrence for bodily injury and death.
the lease also contained an indemnity provision,stating that if mbcc is subjected to any claims,losses,injuries,expenses,or costs related to the use,maintenance or condition of the vehicle,the lessees will pay all of mbcc resulting costs and expenses,including attorneys fees.
as required by the lease,lerner obtained the per person minimum amount of liability insurance from allstate,her insurer.the allstate insurance policy provides 
allstate will pay for all damages a person insured is legally obligated to of bodily injury or property damage 
under these coverages,your policy protects a person insured from claims for accidents arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use,loading or unloading of the auto we insure.
we will defend a person insured if sued as the result of a covered auto accident.this defense will be supplied even if the suit is groundless,false or fraudulent.we will defend that person at our own expense,with counsel of our choice and,may settle any claim or suit if we feel this is appropriate.
in june,lerner drove through a red light in new york and collided with a car owned and operated by robert baron.robert baron son,andrew,was a passenger and he sustained injuries.
ii.state court action 
in september,andrew baron mother commenced a personal injury action on andrew behalf in the new york supreme court,nassau county state court action.the defendants included robert baron,lerner,and mbcc.robert baron and lerner were named as negligent drivers mbcc was sued as the owner of the mercedes benz 
initially,lerner and mbcc were both represented by attorneys merlino and tusa,who were selected by allstate.it soon became apparent that lerner policy might not be sufficient to cover a potential damage award.mbcc thus retained its own counsel,alfredo alvarado.mbcc then against lerner for contractual indemnity.mbcc asserted that,if andrew baron recovered a judgment against mbcc,then mbcc would be entitled to indemnity from lerner under the lease.
in may,the state court action was settled for and the parties entered an infant compromise order.the liability was apportioned as follows robert baron paid allstate paid on behalf of lerner and mbcc,through its insurer,allianz,paid the remaining.the payment by allstate represented the total coverage limit under its policy with lerner.settling the state court action,andrew baron provided three separate stipulations of discontinuance,one to each of the three defendants.notably and significantly,lerner did not obtain a general release or stipulation discontinuing mbcc.
iii.federal court action 
ten months later,allianz,as subrogee of mbcc,commenced this diversity action against lerner,isabella,and dimitry in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york wexler.suing for breach of contract,allianz alleged that the defendants breached the lease by failing to indemnify mbcc for the allianz spent to settle the state court action.allianz sought the plus at least in attorneys fees incurred by and on behalf of mbcc.
responding to allianz,the defendants impleaded allstate as well as tusa and merlino,the attorneys from the state court action.the complaint alleged that allstate breached its duty to defend and indemnify lerner against mbcc and allianz claims and the attorneys committed legal malpractice by failing to get a release from mbcc concerning its against lerner.subsequently,isabella and dimitry,while remaining defendants in the original action,discontinued their claims,leaving lerner as the sole plaintiff.
in june,the defendants and allianz for summary judgment.the defendants moved to dismiss allianz claim on the ground that it was barred by res judicata.they argued that allianz subrogor,mbcc,asserted an identical claim for contractual indemnification against lerner in the state court action and that the settlement and discontinuances of the state court action barred the present action.allianz sought summary judgment on its contractual indemnification claim.
in december,the district court denied the defendants motion and granted allianz for summary judgment.allianz i,d at.in denying the defendants motion,the court held that mbcc contractual claim was not barred by res judicata because it was neither expressly nor impliedly disposed of by the stipulations settling plaintiff personal injury claims against the defendants.id.at.in granting allianz for summary judgment,the court rejected the defendants sole argument about an alleged ambiguity in the lease.id.at.the court thus found no question of fact as to the lease enforceability.id.at.
in january,the defendants allstate and the attorneys moved for summary judgment,arguing that allstate had no duty to defend or indemnify lerner in the federal breach of contract action commenced by allianz the attorneys were not negligent in representing lerner and lerner could not prove that their negligence proximately caused her damages.
in february,the district court granted allstate and the attorneys motions and dismissed the complaint.allianz ii,d at.
in analyzing lerner claim against allstate,the court held that allianz claim against lerner was not within the scope of the automobile insurance policy issued by allstate to lerner.id.at.the court reasoned that allstate policy covered bodily injury or property damage claims arising out of an accident involving use of the car,whereas allianz claim against lerner sought contractual money damages sustained by mbcc as a result of lerner use of the vehicle.see id.at.
in analyzing lerner claim against the attorneys,the court held that lerner failed to create an issue of fact as to the element of proximate cause.id.at.the court concluded that lerner could not prove that if the attorneys had indeed asked mbcc to release lerner from the indemnity clause in the lease,mbcc would have done so.id.in reaching this conclusion,the court relied on the affidavit of alfredo alvarado,the attorney who represented mbcc in the state court action after mbcc retained separate counsel from those defending lerner.in his affidavit,alvarado states that at all times it was my intention to reserve the indemnification rights of mbcc and of its insurance company.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in february,a final judgment was entered granting allianz motion for summary judgment ordering the defendants to indemnify allianz for and granting allstate and the attorneys motions for summary judgment.
the defendants now appeal the award of summary judgment to allianz.in addition,lerner appeals the dismissal of her complaint against allstate and the attorneys.we address each argument seriatim.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.june town of westfield,cir.we will affirm the judgment only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and if the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
ii.defendants appeal contractual indemnification 
the defendants argue that the district court erred in concluding that the lease indemnity provision is unambiguous and in granting summary judgment to allianz on its claim for contractual indemnification in the amount of.
whether a contract is clear or ambiguous is a question of law.kass kass.ambiguity is determined by looking within the four corners of the document,not to outside sources.id.an ambiguous term is one that is reasonably susceptible to more than one reading,or one as to which reasonable minds could differ.see van wagner adver.s m.a contractual ambiguity generally renders summary judgment inappropriate in a breach of contract action.see compagnie financiere de cic et de europeenne merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir observing that a court may resolve ambiguity in contractual language as a matter of law if the evidence presented about the parties intended meaning is so that no reasonable person could decide the contrary quoting banco do brasil,cir alteration in original.
the indemnity provision in the lease provides that if mbcc is subjected to any claims,losses,injuries,expenses,or costs related to the use,maintenance or condition of the vehicle,lerner will pay all of mbcc resulting costs and expenses,including attorneys fees emphasis added.
in opposition to allianz summary judgment motion below,the defendants argued that the lease was ambiguous as to whether their indemnity obligation applied only to the mandatory amount of insurance coverage or to excess claims not covered by insurance.the district court flatly rejected the defendants sole argument which,incidentally,they have abandoned on appeal.allianz i,d at.
now,for the first time,defendants argue that two additional ambiguities in the lease preclude the award of summary judgment to allianz.first,they highlight the term subjected to and ask whether mbcc was indeed subjected to liability by voluntarily settling the state court action as distinct from being found liable by a judge or jury.second,they argue that the extent of indemnification was ambiguous because the lease required the defendants to indemnify mbcc for its resulting costs and expenses,not the allegedly greater value of all of its claims,losses,injuries,and expenses.
before we can address these arguments,the defendants must overcome a procedural hurdle.i t is a general rule that an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.greene united states,cir.nevertheless,because this rule is prudential,not jurisdictional,we have discretion to consider waived arguments.sniado bank austria ag,cir per curiam.we have exercised this discretion where necessary to avoid a manifest injustice or where the argument presents a question of law and there is no need for additional.id.
the circumstances here do not militate in favor of an exercise of discretion to address the new arguments on appeal.because both arguments are based on the terms of the lease,they were both available to the defendants below.see id.availability of argument below weighs against exercising discretion to hear the belated argument on appeal.defendants proffer no reason for their failure to raise the arguments below,nor do they suggest that there will be any great injustice if we refuse to address them.in these circumstances,we decline the invitation to address the untimely arguments.see greene,at entertaining issues raised for the first time on appeal is discretionary with the panel hearing the appeal.
thus,we affirm the district court ruling that the defendants are required to indemnify allianz.
iii.lerner appeal breach of the duty to defend and indemnify and legal malpractice 
next,we consider lerner challenge to the february decision granting summary judgment to allstate and the attorneys,thereby dismissing her complaint.
lerner breach of contract claim against allstate 
lerner argues that the district court erred in dismissing her claims against allstate for breaching its duties to defend and indemnify her against mbcc and allianz indemnification claims.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that while allstate breached its duty to defend,it did not breach its duty to indemnify lerner.
it is a legal principle that the duty of an insurer to defend is broader than its duty to pay.ruder finn seaboard surety.the duty to defend arises whenever the allegations within the four corners of the underlying complaint potentially give rise to a covered claim,or where the insurer has actual knowledge of facts establishing a reasonable possibility of coverage.frontier insulation contractors,merchs.mut,quoting fitzpatrick am.honda motor.an insurer is relieved of the duty to defend only if there is no possible factual or legal basis on which the insurer might eventually be held to be obligated to indemnify the insured under any provision of the insurance policy.servidone constr.sec.ins,internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.
the narrower duty to indemnify arises only if the claim for which the insured has been judged liable lies within the policy coverage.frontier,at.thus,while the duty to defend is measured against the possibility of a recovery,the duty to pay is determined by the actual basis for the insured liability to a third person.id.quoting servidone,at.
observing that the actual basis for lerner liability to allianz was established in december,two months before the district court considered allstate summary judgment motion,the court was misled into analyzing the claim against lerner under the narrower duty to indemnify standard.in concluding that allstate policy did not cover allianz claim against lerner,the court wrote 
as a lawsuit involving a breach of a lease agreement,the claim for which lerner seeks coverage is not a claim of bodily injury or property damage arising out of an accident involving the vehicle.instead,it is a claim for contractual money damages sustained by mbcc as a result of lerner use of the vehicle.this is not a claim for which allstate insured lerner and as such,the complaint of allianz is not within the coverage provided to lerner by allstate.
allianz ii,d at.
lerner maintains that the district court misinterpreted allstate policy,which obligates the carrier to defend an insured sued as the result of a covered auto accident.specifically,lerner argues that mbcc liability to the infant plaintiff and,by extension,its and allianz claims against lerner,resulted from a covered auto accident,and do not depend for viability on whether the allianz lawsuit itself is a claim for bodily injury and damage.we agree with lerner.
the central issue in this case is whether allstate had a duty to defend and indemnify mbcc and allianz claims against lerner and this requires an interpretation of the allstate policy.
under new york law,the interpretation of an insurance policy generally presents a question of law.see hartford accident indem.wesolowski,see also mcginniss employers reinsurance.in the interpretation process,an unambiguous provision must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.state of new york am.mfrs.mut.ins,dep t.an insurance policy must be liberally construed in favor of the insured.stainless,employers fire ins,dep t.
with these principles in mind,we focus on the terms of the policy.the policy provides that allstate will defend a person insured if sued as the result of a covered auto accident emphasis added.the district court did not disc
