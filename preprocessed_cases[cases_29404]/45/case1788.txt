we are asked to decide whether an adverse claim to a stake may be so lacking in substance that a neutral stakeholder can not interplead in good faith.interpleader is proper when a stakeholder has at least a good faith belief that there are conflicting colorable claims.we conclude that appellee met this requirement.
background 
gail and irwin michelman submitted a life insurance application to lincoln national life insurance company in to obtain coverage for their minor daughter,elizabeth.at the time,gail and irwin were married.the application listed gail and irwin as the primary beneficiaries and their other daughter,jessica,as a contingent beneficiary.the application designated gail as the policy owner,with policy ownership passing to elizabeth upon her birthday.lincoln subsequently issued the policy memorializing this.
whether irwin also had an ownership interest in elizabeth life insurance policy is less certain.the insurance contract unhelpfully defined the policy owner in the singular as the owner identified in the application or a successor.although irwin name was written on the line of the application designated for the contingent owner,the michelmans may have intended for irwin to be a primary rather than a contingent owner.the application form did not provide a space for more than one primary owner.nonetheless,in the space to be completed i f two or more primary owners are named,the michelmans checked the box indicating that they were to be joint owners with a right of survivorship between them.
the michelmans themselves dispute what their intent was.irwin testified at his deposition that he and gail intended for both of them to be primary owners of the policy,but that his name was listed on the line for contingent owner because there was no space on the form to insert the name of the second primary owner.at gail deposition,she expressed her belief that irwin was only a contingent owner.for its part,lincoln was inconsistent on the ownership issue.its records reflected that gail was the policy primary owner and irwin was the contingent owner,but its claims examiner stated in a declaration that the insurance application names gail and irwin as joint owners.
gail and irwin divorced in.the divorce decree did not include elizabeth life insurance policy among the assets that it catalogued.in,when elizabeth had not yet reached the age of,gail submitted a form to lincoln purporting to remove irwin as a beneficiary and leave herself as the sole primary beneficiary and jessica as the contingent beneficiary.lincoln acknowledged this change a few days later in a letter to gail 
elizabeth died on august,at the age of.although the autopsy revealed no clear cause of death,the medical examiner found that elizabeth multiple sclerosis and the high level of oxycodone in her blood were contributing factors.elizabeth parents raised concerns about what they considered to be suspicious circumstances surrounding their daughter death but the sheriff department found no evidence that another person was involved.gail,who was out of state at the time of elizabeth death,was never suspected of foul play.
on august,irwin called lincoln and stated that lincoln should look for fraud in the beneficiary information for elizabeth life insurance policy.irwin told lincoln that he and his wife were originally equal beneficiaries under the policy and that their divorce decree prohibited any changes.
on september,irwin attorney wrote a letter to lincoln requesting that it not pay any benefits on elizabeth policy before certain issues were resolved 
please be advised that elizabeth ann michelman has died under suspicious circumstances and that her death is currently being investigated by the police as a possible homicide.
when questioned upon elizabeth death gail michelman claimed that elizabeth life insurance policy with lincoln financial group had lapsed several years ago when in fact it was in full force.elizabeth life insurance policy is a community property asset of the michelman marriage that was not awarded to either party in their divorce.it has also come to irwin michelman attention that gail michelman,in violation of an agreement that she had with michelman,changed the beneficiary on elizabeth life policy without his knowledge or permission.it also appears that lincoln financial group failed to contact elizabeth michelman about naming a new beneficiary upon reaching adulthood.
on september,irwin submitted a completed claim form to lincoln requesting the policy proceeds.
lincoln wrote to gail and irwin on october.lincoln informed them that its records showed gail to be the beneficiary but acknowledged that irwin had made a conflicting claim.admitting that the policy proceeds were due and payable,lincoln explained that by paying one party it faced the risk of being sued by the other.the solution,lincoln concluded,was to file an interpleader action unless gail and irwin could agree how to distribute the proceeds.although gail and irwin subsequently exchanged letters regarding settlement proposals,some of which they shared with lincoln,they failed to reach an accord.
gail submitted a claim form on october.in the accompanying letter,she stated that irwin had no valid claim and that an action in interpleader would be frivolous.gail asserted that lincoln bore the responsibility of resolving any dispute between her and irwin.she asked lincoln what proof irwin had offered in support of his claim.
over the next three months,gail and irwin exchanged a series of letters and telephone calls.gail repeatedly pressed her position that she was the beneficiary,irwin had no legitimate claim to the insurance proceeds,and lincoln was obligated to pay her rather than force her to litigate against her.lincoln maintained that the policy proceeds were due and payable,gail was the current beneficiary according to its records,but it could not pay gail while irwin disputed the validity of the change removing him as a beneficiary.lincoln reiterated its plan to file an interpleader action unless gail and irwin resolved their conflicting claims within days.other than requesting that irwin provide proof of his claim,lincoln never conducted any further investigation into the truth of irwin allegations.
on january,gail filed suit in state court to recover the insurance proceeds,asserting claims against lincoln for bad faith,violation of washington consumer protection act cpa,and breach of contract.lincoln removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.seeking to interplead the insurance funds,lincoln filed a counterclaim against gail and a third party complaint against irwin.
before discovery had commenced,lincoln moved for summary judgment on all of gail claims.in its august,order,the district court denied gail request for a continuance and granted lincoln summary judgment motion in part.the court found that interpleader was appropriate and dismissed gail claim for breach of contract but denied summary judgment as to gail bad faith and cpa claims,finding that they were independent of lincoln ultimate coverage decision.
after discovery concluded,gail moved the district court to vacate its august summary judgment order and,when that motion was denied,moved the court to reconsider its denial of the motion to vacate.the district court denied gail motion for reconsideration.
gail and lincoln each moved for summary judgment on gail remaining claims and irwin cross and counterclaims.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gail and lincoln on irwin claims and determined that gail was entitled to all of the proceeds from elizabeth life insurance policy.irwin has not appealed those decisions.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lincoln on gail extracontractual claims,finding that lincoln acted in compliance with state insurance regulations.gail now appeals that order,the august,summary judgment order,and the orders denying her motion to vacate and motion for reconsideration.

iii.discussion 
interpleader 
although gail challenges several aspects of the district court rulings,her core contention below and on appeal is that lincoln should incur liability for its decision to interplead.she concedes that lincoln had no obligation to determine the ultimate truth of irwin competing claim but maintains that irwin arguments were not cognizable claims against the policy and,even if they were,lincoln lacked a sufficient factual basis to evaluate whether irwin claims were colorable.
federal rule of civil procedure authorizes a stakeholder to join p ersons with claims that may expose the stakeholder to double or multiple liability and requires such persons to interplead.a.here,the district court stated that the bald assertion of a claim against the policy,without any colorable support,is probably not enough to warrant an interpleader action.the court did not consider the issue further,however,because it found that lincoln had a good faith belief that it faced the potential of multiple liabilities.gail challenges that finding.
beginning in,the first three federal interpleader statutes required claimants to be bona fide for jurisdictional purposes.see act of,stat.act of,stat.act of may,stat.this requirement was formally dropped from the statute in,see act of,stat,and was not adopted the following year in federal rule of civil procedure,under which the interpleader here arises.nonetheless,courts continue to hold interpleading stakeholders to a good faith standard.see,aaron mahl,cir cna ins.waters,cir.
this circuit has never squarely held that a stakeholder must have a good faith belief about the existence of competing claims in order to initiate an interpleader action.gail directs us to dictum in new york life insurance lee,cir.like the instant case,lee involved an insurance beneficiary assertion that the insurer had no right to interplead because it was obvious that the purported adverse claim was sham and frivolous relying on authority,we opined that t here is no doubt that an asserted adverse claim may be so wanting in substance that interpleader under the statute may not be justified.id.at citing john hancock mut.life ins.beardslee,cir.the district court did not reach the issue,however,and our decision rested on alternative grounds.see id.at w e find no occasion for inquiring whether the alleged competing claim was lacking in sufficient substance to warrant interpleader under the rule applied in beardslee.
in other cases,we have implicitly assumed that a good faith standard applies to interpleader actions.for example,in palomas land cattle baldwin,cir,a claimant argued that the stakeholder had interpleaded in bad faith.we did not question that such a claim was cognizable,but noted only that the evidence did not warrant such a finding.id.at.more recently,in minnesota mutual life insurance ensley,cir,we held that an insurer good faith belief that it faced the possibility of multiple claims foreclosed a claimant breach of contract claim because the insurer had satisfied its obligation under the contract by instituting the interpleader action.id.at.this circuit has also held that courts may impose the costs of suit on a stakeholder who interpleads in bad faith.see gelfgren republic life ins,cir citing murphy travelers ins,cir.all of these decisions presuppose a good faith requirement.
therefore,we agree with the principle articulated in lee and now expressly hold that in order to avail itself of the interpleader remedy,a stakeholder must have a good faith belief that there are or may be colorable competing claims to the stake.this is not an onerous requirement.see james moore,moore federal practice c ed.in most cases,it is not difficult for the stakeholder to meet the requirement of a reasonable or good faith fear of multiple litigation,and courts appear to require merely that the stakeholder concern in this regard be more than conjectural.
the threshold to establish good faith is necessarily low so as not to conflict with interpleader pragmatic purpose,which is for the stakeholder to protect itself against the problems posed by multiple claimants to a single fund.mack kuckenmeister,cir quoting ensley,at.the possibility of double liability is only one such problem another is the cost of litigation,which does not depend on the merits of adverse claims.id.citing trs.of dirs.guild of pension benefits plans tise,cir see also life ins.welch,a stakeholder,acting in good faith,may maintain a suit in interpleader to avoid the vexation and expense of resisting adverse claims,even though he believes only one of them is meritorious.
although an interpleading stakeholder need not sort out the merits of conflicting claims as a prerequisite to interpleader,good faith requires a real and reasonable fear of exposure to double liability or the vexation of conflicting claims.see union cent.life ins.hamilton steel,cir s o long as there exists a real and reasonable fear of exposure to double liability or the vexation of conflicting claims,jurisdiction in interpleader is not dependent upon the merits of the claims of the parties interpleaded internal quotation marks omitted accord,paterson,walke pratt,cir.
a real and reasonable fear does not mean that the interpleading party must show that the purported adverse claimant might eventually prevail.aaron,at.
of course,the claims of some interpleaded parties will ultimately be determined to be without merit.that,however,is the very purpose of the proceeding and it would make little sense in terms either of protecting the stakeholder or of doing justice expeditiously to dismiss one possible claimant because another possible claimant asserts the claim of the first is without merit.
id.quoting hamilton steel,at internal quotation marks omitted citing beardslee,at.rather,the stakeholder is required to demonstrate that the adverse claim has a minimal threshold level of substantiality.id.quoting indianapolis colts,at accord equitable life assurance soc y of the united states porterenglehart,cir t o support an interpleader action,the adverse claims need attain only a minimal threshold level of substantiality.quoting charles alan wright et,federal practice procedure ed.the adverse claim whether actual or potential must be at least colorable.see fonseca regan,cir dunbar united states,cir bauer uniroyal tire,cir describing interpleader claimants as having a colorable interest in the fund.
this rule is consistent with our prior decisions.in ensley,there was doubt as to whether the insured brother or wife was the beneficiary of his life insurance policy.the insured originally owned the policy.the policy named his wife as the beneficiary.a document that the wife may or may not have forged purported to transfer ownership to her.after an investigation,the insured contacted the insurance company,which restored the policy ownership to him.he then designated his brother as the sole beneficiary.the insured and his wife submitted a stipulated decree to dissolve their marriage,but the insured died five days before the state court entered it and thus was legally married at the time of his death.ensley,at.
although the insured brother was the only person to file a claim to the insurance proceeds,we held that interpleader was proper because the insurer faced potential liability to both the wife and the brother.id.at.as we explained,interpleader extends to potential,as well as actual,claims.id.at citing a dakota livestock.keim,cir.
mack also illustrates the minimal threshold of substantiality required for interpleader.the owner of a k plan was in the process of divorcing his wife and had stipulated to a court order naming her as an alternate plan payee.before the order could be entered,however,the plan owner murdered his wife and shot the state court judge presiding over their divorce.the state court entered an order nunc pro tunc transferring the plan payment to the wife as of a date prior to her death.while this decision was being appealed,the plan trustee filed an interpleader action to resolve the competing claims between the plan owner and the deceased wife estate.mack,at.
we held that interpleader was proper even though the state court order had been affirmed by the state supreme court and the state court judgment was not preempted by federal law as the plan owner had argued.that the district court ultimately disposed of the plan owner adverse claim to the plan proceeds did not render interpleader improper because the district court could not have made that determination without first addressing the claim merits.id.at.we explained that evaluating a claim merits before determining that interpleader is appropriate is backwards of the usual order,and would defeat the purposes of interpleader.id.at citing john hancock mut.life ins.kraft,cir.
in contrast,the seventh circuit decision in beardslee,which we cited approvingly in lee,addressed a situation where the facts did not justify interpleader.the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy had changed back and forth several times between the insured daughter and wife.beardslee,at.while the wife was the designated beneficiary,the insured and his daughter discussed changing the policy again to designate the daughter as the beneficiary,but the insurer falsely told them that the beneficiary could not be changed.id.at.
after the insured death,the daughter sent a letter to the insurer in which she explained the situation and expressed her hope that the insurer would be able to help her cover the insured medical and burial expenses.she noted that the insurance proceeds would have been just enough to cover those expenses and added that her letter would have been unnecessary if,before her father death,the insurer had been honest about his ability to change the beneficiary.id.at.
the seventh circuit found that the insurer was unreasonable in filing the interpleader action because the daughter had no actual or potential claim against the policy.the only possible legal claim by the daughter to any money from the insurer would have been a tort action based on the alleged misinformation given to her by the insurer about the possibility of changing the policy.this potential claim was not a basis for interpleader because it did not suggest the daughter entitlement to the policy proceeds.id.at.
as these cases illustrate,a stakeholder must interplead in good faith,but the threshold showing is not exacting.interpleader is appropriate where the stakeholder reasonably fears that there may be multiple parties with colorable adverse claims to the stake.we now consider whether lincoln met this standard.
irwin submitted a claim form to lincoln requesting that it pay him the proceeds of elizabeth life insurance policy.while this conduct evinces irwin claim to the policy proceeds,this does not end the inquiry as to whether irwin claim was colorable.at the time lincoln decided to interplead,its only clues as to irwin grounds for entitlement to the policy proceeds were its own records of the policy,irwin phone call,and his attorney subsequent letter in which he asked lincoln to refrain from paying gail the proceeds of elizabeth life insurance policy until several issues were resolved.
first,irwin intimated that gail may have played a role in elizabeth death.the district court felt that the ongoing investigation into elizabeth cause of death raised the possibility that the designated beneficiary could be legally barred from recovering.
washington slayer statute prohibits recovery of life insurance proceeds by a beneficiary complicit in the insured death.see.if the slayer statute had precluded gail from recovering the insurance proceeds,these funds would have been payable to jessica,the contingent beneficiary.such an eventuality would not have supported a claim by irwin.
furthermore,by the time lincoln actually filed its counterclaim in interpleader,it had become evident from the final autopsy report that gail had no involvement in elizabeth death.therefore,irwin allegations of suspicious circumstances surrounding elizabeth death did not support lincoln decision to interplead.
next,irwin claimed that gail was questioned about elizabeth life insurance policy after elizabeth death and gail falsely stated that the policy had lapsed.irwin did not explain who questioned gail or how this alleged misrepresentation,without more,would support his claim against the policy.much like the innuendo relating to the suspicious circumstances of elizabeth death,this assertion appears to be aimed more at undermining gail credibility than bolstering irwin contractual entitlement to the policy proceeds.this claim,if it can be described as such,did not constitute a colorable claim that would justify interpleader.
in addition,irwin claimed to have a side agreement with gail that precluded her from removing him as a beneficiary without his knowledge or permission.even if this were true,the fact that gail violated an agreement with irwin to which lincoln was not a party would not invalidate the change in beneficiary.see.no agreement in conflict with,modifying,or extending any contract of insurance shall be valid unless in writing and made a part of the policy.such a claim supplied no basis for interpleader.
irwin also asserted in his letter that lincoln did not contact elizabeth when she turned about naming a new beneficiary.this fact could not serve as the basis for a claim against the policy because it does not call into question gail status as the sole beneficiary.assuming lincoln had an obligation to contact elizabeth about naming a new beneficiary irwin provided no hint as to the source of such an obligation lincoln apparent failure to meet it would not support a colorable claim against the policy.as in beardslee,any recovery to which irwin might be entitled would come from lincoln individually rather than from elizabeth policy.see at.
lastly,irwin informed lincoln that elizabeth life insurance policy was a community property asset of his marriage to gail that was not awarded to either party in their divorce.this was true.see.t he beneficial interest of a spouse in a policy upon the life of a child of the spouses,however such interest is created,shall be deemed to be a community interest and not a separate interest,unless expressly otherwise provided by the policy.we have previously upheld the validity of interpleader based on a claimant possible community property interest in insurance proceeds.bayona,at.
although elizabeth insurance policy provided that the owner could change the beneficiary designation the insurance application and the policy itself insofar as it incorporated the application ownership designation was ambiguous whether gail was the sole owner or whether she and irwin jointly owned it.this difference was material.to the extent gail and irwin were joint owners,they became tenants in common of the policy at the time of their divorce because the dissolution decree failed to provide for the policy disposition.see yeats yeats estate.as a tenant in common,gail could not have divested irwin of his beneficial interest in the policy without his consent.see generally in re foreclosure of liens,discussing rights and circumscriptions.
undoubtedly,gail possessed affirmative defenses such as laches or ratification of the change by irwin or elizabeth,but that is beside the point.interpleader is designed so that stakeholders do not have to make legal predictions about the merits of claims without the benefit of civil discovery.the ambiguity as to primary ownership of the policy appeared on the face of the insurance application,which lincoln already had in its possession.given the uncertainty about irwin ownership of the policy,lincoln had a reasonable fear that gail and irwin would make overlapping claims to the proceeds.
we reject gail contention that lincoln should have investigated further before interpleading.interpleader proceedings are pragmatic in nature and should be resolved expeditiously.see excess cas.reinsurance ass ins.comm r,cir see also hunter fed.life ins,cir the remedy of interpleader should,of course,be a simple,speedy,efficient and economical remedy.it is this ease and efficiency that makes interpleader a valuable procedural device for insurers to resolve conflicting claims upon the proceeds of an insurance policy.tise,at.requiring a stakeholder to investigate further when an adverse claimant has already asserted a colorable claim against the stake would diminish interpleader purpose of limiting litigation expenses because irwin had a colorable claim to the insurance proceeds,lincoln need not have expended additional time or resources trying to assess the merits of his claim.
the availability of interpleader need not produce a harsh result for a legitimate claimant who is forced into interpleader due to a rival claimant assertions.although judgment in interpleader ordinarily entitles the stakeholder to an award of attorneys fees from the interpleaded funds for work performed filing the action in interpleader,see schirmer stevedoring seaboard stevedoring,cir,these fees are normally not high.moreover,a district court has great discretion in apportioning the stakeholder fees among the winning and losing claimants,see id.at,providing a mechanism for vexatious claimants to incur the costs of their meritless claims.gail chose not to seek attorneys fees from irwin 
we conclude that lincoln interpleaded in good faith.it knew from irwin phone call that irwin had a potential claim arising from his asserted of the policy and gail unilateral change to the beneficiary designation.the ambiguity of the insurance application showed that irwin assertion was not frivolous.while this alone sufficed to justify interpleader,irwin took additional steps that further indicated his intent to litigate.he had his attorney send lincoln a letter requesting that it refrain from paying gail the policy proceeds.he filed a claim form demanding the policy proceeds.lincoln thus had a real and reasonable fear of colorable conflicting claims.consequently,the district court judgment in interpleader was proper.
breach of contract 
the district court also did not err in granting lincoln summary judgment on gail claim that lincoln breached the insurance policy.from the beginning,lincoln admitted that the policy proceeds were due and payable.it promptly deposited them with the district court.lincoln good faith decision to interplead entitled it to summary judgment on gail contractual claim.see ensley,at.because the district court summary judgment order was proper,the court did not abuse its discretion by denying gail subsequent motion to vacate the order and,thereafter,gail motion for reconsideration.
gail also appeals the district court denial of her motion for a continuance of the summary judgment proceedings.rule d offers relief to a litigant who,faced with a summary judgment motion,shows the court by affidavit or declaration that it can not present facts essential to justify its opposition.d the court may defer considering the motion or deny it allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery or issue any other appropriate order.id.
gail requested time to discover information regarding lincoln procedures for investigating and resolving disputes over life insurance proceeds between,the steps it took to investigate irwin claim,and its underwriting file.gail did not submit an affidavit or declaration in support of her request.more importantly,as the district court correctly observed,none of gail proposed discovery pertained to her breach of contract claim.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a continuance.
bad faith and consumer protection act claims 
lastly,gail challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of lincoln on her bad faith and cpa claims.these claims were predicated on alleged violations of state insurance regulations and washington insurance fair conduct act ifca.the district court concluded that,for the most part,lincoln had not violated the statutory and regulatory provisions at issue.in the two instances where the district court found that lincoln had failed to comply with the insurance code,it determined that gail did not suffer any compensable injury as a result.
an insurer bad faith handling of an insurance claim,like any other tort,is analyzed according to the principles of duty,breach,and proximately caused damages.mut.of enumclaw ins.dan paulson,quoting smith safeco ins.the insurer commits bad faith if its actions are unreasonable,frivolous,or unfounded.id.quoting kirk airy ins.
washington regulations define specific acts and practices that breach an insurer duty of good faith.am.mfrs.mut.ins.osborn,citing.admin.code to tank state farm fire cas.in addition,a breach of these regulations in particular any subsection of washington administrative code wac section constitutes a per se unfair trade practice violation that is independently actionable under the cpa.see osborn,p d at.
an insurer acts in bad faith by f ailing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims.admin.code,and r efusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation,id.the district court did not point to any specific policy that lincoln utilized when investigating claims other than to have its claims adjusters use their common sense nonetheless,it decided that any violation of wac and was harmless because irwin had asserted a colorable claim and any further investigation would have been irrelevant.
lincoln did not refuse to pay a claim.it fully acknowledged that it owed elizabeth insurance proceeds to somebody.lincoln merely refused to pay any particular claimant until a court determined who was legally entitled to the proceeds.this was fully consistent with state law.see farmers ins.of romas,concluding that insurer did not act in bad faith by filing interpleader action because it was not unreasonable for the insurer to take the position that a finding first needed to be made as to who was the insured person under its policy.thus,gail claim under wac necessarily fails.
we agree with the district court that,to the extent lincoln claims investigation policy was unreasonable,any shortcomings in the policy were harmless.lincoln decision to interplead was sound and it had no duty to investigate thereafter.the district court properly granted lincoln summary judgment on gail claim under wac.
wac prohibits an insurer from m isrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions.gail contends that lincoln violated this subsection when it implied that irwin claims were being investigated or adjusted in some way promised to pay the policy proceeds to the named beneficiary without disclosing an exception for interpleader and failed to notify gail that it had a policy of not providing information regarding competing claims.
the district court correctly rejected gail first argument because the facts did not support it.as the court observed,lincoln clearly and consistently informed gail that it would file an interpleader action if she and irwin were unable to settle their dispute.lincoln only reference to an adjustment or investigation process was a december,letter acknowledging receipt of a complaint that gail had filed with the insurance commissioner and noting that lincoln compliance department had requested additional information for investigation.the district court did not err in concluding that this brief statement did not
