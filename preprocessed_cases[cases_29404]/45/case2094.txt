signature development companies,and village homes,both colorado entities collectively,signature,appeal from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of royal insurance company,an illinois corporation royal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to royal as to royal duty to indemnify and we remand to the district court for calculation of royal contribution as to attorneys fees and costs of defense.
background 
signature is a developer of custom homes.royal issued a general liability insurance policy to signature for the period january,to august,after that time signature changed insurance carriers to aetna casualty surety company,which later became travelers property casualty company travelers.
in april,a group of homeowners that lived in highlands ranch colorado sued signature in colorado state court,alleging that swelling and expanding soils caused property damages to their homes purchased on or after august,the wernli litigation.the plaintiffs,later certified as a class,alleged several claims against signature including negligence,breach of contract,breach of warranties,and violation of the colorado consumer protection act.a separate lawsuit,filed by an individual family in a separate development and county,alleged similar breaches the long litigation.
signature notified travelers of the wernli and long litigations within two weeks of the filing of the wernli litigation.travelers retained the law firm of long jaudon to defend signature,subject to a reservation of rights.travelers advised signature that,because some of the allegations in the wernli and long litigations preceded travelers coverage period,prior carriers ought to receive notification.
signature counsel notified royal about the wernli and long litigations on june.on august,royal notified long jaudon that it was a carrier for signature from january,through january,for signature,and that if it wa s determined that a defense was owed we will payment for all reasonable fees and cost incurred subsequent to the initial tender of this matter.rec.vol.at.royal later acknowledged that its liability coverage actually extended through august,and no longer disputes this fact.
on august,royal sent signature a letter outlining its formal position on coverage,where it agreed to defend signature in both litigations,subject to a detailed reservation of rights.a reservation of rights enables an insurer to assert future defenses based on noncoverage under the policy.see couch on ins.ed.it serves to provide the insured with temporary protection,even though it may turn out that the insured was not entitled to such protection.id.
specifically,royal letter stated 
the complaints are silent as to the timing of any alleged property damage for which damages are sought.royal expressly reserves its right to disclaim coverage should it be determined that all or part of the damages which may be obtained against the insured are determined to be on account of property damages which took place either before the policy period or subsequent to the policy period.
aple.at.royal also reserved the right to seek reimbursement of any monies spent in defense costs.id.at.in addition,royal disclaimed coverage as to property damages resulting from incorrectly performed operations by signature or its contractors or subcontractors.see id.at.
on january,signature counsel notified royal that travelers and signature were engaged in settlement negotiations with the plaintiffs and that discovery had been stayed to encourage early settlement.travelers and signature hoped to settle the pending litigation for approximately million.specifically,signature counsel mentioned a february,meeting at which royal was encouraged to attend.royal neither responded to the letter nor attended the meeting.
there were homes that were closed upon and thus covered by royal policy during the period from january,through august,while royal was signature insurance carrier.royal investigator,aiello,concluded that these homes had experienced structural problems as a result of expansive soil and that a majority of these homes began experiencing soils related problems within the first year.rec.vol,tab,ex.at.in addition,aiello stated that the damages could be a result of poor workmanship or shifting of the structure.id.royal calculated its coverage obligation as,under an allocation method that signature disputes.if aiello conclusion as to poor workmanship was true,the damages would fall under royal disclaimer as to incorrectly performed operations.
in a march,letter,royal extended a offer of contribution to ongoing settlement negotiations,stating that not all of the homes have complained of damages.rec.vol,tab.l.royal tendered a check for in full settlement of its obligation,which signature refused to accept.royal included a restrictive endorsement on the check under which signature would likely forfeit any rights to further payment from royal.
the wernli and long litigations eventually settled for million.travelers agreed to assume percent of the settlement.signature sought the outstanding million from royal,which refused to tender this amount.signature,with the assistance of security from travelers,paid the balance to settle the case.signature then brought this action against royal seeking declaratory relief and compensation for other damages.
in addition,signature has obtained an assignment of travelers claims against royal for contribution to the defense costs and attorneys fees,and seeks reimbursement for those fees in this appeal.royal sought summary judgment,and the district court found that there was no evidence that any of the homes sustained damage during royal coverage period and that royal did not breach its duty to defend and as such granted summary judgment to royal.

we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.simms oklahoma ex rel.dep t of mental health substance abuse,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.when applying this standard,we view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.simms,at.we have jurisdiction under and apply colorado law.

royal duty to defend 
signature contends that royal breached its duty to defend signature under the policy by failing to fully discharge its duties under the policy.specifically,signature argues that royal should have contributed to defense costs and because of its breach of its duty to defend,royal should have been precluded from relying on its coverage defenses.the district court found that signature produced no evidence that royal refused to defend signature.we shall consider each contention in turn.
breach of duty to defend.
under colorado law,an insurer duty to defend arises when the underlying complaint against the insurer alleges any facts that might fall within the coverage of the policy.hecla mining new hampshire ins,en banc.the duty to defend is separate from and broader than the duty to indemnify.see id.furthermore,where the insurer duty to defend is not clear from the pleadings,but the allegations do state a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage,the insurer must abide by its duty to defend the claim.id.
as to its duty to defend,royal policy stated we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages.rec.vol.iii at.the allegations in the wernli and long litigations were based on signature negligence and breach of warranty,which might be occurrences under royal policy as defined therein.an occurrence could include negligence and breach of warranty.see id.at.the district court concluded that signature produced no evidence that royal refused to defend it.rec.vol.i,tab,at dist.order filed july.
signature contends,however,that royal did not uphold its duty to defend or to participate in settlement proceedings.first,signature states that royal had agreed to split defense costs and yet ignored subsequent written demands for those costs.colorado law recognizes that primary coverage insurers are duty bound to defend the insured and are required to contribute their pro rata share to the defense costs.national cas.great fire ins.signature,relying in part on lujan gonzales,also contends that royal may not rely on the defense provided by travelers and may not as a result shirk from its defense costs obligations.see id.holding that insurer refusal to defend was breach of its duty to defend,notwithstanding the defense rendered by the other insurer.finally signature contends that royal failed to complete a reasonable and prudent investigation of all aspects of the underlying case,as required by aetna cas.sur.kornbluth.
royal counters signature argument by stressing the relevance of its reservation of rights under colorado law.royal does not dispute that its duty to defend was triggered and argues that it agreed to defend signature as to property damages that occurred while royal was signature carrier.in fact,royal acknowledged its duty to defend,but undertook the duty subject to a reservation of rights.see hecla mining,at stating t he appropriate course of action for an insurer who believes that it is under no obligation to defend,is to provide a defense to the insured under a reservation of its rights to seek reimbursement should the facts at trial prove that the incident resulting in liability was not covered by the policy.
royal asserts that it upheld its defense obligation it appointed the law firm of long jaudon,and conducted a thorough and diligent internal investigation as to its duty to indemnify.royal argues that the record indicates that it was prepared to reimburse travelers for its defense costs as required under colorado law.see rec.vol,tab depo.of donalee pelovsky,royal claims adjuster supervisor national cas,at.royal set up a reserve for the claim and avers it was prepared to contribute its share of defense costs and indemnity payment to the extent signature claims fell within the coverage of royal policy.royal contends it paid no bills because travelers paid defense counsel bills.royal received no invoices until they were produced in this litigation.
but we agree with signature that although royal pursued the above actions,these actions do not amount to an active independent defense of signature claims.we disagree with the district court conclusion,and hold that royal breached its duty to defend by not fully discharging its duty.rather than discharging its duty to defend,royal was nonresponsive to settlement overtures,failed to communicate with its insured,and failed to fully cooperate in settlement negotiations.see kornbluth,at.although colorado courts have not specifically addressed the issue,we agree that t he fortuitous existence of another insurer who wa s willing to meet its own obligations did not excuse royal from discharging its duty to defend.aetna cas.sur.coronet ins,d,see lujan,at.finally,the district court determination of noncoverage as to royal policy might have been a defense to the claims in the underlying action,but the district court noncoverage ruling did not excuse royal from fully defending the claims in the first instance.
damages from royal breach of its duty to defend 
having determined that royal breached its duty to defend,we turn now to what damages signature has incurred.as determined above,the presence of another insurer will not protect royal from breach of its duty to defend.again we are faced with a issue that colorado courts have not squarely addressed.royal reminds us that signature received a competent defense and it voluntarily entered an apparently favorable and reasonable settlement agreement.see,employers fire ins.western guar.fund,holding where insureds were not undefended,alternate insurer refusal to defend caused the insureds no harm.signature acceptance of a portion of travelers right to attorneys fees from royal is not evidence of damages flowing from royal breach.when signature accepted the assignment,it had already received the reservation of rights,and was aware that royal might be entitled to reimbursement had royal paid any fees.
however,to hold that royal is insulated from contributing any defense costs because royal notified signature of its reservation of rights to seek reimbursement should we determine that the events were not covered by royal policy would amount to permitting the insurer to do indirectly what it can not do directly.see national cas,at stating that to find insurer not responsible for contribution would be to reward insurer for refusing to honor its contractual obligations by failing to defend a lawsuit brought against the insured that falls within the terms of the policy.hecla mining demands that an insurer notify the insured of its reservation of rights and requires the insurer to provide a defense.at see also state pacific indem,th,d the insurer must preserve its right to seek reimbursement by undertaking the defense of its insured upon an express reservation of rights,a reservation the insurer may unilaterally impose.emphasis added.
signature had a contract right to have actions against it defended by royal,at royal expense,subject to royal reservation of its rights.a reservation of rights agreement serves to furnish temporary protection to an insured,even though as in this case it may turn out that the insured was not entitled to such protection.couch on ins.we have held royal in breach of that contractual duty because royal offered little or no protection to its insured.further,royal did not seek a declaratory judgment as to its duty after the underlying litigation was resolved.see hecla mining,at the appropriate course of action for an insurer who believes that it is under no obligation to defend,is to provide a defense to the insured under a reservation of its rights to seek reimbursement should the facts at trial prove that the incident resulting in liability was not covered by the policy,or to file a declaratory judgment action after the underlying case has been adjudicated.we can not allow royal to benefit from its breach,for to do so compels the insured to bear the expense of the litigation,and signature is actually no better off financially that if it never had the contract right of a defense from royal.see national cas,at willis corroon v.the home ins,cir en banc holding that,under illinois law,where insurer mishandled a defense which it undertook under a reservation of rights and left insured in the lurch to allow insurer to blatant ly manipulat e the law and file a declaratory judgment action would encourage the worst possible behavior.a natural and proximate result of royal breach was the participation by traveler as the only insurer in the continued litigation and settlement proceedings.traveler subsequently assigned its rights to seek contribution from royal to signature.we hold that signature is therefore entitled to receive from royal a pro rata portion of attorney fees,costs and expenses incurred in reaching settlement in the underlying litigation.see national cas,at.
royal right to raise coverage defenses 
signature contends that because royal failed to adequately defend under a reservation of rights,royal is estopped from challenging coverage under the policy.colorado subscribes to the majority view that an insurer who believes that it is under no obligation to defend must provide a defense if the allegations in the underlying complaint mig
