janopaul block companies,llc,janopaul block,llc together,janopaul,and golub morales,llp golub together with janopaul,petitioners,seek a writ of mandate,supersedeas or other relief to overturn the trial court order compelling them to arbitrate pursuant to civil code section,subdivision c what the court characterized as a fee dispute between petitioners,on the one hand,and real party in interest paul fire and marine insurance company,on the other hand,arising out of a construction defect action against janopaul.
petitioners contend the trial court erred in granting paul motion to compel arbitration and in denying their motion to dismiss the petition to compel arbitration because paul breached its duty to defend and engaged in bad faith conduct by waiting over two years from the date of janopaul initial tender of defense to accept the tender.petitioners further contend if they are allowed to prove paul breach and bad faith in the trial court in advance of arbitration,paul will forfeit be estopped to assert any rights under section,including the right to arbitrate under subdivision c.
as we explain,we grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
a.the underlying action 
janopaul was the owner of the historic el cortez hotel in san diego el cortez,which janopaul planned to restore.janopaul in contracted with paul named insured,ninteman construction company,now known as the sundt companies,together,sundt,to serve as the general contractor for the el cortez project janopaul contract.in the janopaul contract,sundt agreed under an express indemnity provision to defend janopaul for claims arising from sundt work.
in late january,the el cortez owners association filed suit against janopaul for construction defects at the el cortez project san diego county superior court case no.el cortez action.janopaul timely requested that sundt defend and indemnify it in the el cortez action.when sundt failed to do so,janopaul against sundt for breach of express indemnity,among other causes of action.
ultimately,the el cortez action was consolidated with two other cases san diego county superior court case nos.and cu fr ctl,with the el cortez action serving as the lead action together,underlying action.
tender of defense 
janopaul retained golub to represent it.in early may,golub tendered janopaul defense and indemnity in the underlying action to paul.janopaul tender identified a series of insurance policies issued by paul for work on the el cortez project and included a copy of the complaint in the el cortez action.golub requested a response to the tender offer within days.
paul acknowledged receipt of the janopaul tender in.however,paul stated it was investigating the matter and was then unable to either decline or accept all or part of this tender.in connection with its investigation,paul requested janopaul provide it with the following information most of which ostensibly was available from sundt copies of all contracts between janopaul and sundt including sundt predecessor in interest the phases its insured worked on and lot numbers notices of completion and escrow dates on the home s the nature and extent of damages attributable to its insured and any document depository created in connection with the el cortez action.
in response,the record shows janopaul provided paul with the information in,and sent correspondence to paul on december,october,and may,regarding janopaul defense and indemnity.
on july,more than two years after janopaul original tender,janopaul informed paul that it intended to file a bad faith complaint against paul because of the latter complete failure to respond since to janopaul defense and indemnity tender.janopaul included a draft complaint against paul allegedly asserting tort and contract causes of action,which janopaul threatened to file if paul did not respond conclusively to the tender within days.
three days later,paul agreed to defend janopaul under a reservation of rights.although janopaul had never requested appointment of independent counsel,paul nonetheless agreed as follows to provide janopaul cumis counsel 
civil code section provides the right to independent counsel where the outcome of a coverage issue may be controlled by counsel first retained by the insurer.in light of the allegations of intentional conduct,paul concludes that janopaul is entitled to independent counsel and understands that your golub office has been selected by the insured to represent its interests in this matter.however,paul obligation to pay defense fees and costs incurred by independent counsel is limited to the rates which are actually paid by the insurer to attorneys retained by it in the ordinary course of business in the defense of similar actions in the community where the claim arose or is being defended.thus,paul agrees to contribute to the defense of janopaul at the rate of an hour for p artners,an hour for associates and an hour for paralegals.
paul further stated in its reservation of rights letter that it was not obligated to reimburse janopaul for any fees and costs janopaul incurred pursuing any affirmative claims against sundt or any other party in the underlying action that it only agreed to pay costs and fees that were reasonable and necessary to janopaul defense in the underlying action and demanded to the extent reasonably possible,golub segregate its billing entries so that tasks performed in defense of potentially covered claims are delineated from those associated with the uncovered and affirmative claims outlined herein.
in late august,paul notified golub that it was in the process of reviewing invoices golub had submitted for defending janopaul in the underlying action.paul indicated that paul and golub had met in january regarding paul concerns over golub alleged objectionable billing practices,including excessive hourly rates,block billing entries and tasks which did not appear reasonable necessary to the defense of janopaul.
paul further noted that despite their previous meeting,golub had not modified its billing practices,making it difficult for paul to confirm whether the time golub spent on any particular task was reasonable and necessary to the defense of janopaul.paul also disputed the billing rates golub charged to defend janopaul in the underlying action.
paul thus invoked its alleged right to arbitrate under subdivision c of section,claiming there was a dispute concerning attorney fees between the parties.specifically,because paul had previously acknowledged golub as independent counsel to janopaul,paul claimed the attorney fee dispute must be submitted to a single auditor for resolution.paul also claimed the scope of such arbitration included the applicable rate the extent the fees submitted to paul are reasonable and necessary to the defense of janopaul and any reimbursement right paul may have against janopaul for overpayment of defense fees after the audit process is complete.
paul initially requested janopaul and golub voluntarily agree to arbitrate.paul suggested any such arbitration be stayed pending resolution of the underlying action in order for golub to focus solely on janopaul defense.when janopaul and golub refused to arbitrate,paul filed a petition to compel arbitration.
in response,golub filed a motion to dismiss the petition to arbitrate,which janopaul later joined.among other things,petitioners argued that because paul waited more than two years to respond to the tender of defense and indemnity and reserve its rights,paul had breached the insurance contract s and engaged in bad faith,and forfeited was estopped to assert its alleged right to compel arbitration and select and set rates for independent counsel.paul in turn moved to enforce its petition to compel arbitration.
trial court proceedings 
the trial court initial order 
the trial court denied petitioners motion to dismiss the arbitration petition and granted paul competing motion to compel arbitration,ruling in part as follows 
petitioners motion to dismiss the arbitration petition,or in the alternative to stay the arbitration is denied.arbitration is authorized pursuant to civil code section.this section requires arbitration of any and all cumis fee disputes unless the parties insurance policy provides for an alternative dispute resolution procedure.citation.
paul july,letter contains an acknowledgement of its duty to defend the entire underlying action.this letter also asserts a reservation of rights,and contends that there is no potential duty to defend or indemnify with respect to some of the causes of action.the letter finds that the right to independent counsel under section is triggered and continues paul understands that your golub office has been selected by the insured to represent its interests in this matter.however,paul obligation to pay defense fees and costs incurred by independent counsel is limited to the rates which are actually paid by the insurer to attorneys retained by it in the ordinary course of business in the defense of similar actions in the community where the claim arose or is being defended 
janopaul argues that no right to independent counsel arose because paul denied a defense obligation with respect to some of the claims asserted in the underlying action.however,the right to independent counsel only arises when the insurer takes a position that some claims within the underlying action are not covered.as is clear from the reservation of rights,paul nonetheless agreed to defend the entire mixed action,which it is obligated to do.
janopaul also argues that paul can not compel arbitration because its delay in accepting the tender constitutes a breach of the insuring agreement.however,the citation to intergulf development superior court th does not support this contention.th e instant action addresses only the amount of fees incurred,not whether the insurer breached an obligation to appoint independent counsel.
finally,janopaul argues that the arbitration is unnecessary,or at least should be stayed,until resolution of its for indemnity in the underlying action.however,the relief sought by petitioner in this action is unrelated to janopaul.
petitioner paul petition to compel arbitration is granted.civil code c.this action is stayed pending completion of arbitration.the parties are instructed to select a mutually agreeable neutral arbitrator within one month of this hearing.the parties are further instructed to schedule an ex parte hearing if they are unable to agree on this selection.this ruling is based on the same analysis as set forth in the ruling denying the motion to dismiss,and this analysis is incorporated by reference.
the trial court request for supplemental briefing 
the trial court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the following two issues in connection with paul motion to compel arbitration and petitioners motion to dismiss the petition 
whether the amount of attorney fees incurred after tender of the defense,but prior to acceptance of tender under a reservation of rights is an issue subject to arbitration pursuant to civil code section in other words,is the arbitrability of the fees treated differently than the arbitrability of the fees 
if this issue is not subject to arbitration,what is the procedural mechanism this court should utilize to decide this issue 
the trial court grants paul motion to compel arbitration despite janopaul filing of a bad faith action against paul 
before supplemental briefing had been completed,janopaul filed a bad faith action against paul alleging causes of action for breach of contract,tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and declaratory relief.as we discuss in more detail post,janopaul sought compensatory and punitive damages against paul for the latter alleged breach of faith in connection with,among other concerns,paul alleged unreasonable delay in accepting the tender of defense.
the trial court on january,affirmed its earlier tentative order granting paul motion to compel arbitration,ruling in part as follows 
after entertaining the arguments of counsel,taking the matter under submission and reviewing the additional briefing,the court confirms its tentative rulings on the motion to dismiss and the petition to compel arbitration.both parties agree that fees are subject to the same procedure as fees.the entire fee dispute will proceed to arbitration.most of the arguments in defendants supplemental briefing have already been rejected by this court.the recent filing of the instant bad faith action does not alter this court determination.the gravamen of the new action is paul failure to accept tender in a timely manner,and the failure to pay defense fees at the full amount billed by golub thus,the new action simply recasts the same contentions.any delay in accepting tender may affect the hourly rate paul will be compelled to pay,and this will be adjudicated in the fee arbitration proceeding.this is not a situation where paul denied a defense,or refused to indemnify janopaul.italics added.
janopaul timely challenged the trial court ruling by filing a petition for writ of mandate,supersedeas or other relief and a request for stay.we issued a stay of the january,order and an order to show cause 
discussion 
standard of review and governing law 
the trial court granted paul petition to compel arbitration based on its interpretation of the scope of section mandatory arbitration provision.the proper interpretation of a statute and its application to undisputed facts,such as in the instant case,presents a question of law that is subject to our independent review.see compulink,supra,th at see also gray cary ware freidenrich vigilant insurance th,noting the issue of whether subdivision c of section encompasses disputes between an insurer and cumis counsel is a legal question requiring us to independently review and interpret the scope of subdivision c.
as relevant here,section,subdivision c provides in part any dispute concerning attorney fees not resolved by an alternative procedure set forth in the policy shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the parties to the dispute.
janopaul contends that the gravamen of its complaint against paul is bad faith and breach of.paul contends the gravamen of janopaul complaint involves a dispute concerning attorney fees between an insurer and cumis counsel.based on our independent review of janopaul complaint,we conclude that it raises issues and claims substantially broader than merely a dispute over the amount of attorney fees,as provided in subdivision c of section.
indeed,janopaul in its complaint alleged among other things that paul breached the contract s of insurance and engaged in bad faith when it waited more than two years to accept the tender of defense and nearly three years to begin paying for that defense.as a result of such conduct,janopaul alleged paul has forfeited is estopped from asserting all rights under the policies of insurance,including any rights under section.in addition to compensatory damages,janopaul sought exemplary damages and attorney fees and costs from paul.
in its declaratory relief cause of action,janopaul sought relief as follows 
for a declaratory judgment that the delay constitutes a per se breach by paul of the terms of its policies and a forfeiture of its rights to enforce any terms of the policies against the insured,including without limitation,any right to seek arbitration of defense fees and costs 
for a declaratory judgment that paul silence of over two years concerning section and failure to object to the golub firm rates during that time and janopaul reasonable reliance on that silence estops paul from seeking arbitration of defense fees and costs and 
for a declaratory judgment that paul silence of over two years after knowing all operative facts and rights constitutes a waiver by paul of its right to seek arbitration of defense fees and costs.
significant to the instant appeal,an u nreasonable delay in paying policy benefits is an actionable withholding of benefits which may constitute a breach of contract as well as bad faith giving rise to damages in tort.citations.the general measure of damages for breach of duty to defend consists of the insured cost of defense in the underlying action,including attorn
