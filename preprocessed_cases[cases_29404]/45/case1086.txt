defendant,state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm,appeals a december,order of the united states district court for the western district of michigan,granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff stefanie shields shields and holding that shields no fault automobile insurance policy with state farm obligates state farm to cover the cost of shields medical expenses resulting from injuries sustained in an automobile accident.for the reasons set forth below,this court affirms the order of the district court.
backgrounda.procedural history 
on june,plaintiff stefanie shields filed a diversity of citizenship action for declaratory judgment in federal district court against her two insurance carriers,defendants state farm and government employees hospital association geha,requesting that the district court clarify all parties obligations under their respective insurance contracts,the federal employees health benefit act fehba,et,and the michigan insurance act mnfia.comp.laws et.plaintiff filed an amended complaint on june.thereafter,all three parties filed motions for summary judgment.on december,the district court granted defendant geha motion for summary judgment against plaintiff denied plaintiff motion for summary judgment against geha granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment against defendant state farm and denied defendant state farm motion for summary judgment against plaintiff.the district court disposition of the summary judgment motions required plaintiff shields to reimburse geha for the cost of her medical expenses,and defendant state farm to reimburse shields an incidental amount.
substantive history 
the facts of this case are undisputed.plaintiff stefanie shields is covered by her mother automobile insurance policy with defendant state farm,as well as under her mother employment benefits plan with defendant geha.geha benefit plan was drafted pursuant to fehba whereas the state farm policy was drafted in accordance with the mnfia.
on february,plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident after a pound piece of steel fell off the back of a truck and onto her car.plaintiff suffered extensive medical injuries,for which geha initially paid.plaintiff estimates that geha paid over in medical expenses.
thereafter,plaintiff recovered damages for pain and suffering in a tort action.because plaintiff recovered tort damages,defendant geha informed plaintiff that,pursuant the geha health plan,plaintiff was required to reimburse the geha paid to cover plaintiff medical expenses.plaintiff then sought to have defendant state farm,her insurer,reimburse her for the cost of the medical expenses geha was now requiring her to pay,on the basis of her mother policy with state farm the state farm policy.
defendant state farm refused to pay,arguing that because plaintiff elected a voluntarily coordinated benefits plan,state farm was not obligated to pay shields to reimburse geha.the state farm policy in this case is a policy.according to the language of the contract,a policy is a policy for which an insured coverages for allowable expenses and work loss are coordinated.the policy further explains that 
benefits shown as coordinated will be reduced by any amount paid or payable to you or any relative under any 
vehicle or premise insurance 
individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance and 
medical or surgical reimbursement plan.
at emphasis in original.state farm admits that plaintiff medical expenses are allowable expenses covered by its plan.state farm argues,however,that the initial payments made by geha constitute an amount paid or payable under any individual,blanket or group accident or disability insurance.therefore,state farm argues that plaintiff,and not state farm,should be required to bear the costs of the medical bills.
plaintiff filed the instant action for declaratory relief in federal court against defendants geha and state farm requesting that the court clarify all parties obligations under their respective insurance contracts,federal law,and the mnfia.in particular,plaintiff requested the district court to order defendant state farm to reimburse geha on behalf of plaintiff.the district court held that state farm was obligated under its insurance policy with plaintiff mother to reimburse plaintiff for the medical expenses she repaid to geha.the district court reasoned that geha initial payments were not amounts paid within the meaning of state farm policy because plaintiff was required to reimburse geha.in so holding,the district court relied on the supreme court of michigan decision in sibley detroit automobile exchange.defendant state farm now appeals the district court decision,contending that the district court reliance on sibley to interpret the state farm policy was improper and that the michigan court of appeals decision in dunn detroit automobile exchange,controls.
discussiona.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.blackmore kalamazoo,cir.summary judgment is proper where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
the state farm policy requires state farm to reimburse plaintiff for the cost of medical expenses that plaintiff will reimburse to geha.contrary to state farm assertions,geha intitial payments do not constitute amounts paid within the meaning of the state farm policy,and thus,state farm is not entitled to reduce plaintiff benefits by that amount.geha payments do not constitute amounts paid because the michigan supreme court opinion in sibley makes clear that benefits are not paid under the mnfia where the insured is later required to reimburse the payor.
while the court in sibley was technically interpreting the phrase benefits provided in michigan compiled laws mcl,and the issue in the instant case is the phrase amount paid which appears not in but in the coordinated benefits clause of the state farm policy,the sibley decision still controls the meaning of the language of the state farm policy because the policy was drafted in accordance with the mnfia.the fact that dunn holds otherwise is irrelevant because dunn is not good law.the michigan court of appeals decision in dunn conflicts with the decision of the michigan supreme court in sibley,and therefore is not michigan law.
the mnfia regulates automobile insurance policies purchased by persons with cars registered in michigan.comp.laws et.it requires all car owners to maintain a insurance policy,which must include personal protection insurance coverage.comp.laws.the mnfia defines personal protection insurance coverage to include reasonably necessary medical expenses and lost wages.comp.laws.
personal protection insurance coverage is meant to replace tort damages.therefore,the mnfia limits the available tort remedies for damages caused by car accidents.comp.laws.in limited circumstances,however,a victim of a car accident can sue for damages for pain and suffering.id.the mnfia prohibits insurers from requiring the insured to reimburse the insurance company from pain and suffering damages obtained in civil tort suits.comp.laws.this is in part because the damages obtained in civil suits for pain and suffering are not equivalent to the medical expenses and lost income that an insurance company pays the insured on a policy.see sibley,at.
because the mnfia requires automobile owners to maintain insurance,many michigan car owners have coverage from two insurance policies.that is,they have health insurance worker compensation coverage in addition to a automobile insurance policy.to ease the expense of requiring drivers to maintain two duplicative insurance policies,mnfia mandates that insurance companies offer coordinated benefits plans.comp.laws a see smith physicians health plan.under a coordinated benefits plan,a insurer must offer insurance at reduced premiums to persons with health care or worker compensation coverage that duplicates the insurance policy coverage.comp.laws a.the insured may then only recover from a insurance company to the extent that his or her reasonably necessary medical expenses and lost i
