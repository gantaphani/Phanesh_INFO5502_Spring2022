the plaintiffs,james and donna clark,appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants federal insurance company and chubb group of insurance companies collectively federal and the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment.the clarks allege that the injuries james clark sustained in an automobile accident were covered under three policies of insurance issued by federal to clark employer,the clark rubber company clark rubber.on appeal,the clarks claim that the district court erred in holding that they did not comply with the and subrogation provisions in the insurance policies,and erred in holding that one of the policies was not a motor vehicle liability policy at all.
based on the facts of the case and for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court judgment and remand this case in light of the ohio supreme court recent decision in ferrando mutual insurance,ohio.
background 
the parties have stipulated to the facts of this case.on march,james clark was involved in an automobile accident with david sholtis.james clark was an employee of clark rubber,which was insured at the time under three different policies with federal.first,clark rubber was insured under a business auto policy the auto policy.the auto policy explicitly provided uninsured and motorist insurance and had a per accident limit of and an aggregate limit of.second,clark rubber was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy the cgl policy with limits of.lastly,clark rubber carried a commercial excess liability policy the excess policy with limits of.each of these policies was issued for the period of march,to march,and was in effect at the time of the accident.
the clarks settled with sholtis and his automobile insurer,the personal service insurance company personal on october,for the limit of their liability policy.clark received and donna clark and their two children received.it is undisputed that in exchange for the proceeds of the settlement,the plaintiffs released both sholtis and personal from all liability in connection with this accident.james clark has also recovered from his own automobile insurance policy and from his homeowner policy,both issued by prudential.the clarks admit that federal did not receive notice of the accident or the clarks claim until march.each of the federal policies contained clauses that required insureds to notify federal in case of an accident and that gave federal subrogation rights,namely,the rights to pursue claims on behalf of the injured parties whom it insures.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this diversity case pursuant to,because the clarks are citizens of ohio and federal is an indiana corporation that has its principal place of business in new jersey.see chubb group of ins,cir holding that federal courts have jurisdiction over actions by an insured against his or her own insurance company if the two are of diverse citizenship because such actions are not direct actions within the meaning of c.we have jurisdiction over the district court final judgment pursuant to.
standard of review 
the question in this case is whether the district court properly granted summary judgment to federal and properly denied the clarks summary judgment motion.this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.plant morton int l,cir.although the district court denial of a motion for summary judgment is usually treated as a nonappealable interlocutory order,when an appeal from a denial of summary judgment is presented in tandem with a grant of summary judgment,this court has jurisdiction to review the propriety of the district court denial of summary judgment.hamad woodcrest condo.ass n,cir quotation omitted.the district court denial of summary judgment based on purely legal grounds is reviewed de novo.id.at.summary judgment can be granted only when,taking all justifiable inferences in the nonmoving party favor,there is still no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.plant,at.
c.an overview of the plaintiffs claims 
there are three policies at issue the auto policy,the cgl policy,and the excess policy.although james clark is not listed explicitly as an insured under any of the policies,federal does not dispute that the clarks are insureds pursuant to the ohio supreme court decision in liberty mutual fire insurance,ohio,considering the clarks claims under each of the policies in turn,we ultimately conclude as the district court did that the clarks have breached the and subrogation provisions in all three of the policies.however,while the district court believed that these breaches alone were sufficient to justify the grant of summary judgment to federal,the ohio supreme court recent decision in ferrando makes it clear that breaches of and subrogation provisions are only considered presumptively prejudicial.since the clarks as of yet have had no opportunity to adduce evidence that might rebut this presumption,we remand this case to the district court so that it might hear evidence on this point with respect to all three of the policies at issue.
d.the auto policy 
the clarks first claim is under the auto policy.federal acknowledges that the auto policy explicitly provides insurance and does not dispute that the clarks are insureds under it.three parts of the auto policy are relevant here.first,the auto policy has a general notification clause,which requires that insureds notify federal promptly 
duties in the event of accident,claim,suit or loss 
a.in the event of accident,claim,suit or loss,you must give us or our authorized representative prompt notice of the accident or loss.include 
how,when and where the accident or loss occurred 
the insured name and address and 
to the extent possible,the names and addresses of any injured persons and witnesses.
additionally,you and any other involved insured must 
immediately send us copies of any request,demand,order,notice,summons or legal paper received concerning the claim or suit.
cooperate with us in the investigation,settlement or defense of the claim or suit.
at.this notification clause was later amended to require prompt notification of a potential settlement 
duties in the event of accident,claim,suit or loss is changed by adding the following 
c.a person seeking uninsured motorists coverage must also promptly notify us in writing of a tentative settlement between the insured and the insurer of the vehicle described in paragraph.of the definition of uninsured motor vehicle and allow us days to advance payment to that insured in an amount equal to the tentative settlement to preserve our rights against the insurer,owner or operator of such vehicle described in paragraph.of the definition of uninsured motor vehicle.
at.lastly,in addition to these notice clauses,the auto policy also has a subrogation provision 
transfer of rights of recovery against others to us 
if any person or organization to or for whom we make payment under this coverage form has rights to recover damages from another,those rights are transferred to us.that person or organization must do everything necessary to secure our rights and must do nothing after accident or loss to impair them.
federal claims that the clarks breached these provisions by not promptly notifying federal of their claim and by releasing both sholtis and his insurance carrier from all liability,thereby destroying federal subrogation right against them.the clarks concede that they did not contact federal until march,roughly six years after the accident.they also admit that they fully released sholtis and personal from all years before notifying federal.
the ohio supreme court,in a decision issued after the parties filed their appellate briefs but before oral argument,has made clear the law that governs breaches of these types of notice and subrogation clauses.see ferrando,at.the ohio supreme court explained its holdings as follows 
accordingly,we hold that when an insurer denial of uim coverage is premised on the insured breach of a provision in a policy of insurance,the insurer is relieved of the obligation to provide coverage if it is prejudiced by the insured unreasonable delay in giving notice.an insured unreasonable delay in giving notice is presumed prejudicial to the insurer absent evidence to the contrary.
as in cases involving a breach of a provision,a presumption of prejudice should be applied when evaluating the effects of the breach of a or other provision.as in breach of cases,we find that the burden of presenting evidence to show a lack of prejudice should be on the insured who has failed to comply with the terms of the policy.an additional reason for applying a presumption of prejudice with the burden of presenting evidence on the insured is that the general assembly has specifically allowed a right of subrogation to providers of uim coverage in ohio j.
ibid.we believe that two aspects of ferrando are essential to this case and thus are worth repeating.first,breaches of notice and subrogation provisions serve to vitiate the coverage provided by an insurance policy only if they are prejudicial to the insurer.second,breaches are presumed to be prejudicial unless proven to be harmless by the insureds.these twin principles apply equally to breaches of notice provisions and subrogation provisions 
ferrando has essentially laid out a inquiry describing how courts should handle breaches of and subrogation clauses.first,a court must determine whether the provision was breached.if the relevant provision was breached,a court must then ask whether the insurer was prejudiced by the breach.id.at.these inquiries are to be kept separate and distinct,one does not determine whether a provision was breached by looking to whether there was any resultant prejudice from the breach.id.at.
in this case,we hold that both the and the subrogation provisions were breached.first,we turn to the provisions.the ohio supreme court affirmed in ferrando the earlier notion that a provision in an insurance policy requiring prompt notice to the insurer requires notice within a reasonable time in light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances.ruby midwestern indem,ohio,cited in ferrando,at.the plaintiffs here notified federal in march of,but the accident occurred in.recognizing the apparent unreasonableness of the delay,the clarks argue that we must consider that delay in light of the fact that the clarks claim against federal only became viable because of the decision,which was handed down five years after the accident and only nine months before notice was given.we,however,have already rejected this argument.see lepley hartford acc.indem,cir.in lepley,the plaintiff argued that prior to the decision,she had no reason to believe that she would be covered under the policies,and she claims that hartford in any event would have denied her claim.id.at.we stated that lepley may be correct that hartford would have denied coverage,but lepley could have litigated the matter and that a waiting a favorable ohio supreme court decision is not a reasonable excuse for delaying notice and failing to preserve subrogation rights.id.in light of lepley,we must hold that the clarks have breached the notice clauses of the auto policy.
it is similarly clear that the clarks have breached the subrogation provision of the auto policy.the policy explicitly requires that the plaintiffs do nothing to impair federal right to subrogation,and the clarks here admit that they released the tortfeasor and his insurance company several years before federal was even notified of the accident.this is a clear breach of the insurance agreement.
having determined that the and subrogation provisions were breached,however,we find ourselves unable to proceed on the prejudice component of the ferrando analysis.under ferrando,the breach of the and subrogation provisions is presumed to be prejudicial,and the plaintiffs have the obligation of overcoming that presumption with persuasive evidence.here,however,the clarks as of yet have had no chance to prove that federal was not prejudiced by the clarks breaches of the and subrogation provisions.without the benefit of ferrando,the district judge ended his analysis when he concluded that the clarks had breached the two provisions he assumed that any breach in the notice and subrogation provisions foreclosed the clarks claim.
although the plaintiffs have not rebutted the presumption of prejudice at this point in the litigation,it is certainly possible that,now informed of ferrando standards,they could adduce evidence to this effect on remand.we therefore remand this case to the district court so that it may determine,as an initial matter,whether the plaintiffs can overcome the presumption of prejudice that attaches to their breaches of the and subrogation provisions.we note that this has been the procedure in several ohio cases where the factfinding was conducted before ferrando was decided many courts have remanded cases to the trial court for further proceedings,reasoning that it would be manifestly unjust to dismiss the plaintiffs claims before they had an opportunity to show that their breaches of notice and subrogation provisions were.see,marshall colonial ins.of,wl,at ohio dist.may,contrucci nationwide mut.fire ins,wl,at ohio dist,brozovic paul fire marine ins,no,wl,at ohio dist,cincinnati ins.carroll,wl,at ohio dist,
e.the cgl policy 
we now turn to the second policy at issue in this case,the comprehensive general liability cgl policy.ultimately,we draw the same conclusion with regard to the cgl policy that we drew in our analysis of the auto policy.while the clarks have breached the and subrogation provisions of the cgl policy,it is unclear whether the breaches have been prejudicial to federal.for that reason,we remand this claim as well to the district court for further proceedings.
the cgl policy does not,by its text,provide coverage.however,under the version of ohio ann.in existence at the time the policy covering clark accident was issued and therefore the version legally relevant here,see wolfe wolfe,ohio,insurers were required to offer coverage whenever they offered a insurance policy.see ohio ann.a see also gyori johnston bottling group,ohio,interpreting the statute before the changes made to it in linko indem.ins.of,ohio,same.federal does not dispute that coverage was not offered properly under linko and gyori or that james clark was an insured under the cgl policy federal instead argues that it never had any obligation to offer coverage because the cgl policy was not a policy within the meaning of the statute.
at first glance the cgl policy does not appear to be a policy it categorically excludes automobile coverage.however,there are two exceptions to that general exclusion,one providing coverage in cases of property damage arising out of the operation of mobile equipment the mobile equipment exception,and the other providing liability coverage for incidents arising out of the parking of automobiles on or next to the company premises the parking attendant exception.the clarks have expressly abandoned the argument that the exception is sufficient to turn the cgl policy into a policy,see appellant br.at,and we have squarely rejected the argument that a exception can transform an insurance policy into a policy within the meaning of ohio ann,see,at holding that the parking attendant provision in the federal policy,which is identical to the provision in the case at bar,did not create automobile liability coverage.as a result,it would not be inappropriate for us to conclude that the cgl policy was not a policy within the meaning of former ohio ann.nevertheless,we decline to do so at this time,because this very issue is currently pending before the ohio supreme court.see burkhart cna ins,wl ohio,accepted for review,ohio,ohio july,argued april.burkhart involves precisely the same question presented here,whether parking attendant and mobile equipment exceptions to a commercial policy general exclusion of automobile coverage are sufficient to render the policy a policy within the meaning of former ohio ann.because the ohio supreme court decision in burkhart will definitively resolve this issue and because a remand is already in order in t
