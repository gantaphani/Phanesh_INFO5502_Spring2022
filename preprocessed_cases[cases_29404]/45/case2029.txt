plaintiff denise reid appeals from a district court order denying her motion for partial summary judgment and awarding summary judgment in favor of defendant geico general insurance company geico in this action seeking reformation of an automobile insurance contract.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
the colorado auto accident reparations act.to repealed july,act or act,was enacted in with the purpose of avoiding inadequate compensation to all victims of automobile accidents in the state of colorado.it required complying automobile insurance policies to include certain minimum or basic personal injury protection pip benefits to compensate injured persons for medical expenses and lost wages resulting from an automobile accident.the act also required an insurer to offer,in exchange for higher premiums,optional enhanced pip coverage,and it was geico obligation with respect to this enhanced coverage that gave rise to this lawsuit.
as pertinent here,the act provided 
every insurer shall offer for inclusion in a complying policy,in addition to the coverages described in section governing basic pip,at the option of the named insured 
i compensation of all expenses of the type described in section b without dollar or time limitation or 
ii compensation of all expenses of the type described in section b without dollar or time limitations and payment of benefits equivalent to percent of loss of gross income per week from work the injured person would have performed had such injured person not been injured during the period commencing on the day after the date of the accident without dollar or time limitations.
in september,reid called geico and purchased an automobile insurance policy over the telephone.the policy she chose included the minimum pip coverage required under the act.within days of the telephone call,geico mailed to reid a new business packet,which included a copy of her policy and various other forms relating to her coverage and other coverage that it offered,including enhanced pip.the only form that is relevant to this appeal,however,is geico colorado information and option form option form,which set forth its options for both basic and enhanced pip coverage.geico claims that between september and the date of the accident at issue in this lawsuit,it sent its option form to reid six times,one was included in the new business packet and five more were sent in conjunction with later renewals.in support of its motion for summary judgment,geico submitted one such option form,bearing reid signature and the date march.geico claims that this is the only option form that reid ever signed and returned.
the first two pages of the signed option form comprise descriptions of the basic pip and enhanced pip coverage options available under reid insurance policy.the second page contains a entitled part personal injury protection apip options.at.this describes geico options for enhanced pip coverage and begins with the following introductory paragraph 
higher limits of pip coverage are available at your option.the higher limits are described below.for these options the separate limit for medical expenses is replaced by a single aggregate limit for all pip benefits that apply.the premium for apip is based on a percentage of your basic pip premium.if you selected the ppo option for basic pip in part,it will also apply to apip.however,unlimited apip options,or is not available with the ppo option.apip is not available with the limited basic pip option.
id.below this paragraph is a box listing six options for enhanced pip coverage.each option is designated with an option number in the first column,followed by three more columns setting forth for each option a the total aggregate limit of applicable pip benefits b the applicable work loss limitations and c a percentage reflecting the approximate additional premium per vehicle.id.geico offered this enhanced pip coverage at various rates ranging from to additional premium per vehicle.reid,however,declined all options by checking a box next to the statement i do not want additional pip benefits.id.
in july,reid was injured in an accident while driving her vehicle.geico paid her the full amount of the basic pip benefits to which she was entitled under the terms of her policy.it did not pay for any enhanced pip benefits.in july,reid sued geico in federal court based on diversity of citizenship,claiming that geico offer of enhanced pip coverage failed to meet the requirements of the act as interpreted in controlling case law.her complaint alleges that she has unpaid medical expenses and work losses and seeks reformation of her insurance policy to provide unlimited medical and wage loss benefits.she also asserts causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith.
shortly after reid filed her complaint,the parties filed for summary judgment.reid argued that geico offer of enhanced pip coverage was deficient under the act,and geico countered that reid claims were baseless because she had explicitly rejected enhanced pip coverage in the march,option form.the district court ruled in favor of geico,concluding that its offer of enhanced pip coverage to reid,reflected in the signed option form,was sufficient to satisfy its obligations under the act.
although the court rejected all of reid arguments,only some of them are relevant here.first,it rejected her claim that geico violated the act by failing to offer enhanced coverage in writing prior to issuing her insurance policy.see.a requiring written explanation of minimum pip coverage.the court declined to interpret the statutory text and instead held that even if the act imposed such an obligation with respect to enhanced pip coverage,geico failure to make a written offer was harmless given the multiple written offers that it extended before reid accident.second,the court concluded that geico offer of enhanced pip coverage was sufficient even though it did not specify that its benefits were payable at the level,as set forth in a ii.finally,the court rejected reid arguments based on what her enhanced pip coverage would have been had she decided to buy it.ultimately,the district court concluded that granting reid the relief she requested would give her the benefit of a policy with a premium cost greater than what she paid.at.reformation,the court observed,is an equitable remedy,and it concluded that granting reid that form of relief would not only be inequitable,it would be unconscionable.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis

reid claims that in entering summary judgment in favor of geico,the district court overlooked significant flaws in its offer of enhanced pip coverage.she makes a number of interrelated arguments on appeal,which,for ease of discussion,we distill to three main points.first,she maintains that geico offer of enhanced pip coverage could not have satisfied its obligations under the act because geico did not even have coverage to offer.specifically,she claims geico enhanced pip work loss benefit terminated when the injured person reached age,in violation of a.second,she argues that geico offer of enhanced pip coverage was not reasonably calculated to permit her to make an informed decision as required under allstate ins.parfrey.and third,she challenges the district court determination that reformation of her policy would be unconscionable,arguing that this conclusion was based on an improper assumption that she did not wish to purchase enhanced pip coverage.we address each of these arguments in turn.
geico allegedly coverage 
according to reid,the option form that she signed contained an offer of enhanced
