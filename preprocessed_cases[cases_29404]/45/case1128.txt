in this appeal pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc seeks review of the district court denial of a plan termination date that would permit pbgc to avoid payment of million in unvested shutdown benefits to plan participants represented by united steelworkers of america uswa.the appeal presents no issue as to the propriety of termination of the relevant benefit plans,which termination will result in the participants receipt of million in retirement benefits that they would not otherwise receive in the absence of pbgc termination of the plans and guarantee of the benefits vested under them.pbgc obligation to pay these vested benefits arose after the participants employer republic technologies international,llc rti declared bankruptcy and was unable to pay benefits under the plans.
pbgc initiated involuntary termination proceedings against four defined benefit plans administered by rti after rti filed its petition for bankruptcy pursuant to chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.two of the plans cover participants represented by the uswa.these plans included provisions for shutdown benefits,which would allow eligible participants to receive an immediate unreduced early retirement benefit in the event of a permanent shutdown of one or more of rti facilities.the shutdown benefits were not funded or vested at the time of their negotiation.during the bankruptcy proceedings,rti agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to a new company that had expressed an intention to hire of rti employees,but this new company did not want to assume responsibility for the pension plans.the uswa reached an agreement with rti in april,specifying that the sale of rti assets to the new company would constitute a shutdown under the plans,thereby triggering the provisions for shutdown benefits.
in the course of carrying out its statutory obligations under a,pbgc became concerned about the potential impact of the proposed sale on the plans and on its own financial condition.on june,pbgc issued notices pursuant to c,indicating its intent to terminate the plans,to seek its appointment as statutory trustee,and to have june,established as the date of plan termination.pbgc sought an immediate termination date in order to prevent the vesting of the shutdown benefit provisions that would occur with the closing of the sale of rti assets.pbgc also filed a complaint against rti in federal district court for the northern district of ohio,seeking termination of the plans,appointment as statutory trustee,and june,as the date of plan termination.the uswa was later granted leave to intervene as a party defendant.on cross motions for summary judgment,the uswa opposed only the proposed date of plan termination and asked the district court to establish a termination date of august,day after the closing of the asset sale.the court found that the plan participants had a heightened reliance interest in the receipt of shutdown benefits and that pbgc had failed to demonstrate that a plan termination date of june,adequately protected its insurance fund from an unreasonable increase in liability.it established august,as the date of plan termination,and pbgc has appealed.we conclude that any reliance interest the plan participants had in the receipt of shutdown benefits was extinguished the day pbgc sent out the notices of termination.we also conclude that the district court failed to adhere to the governing statutory purpose and persuasive case authority and thus gave no deference to pbgc determination that it faced an unreasonable increase in its liabilities if the court selected a termination date after shutdown.therefore,we reverse.
before turning to the facts of this particular case,some background on the role that pbgc plays in our nation pension benefit insurance system is necessary.pbgc is a federal corporation that was established by the employee retirement income security act of,erisa for the purpose of administering the pension plan termination insurance program.pbgc insurance program currently protects the pensions of approximately million working men and women in slightly more than private defined benefit pension plans.in fiscal year,pbgc paid over billion in benefits to almost people.under this insurance program,pbgc guarantees the payment of certain minimum pension benefits to pension plan participants in the event that a covered plan terminates with insufficient assets to pay the benefits in full.a,and.pbgc receives no funds from general tax revenues.its operations are financed using income from four basic sources insurance premiums set by congress and paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans,investment income,assets in terminated plans,and recoveries,if any,from employers whose underfunded plans have terminated.see also g,and.
pbgc operates under the guidance of its board of directors,which is composed of the secretaries of labor,commerce,and the treasury.pbgc mission is to protect participants pension benefits and to support a healthy retirement plan system by encouraging the continuation and maintenance of voluntary private pension plans for the benefit of their participants,providing timely payments of benefits in the case of terminated pension plans,and making the maximum use of its resources while at the same time maintaining premiums at the lowest levels consistent with its statutory responsibilities.a.
if a plan terminates with insufficient assets to pay guaranteed benefits,pbgc typically becomes trustee of the plan,takes over the assets and liabilities of the plan,and pays benefits to plan participants,d,and.erisa provides for both voluntary termination by the plan administrator and involuntary termination by pbgc.involuntary termination procedures may be instituted when pbgc determines that the plan is unable to pay benefits when due,a,and when pbgc faces an unreasonable increase in liabilities with respect to the plan if the plan is not terminated.a.if pbgc determines that a plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,it may institute court proceedings to obtain a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund.c.
a plan termination date is significant because it marks the date on which benefits for plan participants cease to accrue.employee retirement income security act of,pension benefit guaranty broadway maint,cir.for involuntary terminations,the date of plan termination has additional importance.when an employer underfunds its pension plan and is unable to finance a minimum level of benefits,pbgc must pay those benefits,and it has the right to recover from the employer the lesser of the amount that the employer underfunded its plan or thirty percent of the employer net worth on a date chosen by pbgc within days prior to the plan termination date.id.citing and b.because involuntary termination proceedings often involve bankrupt corporations with deteriorating financial resources,the date of termination can significantly affect the extent of pbgc recovery from the employer.id.citation omitted.a late termination date may mean that pbgc will have little chance of recovering anything from a bankrupt employer,while an earlier termination date could give pbgc the right to recover substantial assets from that same employer,based on its higher net worth at an earlier time.id.
congress expressed a clear preference that termination dates be set in advance to give plan participants warning when their benefits will stop accruing,see a,but erisa does not require pbgc to give formal advance notice to plan participants in involuntary termination proceedings.congress apparently recognized that,when faced with bankrupt employers and substantial unfunded pension liabilities,pbgc might occasionally wish to establish a retroactive date of termination to limit its own liability.broadway,at citing a.however,despite the importance of termination dates,erisa does not give pbgc unilateral authority to set them,even in involuntary proceedings.if the plan administrator does not agree with the date proposed by pbgc in an involuntary termination proceeding,a federal district court sets the date of plan termination.a.
with this background in mind,we turn to the case before us.
factual background 
prior to filing for chapter bankruptcy in,rti was a leading producer of special bar quality steel products.it was formed as the result of two mergers that occurred in and.as a result of those transactions,rti incurred million in secured debt and also became the sponsor and administrator of four defined benefit plans covered by title iv of the erisa.two of the plans,the republic technologies international,defined benefit plan resi plan and the republic technologies international,llc pension plan for union eligible employees at the lorain facility union plan,provide benefits to participants represented by the uswa.these plans included provisions for shutdown benefits.shutdown benefits are enhanced early retirement benefits for certain workers who are affected by a facility shutdown or business cessation.they permit participants who meet certain age and service requirements to begin receiving a retirement benefit after a plant shutdown,rather than having to wait while out of work to reach a specific retirement age.unlike other early and normal retirement benefits,shutdown benefits usually are not because this enhanced benefit may be paid for many years before a recipient is eligible for normal retirement benefits,the cost of shutdown benefits can be very high.
shutdown benefits were continued in the union plan and added to the resi plan as a result of collective bargaining prior to the mergers in.in return for the promise of shutdown benefits,the uswa agreed to concessions,including reduction of wages,elimination of jobs,and modification of health care benefits and work guarantees.the plans provide for two different types of shutdown benefits a benefit and a rule of benefit.a benefit allows a participant who is not yet and who has years of service to retire and begin to receive a pension benefit when a shutdown occurs if the participant is at least age and the participant combined age and years of continuous service equal or more or the participant combined age and years of service equal or more.a rule of benefit allows a participant who is not yet and who has at least years of service to retire and begin to receive a pension benefit when a shutdown occurs if the participant combined age and years of continuous service equal at least but less than.both plans also provided for a monthly supplement in the event of shutdown,payable until the participant is eligible to receive social security benefits.
pbgc became concerned about rti financial condition as a result of the mergers in and.it negotiated a series of agreements with rti to mitigate the risks resulting from rti highly leveraged existence coupled with the enhanced benefits provided under the resi and union plans.in the first agreement,rti agreed to make cash payments to the resi plan in excess of minimum funding requirements.the second agreement required cash payments in excess of minimum funding requirements to the union plan,as well as a million letter of credit to secure those payments.
in spite of the mergers and agreements,rti continued to experience financial difficulties as a result of poor market conditions,a softening economy,and a high level of debt.it filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy on april.in december,rti and the uswa negotiated a modified labor agreement mla that required rti to sell its assets unless it reorganized by may.
during the course of its bankruptcy case,rti received bankruptcy court approval to sell substantially all of its assets pursuant to a bidding process.on may,rti sought court approval to sell its principal assets to newco.newco expressed an intention to hire of rti employees,but it did not want to assume liability for rti pension plans.when it became clear that rti would be unable to reorganize,rti and the uswa negotiated a modified successor labor agreement msla that did not require a prospective asset purchaser to continue the pension plans.rti and the uswa also entered into a shutdown agreement in april specifying that the sale to newco would constitute a shutdown under the resi and union plans.on may,the bankruptcy court scheduled an auction of rti assets for july,and a hearing to approve the final sale and the shutdown agreement for july.
during this same time period,pbgc was going through the process of determining whether to involuntarily terminate the resi and union plans.pbgc follows the same administrative process in every case to determine whether an underfunded plan should be involuntarily terminated and the proposed date of plan termination.the trusteeship working group twg,an independent body comprised of representatives from pbgc financial,actuarial,policy and legal offices,reviews all termination recommendations developed by pbgc staff.the twg presents its recommendations,along with supporting documents,to the approving official.in cases involving claims of more than million,the approving official is the executive director,who is the head of the agency.the executive director decision is documented in a notice of determination and a termination and trusteeship decision record.on june,the twg met to consider the staff recommendation that the plans in this case should be terminated.they found that both plans were underfunded and that rti would not be able to administer the plans after its assets had been sold.without shutdown benefits,the resi plan was funded and the union plan was funded.if the plans terminated with shutdown benefits,the resi plan would be funded and the union plan funded.in monetary terms,shutdown benefits potentially increased the amount of unfunded liabilities for the plans by almost million.in light of this information,the twg determined that the plans should be terminated and that pbgc should establish a termination date prior to shutdown.if the plans were not terminated prior to shutdown,the twg concluded,pbgc long run loss could reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably.
on june,the executive director concurred in the twg recommendation and issued a notice of determination pursuant to c for each plan.copies were sent to the plan administrator and the uswa and they were also published in seventeen newspapers where rti facilities were located.the notices indicated pbgc determination that,in order to avoid an unreasonable increase in the liability of the pbgc insurance fund and in order to protect the interests of the plans participants pbgc intends to proceed pursuant to erisa,to have the plans terminated and pbgc appointed as statutory trustee,and to have june,established as the plans termination date.
procedural history 
on the same day the notices were issued,pbgc commenced an action against rti to terminate the plans and to set june,as the date of plan termination.on july,the bankruptcy court approved the shutdown agreement and the sale of rti assets to newco.the asset sale to newco closed on august.on november,pbgc filed a motion for summary judgment,asking the district court to determine that the plans must be terminated to protect the interests of the participants and the pbgc insurance fund,to appoint pbgc trustee of the terminated plans,and to establish june,as the date of plan termination.the uswa filed a motion for partial summary judgment,disputing only the date of plan termination.it asked the court to establish august,day after the closing of the asset sale to the date of plan termination.
the district court agreed that the plans had to be terminated to protect the interests of the participants and pbgc insurance fund,but it rejected pbgc proposed termination date and granted the uswa motion for partial summary judgment.the court considered the plan participants reliance interests in shutdown benefits and weighed those interests against pbgc interest in avoiding an unreasonable increase in unfunded liabilities.the court concluded that,despite pbgc issuance of the notices on june,the plan participants continued to have strong reliance interests in the receipt of shutdo
