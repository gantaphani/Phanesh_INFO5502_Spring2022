this is an antitrust case involving alleged violations of sections and of the sherman act.it comes to us after the district granted appellee baptist health motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and denied baptist health motion to tax copying costs.the principal issue on appeal concerns the proper methodology for determining the relevant market in an antitrust case.we also address whether the district court abused its discretion in declining to tax costs.we affirm on both issues.
background 
appellant little rock cardiology clinic pa lrcc is a professional association of cardiologists located in little rock,arkansas,practicing in both diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures.baptist health is the largest hospital company in arkansas,operating five hospitals in the state,its largest being a facility in little rock.blue cross blue shield of arkansas blue cross is a company headquartered in little rock beginning in,lrcc and its cardiologists maintained clinical and staff privileges at baptist health and were in blue cross firstsource network,a network of preferred providers used by all of blue cross health plans.this changed,however,with the opening of the arkansas heart hospital.
in,lrcc developed arkansas heart hospital,which specializes in cardiology services and competes with baptist health.prior to developing arkansas heart,the lrcc cardiologists were on staff at baptist health,and participated in blue cross firstsource network.shortly after lrcc opened arkansas heart,blue cross terminated its network provider agreements with lrcc and lrcc doctors.lrcc alleges that baptist health effected this termination in concert and in combination with baptist health to restrain and monopolize trade unlawfully,specifically,to protect baptist health from competition in the relevant market.in,baptist health adopted an economic credentialing policy,which prohibited any doctor from maintaining staff privileges at any baptist health facility if that doctor directly or indirectly held an interest in a competing hospital.recently,an arkansas state circuit court permanently enjoined enforcement of this policy.
lrcc initially filed this suit against baptist health in november,alleging that baptist health conspired with blue cross to restrain trade in,and monopolize the market for,cardiology services for privately insured patients by forming a jointly owned hmo,hmo partners,with blue cross agreeing with blue cross that baptist health would be the hmo exclusive facility and agreeing with blue cross that blue cross would remove lrcc from blue cross firstsource network.a month later,lrcc amended its complaint to add as plaintiffs a number of individual cardiologists and each of their individual professional associations through which they and lrcc provide cardiology services.baptist health then moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court denied the motion.
in december,lrcc filed a second amended complaint,adding blue cross as a defendant,as well as blue cross and baptist health individually owned subsidiaries and their jointly owned subsidiary all defendants then moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim.the district court granted this motion on the grounds that,among other things,lrcc complaint failed to allege a proper relevant market.in doing so,the district court noted that the supreme court recent decision in bell atlantic twombly,d,had created a higher pleading standard than the standard in conley gibson,d,the standard upon which the district court had relied in denying baptist health first motion to dismiss.the district court,however,granted lrcc leave to amend its complaint one final time.
in march,lrcc filed a third amended complaint,the complaint at issue in this appeal,alleging six antitrust claims against baptist health count i alleges,under of the sherman act,that baptist health and blue cross unlawfully conspired to restrain trade in the market for services to cardiology patients.the remaining counts allege violations of of the sherman act.counts ii and iii allege that baptist health conspired with blue cross to monopolize,and attempted to monopolize,the market for cardiology procedures.count iv alleges that baptist health monopolized the market for cardiology procedures.counts v and vi allege that baptist health conspired with blue cross to monopolize,and aided in blue cross attempt to monopolize,the market for private health insurance.
the district court granted baptist health motion to dismiss with prejudice,finding that the alleged relevant market for counts was legally flawed and therefore counts did not state a plausible antitrust claim.as to counts v and vi,the district court dismissed lrcc claims against baptist health as barred by the statute of limitations because lrcc failed to allege an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy or attempt to monopolize the private insurance market within the limitations period.see.
after the district court dismissed lrcc complaint,baptist health filed a bill of costs under federal rule of civil procedure d,seeking costs for transcription,copying of documents,scanning documents produced in discovery,and reproduction of electronically stored information esi.the district court declined to tax those costs against lrcc.
on appeal,we address two issues whether the district court erred in dismissing counts and whether the district court erred in declining to tax baptist health costs.because lrcc does not raise on appeal the district court dismissal,on limitations grounds,of counts v and vi,we do not address it here.see united states azure,cir.
ii.antitrust claims 
on appeal,we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,accepting the allegations contained in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.express scripts,aegon direct mktg,cir.this standard requires us to determine whether the complaint assert s facts that affirmatively and plausibly suggest that the pleader has the right he claims rather than facts that are merely consistent with such a right.stalley catholic health initiatives,cir.
the four counts at issue on appeal raise federal antitrust claims under sections and of the sherman antitrust act.under that act,it is to contract or form a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states,or to monopolize or attempt to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states.the parties agree that lrcc has not alleged a per se violation.lrcc therefore has the burden of alleging a relevant market in order to state a plausible antitrust claim.double spotting,supervalu,cir.without a relevant market,a court can not determine the effect that an allegedly illegal act has on competition.see ftc freeman,cir.thus,as we have stated,antitrust claims often rise or fall on the definition of the relevant market.bathke casey stores,cir.a relevant market consists of both a product market and a geographic market.id.we proceed by analyzing each of these required components.
product market 
a court determination of the limits of a relevant product market requires inquiry into the choices available to consumers.craftsmen limousine,ford motor,cir.the focus is on how consumers will shift from one product to the other in response to changes in their relative costs.superturf,monsanto,cir.the relevant product market should include products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purpose for which they are produced.united states du pont de nemours.the district court found that appellant third amended complaint failed to allege a relevant product market because,among other reasons,the complaint erroneously defined the product market by how consumers pay for cardiology services.we agree.
the parties extensively brief the issue of what lrcc alleges to be the relevant product market.the complaint first states,the relevant product is those medical services that cardiology patients receive exclusively in a hospital from a cardiologist.it also states,however,that cardiology services and hospital services are not distinct products for the purposes of antitrust analysis.finally,it states that the relevant product market is the market for cardiology procedures obtained in hospitals by patients covered by private insurance.thus,it is unclear whether lrcc is alleging a market in which there is a single,conjoined services obtained in a market in which there are two distinct and complementary services and cardiology services.one issue on which the parties agree,however,is that the product market lrcc alleges is limited to patients covered by private insurance.we base our affirmance of the district court holding on this undisputed limitation.
lrcc proposes a market limited by how consumers pay for cardiology procedures.this theory lacks support in both logic and law.as stated above,the general issue when determining the relevant product market concerns the choices available to consumers.craftsmen limousine,at.in this case involving relevant inquiry is whether there are alternative patients available to the cardiologists.see campfield state farm mut.auto.ins,cir when there are numerous sources of interchangeable demand,the plaintiff can not circumscribe the market to a few buyers in an effort to manipulate those buyers market share.stop shop supermarket blue cross blue shield of,st cir t he concern in an ordinary exclusive dealing claim by a supplier is with the available market for the supplier.brokerage concepts,healthcare,cir stating the logical assumption that a pharmacy considers members of other prescription plans,or uninsured persons,completely interchangeable with privately insured members.thus,lrcc must look to alternative patients who are able to pay the required fees,not just those who pay using private insurance.
lrcc argues that the product market should be limited to patients using private insurance because private insurance and government other primary method of not reasonably interchangeable.the trouble with this theory is that it analyzes the issue from the wrong side of the transaction.it may be true that,from the patient perspective,private insurance and are not reasonably interchangeable.for a variety of reasons,including age and financial considerations,a person with private insurance may not qualify for these government programs.but this lawsuit is not about the options available to patients,it is about the options available to cardiologists.lrcc claims boil down to the allegation that,due to baptist health allegedly unlawful actions,lrcc has access to fewer patients.the relevant question,then,is to whom might the cardiologists at lrcc potentially provide medical service lrcc complaint provides the answer lrcc can provide service to patients from either a government program such as medicare or medicaid,or from a private insurer.emphasis added.patients able to pay their medical bill,regardless of the method of payment,are reasonably interchangeable from the cardiologist correct perspective from which to analyze the issue in this case.
in reaching this conclusion we do not,as lrcc argues,disregard the allegations in the complaint.lrcc has made no allegation that private insurance is the only method of payment it can accept.quite the opposite,lrcc complaint states both that it can and that it does accept payment from sources other than private insurers.our conclusion does not challenge lrcc factual allegations,but rather its legal theory,to which we owe no deference.wiles capitol indem,cir.nor,as lrcc contends,does our decision in tenet health care,cir,endorse lrcc proposed market.tenet was a monopolization case brought under of the clayton act,in which we addressed the bounds of a relevant geographic market.tenet,at.in so doing,we found only that the locations where a patient with private insurance could reasonably turn a key inquiry in analysis were constrained by whether the patient insurance covered the hospital in the relevant location.id.at.this does not address the inquiry in the case of a supplier to whom can the supplier sell thus,tenet is inapposite to our decision on the relevant product market in this case.
we conclude that,as a matter of law,in an antitrust claim brought by a seller,a product market can not be limited to a single method of payment when there are other methods of payment that are acceptable to the seller.we also analyze lrcc alleged relevant geographic market as an alternative ground on which to affirm the district court dismissal.
geographic market 
lrcc failure to allege a coherent relevant geographic market provides an adequate and independent means of affirming the district court dismissal.properly defined,a geographic market is a geographic area in which the seller operates,and to which purchaser s can practicably turn for supplies.tampa nashville coal,d accord morgenstern wilson,cir.broken down,the test requires a court to first determine whether a plaintiff has alleged a geographic market that includes the area in which a defendant supplier draws a sufficiently large percentage of its business the market area in which the seller operates,its trade area.see morgenstern,at citation omitted double d,at bathke,at.a court must then determine whether a plaintiff has alleged a geographic market in which only a small percentage of purchasers have alternative suppliers to whom they could practicably turn in the event that a defendant supplier anticompetitive actions result in a price increase.see,morgenstern,at.the end goal in this analysis is to delineate a geographic area where,in the medical setting,few patients leave and few patients enter.united states rockford mem l,aff,cir.the district court held that lrcc alleged geographic market,little rock,was overly narrow because the complaint contains no allegations that little rock,by itself,made up baptist health trade area.as with the product market,we agree with the district court.
lrcc complaint alleges that baptist health operates and competes in an area well beyond the city of little rock.the complaint alleges that baptist health serves a large percentage of residents from around the state who need cardiology services in hospitals.more specifically,the complaint alleges that,in addition to little rock,baptist health operates in hot springs,pine bluff,conway,searcy,and el dorado.despite these allegations detailing the apparently broad reach of baptist health cardiology services,lrcc complaint seeks to limit the relevant geographic market to the cities of little rock and north little rock.the geographic market is defined as such,lrcc contends,because cardiology patients in little rock and patients from hospitals in surrounding areas overwhelmingly go to little rock for cardiology procedures the reason for this migration to little rock,lrcc alleges,is that the cardiology procedures are not practicably available in hospitals in surrounding cities.in short,lrcc argument is that little rock is the relevant geographic market because it is the location to which cardiology patients must travel.accepting the allegations as true and reading them in the light most favorable to lrcc,as we must,express scripts,at,we can not find that lrcc complaint alleges a plausible relevant geographic market.
this case presents an unusual question.our cases typically have addressed disputes raising the issue of where a consumer can practicably turn in the event of a defendant anticompetitive price second prong in our analysis.see.ass of nurse anesthetists unity,cir tenet,at double d,at bathke,at morgenstern,at.here,however,lrcc complaint contains allegations concerning the geographic areas where customers could turn for cardiology procedures,but fails to do so from the starting point of baptist health trade area.in other words,lrcc complaint alleges that a low percentage of patients leave its proposed geographic market,but does not allege that a low percentage of its patients enter its proposed geographic market.without the necessary allegations,we can not find that lrcc has stated a plausible antitrust claim.by limiting the geographic market in this way,lrcc is able to gerrymander the relevant market to an artificially narrow location,the location where cardiology pr
