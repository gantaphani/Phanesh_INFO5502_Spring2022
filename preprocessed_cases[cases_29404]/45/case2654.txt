cheviot vista homeowners association homeowners association appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of state farm fire and casualty company state farm in the homeowners association action concerning the adjustment of its property damage losses from the northridge earthquake.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the homeowners association earthquake coverage and northridge earthquake damage claim 
prior to the january,northridge earthquake,state farm issued a condominium association policy with an endorsement for earthquake coverage to the homeowners association insuring a condominium building located at cheviot vista place,los angeles.the policy in effect from march,to march,had a limit of coverage for damage caused by earthquake of,with a percent deductible.
the condominium complex was damaged by the northridge earthquake.by january,the homeowners association submitted a claim to state farm for damage to the building and common areas of the complex,as well as to at least some of the individual units.on january,the city of los angeles department of building and safety department inspected the property and found it was safe to occupy.the department reported no structural damage to the property exterior,finding only small cracks.on february,a state farm adjuster conducted a preliminary inspection of the property and noted in the claim file the damage appeared superficial.
minutes from the february,meeting of the homeowners association board of directors board indicate,the january earthquake caused superficial cosmetic damage throughout building common areas.a claim was submitted to state farm insurance.the insurer wants to inspect the individual units,and a contractor will also inspect to give an estimate.minutes from a subsequent meeting on march,state,the common areas apparently sustained only cosmetic damage most units report only plaster and paint damage.one of the storage bins in the upper garage was shaken from its mount and was remounted the balcony in unit appears to be damaged.the building earthquake insurance coverage represents a deductible amounting to.this comes out to an average of per unit.the insurance company wants to inspect the interiors of all the units this would require a single day in which all the units would have to be available for inspection.we would also want a second evaluation from a structural engineer.it was decided that the board will arrange for a city structural inspection and an inspection from the insurance company,on two separate days.these inspections will be to determine structural damage to the units.the owners agreed to pay their own expenses for cosmetic damage to their own units,rather than distributing the cost among the unit owners.the homeowners association will only pay for damage to the common areas,and structural damage to the units,as determined by the inspections.
by letter dated march,and telephone messages on march and,state farm requested the homeowners association contact it to schedule a detailed inspection of the property.that inspection occurred over a period from april to april,during which state farm completed its evaluation of the property common areas and of the individual units to which it was granted access state farm was unable to obtain access to at least six of the individual units.minutes from the april,homeowners association board meeting state,insurance inspection of units was complete on the and of april.one unit had already had repairs done other units were not accessible.to date,seven units have not been inspected.on april,the common areas were inspected for damage.insurance inspectors will forward a report within a week.no structural damage was found.after the report is received,contractors will be contacted for an estimate of repairs.
by letter dated april,state farm notified the homeowners association it had inspected the majority of the units and was attempting to schedule an appointment to inspect the remaining units and the building exterior.it advised that,after completing the outstanding inspections,its repair estimate would be finalized.state farm claim file indicates it did not receive a response to its april,letter or obtain access to inspect the remaining individual units.
on april,state farm prepared a estimate based on the inspections it had conducted,determining the damage to the condominium complex was accounting for depreciation,well below the deductible on april,state farm sent its estimate to the homeowners association,explaining,we have forwarded the estimate of repairs for the units that were accessible to the adjuster.the external and common areas are included in our estimate.based on our observations and estimate of the inspected areas,the total cost of repairs to the building falls below the deductible for earthquake damage.conversations between the adjuster and the building management company indicated they are in agreement with this assessment.based on this information we are unable to make payment to you for earthquake damage to the building because your loss falls below the deductible.if you would like to schedule a follow up inspection,please contact me.in the event that your repair costs do exceed your earthquake deductible,please give me a call and send me a copy of your repair estimate before starting repairs,so i can review your estimate and determine whether payment can be made.i may need to schedule a follow up inspection at that time.minutes from the may,meeting of the homeowners association board report,an estimate for earthquake damage has been received from state farm.as expected,no structural damage was sustained,and the total incidental damage falls far short of the deductible.a contractor will examine the common areas and estimate the cost of cosmetic repairs in those areas.state farm closed the claim file on april.
in june and july the homeowners association obtained bids from three contractors to repair earthquake damage at the property.according to the homeowners association,the property was inspected,examined or appraised by the three contractors and repairs estimated as a whole.the bids ranged in price from to.
in its first communication with state farm since the april inspection of the complex,the homeowners association notified state farm on june,there was a plumbing problem at the property that it believed was related to the earthquake.by telephone calls on july,and,and a letter dated july,state farm advised the homeowners association to retain a plumber to inspect the problem and provide a repair estimate.on august,state farm sent another letter to the homeowners association,stating,please notify a licensed plumber to inspect and evaluate the damages in detail,and prepare a cost estimate for our review.also please let us know if you would like us to inspect the units we have been unable to gain access to date,as we will be more than happy to assess any earthquake damages to those units.according to the claim file,state farm received no response to its august,letter.as a result,state farm sent a letter to the homeowners association on august,advising,w e are waiting to receive your information regarding the plumbing repairs to your property.since we have not had a response from you we assume you do not wish to pursue this portion of your claim.as such,your file will be placed in a closed status.if you wish to pursue this matter simply call or submit the requested information for consideration.
on september,the homeowners association obtained new bids in the amounts of and from two of the contractors that had previously submitted estimates to repair earthquake damage at the property.minutes from the homeowners association board meeting on september,indicate,estimates of have been made for complete repairs.as this is beyond the association means,the board inspected t he building to identify the most critical repairs.escobar construction has submitted a bid of to complete these repairs.on october,the homeowners association entered into a contract with escobar construction on the bid and two additional work orders were written,one on november,in the amount of and another on november,in the amount of.
the homeowners association complaint for breach of contract and insurance bad faith 
the homeowners association did not contact state farm again until april,when,under the provisions of code of civil procedure section it filed a complaint against state farm for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violation of business and professions code section et.on june,the homeowners association filed a first amended complaint for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the first amended complaint,which seeks both compensatory and punitive damages,alleges state farm failed to investigate properly the homeowners association claim of earthquake damage,failed to evaluate and adjust the claim objectively and failed to pay policy benefits to repair the damage caused to the condominium complex by the northridge earthquake.specifically,paragraph of the homeowners association first amended complaint alleges,the inspections of each of the condominium buildings located at plaintiff property were inadequate.the loss adjuster failed to identify,address report significant amounts of earthquake related damages earthquake related repairs and repair costs.state farm knowingly and intentionally failed to advise plaintiff of the true nature and extent of the damage to its property.state farm underestimated the true cost to repair in an effort to save money in the payment of claims.although the pleading describes several techniques allegedly used by state farm to underestimate northridge earthquake losses improper depreciation deductions,unlawful manipulation of a computerized estimating software program and failure to allow sales tax on materials,the complaint does not contain any allegation concerning the amount by which state farm purportedly underestimated the actual losses sustained by the homeowners association 
state farm motion for summary judgment 
on november,state farm moved for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication.in its moving papers state farm argued its policy obligates it to pay its insured only if the amount necessary to repair earthquake damage with equivalent construction or the amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged property exceeds the policy deductible and the amount of earthquake damage sustained by the cheviot vista complex,based on state farm estimate,those obtained by the homeowners association and the amount the homeowners association actually spent to repair the property,was far less than the policy deductible state farm estimate was accounting for depreciation the homeowners association estimates for complete repairs ranged from to the homeowners association spent less than to repair the property and the policy deductible was.accordingly,the homeowners association was not entitled to benefits for northridge earthquake damage under its policy.
the homeowners association opposition to the summary judgment motion 
the homeowners association filed opposition papers on january,initially asserting the summary judgment motion should be denied,or at the very least continued,because discovery had yet to be completed.in particular,the homeowners association noted state farm recently had issued deposition subpoenas to several individuals familiar with the earthquake damage at the condominium complex,including former residents the depositions of several state farm adjusters had just concluded the deposition of state farm person most knowledgeable regarding its adjustment of northridge earthquake claims was scheduled in approximately two weeks and experts have not been designated or deposed.
alternatively,the homeowners association argued the motion should be denied on its merits because triable issues of material fact exist regarding the adequacy of state farm investigation and evaluation of its earthquake damage issues necessary to the resolution of both its breach of contract and bad faith causes of action.according to the homeowners association,state farm had wrongfully determined its earthquake damage claim was less than its policy deductible by lowballing the repair estimate and by improperly calculating the actual cash value of its earthquake loss.to support this assertion,the homeowners association cited in its separate statement only to paragraph of the declaration of glenn rosen,the homeowners association counsel,filed concurrently with the opposition papers.
paragraph of the rosen declaration states,as trial is scheduled for august,experts,including experts who will offer testimony regarding the homeowners association earthquake damages and state farm breach of contract and bad faith,will not be designated until june.a key element of the experts depositions will be the differences between and the impact upon the homeowners association allegations of bad faith stemming from its cost of repair estimate in the amount of versus state farm repair estimate in the amount of.no copy of a estimate or any further information is attached to or identified in the rosen declaration or elsewhere in the opposition papers regarding state farm purported failure to objectively evaluate and adjust the homeowners association earthquake damage claim 
finally,the homeowners association maintained summary judgment should be denied on the ground section obligated state farm to investigate and adjust the claim made in its lawsuit that it had newly discovered earthquake damage and state farm had failed to do so.
state farm reply in support of summary judgment and objection to the homeowners association evidence 
on february,state farm filed a reply memorandum in support of summary judgment and objections to paragraph of the rosen declaration on the grounds it is vague,ambiguous,lacks foundation,contains hearsay statements,misstates the evidence and is irrelevant.in particular,state farm objected that rosen had not established that either he or his experts have the requisite special knowledge,skill,experience,training or education to qualify as experts concerning the earthquake,the policy or state farm claims handling.it also objected rosen had not established that either he or his experts are qualified to distinguish earthquake damage from damage caused by other causes,knew the condition of the property prior to the earthquake,or knew the condition of the property following the earthquake.rosen has not even attempted to establish what he or his experts did to determine the nature cost of repair to the homeowners association purported earthquake damage.nor has he shown knowledge by himself or his experts regarding repairs completed or underway.in addition,state farm objected the declaration contains impermissible hearsay evidence as to the findings of other consultants or individuals,citing evidence code section.
the trial court ruling on the motion for summary judgment 
the trial court heard oral argument on state farm motion on february,and then granted the motion plaintiff ha s never submitted evidence that the cost of repair comes close to the deductible.plaintiff spent on repairs and the deductible is approximately.the claim file was closed in august with no request to reopen the claim.this action was filed in april.the undisputed facts in the separate statement establish that state farm fulfilled its duty under the insurance contract.motion to continue is denied.the trial court did not rule on state farm objections to paragraph of the rosen declaration,merely stating,in reaching its ruling and order in this matter,this court has considered only admissible evidence.judgment in favor of state farm was entered on march.
contentions 
the homeowners association contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment because state farm failure to investigate its newly discovered earthquake damage constitutes a breach of the insurance contract and bad faith evidence of newly discovered earthquake at more than seven times the estimate prepared by state farm in a triable issue of material fact regarding whether in state farm failed to adequately investigate and evaluate its earthquake damage claim and the methodology used by state farm in to calculate the amount of its loss was impermissible.at a minimum,the homeowners association contends,the trial court should have continued the hearing on the motion for summary judgment under section,subdivision h,because discovery had yet to be completed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.intel hamidi cal th,d,subd.c.
the trial court properly granted summary judgment 
state farm satisfied its initial burden of demonstrating the homeowners association could not establish necessary elements of its causes of action 
under the terms of the homeowners association policy with state farm,the homeowners association was entitled to be paid either the actual cash value or the replacement cost of property lost or damaged by the northridge earthquake.payment based on replacement cost without deduction for depreciation will not be made until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced,and the sum paid will not exceed the amount actually spent for the repairs or replacement of the property the policy,with a limit for earthquake damage of,carried a percent deductible of and provided,we will not pay for loss in any one occurrence until the amount of loss exceeds the deductible.we will then pay only the amount of loss in excess of the deductible up to the applicable limit of insurance.
the undisputed facts before the trial court on summary judgment established that in april state farm,after conducting a detailed inspection of the property except for the individual units to which it was not granted access,determined the replacement cost value for the damage to the condominium complex was a sum that did not include any deduction for depreciation.because this amount of damage was far less than the policy deductible,state farm notified the homeowners association it was not entitled to benefits under its policy for earthquake damage.minutes from the homeowners association board meetings in the months following the earthquake indicate the homeowners association was in agreement with this evaluation and,indeed,a city inspector had determined shortly after the earthquake the exterior of the property had no structural damage and had suffered only small cracks.moreover,after receiving state farm estimate,the homeowners association obtained bids from three contractors to repair the complete earthquake damage,which ranged in amount from to,all less than state farm estimate.ultimately,in november the homeowners association chose to repair only the most significant earthquake damage and hired a contractor that completed the work for less than.despite numerous requests from state farm,the homeowners association never granted state farm access to the individual units that had not been inspected,nor did it submit an estimate for the plumbing problem it had discovered in june.indeed,state farm did not hear again from the homeowners association until this eight years later.
this evidence is sufficient to satisfy state farm initial burden on summary judgment as to the causes of action for both breach of contract and bad faith state farm estimate and those of the three contractors retained independently by the homeowners association all indicated the damage to the condominium complex was far less than the policy deductible.the homeowners association ultimately decided to spend even less to repair only the most significant earthquake damage.as a result,according to the evidence submitted with the moving papers,state farm did not owe benefits to the homeowners association under the terms of the policy and,therefore,did not breach the insurance contract based on its adjustment of the claim in.in addition,because state farm satisfied its initial burden of establishing it did not breach the insurance policy in,absent evidence from the homeowners association creating a triable issue of material fact,the bad faith cause of action necessarily falls as well.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,absent th e contractual right to policy benefits,the implied covenant has nothing upon which to act as a supplement,and should not be endowed with an existence independent of its contractual underpinnings.citation.love fire ins.exchange d.where benefits are withheld for proper cause,there is no breach of the implied covenant.
b.the homeowners association failed to present competent evidence creating a triable issue of material fact regarding newly discovered earthquake damage 
because state farm made a prima facie showing the homeowners association could not prove either breach of contract or breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,its initial burden on summary judgment,the burden shifted to the homeowners association to demonstrate,by responsive separate statement and admissible evidence,that triable issues of fact exist.rosenblum safeco ins.th,d rosenblum,subd.p see merrill navegar,cal th,d.in its opposition to summary judgment,the homeowners association presented three arguments state farm had an affirmative obligation under section to investigate the homeowners association newly discovered earthquake damage and its failure to do so constitutes a breach of the insurance contract and bad faith the evidence of newly discovered earthquake damage,estimated the required at to repair more than seven times the estimate prepared by state farm in,creates a triable issue of material fact regarding the homeowners association entitlement to policy benefits and the adequacy of state farm investigation and evaluation of the homeowners association earthquake damage claim and the methodology used by state farm in to calculate the actual cash value of the loss impermissibly included deductions for depreciation and overhead and profit.
the homeowners association initial argument that section created a duty for insurers to investigate newly discovered earthquake damage has been expressly rejected by this court.in lincoln fountain villas homeowners state farm fire casualty ins.th,d lincoln,we held section,while reviving certain earthquake damage claims and allowing an insured to bring a cause of action against its insurer on such a claim within one year of the statute effective date,did not impose any renewed or additional duties on insurance carriers.see also euclid homeowners state farm fire casualty th,d the passage of section did not give or create any rights for an insured beyond a window to file any claim it might otherwise have rosenblum,supra,th at,d section did nothing more than reopen the filing window,for a period,to those otherwise viable cases that had become.
to suggest otherwise is to misunderstand the limited scope of section to obviate the adverse impact the limitations period included in homeowners insurance policies pursuant to insurance code section was having on the ability of many insureds to obtain compensation from their insurance companies for property damage caused by the northridge earthquake.lincoln,supra,th at,d.in an action made timely under section,s ubsequently discovered evidence of earthquake damage may or may not support a claim an insurer initial investigation and adjustment of a claim were deficient,but it does not impose on the insurer a new duty to investigate.citations.lincoln,at,d.because in the instant action state farm did not assert a defense as a ground for summary judgment,section is irrelevant to our review of the trial court order granting state farm motion.citation.id.at,d.
the homeowners association second argument that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding the adequacy of state farm investigation and evaluation of its claim is based on the contention it has newly discovered earthquake damage at the property,which will cost to repair.as the only support for this contention,the homeowners association offered the declaration of its counsel,who,in reporting that experts in the case had yet to be designated,stated,a key element of the experts depositions will be the differences between and the impact
