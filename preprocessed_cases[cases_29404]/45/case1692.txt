background 
factual history 
dfa is a dairy cooperative which contracted with cabool to ship its milk and dairy products to customers nationwide.the contract required cabool to indemnify dfa for claims arising out of personal injury or property damage sustained by reason of an act or omission of cabool or its employees.dfa and cabool each obtained a million liability policy through travelers using the same independent broker.cabool also obtained a million umbrella policy from national union.
dfa and cabool intended that cabool primary and excess policies would be exhausted before any claim could trigger coverage under dfa policy.however,the submissions prepared by the broker did not specify this intention.dfa offered evidence that the insurance broker understood the dfa and cabool business relationship and their transportation agreement containing the indemnity provision.although the broker believed travelers also understood the relationship,travelers classified dfa as a trucker in the business of providing transportation for hire,disqualifying cabool indemnity as an insured contract in both the and union policies.in response to the broker submissions,travelers prepared insurance quotations which dfa and cabool accepted.
travelers liability policy issued to dfa had a deductible.as required by travelers,dfa deposited into a specified insurance reserve account to cover the deductible.
in february,while transporting goods under cabool contract with dfa,a cabool driver was involved in a trucking accident.the cabool truck hit a car driven by deborah ward ward,causing her severe injuries.ward sued the driver,cabool,dfa,and state farm insurance company for million.travelers agreed to defend the driver,cabool,and dfa and retained the same defense counsel for each insured.
in september,travelers informed dfa that travelers was applying both the dfa and the cabool policies to the ward claim.travelers settled the ward claim for million in february.travelers applied the million policy limits from both the dfa policy and the cabool policy.travelers deducted from the dfa reserve account to cover dfa deductible.national union paid the remaining million from cabool umbrella policy.
procedural history 
in june dfa brought a declaratory judgment action against travelers alleging that travelers had wrongly applied dfa liability policy and had wrongly applied dfa deductible.dfa asserted multiple tort claims,including breach of fiduciary duty,conversion,negligent misrepresentation,fraudulent,and vexatious refusal.in the alternative,dfa sought equitable reformation of its policy and the cabool policy with travelers to reflect their intention and understanding that the policy covered claims only after cabool primary and excess policies were exhausted.
in november travelers filed a complaint against cabool.cabool moved to dismiss the complaint.dfa did not object to cabool motion.in june the district court dismissed travelers complaint against cabool.
both travelers and dfa filed motions for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of travelers.the district court framed the essential dispute as whether dfa policy offers solely excess coverage relative to both of cabool policies.the court then narrowed its inquiry to whether dfa policy is excess relative to cabool umbrella policy with national union.after reviewing the insurance policies,the district court found that national union policy is a true excess or umbrella policy whereas,dfa policy is primary in nature and excess only by virtue of an other insurance provision.relying on smith wausau underwriters insurance company,the district court held that a policy offering excess coverage only through an other insurance clause is not considered excess relative to an umbrella policy covering the same loss.
the district court did not determine whether travelers had erred when,in defending dfa and cabool,it considered dfa to be a trucker engaged in the business of providing transportation for hire and deemed its policy with cabool policy for purposes of the ward personal injury claim the district court found this determination was unnecessary.according to the court,dfa was not prejudiced by any such error because the dfa policy was not excess relative to cabool umbrella policy.
finding that dfa policy was not excess to the umbrella policy and that dfa sustained no damages,the district court granted summary judgment on dfa declaratory judgment,conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,and vexatious refusal claims.because dfa did not resist summary judgment on its negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent claims,the court granted summary judgment on these claims as well.
the district court then considered and rejected dfa claim for equitable reformation of the dfa policy.the court found the written and insurance policies were unambiguous and dfa had an adequate remedy at law,namely a claim against cabool based on the parties indemnification agreement.because the insurance policies had expired and dfa could pursue a direct claim against cabool under the indemnification agreement,the district court found reformation was unnecessary.
dfa filed an amended motion for reconsideration of the court order granting summary judgment.in the alternative,dfa sought leave to file an amended complaint adding cabool as a party.travelers resisted,and the district court denied the motion.
on appeal,dfa contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment to travelers on dfa tort claims abused its discretion by refusing to reform the dfa policy and abused its discretion by refusing to permit dfa to amend its pleadings to add cabool as a defendant.
ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.jeseritz potter,cir.when the evidence,viewed in a light most favorable to the party,demonstrates the existence of no genuine issues of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,summary judgment shall be granted.see.c clark kellogg,cir.
tort claims 
dfa contends the district court erred in granting summary judgment on its breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,fraudulent,and conversion claims.travelers argues dfa tort claims rest on the erroneous premise that the dfa policy is excess over the cabool policy and the national union umbrella policy,and fail as a matter of law for lack of proof of damages.following our review of the record,we conclude the district court properly granted summary judgment on dfa conversion claim.furthermore,because dfa did not resist summary judgment as to its negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent claims,the district court properly granted summary judgment on these claims.however,we do not agree with the district court ruling that dfa breach of fiduciary duty claim must fail as a matter of law.
