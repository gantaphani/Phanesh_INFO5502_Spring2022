an endorsement in a liability insurance policy issued to a property owners association excluded coverage of claims for wrongful acts based on the design or construction of any structure.we conclude the exclusion did not preclude coverage of a lawsuit brought by a member against the association asserting claims of fraud and breach of duty.the member claims were not based on the association involvement in the design or construction of a structure,but instead were based on the association conduct in opining on a dispute that arose between the member and another homeowner after the member constructed a structure blocking the view of the other homeowner.accordingly,the exclusion from coverage did not apply,and the trial court erred in ordering summary judgment for the insurer.

executive risk indemnity,insurer issued the association a policy of insurance for the period july,to july,specifically a organization directors,officers and trustees liability insurance policy the policy.the association application for the policy stated,in response to a request for a brief description of the association operations,that its p rimary function is to encourage compliance with cc r restrictions in deeds of members of the association,for the benefit of the community.the policy applied to claims made during the policy period,and the insurer agreed to pay on behalf of the insured loss from claims first made against the association during the policy period for its wrongful acts.a wrongful act was defined to include any actual or alleged error,omission,misstatement,misleading statement or breach of duty by the association.
among several endorsements to the policy was an exclusion the exclusion that provided as follows 
endorsement

the development,planning or landscaping of any real property including any landscaping design,site planning and soil,water,environmental or other testing with respect to any such development,planning or landscaping

the design,construction,renovation or rehabilitation of any building,structure or other improvement on any real property.
on june,during the policy period,association members nicholas and yasuko valery sued the association,asserting claims of fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of duty to act in good faith,and other claims.the valerys complaint alleged as follows 
in,the valerys remodeled their property,replacing an attached covered patio area with an enclosed structure.in february,nicholas valery contacted the association for assistance with a dispute raised by a neighboring homeowner,joan robertson,who claimed that the valerys construction obstructed views from her property.the association told the valerys it provided informal,assistance in bringing neighbors together to settle their differences,but did not tell the valerys it would take sides in the dispute or issue a formal determination that could or would be subject to a claim of judicial deference.the valerys thereupon provided information for the association use in the dispute resolution process,openly discussing all aspects of the dispute.the association suggested the valerys try to settle with robertson and offer her monetary compensation.after a meeting with the association in april,the valerys did not seek further assistance from the association,but continued settlement discussions with robertson.
thereafter,the association informed robertson she should formally apply to the association so that it could issue a written determination on her dispute with the valerys.the association told robertson its written determination would support robertson position and would demand remedial action by the valerys the written determination would could be subject to a claim of judicial deference the association would provide assistance in a lawsuit filed by robertson,and would assist robertson in finding counsel.
on july,the association issued a formal determination.among other things,the determination stated that the valerys replacement structure violated paragraph of the cc rs called for removal of the structure and mandate d reinstatement of views alleged to have existed before the valerys purchase of the property.
robertson then sued the valerys,alleging they were bound to comply with the association determination and the remedial action dictated by the determination,which was subject to judicial deference.the association voluntarily provided declarations and documents to robertson in support of her lawsuit against the valerys,while denying similar information to the valerys unless compelled by subpoena.
the valerys replacement structure did not violate paragraph of the cc rs the association had no authority under the cc rs to issue determinations,which are not entitled to judicial deference any power the association had under the cc rs expired in and the association exercised its alleged powers arbitrarily and capriciously,allowing certain homes and owners the forming members of the association unlimited ability to build and expand while severely restricting construction at other homes of newly arriving homeowners.
after the association tendered the defense of the valerys action to the insurer,the insurer refused to provide a defense or to indemnify the association for any damages that might be awarded in the valery lawsuit,asserting that coverage was excluded under the exclusion.
the association then filed this lawsuit against the insurer and its broker,michael sutton and the sutton insurance agency sutton,asserting causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and declaratory relief against the insurer,and for negligence and declaratory relief against sutton.sutton against the insurer and others.
the insurer moved for summary judgment,asserting that because of the exclusion,no coverage existed under the policy.the trial court granted the motion,concluding the language of the exclusion was not ambiguous 
t he language of the definition of wrongful act and of the exclusion is very broad.the exclusion prohibits coverage for claims of wrongful acts defined to include any error,omission or breach of duty by the association in any way involving improvement on any real property.here,the association seeks coverage for claims that it committed a wrongful,negligently and in breach of duty,attempting to coerce the valerys to alter the renovations to their house,among others.
judgment was entered in the insurer favor and against the association,and appeals were filed by both the association and sutton.
discussion 
we respectfully disagree with the trial court conclusion that the exclusion in the policy precludes coverage of the valerys claims against the association.while the court interpretation of
