specialty national insurance company appeals the district court decision,reached on for summary judgment,that specialty,rather than appellee onebeacon insurance company,has the duty to indemnify a policyholder for liability arising out of a catastrophic accident.we reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of specialty.
the accident caused serious and permanent injuries to marcia rhodes,whose car was by a tractor trailer on route in medway,massachusetts.rhodes had brought her vehicle to a stop at the command of a medway police officer directing traffic through an area where jerry mcmillan professional tree service,was working to remove stumps along the northerly side of the road mcmillan was using a stump grinder attached to a pickup truck in the fashion of a trailer,driving the truck past each stump before backing the grinder up to it to begin the process.mcmillan had been grinding a stump for about three or four minutes at the time the accident occurred.
according to the police report,t he vehicle being used,a tree stump grinder on a trailer pulled by a truck,was straddling the eastbound fog line,leaving a portion of the truck on the roadway.as a result of this,the officer was directing traffic through the work area,which had squeezed the traffic area of the road down to one lane.because of this,the officer stopped rhodes in the eastbound lane to allow westbound traffic to proceed.but the driver of the tractor trailer,carlo zalewski,was distracted as he approached in the eastbound lane and did not see the officer signal or rhodes car in enough time to stop his vehicle.the collision ensued.
in due course,counsel for rhodes wrote to the tractor trailer lessee,building materials corporation of america,to notify it of a claim against it for her injuries.counsel for bmca forwarded this letter to mcmillan,asserting that its operations may have contributed to the accident.mcmillan,in turn,contacted its insurance agent,which notified network adjusters,the claims administrator for specialty.mcmillan had a general commercial liability policy with specialty,providing indemnification for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or property damage and imposing the duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.excluded from this coverage,however,were any such damages arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any auto owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.use includes operation 
network adjusters acknowledged receipt of mcmillan claim on march.though network adjusters engaged in some preliminary investigation,it did so under the impression that mcmillan probably did not have any liability for the accident.in the meantime,rhodes and her husband filed suit in massachusetts state court against bmca,zalewski,and driver logistics,the agency that employed zalewski to drive the truck,seeking damages suffered as a result of the accident network adjusters learned of this development on september,from counsel for rhodes,who also offered his prediction that mcmillan would be named as a defendant.network adjusters prepared an initial major loss report for its files that same day indicating that,based on the information then in hand,coverage for such a claim would apparently lie under specialty policy.
on october,network adjusters reported the accident to onebeacon,mcmillan auto insurer,by telephone.mcmillan policy with onebeacon provided indemnification for all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto and the duty to defend against a suit seeking such damages internal quotation marks omitted the pickup truck was a covered auto under the policy.
as predicted,zalewski and driver logistics served mcmillan with a complaint on september.they alleged that mcmillan had failed in his duty to provide markers,warning signs,and traffic control devices on the worksite adjacent to route,making him a joint tortfeasor responsible for contribution to the plaintiffs in the event they were found liable for the rhodeses injuries.the complaint did not allege that mcmillan use of the pickup truck had contributed to the accident.
by november,specialty hired counsel to defend mcmillan against the claim.several months later,this attorney wrote to onebeacon,noting that allegations had surfaced during discovery in the lawsuit that his client had contributed to cause the accident by fail ing to pull his pickup truck completely off the side of route.counsel for mcmillan therefore asked onebeacon to participate in defending the action under the auto policy.ten days later,on june,network adjusters wrote to mcmillan,asserting that,despite specialty participation in the defense to date,its policy did not cover the liability at issue.the letter explained that,because mcmillan pickup was parked along route and was partially obstructing traffic a causal connection is reasonably apparent between the use to which the vehicle was being put and the alleged injury,placing it within the ambit of onebeacon auto policy.
network adjusters sent a similar letter to onebeacon,asking it to assume the obligation to defend mcmillan.in response,onebeacon agreed to participate in,and to pay one half of the further costs of,mcmillan defense,but denied any responsibility to defend or indemnify him.onebeacon argued that,because the complaint alleged only a failure to warn on mcmillan part,providing a defense or indemnity would be tantamount to converting onebeacon policy into a general liability policy.
at this point,the trial of the massachusetts state court action was scheduled to commence on september.before then,however,mcmillan reached a settlement with the rhodeses,which had the effect of extinguishing the contribution claims.see.laws ch,b.the settlement called for the rhodeses to receive,with specialty and onebeacon each paying half of that amount.each insurer,however,reserved its right to claim that the other was solely responsible for defending and indemnifying mcmillan and,therefore,for the entire cost of the settlement.the rhodeses claims against the remaining defendants proceeded to trial,resulting in verdicts against the remaining defendants in the sum of of interest and costs,which brought the figure to nearly million.
specialty then sued onebeacon in federal district court,seeking to recover the expense of defending and indemnifying mcmillan on a theory of equitable subrogation onebeacon counterclaimed against specialty for onebeacon portion of the settlement payment on the same theory.onebeacon eventually moved for summary judgment against specialty,arguing that specialty was estopped to deny coverage for the liability under mcmillan commercial policy due to specialty delay in doing so and alternatively,the liability was not covered by onebeacon auto policy.specialty opposed the motion and for summary judgment on the grounds that the liability fell within the scope of coverage of the auto policy,not the commercial policy and onebeacon could not assert estoppel because,inter alia,mcmillan could not claim to have detrimentally relied on specialty delay in denying coverage.
in a margin order,the district court granted onebeacon motion for summary judgment and denied specialty.the district court ruled that it was specialty policy that provided mcmillan with indemnification against the claim.the court also determined that 
for over two years,specialty national controlled the defense of the claims without asserting that those claims were excluded from coverage under the specialty national policy at issue.this was an unreasonable delay which precludes the present claim of specialty national for equitable subrogation.
the district court declared that specialty was primarily obligated to provide coverage to mcmillan for the liability and that onebeacon was entitled to equitable subrogation from specialty for onebeacon share of the settlement payment.specialty then assented to the entry of final judgment for onebeacon in accordance with the court order this appeal followed.
specialty challenges the district court rulings on summary judgment,arguing that mcmillan liability was covered by the auto policy and that it was not estopped to seek equitable subrogation against onebeacon.we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo.see,brooks aig sunam.life assurance,cir.the presence of for summary judgment neither dilutes nor distorts this standard of review.mandel boston phoenix,cir.
the interpretation of an insurance policy poses a question of law.see,fuller first fin.ins,accord merchants ins.of united states fid.guar,cir.in the absence of an here,both parties say there is court must construe the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense.see,fuller,at,at accord fireman fund ins.special olympics int l,cir.
onebeacon auto policy covers liability resulting from the use of a covered auto,while specialty excludes liability arising out of the use of any auto emphases added.despite this slight variation in language,the parties agree that their policies are essentially mirror images of each other in this mcmillan liability is covered under onebeacon policy,it is excluded from specialty policy,and vice versa see ruggerio ambulance,grange ins,relying on authorities interpreting arising out of to construe resulting from language in auto policy.
massachusetts courts are regularly called upon to decide whether a particular injury arises out of the use of an auto for purposes of insurance coverage,and t he distinctions drawn in this area are not always obvious.metro.prop.cas.ins.santos,discussing divergent outcomes.indeed,t here is no bright line test indicating when an injury may be said to arise out of the use of an automobile.white am.cas.ins.nevertheless,the case law in this area does provide some guidance.the expression arising out of indicates a wider range of causation than the concept of proximate causation in tort law.however,the expression does not refer to all circumstances in which the injury would not have occurred but for the involvement of a motor vehicle.rischitelli safety ins,citations omitted.
it follows,as onebeacon points out,that the mere involvement of a motor vehicle in a particular misfortune does not mean that the resulting injuries are covered by auto insurance.see ruggerio ambulance,at,at rejecting proposition that any use or operation of a motor vehicle results in coverage under a motor vehicle policy.so massachusetts courts have found the connection between an accident that delayed an ambulance en route to a dying man and his death too attenuated to bring the liability within the scope of the ambulance company auto insurance,id.at,at,and that,when an insured left his vehicle to attack another driver following a collision,t he battery on the plaintiff was sufficiently independent of the motor vehicle accident that the losses that the plaintiff sustained arose from the intentional wrongdoing of the other driver and not from the use of an automobile,rischitelli,at,at.see also tae tae,finding injuries sustained in explosion of kitchen stove caused when insured drained gas from vehicle into bucket,carried it into dwelling,and used gas to immolate himself insufficiently dependent on the use of the automobile to be covered by the automobile insurance policy.
here,though,the connection between the use of mcmillan pickup truck and the rhodeses injuries was closer than the attenuated or independent relationships found inadequate in these other cases.as the police report indicates,it was the positioning of part of the pickup in the roadway that required the police officer to direct traffic through the area one lane at a time.had the officer,in doing so,not directed rhodes to stop her car to allow vehicles traveling in the other direction to pass,she would not have been by the.even if this sequence does not necessarily establish proximate cause as a matter of it at least comes close,see wilborg denzell,rejecting challenge,on proximate cause grounds,to verdict for plaintiff injured in collision with motorist who crossed into her lane while swerving around defendant stalled car a causal connection is reasonably apparent between the use to which the vehicle was being put and the resulting injury.ruggerio ambulance,at,at quoting lee russ thomas sagalia,couch on insurance ed see also assetta.at,at ruling that injuries caused by bottle thrown from moving vehicle arose out of its use because it is reasonable to assume that its movement affected both the trajectory of the bottle and the force with which it struck plaintiff.mcmillan liability for the rhodeses injuries is therefore covered by his auto policy with onebeacon and excluded from his commercial liability policy with specialty.see allstate ins.safer,d,ruling that liability for negligently parking truck to obscure view of intersection,resulting in collision between two other vehicles,was injury arising out of the use of an auto excluded from commercial liability policy.
in disputing this conclusion,onebeacon notes that the complaint sought contribution for the rhodeses damages solely on a theory that mcmillan had failed to place the requisite signs warning of the work adjacent to the roadway,as opposed to any negligence in his positioning of the vehicle.the scope of liability coverage,however,depends on the source from which the plaintiff personal injury originates rather than the specific theories of liability alleged in the complaint of the underlying civil action.brazas sporting arms,am.empire surplus lines ins,cir quoting bagley monticello ins,bracketing omitted as just discussed,the placement of part of mcmillan truck in the roadway was a source of the rhodeses injuries in the sense that it bore the necessary causal relationship to them that zalewski and his employer sought to hold mcmillan responsible for the accident based on different,allegedly negligent acts does not undermine that conclusion.see brazas sporting arms,at ruling that claim of negligently flooding market with firearms fell within products liability exclusion to commercial liability policy because firearms were the immediate source of the plaintiffs injuries.
onebeacon also maintains that mcmillan liability is not covered by its auto policy because the pickup truck was not in use at the time of the collision.to the contrary,onebeacon argues,mcmillan was grinding a stump at that point,which would have required him to get out of the pickup in order to operate the grinder.this argument,however,mistakenly focuses on what mcmillan was doing at the precise moment of the accident,when the proper inquiry under the policies is whether mcmillan liability for the accident arises out of the use of the pickup.before engaging the stump he was working on at the time of the crash,mcmillan had driven his truck past the stump and backed the grinder up to it.this was unquestionably a use of the pickup truck and,as we have already concluded,it was this use that had a causal connection to the accident in the sense that the positioning of the truck the roadway required the officer to stop rhodes.
whether mcmillan was also making use of the truck within the meaning of the policies by operating the stump grinder at the instant of the crash,then,is we suspect that he was.see white.at,at t he term use must be understood in its most comprehensive sense and the term is not confined to motion on a highway,but extends to any activity in utilizing the insured vehicle in the manner intended or contemplated by the insured quoting russ segalia,supra.we therefore conclude that the district court erred in ruling that specialty,not onebeacon,had the duty to indemnify mcmillan against the claim seeking contribution for the rhodeses injuries.that liability arose out of mcmillan use of the pickup truck,bringing it within the scope of onebeacon auto policy and excluding it from specialty general commercial liability policy.
in granting summary judgment for onebeacon,the district court also ruled that specialty was estopped to pursue equitable subrogation because f or over two years,it controlled the defense of the claims without asserting that those claims were excluded from coverage und
