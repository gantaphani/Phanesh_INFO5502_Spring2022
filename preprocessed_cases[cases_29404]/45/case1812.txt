we must decide,among other issues,whether an insurance company failure to settle a claim against its insured by a claimant stated settlement deadline constitutes a breach of the insurer duty of good faith and fair dealing under alaska law.
on september,charles herron was involved in a accident,in which his passenger angelina trailov was severely injured at the time,allstate insurance company allstate provided car insurance to herron under a policy obtained by herron parents,which provided a maximum of bodily injury coverage for each person injured.
allstate learned of herron accident two days after it occurred and began its investigation that same day.allstate contacted herron mother and discussed the scope of herron insurance but unsuccessfully attempted to contact trailov at the hospital to which she had been airlifted.a week later,allstate sent a letter to herron parents,advising them that it was working on the claim.herron father faxed a copy of the letter to herron attorney,who in turn faxed a copy of the letter to trailov attorney,michele power.
shortly thereafter,allstate sent a letter to power requesting a complete description of trailov injuries,information regarding trailov treating physicians and any ongoing treatment she was receiving,and access to trailov medical records or bills as power received them.allstate received the medical release form signed by trailov mother,mary kenick,as well as a letter requesting a copy of herron insurance policy.
in february of,power sent allstate a letter demanding that it pay its full policy limits for trailov injury.the letter did not specify a deadline for allstate response.allstate acknowledged receipt of power letter,and forwarded herron a copy of the letter,informing him that his policy does not cover punitive damages.herron attorney responded insisting that allstate accept power offer and stating that if it refused to do so,herron would look to allstate for all damages awarded,including punitive damages.
in april,power again wrote to allstate,stating that power offer to settle at policy limits would be revoked on may,and that power would file a lawsuit on trailov behalf unless there is some discussion regarding resolution.on may,allstate acknowledged receipt of power letter,and stated that allstate anticipated responding by may.on may,allstate paid trailov to compensate a portion of her medical expenses.on may,allstate faxed a letter to power indicating that it had not yet completed its investigation,but that it would do so and respond to her settlement offer by the end of the month.true to its word,allstate faxed power a letter offering to settle at herron policy limit in addition to in attorneys fees on may.that same day,allstate received a letter from attorney douglas johnson indicating that allstate had failed to meet power deadline and that johnson had been retained by trailov as to file suit against allstate.
allstate filed a complaint against herron in the district court for the district of alaska,seeking declaratory relief.allstate sought a declaration that its good faith attempt to settle trailov and kenick claims satisfied its obligation to its insured,and that it is not obligated to pay any portion of the confessed judgment that exceeds the limit of the bodily injury coverage afforded herron under the policy.but before he was served with the complaint in the federal lawsuit,herron confessed to judgment in the amount of against himself in favor of kenick and trailov in alaska superior court and assigned all of his rights against allstate to kenick and trailov.in exchange,kenick and trailov entered into a covenant not to execute the judgment against herron personal assets.kenick and trailov then initiated a lawsuit in alaska state court against allstate,attempting to collect under herron assigned rights.
in light of herron actions,allstate amended its complaint,seeking additional declarations that herron breached the cooperation clause of the insurance contract by consenting to entry of judgment and assigning his rights without allstate permission herron breach was not excused by any prior material breach by allstate herron breach voided the insurance contract and either allstate liability is limited to the amount of bodily injury coverage or,in the alternative,herron breach voided the contract and all liability coverage.
herron responded with a motion requesting that the district court decline jurisdiction over allstate suit or,in the alternative,stay proceedings.herron argued that,because he had assigned any claims he may have had against allstate to kenick and trailov,herron was no longer a real party in interest to the controversy and allstate action should therefore be prosecuted in state court along with kenick and trailov nonremovable tort claims.the district court denied the motion and retained jurisdiction over allstate request for declaratory relief,concluding that jurisdiction was proper because the suit did not involve any unsettled areas of state law,nor did it risk duplicative litigation.herron then filed a motion to dismiss allstate suit as moot or,in the alternative,to substitute kenick and trailov for himself as party defendants.the district court again denied herron motion,although it suggested that allstate consider adding kenick and trailov as defendants.
allstate and herron each filed motions for summary judgment,both of which the district court denied before trial,allstate filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence of various instances of purported behavior.the district court had previously concluded that herron suffered no harm as a result of these purported transgressions,and granted allstate motion.
after a trial,the court submitted a single question to the jury considering all the facts and circumstances contained in the evidence submitted to you,did allstate act reasonably by offering policy limits on may,the jury answered,yes.after the jury delivered its verdict,allstate counsel indicated that he would submit a proposed judgment to the court,and the judge replied,okay.but the next day,before allstate filed its proposed judgment,the district court entered a judgment indicating only that allstate did act reasonably by offering policy limits on may.less than a week later,allstate filed a motion to amend the judgment to reflect several additional declarations that allstate sought in its complaint.namely,allstate sought to amend the judgment to state 
the jury returned a verdict in favor of allstate on june,finding that under all the facts and circumstances allstate acted reasonably by offering policy limits on may.
it is undisputed that herron breached the insurance contract by consenting to entry of judgment and assigning his rights without allstate consent.
pursuant to the jury verdict,herron breach was not excused by any prior breach by allstate.
herron breach voided the insurance policy liability coverage.
herron assignment of rights to trailov and kenick is null and void because herron had no rights to assign as of the date of assignment.
the district court granted allstate motion,and filed the amended judgment as requested.herron timely appeals.
herron first claims that the district court improperly exercised jurisdiction over allstate suit for declaratory relief.under the declaratory judgment act,a district court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.a gov t emps.ins.dizol,cir en banc.so long as the court exercise of jurisdiction over the suit passes constitutional and statutory muster,the district court has discretion to determine whether maintaining jurisdiction over the declaratory action would be appropriate.dizol,at.in making such a determination,a district court is to consider a variety of factors,including whether retaining jurisdiction would involve the needless determination of state law issues encourage the filing of declaratory actions as a means of forum shopping risk duplicative litigation resolve all aspects of the controversy in a single proceeding serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue permit one party to obtain an unjust res judicata advantage risk entangling federal and state court systems or jeopardize the convenience of the parties.id.at.because the district court is in the best position to assess how judicial economy,comity and federalism are affected in a given case,id.at,we review the district court decision to retain jurisdiction over a declaratory judgment action for abuse of discretion,id.at.
here,the district court did not abuse its discretion by maintaining jurisdiction over allstate declaratory judgment action.this case presents a straightforward contract dispute between allstate and herron,over which the district court has jurisdiction based on the parties diversity.allstate complaint seeks a declaration merely that herron breached the insurance contract and voided its coverage by consenting to the entry of judgment against him and by assigning his contractual rights against allstate.the district court decided no issues of alaska law outside of that defining herron and allstate contractual relationship.there is thus little concern that allstate declaratory judgment action entangled federal and state court systems or that the district court allowed allstate unfairly to select a favorable or inconvenient forum for determining its rights under the contract.moreover,herron never initiated his own action against allstate that would risk duplicative litigation of these same contractual rights.in short,we see no concern that would have required the district court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction over allstate action.
herron counters that,under the guise of a contract suit,allstate has in fact sought a declaration of its defense to the tort suit filed by kenick and trailov in alaska state court.in particular,he contends that the jury finding that under all facts and circumstances,allstate act ed reasonably by offering policy limits on may,is simply a statement of allstate nonliability to kenick and trailov tort claims.herron argues that the district court therefore erred by allowing allstate to use this declaratory judgment action to handpick its preferred forum for litigating the merits of kenick and trailov state tort action.cunningham,bail,cir t o compel potential personal injury plaintiffs to litigate their claims at a time and in a forum chosen by the alleged would be a perversion of the declaratory judgment act.
but herron misunderstands the connection between the action here and kenick and trailov tort suit against allstate.the issues in this suit and the tort suit overlap solely because kenick and trailov rights against allstate are entirely derivative of herron rights under his insurance agreement.the jury declaration of allstate reasonableness pertains to alaska law defining an insurer contractual obligations to its insured,not tort law.see continental ins.bayless roberts,alaska.that declaration may well be fatal to kenick and trailov tort claims against allstate,but only because an unexcused breach of the contract by herron may have thus prevented him from assigning any rights against allstate to kenick and trailov in the first place.at bottom,allstate suit sounds in contract,not tort,regardless whether the merits of this action have become entwined with a defense allstate may potentially raise to kenick and trailov derivative tort action.accordingly,we are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion by maintaining jurisdiction over allstate declaratory judgment action.
herron next contends that the district court erred by refusing to direct a verdict that allstate materially breached the insurance contract when it failed to accept power offer to settle at policy limits by may.we review the district court denial of a motion for directed verdict de novo.oglesby pac.transp,cir.to succeed on his claim,herron must demonstrate that the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to allstate,requires a rational juror to conclude that allstate materially breached the contract by offering to settle at policy limits on may.see maheu hughes tool,cir.
in alaska,w hen a plaintiff makes a policy limits demand,the covenant of good faith and fair dealing places a duty on an insurer to tender maximum policy limits to settle a plaintiff demand when there is a substantial likelihood of an excess verdict against the insured.jackson am.equity ins,alaska.this obligation stems from an insurer general duty to act in good faith to protect the interests of the insured,and it requires the insurer to exercise not only good faith,but also ordinary care and reasonable diligence and caution,continental ins,at internal quotation marks omitted.if an insurer unreasonably refuses to settle at policy limits,it has materially breached its contractual obligation to the insured and can not escape liability on the ground that the insured failed to comply with other terms of the contract subsequent to the insurer own breach.grace ins.of,alaska ellipsis in original internal quotation marks omitted.thus,if allstate breached its obligation to tender policy limits in response to power settlement offer,herron would be entitled to coverage,even in excess of his policy,for his liability to trailov and kenick,regardless of any subsequent breach on his part.see jackson,at grace.
because the parties stipulated that allstate could have determined that herron liability exceeded the limits of his insurance policy by may,herron contends that,as a matter of law,allstate breached its duty to settle at policy limits by failing to meet power may deadline.but the parties stipulation did not preclude a rational jury from finding that allstate nevertheless acted reasonably by offering to settle at policy limits only two weeks later.in essence,the parties stipulation did not require a jury to conclude that allstate should have determined herron liability to exceed the policy limits and should have offered to settle by may.
indeed,the jury found that allstate decision to offer to settle on may,was reasonable,and we have no cause to question the jury conclusion based upon the record before us.allstate began its investigation two days after herron accident occurred and was consistently in contact with power throughout the process.although power placed a may deadline on her offer to settle,her language was not steadfast rather,she merely stated that by the deadline there must be some discussion regarding resolution.allstate twice responded to this settlement offer by the deadline,and it even paid a portion of trailov medical bills on may.on may,allstate stated that it would have a final answer by the end of the month,and on may,allstate in fact accepted power offer to settle at policy limits.
viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to allstate,it is not clear that allstate failed to comply with the terms of power deadline,let alone that it failed reasonably to offer to settle at policy limits.a rational jury could find that allstate acted reasonably.because herron is not entitled to judgment that allstate breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing,the district court did not err in refusing to grant herron motion for a directed verdict 
herron next contends that the district court improperly excluded evidence at trial relating to alleged contract breaches by allstate other than its failure to accept power settlement offer by may.in particular,herron contends that the district court should have permitted him to introduce evidence that allstate violated its own procedures and alaska insurance regulations in investigating herron accident,never sent herron a letter notifying him of his potential for excess liability,failed to investigate properly the claims against herron,and failed to advise herron and his counsel of allstate settlement negotiations.the district court excluded evidence relating to each of these claims under federal rules of evidence and.we review the district court evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion,and the appellant is required to establish that the error was prejudicial.tritchler cnty.of lake,cir.
standing alone,none of these additional alleged breaches would entitle herron to prevail on the merits of this action.under alaska law,only a material
