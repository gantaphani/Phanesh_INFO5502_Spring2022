this appeal requires us to determine what an insured must prove in order to establish its rights under a lost or destroyed insurance policy.the trial court found that the insured had introduced sufficient secondary evidence to prove the substance of the policy material provisions,and rendered judgment for the insured.the court of appeal held that the insured was required instead to prove the actual words of those provisions,and reversed the judgment.as will appear,we conclude that the holding was erroneous,and therefore reverse the court of appeal judgment,with some issues outside the scope of review to be determined on remand.
from the until the late,rexall drug company rexall,predecessor in interest of plaintiff dart industries,dart,was one of a number of pharmaceutical companies that manufactured and marketed the prescription drug diethylstilbestrol des,a synthetic estrogen widely used at the time to prevent miscarriages.
throughout this period,rexall carried comprehensive general liability cgl insurance under policies issued in sequence by its three primary carriers employers liability assurance corporation,employers,predecessor in interest of defendant commercial union insurance corporation commercial union,for the years liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual,for the years and continental insurance company continental,for the years.
from the onward,a large number of claimants alleging personal injuries caused by exposure to des began filing actions for damages against des manufacturers nationwide.the majority of claimants were adult women whose mothers had ingested des while the claimants were in utero and who,when they reached childbearing age themselves,manifested precancerous and cancerous vaginal and cervical lesions,as well as various deformities of their reproductive organs resulting in infertility or miscarriages.see generally brown superior court cal d,sindell abbott laboratories cal d.many of the complaints were filed against dart,both in california and in other jurisdictions,alleging exposure to des in each of the foregoing time periods.dart tendered the defense of these actions to commercial union,liberty mutual,and continental.all three carriers denied coverage and refused to provide a defense.
in october,dart filed the present action for declaratory relief and damages against commercial union,liberty mutual,and continental.the primary relief sought was a declaratory judgment code civ,establishing that the policies defendants sold to dart and its predecessor obligate them to provide a defense to the des actions and to indemnify dart for any liability assessed against it in those actions.
in october,dart settled with liberty mutual and continental.commercial union declined to participate in the settlement.the remaining issue in the case,accordingly,was whether dart was entitled to a defense and indemnity from commercial union under the policy in effect for the period of september,to september,employers policy no.the question was complicated by the undisputed fact that the policy is lost and neither party has been able to find it or a copy of it.this fact,as we shall see,has led to the principal issue of law we address in this case.
this case has a long and convoluted procedural history,and has been the subject of no fewer than four appeals and four decisions of the court of appeal.we briefly review that history.
after various pretrial proceedings,dart moved for preference in trial setting.the motion was denied,and shortly thereafter the court dismissed the action for failure to bring it to trial within five years.code civ.dart appealed.in the first appeal,the court of appeal held the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for preference,and reversed and remanded for trial.dart industries,commercial union ins,nonpub.opn.dart industries i.the court also concluded that the trial court had properly denied dart motion for summary judgment,and held that at trial dart must prove the contents of the insurance policy by a preponderance of evidence,rejecting commercial union contention that proof must be by clear and convincing evidence.
the case was initially tried in before judge newell barrett,sitting without a jury.dart undertook to prove the existence and the substance of the material terms of the lost policy by means of the testimony of charles pyne,an employee of obrion,russell obrion,which served as the insurance agent of employers,commercial union predecessor and a broker for the dart account during the relevant period,as well as by various items of documentary evidence.judge barrett entered a minute order announcing a tentative decision in favor of commercial union on the ground that dart had not proved the lost policy limits of liability.dart requested a statement of decision code civ,but judge barrett died before issuing such a statement.a second judge thereupon signed a judgment for commercial union based on judge barrett minute order.dart appealed and the court of appeal reversed the judgment on the ground that a second judge is not authorized to sign a judgment based only on the first judge tentative decision.dart industries,commercial union ins.may,wl nonpub.opn.
the case was assigned for retrial to judge loren miller.by stipulation,the parties submitted the matter to him for decision on the basis of the record of the first trial,including the reporter and clerk transcripts and the exhibits,a videotape of the testimony given at the first trial,and new briefs.after reviewing this record,judge miller entered a minute order announcing a tentative decision in favor of dart.he then issued a statement of decision at commercial union request,and entered judgment accordingly.commercial union appealed.
the court of appeal held that judge miller statement of decision was insufficient as a matter of law because it failed to adequately explain the factual or legal basis for his decision on a number of issues identified by commercial union and deemed by the court of appeal to constitute principal controverted issues at trial code civ.on this ground,the court of appeal reversed the judgment with directions to judge miller to issue a new statement of decision addressing certain additional issues and to enter a new judgment based thereon.dart industries,commercial union ins.june,nonpub.opn.
as directed by the court of appeal and after further hearing,judge miller issued a substantially more detailed statement of decision and judgment.in the statement of decision,the court reviewed at length the evidence to support its findings that dart conducted a diligent and exhaustive search for the lost policy,but was unable to find it dart proved the existence of the policy by secondary evidence the policy was a manuscript policy,meaning that it was custom tailored to the insured,rather than a standard form the policy covered dart predecessor rexall for the single term from september,to september,the policy provided coverage for product liability claims for bodily injuries occurring during the policy period,including injuries caused by des exposure during that period but not manifesting themselves until after the period ended the policy provided coverage that would cover injuries initiated by the ingestion of the drug during the policy period but manifesting after that period the policy limits of liability were per person and per occurrence or accident,with a annual product liability aggregate limit the policy did not contain a deductible and the policy covered defense costs separately from the limits of liability.
the court then reviewed the case law to support its conclusion that the trigger of coverage under the policy was exposure to des rather than manifestation of the ensuing injury many years later.because dart several primary insurance carriers commercial union,liberty mutual,and continental proposed different triggers of coverage,the court recognized the potential for either inadequate recovery or double recovery of benefits to avoid that result,the court found method of allocating the insurers obligations devised by the parties,that commercial union should pay only percent of the costs of defense and indemnity in actions against dart arising from des exposure during the policy period.
in the ensuing judgment,entered on december,the court declared the parties rights and liabilities under the policy in accord with the foregoing statement of decision awarded dart damages of some million for local defense costs,for the allocated portion of the insured national coordinating defense counsel costs,and for indemnity,plus prejudgment interest through of some million and declared that dart is entitled to recover from commercial union percent of the defense costs and settlements incurred by dart after in actions for damages arising from des exposure during the policy period.commercial union appealed again.
the court of appeal again reversed the judgment,this time on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the findings of the trier of fact on the material terms of the lost policy,principally because dart failed to produce the actual language of the policy.from dart earlier stipulation to retry the case on the record of the first trial,the court of appeal inferred that dart has conceded it has no additional evidence to offer,and on that ground remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to enter judgment in favor of commercial union.
dart petitioned for review.we granted its petition to determine what an insured must prove in order to establish its rights under a lost insurance policy,and whether the court of appeal correctly held that the evidence in the case at bar was insufficient to support the trial court findings regarding the contents of the lost policy.
we begin with the statutory law.evidence code section,subdivision a,provides that t he content of a writing may be proved by otherwise admissible secondary evidence,excepting when a genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the writing and justice requires the exclusion or when a dmission of the secondary evidence would be unfair.the admission of oral testimony regarding the contents of a writing is specifically governed by section,which provides,in pertinent part,that such testimony is admissible if the proponent does not have possession or control of the original or a copy of the writing and n either the writing nor a copy of the writing was reasonably procurable by the proponent by use of the court process or by other available means fed.rules,rule,
these statutes are codifications of the venerable common law rule that lost documents may be proved by secondary evidence.in folsom executors scott cal,wl,the court stated the rule for the admission of secondary evidence of a lost paper,requires that a bona fide and diligent search has been unsuccessfully made for it in the place where it was most likely to be found and further,the party is expected to show that he has in good faith exhausted in a reasonable degree all the sources of information and means of discovery which the nature of the case would naturally suggest,and which were accessible to him.
as was elaborated in kenniff caulfield cal,kenniff if any suspicion hangs over the instrument,or that it is designedly withheld,a rigid inquiry should be made into the reasons for its.but where there is no such suspicion,all that ought to be required is reasonable diligence to obtain the fact,courts in such cases are extremely liberal.id.at.questions whether the search was sufficient in scope and was conducted in good faith are addressed to the discretion of the trial court,and will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion.id.at,see also guardianship of levy d.
a corollary of the rule that the contents of lost documents may be proved by secondary evidence is that the law does not require the contents of such documents be proved verbatim.in posten rassette cal,wl for example,the owner of real property gave a written power of attorney to his agent,parker.the document was accidentally destroyed by fire,but the owner took no steps to revoke the power.a year later,acting on the same power,parker sold the property to a third person.this court affirmed a judgment recognizing the validity of the sale.at trial,the notary who witnessed the deed of sale testified he had seen the power of attorney in question,that it had authorized parker to sell the property,and that the document had been destroyed by fire.this court held that the testimony was sufficient to establish the existence,loss,and contents of the power of attorney.in the case of lost instruments where no copy has been preserved,it is not to be expected that witnesses can recite its contents,word for word.id.at.
this rule was reaffirmed in kenniff,supra,cal.there the only evidence of the contents of a lost and unrecorded deed to a parcel of real property was the testimony of the conveyancer who drafted it he identified the blank form he had used,and said he had copied into it a description of the property taken from a prior deed of the property to the grantor and he was sure the deed was to the lot in issue.holding this testimony to be sufficient proof of the contents of the lost deed,we stated it is not necessary,in order to admit evidence of the contents of a lost instrument,that the witnesses should be able to testify with verbal accuracy to its contents it is sufficient if they are able to state it in substance.id.at.subsequent cases are in accord.for example,in seaboard national bank ackerman,when all record of a judgment in a lawsuit had been destroyed by fire,the court reiterated in the case of a lost instrument where no copy has been preserved,it is not to be expected that witnesses can state the contents,word for word.citation.the substance of a lost or destroyed document is all that is required.id.at,accord,von hasseln von hasseln d.
the lost document cases illustrate a few of the many types of secondary evidence that courts have admitted to prove the contents of a missing instrument.for example,courts have often admitted oral testimony for this purpose.kenniff,supra,cal.at,posten rassette,supra,cal.at robinson thornton d.lost contract to repurchase gas lease testimony of contracting party guardianship of levy,supra,d at,testimony of recipient of lost letters deacon bryans,testimony of witness who saw lost promissory notes seaboard national bank ackerman,supra.at,testimony establishing record of judgment destroyed by fire hedstrom union trust,testimony of drafter of lost lease.courts have also admitted a standard form of the lost document kenniff,supra,cal.at,blank form used in drafting lost deed,as well as evidence of a routine practice of a party amoco production united states cir,lost deed grantor routine practice of reserving a mineral interest in all property deeded.
the use of secondary evidence was affirmed in the only two published california decisions involving lost insurance policies.in clendenin benson,a driver sued for damages to his automobile caused by a collision with the defendant truck,and his insurer joined a subrogation cause of action.the court rendered judgment for the insurer even though the latter could not produce the policy at trial.affirming the judgment,the court of appeal held that the evidence shows that a diligent and bona fide but unsuccessful search for the document was made at the place where it was most likely to be found further,the contents of the policy were sufficiently shown by the testimony of employees of the insurer and by its records.id.at.
in rogers prudential ins.d,an employee who became totally disabled while covered by a group major medical policy issued by the defendant insurer sued after his benefits were terminated.pursuant to company practice,the insurer had destroyed its copies of the policy several years after terminating the plan the plaintiff copy had been destroyed by fire,and he could produce only a brief announcement of the plan summarizing its provisions and referring to the master policy for details of coverage.the insurer moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was relieved of liability by the terms of the missing policy,asking the court to determine those terms by construing the announcement alone.the court granted the motion.reversing the ensuing judgment,the court of appeal explained that the trial court was not limited to construing the announcement.contents of a lost or destroyed memorandum may be shown by an unsigned copy or by oral evidence.citation.such evidence may include testimony of employees of the insurer who were familiar with the policy standard provisions,or copies of other policies sold at the same time which utilized similar provisions.id.at.
having established that the contents of a lost insurance policy may be proved by secondary evidence,the question precisely must be proved.in an action on an insurance policy that has not been lost or destroyed,it is well settled that t he burden is on an insured to establish that the occurrence forming the basis of its claim is within the basic scope of insurance coverage.citations.and,once an insured has made this showing,the burden is on the insurer to prove the claim is specifically excluded.aydin first state ins.cal th,d.the rule applies irrespective of whether the dispositive policy language is found in clauses described as exclusions,exceptions,limitations,conditions,or endorsements i t is the function served by policy language,not the location of language in an insurance policy,that is determinative.id.at,d,italics added.this rule follows from the general evidentiary rule found in evidence code section that e xcept as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.
we see no reason not to apply this rule to a policy that has been lost or destroyed without fraudulent intent on the part of the insured.thus,the claimant has the burden of proving the fact that he or she was insured under the lost policy during the period in issue,and the substance of each policy provision essential to the claim for relief,essential to the particular coverage that the insured claims.which provisions those are will vary from case to case the decisions often refer to them simply as the material terms of the lost policy.see,national american ins.certain underwriters at lloyd london cir,servants of the paraclete,great american ins.in turn,the insurer has the burden of proving the substance of any policy provision essential to the defense,any provision that functions to defeat the insured claim.see,burroughs wellcome commercial union ins,emons industries,liberty mutual fire ins.those provisions,too,will be case specific 
we apply these rules to the case at bar.as noted at the outset,the primary issue at trial was whether employers policy no.hereafter,the policy entitled dart to a defense and indemnity from commercial union in litigation arising from exposure to des between september,and september.
some matters on which dart,as the insured,has the burden of proof are undisputed in this case.it is undisputed that neither dart nor commercial union now has a copy of the policy,and that dart made a reasonably diligent but unsuccessful search for the policy.the trial court was therefore entitled to find that the policy was lost or destroyed,and that it was lost or destroyed without fraudulent intent on the part of dart.accordingly,the court properly admitted the secondary evidence offered by dart to prove the material terms of the policy.commercial union does not dispute the point.
it is also undisputed that the policy was a cgl policy and was in effect from september,to september,and that commercial union predecessor in interest employers issued the policy to dart predecessor in interest rexall.the trial court was therefore entitled to find that dart was insured under the policy during the period in issue.again commercial union does not dispute the point.
dart contends the court of appeal erred in requiring it to prove the material provisions of the policy by introducing evidence of the specific language used in those provisions.the point is well taken.as discussed above,there is no such evidentiary requirement to prove the contents of lost documents,be they insurance policies or otherwise.although the court of appeal opinion acknowledges the general rule that lost documents can be proved by secondary evidence,the court repeatedly faulted dart for presenting no evidence of the policy language there is no evidence at all concerning the words used in the policy.there is no evidence to show what sort of language was used by commercial in standard or manuscript policies or at all at the time dart policy was issued or at any time.there is no evidence to show what sort of language was used in the industry at the time dart policy was issued or at any time.there is no evidence to show what standard provisions,if any,were required by statute at the time dart policy was issued,or what standardized provisions,if any,were usually incorporated into commercial cgl policies in the or at any time.the court concluded w e believe that a policy language is critical whenever an insured demands a defense or indemnity under a cgl policy,and we hold in this case that reference to the language of the policy is indispensable because of the substantial time between exposure and injury in des cases.
thus,we understand the court of appeal holding as fashioning a special evidentiary rule with respect to insurance policies,an actual language rule,providing that the contents of such policies may only be proved by reproductions of the policy language,and that anything less does not,as a matter of law,constitute substantial evidence of these contents.the court of appeal reasoned that the meaning of an insurance policy,like that of any contract,is derived from examining its language and concluded that without such language,the contents of a policy can not be determined.
although it is a truism that we look to the language of a contract to ascertain its meaning,it is equally true that when a contract has been lost in good faith,and the actual language is unavailable,the law does not require proof of such language.rather,as discussed above,the proponent of the lost document need only prove the relevant substance of the document.kenniff,supra,cal.at,posten rassette,supra,cal.at von hasseln von hasseln,supra,d at,seaboard national bank ackerman,supra.at.
commercial union contends that in most lost insurance policy cases from other jurisdictions,there is at least an approximation of the actual language through specimen policies,standardized policies,policies from preceding or subsequent years,and the like.see,remington arms liberty mutual ins,burroughs wellcome commercial union ins,supra.at employers liability assurance hoechst celanese.yet it is undisputed that in the present case there was a manuscript policy specifically written for dart for the period of it is therefore less likely that specimen policies,standardized policies or successor policies would be available or useful in establishing the contents of the policy.we see no reason why the lack of such actual language evidence should preclude dart from obtaining the benefits of its policy.when,as here,it is undisputed that there was an insurance policy covering the relevant time period and that the policy was lost in good faith and not recovered after diligent search,there is no reason either in the law of contract or of evidence why secondary evidence that attests to the substance but not the precise language of an insurance policy should be insufficient as a matter of law to establish the insurer contractual obligations.
commercial union seeks to distinguish this case from other,noninsurance lost document cases on the ground that the latter involved fewer and simpler terms.the distinction is not legally significant.however few or many terms there may be,it remains necessary for the proponent of a lost deed,power of attorney or a money less than a proponent of a lost insurance prove each of its provisions essential to the claim for relief.
the trial court was thus correct in declaring that dart must prove with secondary evidence the existence and terms of the coverage material to the risk at issue.this does not mean that dart is required to prove the policy contents verbatim.rather,it must prove the substance of the employers policy with sufficient evidence to show coverage for the des claims.as noted above,the trial court found in detail that dart had proved the substance of the material terms of the policy by sufficient secondary evidence,and entered judgment accordingly.we turn next to specific challenges to the trial court findings on the grounds that they were not supported by substantial evidence.
the court of appeal opinion identified only one finding assertedly unsupported by the evidence that the lost policy was an policy in that it provided coverage for exposure to des during the policy period even if the injuries caused by that exposure were not discovered until after the policy period ended.the court of appeal opinion was not entirely clear as to the basis of its objection to this finding,but it appears it had two principal concerns.first,charles pyne testimony,which identified the policy as,essentially lacked probative value because it was conclusory and not corroborated by documentary evidence.second,even if pyne testimony established that the policy was in fact,such testimony was not sufficiently detailed to define that term and related terms so as to establish commercial union obligation to cover claims of individuals whose injuries ultimately arose from the ingestion of des during the policy period.without any evidence of the language used in dart missing policy,judicial interpretations of common words and phrases actually used in other cgl policies,accident,occurrence,bodily injury are irrelevant.we disagree with both points.
first,pyne testimony was not conclusory.pyne,a licensed insurance broker,was the manager of the obrion office in los angeles during the years the policy was in effect.he became familiar with the product liability coverage of the policy by participating in a number of meetings at which that coverage was discussed on another occasion,the insurance manager of dart showed pyne the policy and questioned him about a coverage matter.the trial court specifically asked pyne,do you recall whether or not you saw an occurrence provision in this contract or do you just assume that there was an occurrence provision in the contract pyne replied,i saw it in the insurance contract,and went on to make it clear he was referring to an coverage provision of the policy.this is direct testimony of a fact in issue.
nor was it necessary that pyne testimony be corroborated by documentary evidence or otherwise.it is well established that t he testimony of a single witness may be sufficient to support a judgment.in re marriage of slivka d.see also,e xcept where additional evidence is required by statute,the direct evidence of one witness who is entitled to full credit is sufficient for proof of any fact.moreover,pyne testimony was in fact corroborated.dart introduced evidence of two other product liability claims against as the hinkle and boone commercial union paid under the policy here in issue.in each,the plaintiff successfully claimed damages for bodily injuries caused by ingestion of an allegedly harmful drug during the policy period but not discovered until after the period ended.referring to the parties by the names of their predecessors,the trial court expressly found that the hinkle and boone lawsuits against rexall in the are further specific evidence of occurrence coverage.both cases involved ingestion of a drug during the policy period with filing of claims after the employers policy period ended.both claims were also paid for by employers under the employers policy.
the court of appeal dismissed this evidence on the ground that it proves nothing.the court reasoned that i t is likely as not that the hinkle and boone claims were defended or paid as an accommodation to dart rather than as an obligation of coverage.but the trial court had expressly rejected this assertion as speculative.there was no evidence produced that employers ever paid claims that were not covered under the employers policy or that there was any practice of employers to pay uncovered claims as an accommodation to its insureds.neither commercial union nor the court of appeal cites any evidence to the contrary.on this record,the trial court conclusion that it was probable that commercial union paid the hinkle and boone claims to comply with its contractual obligation is a reasonable inference,and as such it must be upheld on appeal.overton d,see also crawford southern pac.cal d.nor may an appellate court substitute its determination of pyne credibility for that of the trial court.commercial union contention that his testimony was so untrustworthy,and lacking in foundation as to deserve no credence is nothing more than a request that we redetermine his credibility.this we may not do.
the court of appeal is also incorrect that pyne testimony was insufficiently detailed to permit determination of whether the policy covered injuries stemming from ingestion of des during the policy period.he testified that he knew the meaning of the term occurrence policy,and defined it as one in which coverage is provided for a happening that would take place during the policy term,but which might not be discovered until the expiration of the policy term.he also testified that the policy covered personal injuries from defective products.moreover,the trial court also found that injuries were factually similar to the injuries covered in the hinkle and boone claims and reasonably inferred that dart policy covered des injury as well.such evidence,although it did not reproduce the policy language,was sufficient to support the trial court finding that dart policy covered des injuries initiated during the policy period but manifesting outside it.
in sum,we conclude that the court of appeal erred in holding there was no substantial evidence to support the finding that the lost policy provided coverage and that such coverage included claims for injuries caused by des exposure during the policy term but not manifesting until after the term ended.
commercial union contends that dart failed to prove a number of other material terms of the lost policy not discussed in the court of appeal opinion.the trial court,however,expressly found that dart had sufficiently proved each such term.commercial union must therefore show the record is devoid of substantial evidence to support those findings.we conclude that it has failed to do so.
commercial union first complains of findings that the limits of coverage under the policy were per person and per occurrence,with a product liability aggregate limit per year.for the first two of these limits,the trial court relied on both documentary evidence and testimony.the documentary evidence was a letter written in to pyne by herb bennett,an agent in the boston office of obrion,replying to a query by pyne as to whether the policy covered a certain claim by rexall now dart.in his letter bennett explained that commercial union had discarded the policy and could not produce it,but stated that according to bob forrest the primary policy limits were and.the court found that forrest was the obrion partner who had negotiated the terms of the policy and was personally responsible for the rexall account for many years.the court further found that obrion had agency authority to give out information about the terms of a commercial union policy.on this basis,the court found the letter admissible as an authorized admission of a party.commercial union contends the trial court erred in admitting such testimony.
the rule is that whatever is said by an agent,either in the making of a contract for his principal,or at the time,and accompanying the performance of any act,within the scope of his authority,of the particular contract or transaction in which he is then engaged,is,in legal effect,said by his principal,and admissible as evidence but declarations or admissions by an agent,of his own authority,and not accompanying the making of a contract,or the doing of an act,in behalf of his principal,are not binding upon his principal and are not admissible wigmore on evidence,miller construction d,italics added.in the present case,the undisputed evidence is that in,when the letter w
