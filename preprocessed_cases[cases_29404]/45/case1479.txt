individual who leased trucks to united van lines,a federally registered motor carrier the,and a trade association,independent drivers association,ooida,commenced this class action against united,alleging violations of the secretary of transportation regulations,part,claims that may be brought in court under a.claim iii alleged that united improperly charged back the cost of public liability and property damage insurance.in july,the district court dismissed count iii but denied united motion to dismiss other claims.in march,the court concluded that plaintiffs claims are subject to the statute of limitations found in c and dismissed all remaining claims that arose prior to february.ooida united van lines,llc,d.in july,the court struck plaintiffs class allegations and dismissed ooida because it sued only in a representative capacity.thereafter,the court granted the motion to dismiss all claims not previously dismissed with prejudice,and it dismissed united counterclaims without prejudice.
all plaintiffs appeal this final order.because the denial of class certification and resulting dismissal of ooida are not challenged,ooida is not a proper party to the appeal.the argue that the district court erred in applying the statute of limitations,an issue of recurring importance to the trucking industry,and in dismissing claim iii.we agree with the eleventh circuit recent decision that damage actions under a are subject to the general statute of limitations found in for civil actions arising under federal statutes.see ooida landstar,cir.however,we affirm the dismissal of claim iii.therefore,we reverse only the dismissal of claims i and ii asserted by plaintiffs pelletier and lee for the period february,to february.interested readers will find background regarding the regulatory changes enacted by the icc termination act of iccta,the regulations,and judicial enforcement of those regulations in ooida new prime,cir.
i.the statute of limitations issue 
iccta created a private right of action in a for violations of the regulations.see new prime,at.united asserts that another provision of iccta,c,provided a statute of limitations for claims brought under a.the contend that iccta provided no limitations period for claims under a therefore,the general federal limitations period in applies.to frame this issue,we set forth the relevant statutory provisions 
general authority 
b complaints.a person may file with the secretary or board,as applicable,a complaint about a violation of this part by a carrier 
rights and remedies of persons injured by carriers 
a in general 
damages for violations.a carrier is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier in violation of this part.
b liability and damages for exceeding tariff rate.a carrier providing transportation or service is liable for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff in effect under section.
a election 
complaint to dot or board civil action.a person may file a complaint with the board or the secretary,as applicable,under section b or bring a civil action under subsection b to enforce liability against a carrier 
limitation on actions by and against carriers 
b overcharges.a person must begin a civil action to recover overcharges within months after the claim accrues.if the claim is against a carrier and an election to file a complaint with the board or secretary,as applicable,is made under section c,the complaint must be filed within years after the claim accrues.
c damages.a person must file a complaint with the board or secretary,as applicable,to recover damages under section b within years after the claim accrues.
unlike most issues of statutory interpretation,the parties in this case agree that the statutes plain meaning supports the contention.section a contains no limitations period,the limitations period in c applies only to claims under b,and iccta contains no other applicable limitations period.thus,construing these provisions in accordance with their plain meaning,claims under a are subject to the limitations period in.the district court nonetheless concluded that,when viewed in light of the legislative history,a plain reading of produces an absurd result that is contrary to a common sense interpretation of the iccta.accordingly,the court held,c limitations period also applies to actions under a.ooida ii,d at.we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo.see united states springer,cir.standard of review,cert.denied,d.
in the usual case,if the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms,without reference to its legislative history.united states ron pair,d quotation omitted.this rule results from deference to the supremacy of the legislature,as well as recognition that congressmen typically vote on the language of a bill.lamie united states trustee,d quotation omitted.where the plain meaning of a statute is clear,we are not free to replace it with an unenacted legislative intent.ins cardoza fonseca,d scalia,concurring.if congress enacted into law something different from what it intended,then it should amend the statute to conform it to its intent.lamie,at.
like most principles of statutory construction,judicial deference to the plain meaning of a statute is not an absolute.one exception consists of those rare cases when a statute plain text produces a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters,and those intentions must be controlling.griffin oceanic contractors,d see in re kolich,cir.in this case,the district court concluded that congress intended a limitations period because i the house conference report stated that c preserves the current relevant statutes of limitations for bringing suits by or against carriers and makes the time uniform for all types of traffic,conf,at,reprinted in,and ii a was moved out of b by an amendment that failed to amend the cross reference in c.ooida ii,d at.
though this is a plausible interpretation of the legislative history,it does not establish that a limitations period for a damage actions is demonstrably at odds with congressional intent.the cause of action created by a was in many respects new,so for this cause of action,there was no current relevant statute of limitations to preserve.see new prime,at.congress subjected a actions to no explicit statute of limitations.congress is presumed to know that the general statute would therefore apply.section c explicitly subjected only the administrative claims authorized by b to a statute of limitations.the difference between two years and four years,while significant to many litigants,is not significant enough to demonstrate that one period or the other is demonstrably at odds with congress intent in enacting the new cause of action in a.t he sine qua non of this doctrine is that the meaning genuinely intended but inadequately expressed must be absolutely clear otherwise we might be rewriting the statute rather than correcting a technical mistake.united states video,d scalia,dissenting.this exception does not apply.
another narrow exception to the principle of rigid adherence to the plain meaning of a statute is the rare case of a scrivener error that produces an absurd result.for example,in green bock laundry machine,d,all justices agreed that,as justice scalia put it in his concurring opinion,rule a of the federal rules of evidence,if interpreted literally,produces an absurd,and perhaps unconstitutional,result,id.at.in chickasaw nation united states,d,the court concluded that a failure to delete an inappropriate in the statute at issue was simply a drafting mistake that does not warrant rewriting the remainder of the statute language.and in national bank of oregon independent insurance agents of america,d,a unanimous court moved the quotation marks in a statute that amended the federal reserve act,which meant that one substantive provision survived repeal in.after reviewing in detail the structure,language,and subject matter of the act and the statute it amended,the court concluded that the statute true meaning was clear beyond
