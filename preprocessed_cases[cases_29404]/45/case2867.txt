ii.background 
a.the action brought by financial insurance company 
in early,an adjuster with financial insurance company financial became suspicious that a claim filed by an insured might be the accident involved was staged.the adjuster referred the matter to financial special investigations unit.the insured confessed that the claim was fraudulent.further investigation of financial claims files revealed at least purported collisions giving rise to at least fraudulent insurance claims.
on june,financial filed a section action.financial was represented by the law firm of what is now manning marder,kass,ellrod,ramirez the manning firm.the manning firm is also counsel for allstate in the present case.the financial complaint alleged the existence of an automobile insurance fraud ring led by attorneys gary laff,bernard berry,jerry widawski,douglas weitzman,and barbara reid,aided by a capper,angel sepulveda.
as required by section,subdivision e,the june,financial complaint was filed under seal and was not disclosed to the public.because there was an ongoing criminal investigation of some of the defendants in the financial action,the complaint remained under seal until september.on that date,an unsealed first amended complaint was filed.financial first amended complaint alleged in part,on information and belief,including information from accomplice or informant interviews,numerous other insurance companies also received false and fraudulent claims from the staged accident ring operated by the named defendants.allstate complaint was filed on october,nearly months after financial filed its first amended complaint.
public disclosures relating to the financial action 
on september,when financial first amended complaint was filed,and as part of the criminal investigation of the alleged fraudulent conspiracy,search warrants were executed at several law offices.on october,the los angeles daily journal published an article discussing the searches.harris,investigations carried out at pi offices,daily journal.identified as defendants were laff,widawski,weitzman,berry,and reid,who were attorneys.identified as financial counsel was dennis kass of the manning firm.the article stated the financial action was the first to be brought under section defendants had been accused,along with medical offices,of being in a large auto insurance fraud ring department of insurance investigators had executed search warrants at the law offices of laff,widawski,and weitzman.ibid.in a response to the trial court order to show cause re dismissal in the present case,kass declared that while he had been present outside the offices during the searches,he had not entered any of the premises while they were being searched moreover,he had never seen any of the documents seized in those searches as they had remained under seal.
an october,letter published in the los angeles daily journal responded to the october article.it described the execution of the search warrant at laff office as follows approximately officers,with guns drawn,came running down office hallways and barged into laff offices to serve the search warrant.what kass,financial attorney,was overseeing was,in effect,discovery by gestapo tactics.i hav e nothing to do with laff or any of the issues or subject matter of the underlying case.however,it may well be prophetic for all in society when,as one of the officers was leaving at the end of the day,he said to me in the hall as the elevator door closed,we coming for you next.letters to the editor,gestapo tactics used in law office search,daily journal.

allstate investigation and complaint 
in october,within six weeks of the unsealing of the financial complaint and one month after the publication of the daily journal article describing the law office searches,a senior special investigations unit analyst for allstate,richard wong,spoke with a number of insurance agents.it bears emphasis that wong following description of allstate investigation was uncontradicted.in a declaration filed in opposition to the trial court order to show cause re dismissal in this case,wong stated as follows.he was responsible for spotting patterns of fraudulent insurance claims and reviewing claims paid for indications of fraud.the investigation wong initiated in october revealed a pattern of repetitive accident and medical reports and claims submitted by three of the lawyers named in the financial.laff,reid,and well as a fourth attorney,david berger.also,wong discovered that most of the reports used to support the claims were written by certain medical providers.over files showed uniformity in descriptions of accidents,injuries sustained,course of treatment,and medical reports.ultimately,allstate obtained taped confessions concerning staged collisions.the confessors implicated weitzman,berger,reid,and laff,and other defendants subsequently named in the allstate complaint.the information was turned over to the manning firm.wong declared i discovered the information on which the allegations in the present action are based through my own efforts of reviewing files of claims paid by allstate.i did not first learn this information from any source other than my own efforts.in addition,wong asserted that no one at the manning firm gave him any information about the claims in the financial action until october when the present lawsuit was filed.
wong spoke with a financial employee about a key witness,glenna cline.cline lived with sepulveda,the man identified as the principal coordinator of the staged collisions at issue in the financial case.sepulveda had died in.with respect to cline,wong declared i retained an investigator who originally contacted cline during the course of my investigation of this matter.she described more details about the conspiracy that is alleged in this action.upon learning that financial was suing some of the same defendants that were the subject of my investigation,i gave financial the information regarding cline.subsequent to my disclosure to financial,cline testified as a witness in the financial action.
attorneys for financial took cline deposition in february.she testified sepulveda had worked for several attorneys,selling them fraudulent accident cases.those attorneys included widawski,weitzman,laff,and reid.sepulveda staged the accidents and then sold the cases to the attorneys.sepulveda would take cases to neil shekhter and be paid cash for them.sepulveda was not the only person who took cases to the attorneys.the law offices gave sepulveda the names of clinics to use.cline also identified gary karp as a participant.
allstate filed its complaint on october.allstate alleged an internal investigation it had commenced one year earlier,in october,had unveiled fraudulent insurance claims resulting from defendants staged accident activities.the fraudulent claims involved at least collisions occurring between january and april,and at least separate claimants.allstate sued nine defendants in common with the financial action laff,reid,and weitzman as well as their law offices modilevsky,the physician bondarev,the chiropractor downtown metro medical clinic,abs health care and rehabilitation center and shekhter and karpel,who were alleged to be office staff.allstate also sued more than persons who were not parties to the financial attorney,berger,six doctors,six medical offices,three chiropractors,eight cappers,and seven office staffers.
as required by section,subdivision e,allstate served a material statement on the district attorney and the insurance commissioner detailing the facts in support of its complaint.allstate set forth the facts as to allegedly fraudulent collisions.in nearly half of the cases,the participants had confessed that the accidents were staged.
proceedings in the trial court 
on october,over three years after allstate filed its complaint,the trial court issued an order to show cause why the lawsuit should not be dismissed under subdivision h.the october,order to show cause stated in part a prior qui tam action,the financial case,alleged a conspiracy among the same lawyers,and others to stage automobile accidents and present fraudulent claims to financial.here,it appears that the charged conspiracy was publicly disclosed in the financial case.it further appears that allstate was not the original source.plaintiff is accordingly ordered to show cause why this case should not be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in connection with the order to show cause,the court intends to take judicial notice of all papers within the allstate and financial case files.
after considering the evidence and argument of the parties,the trial court found the present action was based upon the public disclosure of the insurance fraud ring further,allstate was not an original source of the information.the trial court reasoned the insurance fraud ring was publicly disclosed by the financial pleadings,the search warrant and the underlying affidavit,the media coverage,and cline deposition.the trial court stated t he first amended complaint in the financial case,the search warrant,the media coverage and the deposition of glenna cline all made allegations of a conspiracy to submit fraudulent automobile accident claims that involved the key parties in the allstate case.the trial court further found the specific facts alleged by allstate were merely derivative of the publicly disclosed existence of the fraud ring.finally,the trial court concluded,allstate was not an original source of the core information.an order dismissing the complaint was entered.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the question of whether allstate action is barred by subdivision h requires the interpretation and application of the statute to undisputed facts.as such,the issue presented is a question of law subject to our de novo review.rothschild tyco internat.us,th,d olsen breeze,th,d service employees internat.union county of los angeles d.
we apply the following standard of statutory review described by our supreme court,when interpreting a statute our primary task is to determine the legislature intent.citation.in doing so we turn first to the statutory language,since the words the legislature chose are the best indicators of its intent.freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d,people jones cal th,d.further,our supreme court has noted,if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute delaney superior court cal d.however,the literal meaning of a statute must be in accord with its purpose as our supreme court noted in lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,as follows we are not prohibited from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute in lungren deukmejian cal d,our supreme court added the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation the supreme court has held the courts must give statutes a reasonable construction which conforms to the apparent purpose and intention of the lawmakers.clean air constituency california state air resources bd.cal d.webster superior court cal d.further,the supreme court has held we have recognized that a wide variety of factors may illuminate the legislative design,such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the time and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy and contemporaneous construction.in re marriage of bouquet cal d,quoting alford pierno d.walters weed cal d.
pursuant to section,subdivision a,it is unlawful to knowingly employ runners,cappers,steerers,or other persons to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits pursuant to the workers compensation law or to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits under a contract of insurance or that will be the basis for a claim against an insured individual or his or her insurer.a civil action for a violation of section may be brought by a district attorney or by the insurance commissioner,subd.d.in addition,a section action may be brought by interested persons,subd.e.section,subdivision e states any interested persons,including an insurer,may bring a civil action for a violation of this section for the person and for the state of california.the action shall be brought in the name of the state italics added.the district attorney or insurance commissioner may,within days,opt to take over an action brought by an interested person,subd.e a.if the district attorney and the insurance commissioner decline to do so,the interested person has the right to conduct the action,subd.e b.
section authorizes to in civil penalties against perpetrators of insurance fraud for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company an assessment of up to three times the amount of each claim for compensation and other equitable remedies,subd.b.an interested person who brings a successful section action is entitled to a percentage of the proceeds thereof the percentage allowed ranges from to percent depending on whether the district attorney or insurance commissioner intervenes and proceeds with the action,subds.g a g a.in addition,pursuant to section,subdivision g b,if the person bringing the action in which the district attorney or insurance commissioner does not proceed,as a result of a violation of this section has paid money to the defendant or to an attorney acting on behalf of the defendant in the underlying claim,then he or she shall be entitled to up to double the amount paid to the defendant or the attorney if that amount is greater than percent of the proceeds.that person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred,plus reasonable attorney fees and costs.all of those expenses,fees,and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.
of specific relevance to the present proceeding,as noted above,subdivision h imposes a jurisdictional bar to an action brought by an interested person that is based upon public disclosure of the fraud where that individual or entity was not an original source of the information.subdivision h states a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a legislative or administrative report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the district attorney or insurance commissioner before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.
as pertinent here,there are two ways superior court jurisdiction in an insurance fraud qui tam action can be defeated under subdivision h.the first relevant way the jurisdictional bar occurs is when an insurance fraud qui tam plaintiff learns of the fraudulent conspiracy because of the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a civil hearing.subd.h a.defendants argue that the trial court correctly found it had no jurisdiction because allstate learned of the fraudulent conspiracy from the first amended complaint in the financial action.in this regard,defendants note that allstate lawyer drafted the first amended complaint in the financial qui tam action.the second relevant way the jurisdictional bar can arise is when the insurance fraud qui tam plaintiff learns of the fraudulent conspiracy because of the public disclosure of allegations or transactions from the news media.ibid.defendants contend allstate learned of the insurance fraud from news reports.a relevant exception to the jurisdictional bar found in subdivision h a occurs if the qui tam plaintiff,other than the attorney general,is the original source of the information.the term original source is defined in subdivision h b.defendants argue that allstate was not an original source because it did not have direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based.ibid.rather,defendants argue that allstate knowledge of the conspiracy arose from its own lawyer representation in the financial lawsuit and the press reports.
legislative history of section 
as will be described,the legislative history of section shows the statute has been repeatedly amended specifically to authorize and encourage insurers to bring fraud actions under the section.the legislature envisioned that automobile insurers,working with law enforcement agencies,could contribute to efforts to combat the prevalent and serious problem of automobile insurance fraud.the legislature recognized that this approach benefits insurers,insureds,and government agencies without unnecessarily burdening public resources.because the legislative history is particularly illuminating in terms of the issues posited by the parties,we discuss it in some detail.

the proposed increased share of proceeds to insurers was subsequently reduced to between and percent.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended after.as explained in a analysis by the assembly committee on the judiciary as brought to this committee,the bill adjusted the formula for the distribution of proceeds recovered from a settlement or judgment by potentially tripling the percentage the insurer would receive.supporters of the bill believed this to be an effective way in which to encourage insurers to pursue claims of insurance fraud.because of strong concerns expressed by the committee staff about the overwhelming increase in the percentage of proceeds that an insurer would receive,the author has agreed,after extensive negotiations with the committee staff and other parties,to adopt a more modest approach.the approach adopted by the author continues to combat insurance fraud by encouraging insurers to pursue claims of insurance fraud.the approach seeks to balance this important goal with the objective of ensuring that insurers are not provided with a windfall as the result of a significant increase in the percentage of proceeds they would be able to collect.the author goal of reducing insurance fraud is a worthy one.id.at.
in addition,the legislature dropped the provision singling out insurers,as distinguished from other interested persons,for increased percentages of recovery.an assembly judiciary committee report stated,because of concerns about the substantial of proceeds,and the bill earlier language providing that the percentage change would not be shared equally with other interested parties who might bring an action,the author agreed to delete the language providing for a special increase specifically for insurers and to modify the distribution of proceeds.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as proposed to be amended after.
in addition to increasing the percentage of recovery by interested persons,assembly bill amended section,subdivision e to read as it does now any interested person,including an insurer,may bring a civil action for a violation of this section stats,ch,west cal.legis.service.further,section,subdivision b was amended to add,the to penalty prescribed in this paragraph shall be assessed for each fraudulent claim presented to an insurance company by a defendant and not for each violation.stats,ch,west cal.legis.service.
in enacting assembly bill,the organized crime prevention and victim protection act of stats,ch,west cal.legis.service,the legislature found o rganized automobile fraud activity operating in the major urban centers of the state represents a significant portion of all individual automobile insurance cases.these cases result in artificially higher insurance premiums for core urban areas and areas of the state than for other areas of the state.only a focused,coordinated effort by all appropriate agencies and organizations can effectively deal with this problem.ibid.
d.the federal false claims act 
the language in subdivision h is not unique to section.similar language is found in a section of the federal false claims act et.title of the united states code,section e a states no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.italics added.for purposes of the federal false claims act,an original source is defined as follows,o riginal source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.e b.

e.the federal courts of appeals authority 
the parties have extensively briefed the conflicting decisions concerning public disclosure and the original source rule issued by the federal circuit courts.the federal circuits have expressed widely varying views as to public disclosure and original source issues as they relate to the jurisdictional bar in federal false claims act litigation.some of those views support allstate position other perspectives support defendants side of the dispute.
for example,the first circuit has articulated the following test thus,when it is not clear whether or not a qui tam action should be barred by the ambiguous provision precluding the action if it is based upon transactions or allegations which are the subject of another suit or proceeding in which the government is a party,we think that a court should look first to whether the two cases can properly be viewed as having the qualities of a relationship.in answering this question,we think it would be useful for the court to be guided by the definition of the word parasite,and ask whether the qui tam case is receiving support,advantage,or the like from the host case in which the government is a party without giving any useful or proper return to the government or at least having the potential to do so.see random house dictionary of the english language ed.unabridged.if this question is answered in the affirmative,the court may properly conclude that there is an identity between the basis of the qui tam action and the subject of the other suit or proceeding if this question is answered in the negative,the court similarly may gather that such an identity is lacking.united states ex rel.prawer and fleet bank cir.the first circuit perspective is supportive of allstate position.
the second circuit rule,which engrafts a requirement that the qui tam plaintiff have been the source of public disclosure to the entity which publicly discloses the evidence of fraud,is as follows w e note that original source is expressly defined in e b.a straightforward reading of e b indicates that to be an original source a qui tam plaintiff must have direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based,and have voluntarily provided such information to the government prior to filing suit.a close textual analysis combined with a review of the legislative history convinces us that under e a there is an additional requirement that a qui tam plaintiff must meet in order to be considered an original source,namely,a plaintiff also must have directly or indirectly been a source to the entity that publicly disclosed the allegations on which a suit is based.united states ex rel.kreindler united technologies cir,italics added accord,united states ex rel.dick long island lighting cir,because the relators were not the source of the allegations in the first lawsuit,they did not qualify as original sources.also,in kreindler,the plaintiff argued that it did not obtain the pertinent information solely from publicly disclosed material but that it also conducted an independent investigation.the second circuit,citing united states ex rel.precision koch industries cir,held that a qui tam action based in any part upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions would be barred.united states ex rel.kreindler united technologies,supra,at.defendants quite obviously rely on the second circuit position articulated in kreindler.
the third circuit takes a broader view than the second circuit of when a qui tam plaintiff may pursue a fraud claim after public disclosure of misconduct.the third circuit rule is as follows a relator action is based upon a public disclosure of allegations only where the relator has actually derived from that disclosure the allegations upon which his qui tam action is based.such an understanding of the term based upon,apart from giving effect to the language chosen by congress,is fully consistent with section e undisputed objective of preventing parasitic actions see,united states ex rel.stinson prudential ins.cir,for it is that a suit that includes allegations that happen to be similar even identical to those already publicly disclosed,but were not actually derived from those public disclosures,simply is not,in any sense,parasitic.id.united states ex rel.mistick pbt housing authority,supra,at.the third circuit analysis is supportive of allstate position.
the fourth circuit has adopted an entirely different perspective from other circuits as to the relationship between the publicly disclosed matters and the qui tam complaint factual allegations.in united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson cir,the court held t herefore,a relator action is based upon a public disclosure of allegations only where the relator has actually derived from that disclosure the allegations upon which his qui tam action is based.such an understanding of the term based upon,apart from giving effect to the language chosen by congress,is fully consistent with section e undisputed objective of preventing parasitic actions,see,united states ex rel.stinson prudential,supra,at,for it is that a suit that includes allegations that happen to be similar even identical to those already publicly disclosed,but were not actually derived from those public disclosures,simply is not,in any sense,parasitic.both allstate and defendants rely on the fourth circuit rule.
the fifth circuit has adopted a very restrictive original source test,one defendants strongly support.in federal recovery services,united states cir,ambulance company executives filed suit in state court alleging a competitor engaged in unfair business practices.the executives then formed a new corporation and filed a qui tam suit in federal court based on the exact same unfair business practices as were pursued in the state court action.but in the qui tam suit,the plaintiffs added additional unfair business practices claims.the fifth circuit held that if a qui tam action was even partly based upon publicly disclosed allegations,the district court had no jurisdiction under the false claims act.the fifth circuit held a n fca qui tam action even partly based upon publicly disclosed allegations or transactions is nonetheless based upon such allegations or transaction.united states ex rel.precision koch industries,supra,at,cert.denied,d see also cooper blue cross and blue shield of florida cir,holding that e preclude s suits based in any part on publicly disclosed information.as the tenth circuit acknowledged,congress chose not to insert the adverb solely before based upon,yet to hold as plaintiff urges would accomplish exactly that result and alter the statute plain meaning.united states ex rel.precision koch industries,supra,at.stated another way,plaintiff can not avoid the jurisdictional bar simply by adding other claims that are substantively identical to those previously disclosed in the state court litigation.federal recovery services,united states,supra,at,original italics.the sixth,eighth,tenth,and eleventh circuits have also held that that if a false claim act qui tam action is even partly based upon publicly disclosed allegations,then the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff is an original source.minnesota ass of nurse anesthetists allina,supra,at,fn.united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth cir,united states ex rel.precision koch industries,supra,at.defendants quite obviously rely on these opinions as they do on the previously discussed second circuit analysis in united states ex rel.kreindler united technologies,supra,at page.
the seventh circuit has clarified that a qui tam plaintiff can be an original source even if most of the facts underlying the fraud have been publicly disclosed.even if there has been public disclosure of key facts,in the seventh circuit view,if the qui tam plaintiff identifies how the circumstances amount to a fraud,then the original source jurisdictional bar is inapplicable.in united states bank of farmington cir,the court described how a plaintiff can still be an original source even in the face of significant prior public disclosure of factual matters pertinent to the fraud mathews argues that she is an original source under houck because,while some pieces of her story of fraudulent conduct by the bank may have been dependent on public disclosures,her contribution was to reveal the entire pattern of the fraud.all the facts from various sources came together in her lawyer office,she says,before she caused the facts to be placed in the public domain.the hidden pattern she revealed is what was independent of public disclosure.fair theory.in an exceptionally or unusually complicated allegation of fraud each piece of the information may be publicly disclosed,yet the fraud itself may remain hidden until some perspicacious plaintiff puts it in perspective.we acknowledge that in such a case,a plaintiff might be an original source even though her knowledge of every isolated element of the fraud is based upon public disclosures.mathews,however,is not such a plaintiff.the seventh circuit noted that the plaintiff in that case did not engage in any significant development of facts apart from those which had previously been publicly disclosed.the seventh circuit continued this was no profound scheme.it would not take sherlock holmes to figure it out we can not say in advance how complex a fraud must be,or how deep or clever its revelation,to satisfy the original source requirement when the claim is based on information which has been publicly disclosed.but the misrepresentation mathews revealed,and the difficulty involved in its unveiling,falls well short of the mark.putting two and two together,as mathews says she did,will not do.id.at.it is apparent the seventh circuit believes that in the case of a complex fraudulent conspiracy,even in the face of disclosure of many facts concerning the unlawful conduct,a qui tam plaintiff who puts the factual circumstances together may pursue a false claims act lawsuit.
the ninth circuit in wang fmc cir,confronted a case similar to the present one.the qui tam plaintiff sued his former employer claiming that it defrauded the government in four separate projects.the ninth circuit noted that neither the allegations nor the evidence of fraud had previously been publicly disclosed in three of the four projects identified in the qui tam complaint.hence,as to three of the four projects which had not previously been publicly disclosed,those matters could be pursued in the qui tam action.later,in united states ex rel.found.aiding the elderly horizon cir,two prior lawsuits had revealed instances of fraud,but not the particular fraudulent conduct appearing in the subsequently filed qui tam action.the ninth circuit panel concluded the public disclosure jurisdictional bar was therefore inapplicable to the qui tam action.ibid.allstate obviously relies on wang which does support its position as well as the horizon decision.
the district of columbia circuit applies a test that is subtly different from others but which probably works to defendants benefit.the district of columbia circuit synthesized its public disclosure rule as follows we acknowledge that congress did not prescribe by mathematical formulae the quantum or centrality of nonpublic information that must be in the hands of the qui tam relator in order for suits to proceed.citation.nevertheless,it is our task to ensure that qui tam suits are limited to those in which the relator has contributed significant independent information citation.the act triggers the jurisdictional bar only when there has been a public disclosure of allegations or transactions,which it explicitly refers to in the disjunctive.citation.the term allegation connotes a conclusory statement implying the existence of provable supporting facts.citation.the term transaction suggests an exchange between two parties or things that reciprocally affect or influence one another.citation.we illustrated the meaning of these terms in united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn,with the following equation x misrepresented state of facts y true state of facts z fraud.x and y represent the material elements of fraud a qui tam action can not be sustained where all of the material elements of the fraudulent transaction are already in the public domain citation.when the publicly disclosed transaction is sufficient to raise the inference of fraud x y are in the public domain,there is little need for qui tam actions,which tend to be suits that the government presumably has chosen not to pursue or which might decrease the government recovery in suits it has chosen to pursue.citation.united states ex rel.findley employees club.as will be noted,this is a slightly different public disclosure test than others which more strongly support defendants position.
federal decisional authority is in hopeless conflict.devecchio,qui tam actions some practical considerations,there seems to be no unanimity both among and within individual circuits as to when claims are based upon public disclosures,what constitutes a public disclosure,when and under what circumstances a qui tam relator must first inform the government of the claims,the extent of the factual information that must be provided to the government,when a qui tam action must be filed where there has been a public disclosure,what are the requisites to be classified as an original source,when a claim is primarily based upon prior public disclosures and many other issues that arise under the statute,quoting ex rel.merena smithkline beecham d,selden,battling david and qui tam lawsuits brought under the false claims act.law,the case law in this area is extensive and varies from circuit to circuit grimaldi,pretrial motions under the false claims act summer pub.cont,the law in this area is dynamic and rapidly changing,with splits among the federal appellate courts on virtually every imaginable issue.the test articulated by the second,fifth,sixth,eighth,tenth,and eleventh circuits the qui tam suit is precluded even if it has been partially premised upon previously publicly disclosed information supports defendants position.on the other hand,the first and third circuits analysis,which allows some similarity between the qui tam claim and the previously publicly disclosed allegations,is supportive of allstate position.moreover,the seventh circuit acknowledges that in a complicated fraud case when the perspicacious plaintiff puts the pertinent facts in perspective,a prior public disclosure that does not reveal a hidden pattern of fraud does not bar a qui tam action.united states bank of farmington,supra,at.also,the ninth circuit has held that when there has been public disclosure of one fraudulent series of transactions but three others remained unpublicized,all by the same defendant,the public disclosure bar of the false claims act does not jurisdictionally prevent prosecution of a qui tam lawsuit as to the conclusion that squarely supports allstate position.wang fmc,supra,at.
finally,we have carefully examined the facts in each of the federal appellate court decisions since the adoption of the amendments to the false claims act.although the ninth circuit wang decision is close,none of the facts in the circuit court decisions parallels those in the present case.the present case involves a prior public disclosure of a fraudulent conspiracy directed at financial.subsequently,allstate,through its own intensive fraud investigation,determined that it too had been a victim.for these and other reasons,as will be noted,we conclude that the federal authority,although helpful,is not conclusive.
differences between the federal false claims act and section 
the federal false claims act differs from section in several significant respects.the goal of the federal statute is to recoup government funds lost through the fraud of federal contractors.in other words,when a federal contractor fraudulently overcharges the government,public monies are lost.the federal government is the direct victim.the taxpayers are the indirect victims.the federal act encourages whistleblowers to report contractor fraud.an action may be brought by a person with knowledge of the fraud.but that individual is not a direct victim of the fraud.the only direct victim is the federal government.money recovered through a federal false claims act action is released to the national treasury.the relator recovers a bounty for bringing the fraud to light.if a federal contractor fraud on the federal government were the subject of multiple federal false claims act proceedings,the amount of money recovered by the government would be diminished.the federal false claims act prevents this scenario from occurring by barring parasitic actions.a person can not base a federal false claims act lawsuit on information learned through public channels and as to which she or he made no contribution.united states ex rel.doe john doe,supra,at.as the second circuit court of appeals explained in john doe because qui tam plaintiffs relators are entitled to a portion of the proceeds of successful suits,there is the potential for parasitic lawsuits by those who learn of the fraud through public channels and seek remuneration although they contributed nothing to the exposure of the fraud.to discourage such chicanery,congress carefully crafted a jurisdictional bar to qui tam claims that are based on publicly disclosed information.id.at.the second circuit continued qui tam suits by individuals seeking quick cash without assisting in exposing the fraud were aptly characterized by attorney general biddle,in,as parasitic actions.citation.id.at.
the purpose of section,on the other hand,is to prevent and remedy automobile insurance fraud.insurers,not the state government,are the direct victims of the fraud.insureds are the indirect victims who pay higher premiums due to the prevalence of insurance fraud.state and local governments,which generally are neither the principal direct nor indirect monetary victims of the fraud,recover funds pursuant to successful section actions.section recoveries are earmarked for fraud prevention,investigation,and prosecution purposes.the government does not necessarily recover funds lost to it because of a fraud perpetrated on it.further,section has been amended since it was initially extended to insurance fraud for the express purpose of encouraging automobile insurers to bring section actions.it is in the government interest to have insurers investigate and prosecute such proceedings.the government serves to gain both in terms of fraud prevention and financially from such actions,especially given limited investigative and prosecutorial resources available to it.moreover,for each such successful prosecution by an,the government recovers more,not less,money.the government percentage share of the recovery is reduced when an insurer brings the section action and the government opts not to intervene.but the government is statutorily empowered to intervene in such actions,and when it does,its percentage of the proceeds is increased.simply stated,there are material differences between the federal false claims act and section.
subdivision h does not bar allstate claim 
defendants argue we should follow federal precedent in construing the language of subdivision h.the supreme court has held that,as a general rule when legislation has been judicially construed and a subsequent statute on the same or an analogous subject is framed in the identical language,it will ordinarily be presumed that the legislature intended that the language as used in the later enactment would be given a like interpretation.this rule is applicable to state statutes which are patterned after the federal statutes.citations.keating superior court cal d,overruled on other grounds in southland keating,d accord,snukal flightways manufacturing,cal th,d.further,if the objectives and relevant wording of a federal statute are similar to a state law,california courts often look to federal decisions for assistance in interpreting this state legislation.richards hill,cal th,d,reno baird cal th,d.
yet,this rule of statutory interpretation may be different if there are varying circuit approaches to a federal statute.under those circumstances,california courts decline to always follow federal decisions when construing a state statute which is similarly worded to a federal law.richards hill,supra,cal th at,d.in richards,the california supreme court explained this state test for the continuing violation doctrine under the fair employment and housing act.as is often the case in addressing discrimination questions under the fair employment and housing act,the supreme court looked to the relevant federal decisional authority construing title vii of the civil rights act of.in richards,the problem with simply adopting the federal courts continuing violation doctrine analysis was that there was no single rule.the various circuits had adopted essentially four approaches to the continuing violation rule.id.at,d.the california supreme court eventually adopted a modified test of the fifth circuit ruled articulated in berry board of sup rs of cir.richards hill,supra,cal th at,d.in adopting its modified continuing violation rule,the california supreme court examined the relevant california decisional authority the statutory objectives of the fair employment and housing act and the practicalities involved in the application of the statute of limitations in the employment discrimination context.id.at,d.
we conclude the flexible approach identified in richards ought likewise to be applied in this case involving a federal statute,the false claims act,and subdivision h.as in richards,there is no consistency in federal decisional authority construing the original source rule resulting from the amendments to the false claims act.further,as can be noted,there are material differences between the purposes and operation of the federal false claims act and section.moreover,given the widely divergent views taken by the federal circuits,it is injudicious for us to begin assigning a particular legislative intent to the california legislature since section was first adopted in in order to address worker compensation fraud and during the subsequent amendatory process throughout the.finally,there is no evidence of a legislative intent to adopt a particular circuit perspective on the original source rule.given the material differences between the purposes and operation of the false claims act as compared to section,we decline to entirely rely on circuit court decisional authority construing the federal law.
but we follow federal precedent with respect to the general purpose of the jurisdictional is,to prevent qui tam actions brought by persons who,like the relator in united states ex rel.marcus hess,supra,at page,simply copied allegations from a criminal indictment on file,learned of the specific fraudulent conduct at issue through public channels,and who had not contributed or assisted in a material way in exposing the fraud.united states bank of farmington,supra,at wang fmc,supra,at.the california legislature,in adopting subdivision h,intended to bar parasitic or opportunistic actions by persons simply taking advantage of public information without contributing to or assisting in the exposure of the fraud.united states ex rel.doe john doe,supra,at minnesota ass of nurse anesthetists allina,supra,at rothschild tyco internat.us,supra,th at,d.
as noted above,the pertinent language of subdivision h is as follows a no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a legislative or administrative report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.b for purposes of this paragraph,original source means an individual who had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the district attorney or insurance commissioner before filing an action under this section which is based on the information.italics added.in determining legislative intent,we consider the meaning of the statutory language in accord with its purpose.lakin watkins associated industries,supra,cal th at,d,lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.we find the meaning of the statutory language is clear.further,applied to the present facts in light of its purpose,allstate complaint is not barred.
