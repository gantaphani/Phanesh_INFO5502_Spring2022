a woman shot and injured a man.as a result of the shooting,the woman entered a nolo contendere plea to a felony assault with a firearm,and she also suffered a civil judgment against her and in favor of the man.the woman is bankrupt but she had homeowner insurance at the time of the shooting,and the man wants to collect his judgment from her insurer.the policy excludes coverage for bodily injury which is a foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act of the insured or which is in fact intended by the insured.in the insurer declaratory relief action against the man,the trial court granted the insurer motion for summary judgment.the man appeals,claiming there are questions of fact about the woman intent at the time of the shooting.we affirm on the ground that the criminal act exclusion applies without regard to the insured intent and based on the undisputed facts of this case without regard to the doctrine of collateral estoppel.
armed with a handgun,susan paster entered hugh schurtz residence and shot at schurtz,grazing his forehead and finger.paster was arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with a firearm,with an allegation that she had personally used a firearm,subd.a,subd.a,subds.a,d,subd.c.paster entered a not guilty plea and denied the allegation.
about three weeks later,schurtz sued paster for damages on three intentional tort theories assault,battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress,alleging in his verified complaint that paster had pointed a loaded gun at his temple,threatened to kill him,then intentionally and willfully discharged the handgun for the purpose of killing him.
in december,in her criminal case,paster entered a plea of nolo contendere to one felony count assault with a firearm and admitted the personal use allegation.the trial court accepted paster waiver of her trial rights,found a factual basis for paster plea and admission,found paster guilty of assault with a firearm,found true the allegation that paster had personally used the gun,and accepted paster plea as one to a serious felony within the meaning of penal code section,subd.a,subds.a,d.as part of a negotiated disposition,paster was taken into custody the same day and sent to state prison for a diagnostic evaluation with the understanding that,when completed,the evaluation would be relied on by the court to determine whether paster would be sentenced to state prison for a term of five years or placed on probation.the attempted murder count was dismissed.
in july,schurtz filed an amended unverified complaint in his civil action,adding a cause of action for negligence and alleging that paster had carelessly and negligently ingested drugs and alcohol,then gone to schurtz house and brandished a pistol and waved it about,which result ed in the pistol discharging in the direction of,and near schurtz.
paster answered schurtz first amended complaint,then tendered the defense of schurtz action to century insurance company her homeowner insurer at the time of the shooting subject to a reservation of rights,century agreed to defend paster,and lawyers were retained to represent her in schurtz action.in october,paster,schurtz,and their lawyers executed a stipulation in which paster admit ted liability for all injuries and damages suffered by schurtz on his negligence cause of action,schurtz dismissed his intentional tort causes of action,and the parties agreed that the only issue to be submitted to the trier of fact at trial would be schurtz damages.the stipulation was not signed or approved by century.
in the fall of,schurtz testified at his deposition that paster had gained entry to his house by breaking a window,that she woke him by hitting him on the head with her fist or the gun,held the gun at his head,and said it was a joke.when he started to get up,she put the gun at his crotch,told him not to move,put the gun back to his head and said,the bullet in the chamber.you dead.he leaned forward and t he gun fired.about one week later,paster testified at her deposition that she never intended to inflict any kind of injury on schurtz,that she always carried a gun for protection,and that she took her gun out of her purse at schurtz house only after he woke up,got up,and frightened her.the gun went off accidentally as he struggled to get it away from her 
in august,schurtz damages were tried to a jury,which awarded him.century refused to pay the judgment,and in march sued paster and schurtz for declaratory relief,asking for a judicial determination that it was not obligated to pay schurtz judgment against the ground that the policy expressly excluded coverage for bodily injury which is a foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act of the insured or which is in fact intended by the insured.schurtz answered and against century,alleging a direct right of recovery and asking for damages in the amount of his judgment against paster.
century moved for summary judgment on the ground that schurtz injuries were the result of paster intentional and criminal act and,as such,expressly excluded from coverage by the terms of paster insurance policy.century evidence documents from paster criminal case,and the pleadings and deposition transcripts from schurtz civil action against paster established paster plea of nolo contendere,her admission of the gun use allegation,the criminal court finding of guilt,and schurtz admission that paster had awakened him by hitting him with her fist or the gun,then threatened to kill him.
in his opposition to century motion,schurtz picked at some nits for example,whether the transcript of paster plea was of a plea or a plea hearing,whether schurtz civil action was filed on october or october,and other matters of equal weight and significance but otherwise admitted the material facts relied on by those pertaining to paster intent at the time of the shooting.schurtz offered paster deposition testimony to show that,notwithstanding paster criminal conviction and schurtz original complaint for intentional tort damages,paster was acting in when she took her gun from her purse,that she never intended to injure schurtz,and that her actions were negligent,not intentional.
the trial court granted century motion for summary judgment,finding among other things that paster plea of nolo contendere to assault with a firearm and her admission of the gun use allegation were based on the same acts as schurtz tort claims against paster,that century policy excluded coverage for bodily injury that was the foreseeable result of an intentional or criminal act,that paster was engaged in a criminal act at the time of the shooting,that the ensuing struggle and bodily injury were foreseeable results of her act and that,as a result,there was no coverage under century policy.schurtz appeals from the judgment.
discussion 
schurtz contends there are triable issues of material fact concerning paster intent at the time schurtz was shot and,therefore,about whether her actions were criminal.we disagree.
at the time this case was before the trial court,century exclusion of coverage for injuries caused by an intentional or criminal act was treated as a legal redundancy,and no real distinction was made between an act that might be one but not the other.so viewed as it is by schurtz on this appeal,the summary judgment probably could not stand.teitelbaum furs,dominion ins,cal d,in a subsequent civil case,a final judgment of conviction in a prior criminal case conclusively bars relitigation of any issue necessarily decided in the criminal case except where the prior criminal case has been resolved by guilty plea rather than trial,in which event the guilty plea is admissible in a subsequent civil action only as an admission see also pease pease d.a trial court in a civil case may not give collateral estoppel effect to a criminal conviction involving the same issues of the conviction resulting from a guilty plea yarbrough superior court cal d,interinsurance exchange flores th,d and see,a plea of nolo contendere to a felony shall be considered the same as a plea of guilty and the legal effect of the one is the same as the other in a subsequent civil action as well as in the criminal action arenstein california state bd.of pharmacy d.the plea is an admission of every element of the charged offense.
but there is a difference between an exclusion that refers only to intentional acts and one that refers also to criminal acts,and century policy expressly and unequivocally excludes coverage for injuries resulting from a criminal act.whatever factual dispute there may be about paster intent at the time of the shooting,the bare fact of her conviction is undisputed and at this point could not be disputed.since the means by which paster stands convicted are irrelevant in this context,it follows that century motion for summary judgment was properly granted.
in safeco ins.robert cal th,d,our supreme court held that,notwithstanding an exclusion of coverage for bodily injury arising out of an illegal act,an insurer is obligated to defend and indemnify its insureds in a wrongful death action brought against them after their teenage son accidentally shot and killed his friend as a result of which the son was made a ward of the juvenile court after a petition charging him with involuntary manslaughter was sustained.id.at,d.in safeco,where the policy did not have a criminal act exclusion,the supreme court explained the ambiguity of the language that was used and,in that context,made it clear that the ambiguity could have been avoided by the use of a criminal act exclusion 
safeco agreed to defend and indemnify the insureds in the event of claims brought against any insured for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which the policy defined as an accident resulting in bodily injury during the policy period.excluded from coverage was liability for bodily injury arising out of any illegal act committed by or at the direction of an insured.italics added.the policy did not define the term illegal act.
the phrase illegal act is susceptible of two reasonable meanings t he court of appeal,relying on a dictionary definition,construed the term broadly,as meaning any act prohibited by law.but the term can also be interpreted more narrowly as meaning a violation of criminal law.this is the construction safeco urges us to adopt.certain thesauruses do treat the term illegal as synonymous with criminal.if we were to adopt this meaning in the context of the policy here,we would have to treat the policy clause excluding coverage for an illegal act as the equivalent of a clause excluding coverage for a criminal act.
the policy before us,however,contains not a criminal act exclusion but an illegal act exclusion.had safeco wanted to exclude criminal acts from coverage,it could have easily done so.insurers commonly insert an exclusion for criminal acts in their liability policies.croskey kaufman,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,pp,because safeco chose not to have a criminal act exclusion,instead opting for an illegal act exclusion,we can not read into the policy what safeco has omitted.to do so would violate the fundamental principle that in interpreting contracts,including insurance contracts,courts are not to insert what has been omitted 
we now consider the court of appeal construction of the term illegal as meaning a violation of any law,whether civil or criminal that construction,however,is so broad as to render the policy liability coverage practically meaningless.for instance,a violation of any law would include the law governing negligence,which holds individuals responsible for the failure to exercise ordinary care resulting in injury to another the duty to exercise ordinary care is imposed by law a violation of that duty is therefore a violation of law.broadly construed,a violation of any law,whether civil or criminal,is an illegal act.an insured negligent act,being a violation of law and therefore an illegal act,would thus not be covered under safeco policy excluding coverage for an insured illegal acts.
but the homeowner policy that the insureds here bought from safeco expressly provided that safeco would defend and indemnify them for bodily injury caused by an occurrence,which the policy defines as an accident which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage.because the term accident is more comprehensive than the term negligence and thus includes negligence,safeco homeowner policy promised coverage for liability resulting from the insured negligent acts.that promise would be rendered illusory if,as discussed above,we were to construe the phrase illegal act,as contained in the policy exclusionary clause,to mean violation of any law,whether criminal or civil.when reasonably practical,contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect,and that is consistent with the parties intent 
it is not clear how the court of appeal defined the word illegal as it is used in the exclusionary clause.if the court of appeal construed the exclusionary clause as excluding every offense,that is,every crime,it defines the word illegal as meaning criminal.as we have seen,that definition is inappropriate here because it rewrites the policy by inserting what has been omitted.
as we noted earlier,ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds favor,consistent with the insureds reasonable expectations.an insured should not be expected to know the subtle legal distinctions between the concepts of ordinary negligence and gross negligence.such distinctions are not objectively within the reasonable expectations of the insured in short,because the illegal act exclusion can not reasonably be given meaning under established rules of construction of a contract,it must be rejected as invalid safeco ins.robert,supra,cal th at,d,some emphasis added.
the corollary of the safeco rule is that where,as here,an insurer does want to exclude criminal acts from coverage and has expressly done so in language that is clear and unambiguous,the exclusion will be given effect.safeco ins.robert,supra,cal th at,d,see also century ins.stewart th,d criminal act exclusion is not ambiguous croskey kaufman,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group the criminal act exclusion bars coverage even for acts not known by the insured to be unlawful when committed,the criminal acts exclusion applies regardless of intent,pp,an act made punishable by the penal code is a crime,a crime is an act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it,and to which is annexed,upon conviction,the punishment of death,or imprisonment,or fine,or removal from office,or disqualification to hold an office of honor or trust or profit in this state witkin epstein,law ed.introduction to crimes,and see hooper allstate ins.so d.
whatever merit there might be to schurtz contention that paster criminal conviction does not bar relitigation of the issue of paster intent at the time of the shooting,the collateral estoppel issue is relevant only to the intentional acts there is conflicting evidence on the issue of intent,and because collateral estoppel does not bar relitigation of an issue necessarily decided in a prior criminal case where,as here,that issue was determined by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere rather than by trial.teitelbaum furs,dominion ins,supra,cal d at.
but century policy also excludes coverage for an injury resulting from a criminal act,and there can be no dispute that paster committed a criminal act.no matter how often she and schurtz redefine the facts surrounding the shooting,the evidence is undisputed that paster was convicted of a felony,subd.a,subds.a,d.this is not a matter of an admission by paster or schurtz.the conviction is undisputed and indisputable.and although schurtz now contends that paster conduct was not criminal because it was not intentional,schurtz characterization of the legal effect of paster act can not change the undisputed fact that she was convicted of a crime.allstate ins.talbot,the determination whether an act is criminal within the meaning of the criminal act exclusion does not depend on whether the insured intended the damages,evidence of a final judgment adjudging a person guilty of a felony is not made inadmi
