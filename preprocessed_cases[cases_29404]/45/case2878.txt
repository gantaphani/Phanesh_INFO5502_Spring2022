this appeal presents the question of whether an attorney,who is retained by an insurance company to provide coverage advice in a lawsuit against its insured,may be held liable to the plaintiff in that lawsuit for making a fraudulent statement about coverage.we answer that question in the affirmative because deceit undermines the administration of justice.
background 
for purposes of our review,we must accept as true the following allegations of the complaint.see blank kirwan cal d.with that in mind,we rarely use alleged in discussing the factual assertions in the complaint.
john and june shafer are homeowners in los angeles county.in the early,they contracted with tri county builders,a general contractor,to remodel their home and build an addition to it.tri county builders,a partnership,was run by jay demay and perry hanstad.the construction contract apparently required that any disputes between the parties be resolved by binding arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa.
as a result of numerous problems with the construction,in december,the shafers filed a demand for arbitration against tri county builders,demay,and hanstad.the demand set forth claims for breach of contract,negligence,fraud,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,among others,and sought an award of damages,including punitive damages.demay tendered the defense of the action to truck insurance exchange,which had issued a comprehensive general liability policy to him doing business as tri county builders 
by letter dated may,truck agreed to defend tri county builders,demay,and hanstad,subject to a reservation of rights.the letter consisted of four pages that quoted and discussed several provisions in the insurance policy.it pointed out that coverage was dependent upon an occurrence,which,according to the letter,was defined in the policy as an event,or a series of events which results during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage,neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
the letter continued y our policy does not afford coverage for exemplary or punitive damages additionally,intentional acts are not covered under any policy of insurance as provided under insurance code section,as this is against public policy for insurers to provide coverage for such causes of action a definition of occurrence,as well as section of the california insurance code and section of the california civil code,may exclude coverage for damages resulting from such intentional willful acts.
in response to truck letter,demay requested that truck pay for counsel of his own choosing.because the shafers arbitration demand asserted claims of negligent and willful wrongdoing,demay was concerned that an attorney selected by truck would have a conflict of interest given that a finding of liability based on willful acts would negate truck obligation to pay indemnity while a finding of negligence would entitle demay to indemnification.see,san diego federal credit union cumis ins.society,d.cumis.
for advice on coverage issues,truck retained lance labelle,of berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone.on june,labelle discussed coverage with chris lundblad,an employee of truck.on june,labelle sent lundblad a confirming letter,stating 
this will confirm our telephone conference of june,wherein authority was extended for our office to modify truck may,reservation of rights letter with respect to the plaintiffs claim as it relates to bodily injury under the policy.specifically,we discussed affording coverage for bodily injury,physical manifestation of injury alleged in the complaint,which claim relates to both the intentional and negligence based causes of action in the complaint.
w hile the vast majority of damages would not constitute property damage under your policy,we discussed the potential that resulting property damage to the flooring might constitute covered property damage in an effort to modify the reservation of rights so as to not trigger the cumis obligation,we have enclosed the modified reservation of rights letter which we furnished to your insured pursuant to your authority.please note that the definition of occurrence has been deleted from the reservation of rights along with any reference to insurance code section and civil code section.
labelle sent the superseding reservation of rights letter to demay attorney on june.it consisted of pages that quoted and discussed the policy provisions as to which truck reserved its rights.the letter did not define occurrence nor did it refer to insurance code section or civil code section.there was no reservation of rights as to willful or intentional acts,though coverage for punitive damages was expressly excluded.the letter stated in part our firm has been retained by truck insurance exchange truck with respect to the coverage aspects of the county builders matter.please be advised that truck has elected to replace and supersede its previously communicated may,reservation of rights with this reservation of rights.the letter to demay attorney concluded truck has made arrangements for your clients defense to be handled by the law firm of bodkin,mccarthy,sargent smith.you will soon be contacted by a bodkin attorney to make arrangements for transfer of the file obviously,to the extent that demay also wishes to retain your professional services,he is free to do so at his own expense.
the superseding reservation of rights letter,when read in context with the first reservation of rights letter and labelle june,letter to lundblad,implicitly acknowledged that,while an insurance policy can not provide indemnity for willful acts see,an insurer may agree to pay indemnity after an insured has committed a willful act.if the insurer so agrees,the insured demay is entitled to indemnification if he relies on that agreement to his detriment,for example,by discharging his own counsel in order to be represented by counsel chosen by the insurer.see tomerlin canadian indemnity cal d,downey venture lmi ins.th,d discussing tomerlin croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,to,pp,to same.
the arbitration commenced on march,before a panel.there were days of evidentiary hearings,one day of site inspection,and one day of closing arguments.the parties produced witnesses and numerous exhibits.
on july,the panel unanimously found in favor of the shafers,awarding them in general damages,in attorneys fees and costs,in interest,to cover aaa administrative fees and the arbitrators compensation,and in punitive damages against demay,totaling.
in the arbitration award,which referred to builders,demay,and hanstad collectively as respondents,the arbitrators found that respondents failed to accurately cost the project from the outset,and never adequately scheduled the job.respondents failed to properly supervise,and failed to properly man the job.respondents failed to complete the job as scheduled after repeated assurances and revisions of completion dates.respondents provided poor workmanship.
the arbitrators also found that r espondent demay committed a fraudulent act at the time he entered into the construction agreement,that he never intended to complete the project within the times repeatedly promised,and ignored the agreement with absolute impunity.respondent demay repeatedly extracted payment of additional monies in advance of work performed while promising to complete the project with new extended completion dates.the panel further finds that respondent demay committed other acts of fraud 
the panel finds that there was a scheme and design by respondent demay commencing at a time before signing the original contract with the shafers,designed to extract profits from items through change orders which should have been included within the scope of the original contract 
moreover,respondents estimated cost had gross deficiencies which were part of the misrepresentation and fraud 
the failure to properly price the electrical service was a sham 
respondent demay failed to thoroughly inspect the existing house before he authorized signing the initial construction contract,notwithstanding the fact this was the largest project demay had entered into to date.
the panel finds that these events collectively are more than breach of contract and negligence.they evidence a scheme and design that respondent demay never intended to build the project for the price and within the time originally contracted for.
based on these findings,the arbitrators awarded in punitive damages against demay.the arbitrators found that the fraudulent nature of demay conduct had been established by clear and convincing evidence,the standard used in civil actions see,subd.c.
on october,the superior court for the county of los angeles confirmed the arbitration award,entering judgment in the shafers favor and against tri county builders,demay,and hanstad in the amount of,plus in punitive damages against demay shafer builders,no.
by letter dated december,counsel for the shafers wrote to labelle,saying now that the arbitrator award in this matter has been rendered into an enforceable judgment,the shafers ask that truck insurance exchange truck satisfy that judgment against its insureds.we remind truck that the shafers now have the right to sue truck directly if truck will not voluntarily satisfy the judgment.the shafers expected truck to pay the entire judgment.
on march,labelle sent a letter to the shafers attorney,enclosing a check for.the letter indicated that the check was for in attorneys fees,to reimburse the shafers for aaa fees and the arbitrators compensation,and for miscellaneous property damage.
in the letter,labelle stated truck is making a good faith payment of these items at this time,but is reserving its right to reimbursement of these amounts from the shafers should a determination be made in a court of law that these items,in fact,are not covered under truck policy.truck incorporates herein by reference the june,reservation of rights letter previously issued to its insured.truck also reserves its rights under california case and statutory law,and in accordance with california public policy which precludes indemnity for damages based upon a finding of fraud.the shafers are free to negotiate this check without waiving their rights to claim that an additional portion of the award is covered under the truck policy.
truck payment of left an unpaid sum of in general damages,in interest,and in punitive damages,totaling.from march to july,labelle and the shafers attorney exchanged a series of letters,with the shafers seeking additional payment on the judgment and labelle refusing on behalf of truck.
in a letter dated may,labelle commented on page of the arbitration award,the arbitrators state that the insured never intended to complete the project within the times repeatedly promised page of the arbitration award states that the insured never intended to build the project for the price and within the time originally contracted for.
the intent of the insured is a critical issue in the analysis of coverage.section of the policy states that the company will pay for damage to property caused by an occurrence to which this insurance applies.occurrence is defined in paragraph m as an event proximately caused by an act or omission of the insured which results in bodily injury or property damage,neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.this policy language is consistent with section of the insurance code,which states a n insurer is not liable for loss caused by the willful act of the insured 
therefore,while the arbitration award is vague as to the division of the awarded in damages,it is very clear on its finding that the insured never expected or intended to complete the project on time.underscoring in original.
meanwhile,truck and demay entered into a settlement agreement under which truck paid demay as part of a mutual release of all claims.demay agreed to assist truck in any proceedings arising out of the arbitration award and to keep the existence and terms of the settlement confidential.shortly after signing the settlement agreement,demay moved to the border to avoid enforcement of the shafers judgment.
hanstad,too,sought to avoid the judgment.he filed for bankruptcy.the shafers filed a petition in the bankruptcy proceeding,alleging that the debt was not dischargeable because it was based on fraudulent conduct.see a.because truck was not paying the entire amount owed on the judgment,the shafers needed to preserve their claim against hanstad.ultimately,the entire amount of the judgment was declared nondischargeable.
truck monitored developments in the bankruptcy proceeding.in an internal memo dated november,one truck employee wrote to another the issue in the bankruptcy proceeding is that the shafers are claiming that the judgment they have obtained against hanstad is related to fraud and intentional acts and that this is a judgment 
accordingly,that plays right into our hands in that they can not argue to a court of law both that the remaining claims against tri county builders are intentional and fraudulent claims which can not be discharged through bankruptcy and that they are unrelated to any fraud and intentional acts by the insured and should be compensated by truck 
we believe that all monies owed on this matter have been paid.this matter is basically closed except for the shafers direct action against truck which may follow.however,we do not expect the shafers to actually follow through with their threats of filing suit.this matter is being handled primarily by lance labelle of the law offices of berger,kahn.
in,hanstad sued truck for bad faith.he was represented by counsel for the shafers.in december,during the discovery phase of the case,the shafers attorney learned for the first time that truck had agreed to indemnify builders,demay,and hanstad for willful acts.that knowledge was confirmed in early,when labelle deposition was taken.ultimately,hanstad prevailed against truck for bad faith.
on june,the shafers filed this action against truck,labelle,and labelle firm,alleging causes of action for breach of contract,bad faith,and fraud.labelle and his firm collectively labelle were named on the fraud claim only.labelle filed a demurrer,arguing that he did not owe the shafers a duty of truthful disclosure about the coverage afforded by truck and that the shafers had not justifiably relied on any statements he had made.the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.
the shafers filed a first amended complaint.it retained the cause of action against labelle for fraud and added a cause of action against labelle and truck for conspiracy.the amended complaint read as follows after the shafers obtained a judgment against truck insureds,labelle represented to the shafers that truck had not agreed to provide indemnity for willful acts.in fact,truck had agreed to indemnification.while labelle and truck knew that the statement about indemnity was false,the shafers did not know of its falsity.labelle made the false statement with the intention of inducing the shafers to forgo full payment on the judgment.the shafers relied on labelle false statement,resulting in economic and noneconomic damages.
labelle filed a demurrer to the amended complaint,making the same arguments as before.labelle also asserted that the shafers conspiracy claim was barred by section of the civil code,which prohibits a conspiracy claim against an attorney unless the trial court first determines that the plaintiff has a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits 
by order filed december,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,agreeing with the arguments made in labelle papers.an order of dismissal and judgment were duly entered.the shafers filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
the shafers argue on appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing the causes of action for fraud and conspiracy.we agree.labelle owed the shafers a duty not to make fraudulent statements about the insurance coverage provided by truck.and,contrary to labelle contention,the shafers reliance on his statements was justifiable.for his part,labelle contends that this action is barred because the litigation privilege,subd.b protected his statements about insurance coverage.with that we disagree.as for the conspiracy claim,civil code section does not preclude liability because labelle had an independent duty not to injure the shafers through fraudulent statements.
misrepresentation of coverage 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer that was sustained,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts that are properly pleaded and determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at,accord,zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.in the construction of a pleading,for the purpose of determining its effect,its allegations must be liberally construed,with a view to substantial justice between the parties.code civ.
section of the insurance code requires that liability insurance policies,with exceptions not relevant here,contain a provision stating that whenever judgment is secured against the insured in an action based upon bodily injury,death,or property damage,then an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment,subd.b.if that provision does not appear in a policy,it is implied by law,all further references to section are to the insurance code.the shafers filed the present action,in part,pursuant to section.
upon obtaining a judgment against the insured,the judgment creditor has an independent cause of action against the insurer to enforce the insurer obligation to indemnify the insured.gonzalez paul mercury ins.d.the judgment creditor right to sue is not derivative or dependent upon any assignment from the insured.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.section makes the judgment creditor a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between the insurer and the insured.murphy allstate ins.cal d,murphy.
under section,a judgment creditor may proceed directly against any liability insurance covering the defendant,and obtain satisfaction of the judgment up to the amount of the policy limits.reliance ins.superior court th,d.such a claim is subject to the terms and limitations of the policy,including any reservation of rights.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,to,to.
in applying section,we rely on principles of agency law dating back more than a century,as codified in the civil code.an agent is one who represents another,called the principal,in dealings with third persons.such representation is called agency.west ann.one who assumes to act as an agent is responsible to third persons as a principal for his acts in the course of his agency w hen his acts are wrongful in their nature.
an agent or employee is always liable for his own torts,whether his employer is liable or not.holt booth th,fn,d accord,michaelis benavides th,d.in other words,when the agent commits a tort,such as fraud,then the agent is subject to liability in a civil suit for such wrongful conduct.mottola kautz d.accord,crawford nastos d.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.agency and employment.
i f a tortious act has been committed by an agent acting under authority of his principal,the fact that the principal thus becomes liable does not,of course,exonerate the agent from liability.the fact that the tortious act arises during the performance of a duty created by contract does not negate the agent liability.bayuk edson d.
the relationship of attorney and client is one of agent and principal.see cpi builders,impco technologies,th,d caro smith th,d see also levy superior court cal th,d.as with other types of agency relationships,t he law of misrepresentation applies to lawyers.rest d,law governing lawyers,com.c.lawyers are subject to the general law.if activities of a nonlawyer in the same circumstances would render the nonlawyer civilly liable,the same activities by a lawyer in the same circumstances generally render the lawyer liable,com.b.
a lawyer communicating on behalf of a client with a nonclient may not knowingly make a false statement of material fact to the nonclient rest d,law governing lawyers.the law governing misrepresentation by a lawyer includes the criminal law theft by deception,the law of misrepresentation in tort law and of mistake and fraud in contract law,and procedural law governing statements by an advocate compliance with those obligations meets social expectations of honesty and fair dealing and facilitates negotiation and adjudication,which are important professional functions of lawyers,com.b,citation omitted,italics added.a misrepresentation can occur through direct statement or through affirmation of a misrepresentation of another,as when a lawyer knowingly affirms a client false or misleading statement,com.c.
as one of our courts has stated in the context of fraudulent conduct by an attorney toward persons not his own clients,no preference is accorded to the attorney professional status in the disposition of claims alleging fraud.if an attorney commits actual fraud in his dealings with a third party,the fact he did so in the capacity of attorney for a client does not relieve him of liability.citation.while in general an attorney professional duty of care extends only to dealings with his own client and to intended beneficiaries of the legal work performed,these limitations upon liability for negligence do not apply to liability for fraud.citation.jackson rogers wells d,citing goodman kennedy cal d.
in general,a lawyer who makes a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability to the injured person when the other elements of the tort are established rest d,law governing lawyers,com.g.this rule applies equally to statements made to a sophisticated person,such as to a lawyer representing another client,as well as to an unsophisticated person,com.b.misrepresentation is not part of proper legal assistance vigorous argument often is.thus,lawyers are civilly liable to clients and nonclients for fraudulent misrepresentation,but are not liable for such conduct as using legally innocuous hyperbole or proper argument in negotiations or presenting an argument to a tribunal in litigation,com.f.
in cicone urs d.cicone,the court held that an attorney may be liable to a nonclient for fraudulent statements made during business negotiations.there,the sellers and the buyer in a business acquisition were represented by their respective counsel,who conducted the transaction.the buyer drafted a proposed written agreement containing a provision obligating the sellers to warrant the accuracy of the company balance sheet.the sellers objected to that provision and refused to guarantee the accuracy of the company financial information.in response,the buyer stated that he understood and would deem the sellers to be guaranteeing the balance sheet to the best of their knowledge.the sellers signed the agreement without modification.
at the time the buyer agreed to accept the sellers best knowledge,he had no intention of honoring it but intended to rely on the strict warranty in the written agreement.the sellers relied on the buyer oral statement in signing the agreement.the balance sheet was,in fact,correct to the best of the sellers knowledge.but,after the transaction was completed,the buyer claimed that the sellers had understated tax liabilities in the amount of.the sellers settled the claim without litigation and filed suit against their attorney for malpractice.he against the buyer attorney,alleging causes of action for negligence,equitable indemnity,fraud,and deceit.the buyer attorney filed a demurrer,arguing that he owed no duty to the sellers or their attorney.the trial court agreed,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and dismissed the.
the court of appeal reversed,explaining the buyer attorney argue s a lack of duty owed to the sellers attorney.however,this argument appears in relation to the causes of action for negligence and indemnity.more properly it could be stated,inferentially everyone has a duty to refrain from committing intentionally tortious conduct against another.thus,a promise material to the contract which is made without any intention of performing it is deemed a misrepresentation of fact.
the sellers attorney alleges that the buyer and his attorney made a promise without disclosing they entertained no intention to perform said promise to deem the warranty of the financial statement as only to sellers best knowledge and belief.
although a duty to disclose a material fact normally arises only where there exists a confidential relation between the parties or other special circumstances require disclosure,where one does speak he must speak the whole truth to the end that he does not conceal any facts which materially qualify those stated 
the extent of liability an attorney may incur toward third persons,while the attorney is acting on behalf of a client,has been the subject of divergent opinion in various american jurisdictions,the traditional view being that an attorney may not generally be held liable to third persons because he is not in privity with them,and owes them no duty to act with care a typical statement of this approach is that an attorney is not liable to third persons for acts committed in good faith in performance of professional activities as an attorney for his client.if,however,an attorney is actuated by malicious motives,or shares the illegal motives of his client,he may be personally liable with the client for damage suffered by a third person as the result of the attorney actions.
in california it is well established that an attorney may not,with impunity,either conspire with a client to defraud or injure a third person or engage in intentional tortious conduct toward a third person 
thus,the case law is clear that a duty is owed by an attorney not to defraud another,even if that other is an attorney negotiating at arm length.
thus,while duty is not an element of fraud in the traditional sense,a duty is owed to others to refrain from intentionally tortious conduct.therefore,any inference arising from the lower court decision that the element of duty bars the sellers attorney causes of action for fraud and deceit against the buyer attorney is not supported by law.cicone,supra,d at,citations omitted.
as early as,when strict notions of privity ruled the day,our supreme court recognized that an attorney could be held liable for defrauding a third party,even without privity,stating it is a general doctrine that an attorney is liable for negligence in the conduct of his professional duties to his client alone and not to third parties.the exceptions to this general rule are where the attorney has been guilty of fraud or collusion,or of a malicious or tortious act.responsibility for a fraudulent act is independent of any contractual relation between the guilty party and the one injured and one committing a malicious or tortious act,to the injury of another,is liable therefor,without reference to any question of privity between himself and the wronged one.buckley gray cal,italics added,disapproved on another point in biakanja irving cal d.
more recently,in a case brought by a nonclient against an attorney for fraud,the court of appeal concluded that an attorney had a duty to abstain from injuring a third party through express misrepresentation w here one does speak he must speak the whole truth to the end that he does not conceal any facts which materially qualify those stated one who is asked for or volunteers information must be truthful,and the telling of a calculated to deceive is fraud.pavicich santucci th,d.
in a similar case,the iowa supreme court quoted extensively from the restatement third of the law governing lawyers and discussed cicone,supra,d,in holding that once a lawyer responds to a request for information in an arm length transaction and undertakes to give that information,the lawyer has a duty to the lawyer requesting the information to give it truthfully.such a duty is an independent one imposed for the benefit of a particular person or class of persons public policy favors a duty,running from an attorney representing a party to a commercial transaction,not to make fraudulent misrepresentations to an attorney representing the adverse party in the transaction.hansen anderson,wilmarth van der maaten iowa,hansen.
the principles set forth in the restatement are not limited to business transactions.they may apply in representing a client in litigation,such as when negotiating a settlement.rest d,law governing lawyers,com.a.in fire ins.exchange bell by bell,the principal question was whether,and to what extent,a party who is represented by counsel has the right to rely on a representation by opposing counsel during settlement negotiations.id.at.in that case,an infant was severely burned at his grandfather home when a water heater ignited a fire.the infant mother retained counsel,robert collins,who contacted farmers group,which had issued the grandfather homeowner policy.
in negotiating a settlement,the attorney for farmers stated that the policy limits were when they were actually,as he knew.based on that false information,collins advised the infant mother to settle for and she did so.in subsequent litigation against the manufacturer of the water heater,collins learned that the farmers policy had limits of.
collins filed an action on behalf of the infant against farmers and its attorney,alleging a cause of action based on the misrepresentation of the policy limits.the defendants moved for summary judgment,contending that collins had,as a matter of law,no right to rely on the alleged misrepresentations because he was a trained professional involved in adversarial settlement negotiation and had access to the relevant facts.fire ins.exchange bell by bell,supra,at fire ins.exchange.the trial court denied summary judgment.the indiana supreme court affirmed,stating 
the reliability and trustworthiness of attorney representations constitute an important component of the efficient administration of justice.a lawyer representations have long been accorded a particular expectation of honesty and trustworthiness.
the reliability of lawyers representations is an integral component of the fair and efficient administration of justice.the law should promote lawyers care in making statements that are accurate and trustworthy and should foster the reliance upon such statements by others.fire ins.exchange,supra,at.the court concluded that,as a matter of law,collins had the right to rely on opposing counsel representation of the policy limits.id.at.
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reached the same conclusion in slotkin citizens cas.of new york cir slotkin.there,the attorneys for an insurer in a medical malpractice case stated that the policy limits were,failing to mention that there was an additional million in excess coverage.the plaintiffs settled for.
upon learning of the misrepresentation,the plaintiffs brought a diversity action against the insurer attorneys,alleging fraud.the plaintiffs prevailed.in upholding the verdict as to one of the attorneys,the second circuit,applying new york law,stated the insurer attorney stipulated that to the best of his knowledge there was only worth of coverage his insistence that the policy limit was renders him liable under the new york definition of scienter as a reckless indifference to error,a pretense of exact knowledge,or an assertion of a false material fact susceptible of accurate knowledge but stated to be true on the personal knowledge of the representer.slotkin,supra,at.
turning to the present case,under california law,f raud is an intentional tort,the elements of which are misrepresentation knowledge of falsity intent to defraud,to induce reliance justifiable reliance and resulting damage.cicone,supra,d at.accord,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.labelle argues that his statement about insurance coverage was not a representation of fact but a nonactionable legal opinion.he also contends that he did not owe the shafers a duty to make truthful statements about coverage and that they did not justifiably rely on any statements he made.based on the allegations of the first amended complaint,we disagree.
misrepresentation of fact 
in the arbitration,the shafers prevailed against the insureds builders,demay,and hanstad.after judgment was entered on the arbitration award,the shafers looked to truck for payment,as was their statutory right.in a series of letters,the shafers attorney and labelle discussed the coverage afforded by truck and whether the shafers were entitled to more than.
labelle june,letter to lundblad at read together with the first and the superseding reservation of rights that truck had agreed to cover willful acts under the policy.in the june letter,labelle referred to his prior discussion with lundblad about affording coverage for both the intentional and negligence based causes of action in the complaint and explained that the june,superseding reservation of rights letter did not refer to the policy definition of occurrence or the statutory exclusion for willful acts.labelle also confirmed that the superseding reservation of rights letter was an effort to modify the first reservation of rights letter so as to not trigger the cumis obligation cumis,supra,d.in that way,truck extended coverage to willful acts and avoided having to pay for cumis counsel.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,to,pp.to discussing insured right to cumis counsel.
yet,in letters to the shafers attorney dated march and may,labelle pointed to the occurrence provision in the policy and the statutory exclusion for willful acts to justify truck payment of only toward a judgment totaling.thus,labelle allegedly misrepresented the scope of insurance coverage.he had a duty not to make fraudulent statements.see goodman kennedy,supra,cal d at,buckley gray,supra,cal.at,pavicich santucci,supra,th at,d jackson rogers wells,supra,d at.cicone,supra,d at.fire ins.exchange,supra,at hansen,supra,at slotkin,supra,rest d,law governing lawyers,coms.
indeed,cases from states hold that a n attorney can be liable to a nonclient,even an adversary in litigation,for fraud or deceit.hansen,supra,at,citing mallen smith,legal malpractice ed,fn.
a knowing misrepresentation may relate to a proposition of fact certain statements,such as some statements relating to price or value,are considered nonactionable hyperbole or a reflection of the state of mind of the speaker and not misstatements of fact whether a misstatement should be so characterized depends on whether it is reasonably apparent that the person to whom the statement is addressed would regard the statement as one of fact or based on the speaker knowledge of facts reasonably implied by the statement or as merely an expression of the speaker state of mind.assessment depends on the circumstances in which the statement is made,including the past relationship of the negotiating persons,their apparent sophistication,the plausibility of the statement on its face,the phrasing of the statement,related communication between the persons involved,the known negotiating practices of the community in which both are negotiating,and similar circumstances.in general,a lawyer who is known to represent a person in a negotiation will be understood by nonclients to be making nonimpartial statements,in the same manner as would the lawyer client.rest d,law governing lawyers,com.c,italics added.
in light of the foregoing factors,the first amended complaint adequately pleads that labelle made a fraudulent statement about the insurance coverage provided by truck,and the shafers reasonably viewed his statement as one of fact.
justifiable reliance 
the shafers justifiably relied on labelle alleged false statements.they had no reason to doubt him.they did not know that labelle had sent demay attorney two reservation of rights letters,nor did they know the contents of either one.like the plaintiffs in fire ins.exchange,supra,hansen,supra,and slotkin,supra,the shafers reasonably relied on the coverage representations made by counsel for an insurance company.
in a march,letter to the shafers attorney,labelle stated that truck reserves its rights under california case and statutory law,and in accordance with california public policy which precludes indemnity for damages based upon a finding of fraud.as alleged in the operative complaint,the shafers reliance on labelle fraudulent concealment was well justified w ithout the reservation of rights letters,the shafers had no real choice but to rely on labelle pronouncements about lack of coverage for intentional acts.the shafers attorneys understood that intentional misconduct by an insured precludes coverage under any policy of insurance.what they did not know,and what labelle failed to reveal,was that the manner in which truck had reserved its rights under the policy tacitly expanded coverage to include intentional misconduct by the insured elsewhere in the amended complaint,the shafers alleged that they did not obtain evidence about the fraudulent nature of labelle statements until late and early,during discovery in related litigation.
if the shafers had known or suspected the truck had agreed to provide coverage for willful would have aggressively sought full payment of the judgment at the outset instead of accepting a payment of in march.but the shafers believed labelle.they did not file suit until june years and eight months after the entry of they learned about the alleged fraud.in the meantime,the shafers allegedly incurred economic and noneconomic damages.
further,labelle relationship the shafers was not that of an opposing participant or party.under section,truck had to pay the shafers the amount of the judgment,subject to the terms and limitations of the insurance policy,including any reservation of rights.see croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,to,to.in that sense,the shafers were to be treated as the insureds.section inure s to the benefit of any and every person who might be negligently injured by the assured as completely as if such injured person had been specifically named in the policy.malmgren southwestern ins.cal,italics added construing stats,ch,now section,see historical note,west ann.ed.foll.and,as stated,the shafers were third party beneficiaries of the insurance policy.see,murphy,supra,cal d at.
we also observe that labelle is trying to have his cake and eat it too.he advised truck to provide coverage for willful acts so that truck would not have to pay for cumis counsel.yet,labelle represented to the shafers that willful acts were not covered so that truck would not have to pay the total amount due on the judgment.
labelle case authority does not support his position that the shafers could not justifiably rely on his word.in goodman kennedy,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs nonclients sued an attorney for erroneous advice about purchasing stock from his clients.but t here was no allegation that the advice was ever communicated to plaintiffs and hence no basis for any claim that they relied upon it in purchasing or retaining the stock.id.at,see bily arthur young cal th,d,discussing goodman.here,labelle made the misrepresentations directly to the shafers,and they relied on his statements in failing to seek full payment on the judgment.
in parnell smart d,the plaintiff was not allowed to bring a legal malpractice action against the attorneys who had represented the opposing side in prior proceedings.in particular,the plaintiff argued that an insurance carrier retained counsel owes a duty to a third party to disclose to the carrier all settlement offers made in the course of that claim.id.at.the shafers do not make any such argument.
in sabo deitsch th,d,the court held that a law firm was not liable to a nonclient for negligent misrepresentation where the complaint did not allege either an intent to induce the nonclient to rely on the attorneys advice or the nonclient justifiable reliance on that advice.id.at,d.in the instant case,those elements of fraud are alleged,and labelle does not contend otherwise.
thus,labelle had a duty not to make fraudulent statements to the shafers about the insurance coverage provided by truck.the first amended complaint alleges that the shafers justifiably relied on a misrepresentation of that sort.it follows that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.

labelle contends that the litigation privilege,subd.b applied to his statements about insurance coverage,rendering them nonactionable.labelle did not raise this issue below,but it is well settled that when the issue raises a pure question of law,we may consider the issue for the first time on appeal.gilliland medical board th,d.
we conclude that the litigation privilege does not shield labelle from liability for fraud because his alleged misrepresentations were made to a party standing in the shoes of an insured,and the application of the litigation privilege in this case would be inconsistent with the purpose of section.
in general,the litigation privilege precludes liability for communications made in any proceeding of a legislative,judicial,or official nature,and in proceedings where a writ of mandate is sought,subd.b.the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson cal d.because the privilege applies without regard to malice or evil motives,it has been characterized as absolute.brown kennard th,d accord,aronson kinsella th,d.
the principal purpose of the litigation privilege is to afford litigants and witnesses the utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions 
i n immunizing participants from liability for torts arising from communications made during judicial proceedings,the law places upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,citations omitted.in other words,the litigation privilege is intended to encourage parties to feel free to exercise their fundamental right of resort to the courts for assistance in the resolution of their disputes,without being chilled from exercising this right by the fear that they may subsequently be sued in a derivative tort action arising out of something said or done in the context of the litigation aronson kinsella,supra,th at,d.
turning to section,our supreme court explained in murphy,supra,cal d,section makes the judgment creditor a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between the insurer and the insured a third party beneficiary may enforce a contract expressly made for his benefit.and although the contract may not have been made to benefit him alone,he may enforce those promises directly made for him the injured claimant rights under the statute may extend beyond third party beneficiary principles.in barrera state farm mut.automobile ins.cal d,this court held that insurance code section must be read in light of the financial responsibility law and that its underlying policy providing benefits to injured parties may not be limited by third party beneficiary law.on the basis of that policy,it was held that in an action by the injured claimant,misrepresentations by the insured do not constitute a defense for an insurer who failed to promptly investigate insurability.murphy,supra,cal d at,citations omitted,italics added.
in johnson holmes tuttle.d,of the cases cited with approval in murphy,supra,cal d at page,court of appeal discussed section,stating 
a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.
where one person for a valuable consideration engages with another to do some act for the benefit of a third person,and the agreement thus made has not been rescinded,the party for whose benefit the contract or promise was made,or who would enjoy the benefit of the act,may maintain an action against the promisor for the breach of his engagement.
while the contract remains unrescinded,the relations of the parties are the same as though the promise had been made directly to the third party.although the party for whose benefit the promise was made was not cognizant of it when made,it is,if adopted by him,deemed to have been made to him.he may sue on the promise.where a promise is made to benefit a third party on the happening of a certain contingency,the third party may enforce the contract on the occurrence of that contingency 
the action by a third party beneficiary for the breach of the promisor engagement does not rest on the ground of any actual or supposed relationship between the parties but on the broad and more satisfactory basis that the law,operating on the acts of the parties,creates the duty,establishes a privity,and implies the promise and obligation on which the action is founded section is a part of every policy and creates a contractual relation which benefit s every person who might be negligently injured by the insured johnson holmes tuttle,supra,d at,citations omitted,italics added.
it is fundamental that generally speaking the injured party may not directly sue an insurer of the alleged tortfeasor the statutory cause of action created by insurance code section is based on the unsatisfied judgment hence the contingency giving rise to an injured party right as a third party beneficiary to enforce the contract is the legally established liability of the insured.zahn canadian indem.d.
as labelle would have it,the litigation privilege precludes liability for any fraudulent statements he made to the shafers about the coverage afforded to truck insureds.we reject that contention.the litigation privilege does not protect fraudulent statements intended to prevent an injured party from exercising his or her rights under section.
simply put,the injured party,as a third party beneficiary,may enforce a contract expressly made for his benefit.murphy,supra,cal d at.that includes an insurance policy in cases where the injured party files suit against an insured.ibid.the insurer has a duty to act as if such injured person had been specifically named in the policy.malmgren southwestern ins,supra,cal.at.section recognizes that the insurer duty to pay adjudicated liabilities is in place as much to protect injured parties from uncompensated loss as to protect the insured from personal financial disaster.hand farmers ins.exchange th,d,italics added.
just as an insurer may be held liable for defrauding its insured see notrica state comp.ins.fund th,d chodos insurance of north america d,so an insurer should not be allowed to deceive a third party beneficiary of the insurance policy see murphy,supra,cal d at,county of mariposa yosemite west associates d.shell schmidt d.and if an insurer may be found liable to a third party beneficiary for fraud,so may its coverage counsel.see goodman kennedy,supra,cal d at,buckley gray,supra,cal.at,pavicich santucci,supra,th at,d jackson rogers wells,supra,d at.cicone,supra,d at.fire ins.exchange,supra,at hansen,supra,at slotkin,supra,rest d,law governing lawyers,coms.
counsel retained by an insurer has an obligation to be truthful in describing insurance coverage to a third party beneficiary.the litigation privilege is not a license to deceive an injured party who steps into the shoes of the insured.see pt,ante.section grants an injured party the right to file suit in order to recover under the insurance policy.coverage counsel may not commit fraud in an attempt to defeat that right.and to the extent there is a conflict between an injured party rights under section and coverage counsel reliance on the litigation privilege,subd.b,the rights of the injured party prevail as they arise under the more specific of the two statutes.see schoendorf registry th,d.
finally,we note that a primary purpose of the litigation privilege is to safeguard litigants and witnesses from subsequent tort suits.the privilege also encourages open channels of communication,promotes the zealous protection of clients interests,and obligates litigants to expose the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence during trial.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at,home ins.zurich ins.th,d home ins.those purposes are not frustrated where,co
