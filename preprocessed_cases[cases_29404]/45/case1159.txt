while that policy did not expressly provide for uim coverage,plaintiff contends that such coverage arose by operation of law under former ohio revised code,as that provision has been interpreted by the ohio supreme court in liberty mutual fire insurance,ohio,ezawa yasuda fire marine insurance,ohio,and selander erie insurance group,ohio.plaintiff contends the district court erroneously found that plaintiff was not an insured under the policy,the policy was not an automobile liability policy for purposes of,and the other insurance provisions in the policy applied to uim coverage arising by operation of law.after review of the record and the applicable law,we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of state farm.

motor vehicle liability insurance 
until was amended effective september,the statute did not define what constituted an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurance policy for purposes of triggering an insurer obligation to offer coverage.interpreting the version of the statute,the ohio supreme court held in selander erie insurance group,ohio,that a commercial liability policy providing limited liability coverage for hired and nonowned automobiles used in the insured business afforded sufficient automobile coverage to be deemed a motor vehicle liability policy subject to 
the district court distinguished this case on the grounds that the decedents in selander were killed while in the course of partnership business.the commercial liability policy at issue in selander expressly provided limited liability coverage to the named insured,the partnership,arising from the use of hired and nonowned automobiles in the course of partnership business.two brothers,who were partners in the business,were killed in an accident involving a pickup truck owned by one of the partners and being used in the course of partnership business.despite the possible implication that the course of employment distinction might be significant to the holding in selander,subsequent ohio supreme court decisions lead us to conclude that this case can not be distinguished from selander on that basis.
in davidson motorists mutual insurance,ohio,the ohio supreme court distinguished selander from homeowner policies that excluded coverage for motor vehicles,except that they provided limited liability coverage for certain motorized conveyances not subject to motor vehicle registration laws.in finding the homeowner policies were not automobile or motor vehicle policies,the court explained that 
the policy in selander was deemed an automobile liability or motor vehicle policy precisely because there was express liability coverage arising from the use of automobiles.furthermore,automobiles,unlike the vehicles listed in the homeowner policy in this case,are subject to motor vehicle registration and are designed for and are used for transporting people on a public highway.

in hillyer state farm fire casualty,ohio,a case arising under the version of the statute,the ohio supreme court held that a clause in a homeowner policy does not convert that policy into a motor vehicle policy for purposes of clarifying its decisions in selander and davidson,the court explained that it is the type of coverage provided by the terms of the policy that determines whether it will be found to be a motor vehicle liability policy for purposes of the statute.in the course of the opinion,the court provided the following insight into the rationale underlying selander and davidson 
selander involved a business liability policy issued to a partnership.the policy generally excluded coverage for automobiles however,it provided some automobile liability coverage for claims of vicarious liability arising from the use of unspecified hired or nonowned vehicles used in the course of the business.because the business policy provided some liability coverage in limited circumstances,we held that coverage must be provided 
the coverage in davidson was not incidental merely because it involved recreational vehicles.instead,it was incidental primarily because coverage of those vehicles was remote from and insignificant to the type of overall coverage the policy provided.

the state farm policy in this case provided coverage through an exception to the automobile exclusion for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the use of any auto in your business by any person other than you.lawler,d at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because the state farm policy provided essentially the same limited automobile liability coverage as was provided by the commercial liability policy at issue in selander,the state farm policy was an automobile or motor vehicle liability policy triggering the obligation to offer coverage.because the policy provided no coverage and no valid offer and rejection of such coverage was obtained,coverage arose by operation of law.
challenging the district court finding that she and her husband were not insureds under the state farm policy,plaintiff argues that the district court misinterpreted and failed to apply ohio law as articulated by the ohio supreme court in and ezawa.while we do not agree with all of the district court analysis of the decision,we nonetheless conclude that neither nor ezawa compel a finding that plaintiff is entitled to uim coverage.
in,a surviving widow sought to recover uim motorist benefits under two insurance policies issued to her husband employer,superior dairy,after he was killed in a car accident while driving his wife car on personal business.superior was the named insured under a commercial automobile liability policy and an liability policy.the ohio supreme court defined three issues for decision first,whether the decedent christopher pontzer,as an employee of superior,was an insured for purposes of uim coverage under these policies second,if he was,then whether it was necessary for him to have been acting in the course of employment at the time of the accident and third,whether the exclusions in the umbrella liability policy applied to uim coverage arising by operation of law.
the commercial automobile policy,which provided coverage,defined an insured to include you if you are an individual,any family member and anyone else occupying a covered auto.although superior was the only named insured,the court found the definition to be ambiguous and construed the policy against the insurer,reasoning as follows 
contrary to appellees contentions,the policy language of the commercial automobile policy can be interpreted to include company employees.assuming arguendo that you does refer solely to superior dairy,this does not foreclose the inclusion of pontzer as an insured under the policy.we note again,as we have often in the past,that uninsured motorist coverage was designed by the general assembly to protect persons,not vehicles.martin midwestern group ins,ohio,paragraph one of the syllabus.since ohio revised code mandates underinsured as well as uninsured motorist coverage,obviously the same rationale applies to underinsured motorist coverage.it would be contrary to previous dictates of this court for us now to interpret the policy language at issue here as providing underinsured motorist insurance protection solely to a corporation without any regard to persons.see ady am.ins,ohio.rather,it would be reasonable to conclude that you,while referring to superior dairy,also includes superior employees,since a corporation can act only by and through real live persons.it would be nonsensical to limit protection solely to the corporate entity,since a corporation,itself,can not occupy an automobile,suffer bodily injury or death,or operate a motor vehicle.here,naming the corporation as the insured is meaningless unless the coverage extends to some person or to the corporation employees.
at.thus,the court found that,as an employee of superior,pontzer came within the definition of an insured under the automobile policy.since that policy contained no language requiring that employees be acting within the scope of their employment to receive uim coverage,the court found the decedent was covered under the business automobile policy.
the separate umbrella policy listed superior dairy as the named insured,and coverage was found to arise by operation of law.the court first declared that,as an employee of superior,pontzer was an insured.only then did the court address the issue,explaining that it had 
already found that liberty mutual had failed to offer underinsured motorist coverage through the umbrella policy issued to superior dairy.thus,any language in the liberty mutual umbrella policy restricting insurance coverage was intended to apply solely to excess liability coverage and not for purposes of underinsured motorist coverage.see,demetry kim,ohio app d.therefore,there is no requirement in the umbrella policy that pontzer had to be acting during the scope of his employment to qualify for underinsured motorist coverage.
at.based on this determination,the court held that pontzer was an insured entitled to uim coverage even though he was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident.
plaintiff argues that the district court misinterpreted this portion of the decision,based on its erroneous view that the ohio supreme court failed to consider the differences between the definitions of an insured in each of the two policies.the district court specifically found that from the summary treatment of the umbrella policy,one is left with the impression that the ohio supreme court simply decided that since they found coverage under the business automobile policy they might as well find it under the umbrella policy as well.lawler,d at.relying on the fact that the opinion did not discuss the limitation until after declaring that pontzer was an insured under the umbrella policy,the district court reasoned that the limitation must have appeared outside the definition of an insured.based on this inference,the district court then distinguished from this case on the grounds that the state farm policy more narrowly defined an insured to include only employees acting within the scope of their employment.
while the ohio supreme court failure to articulate the reasons for finding pontzer was an insured makes the task of interpreting the scope of its holding more difficult,the fact that the court specifically found pontzer was an insured under the umbrella policy can not be disregarded.nor can we ignore the court statement that if we find pontzer was not an insured under the policies,then our inquiry is at an end.at.see szabo cgu int l,d,it is,in short,unreasonable to read for the proposition that an employee who is not named,either expressly or impliedly,under her employing corporation automobile liability policy,must nevertheless benefit from de jure uim coverage on account of the insurer not having offered suc
