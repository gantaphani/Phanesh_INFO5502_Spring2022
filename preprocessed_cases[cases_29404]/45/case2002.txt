in this diversity action based on kansas law,natalie long seeks uninsured motorist benefits for her children,who were severely injured in a accident.the uninsured teen driver,a friend of long children,did not have permission to drive the truck involved in the accident.
after the district court dismissed long claims against the vehicle owner insurance company paul fire and marine insurance,long added her own insurance company american standard insurance company of wisconsin as a defendant.american standard subsequently moved for summary judgment,lost,and decided to settle long claims.despite the settlement,long continues to seek additional uninsured motorist um benefits from paul.
on appeal,long challenges the dismissal of her claims against paul.she contends the kansas uninsured motorist statute.stat.ann.a,requires the paul policy to provide um coverage for her children.she also asserts that even if the statute does not require um coverage,the language of the paul policy itself provides coverage.according to long,because paul denied liability coverage for the accident under the nonpermissive user provision in its policy,the pickup truck involved in the accident became an uninsured vehicle,triggering the paul um coverage.
we conclude the truck was not an uninsured vehicle for purposes of the paul policy,under either the kansas statute or the policy relevant language.exercising jurisdiction under,we therefore affirm the district court entry of judgment in favor of paul.
background 
a.the accident 
the accident occurred when a group of underage teenagers were joyriding in a pickup truck.the truck belonged to a construction company owned by the driver father.even though he was unlicensed,the driver parents would occasionally allow him to drive the truck to and from school,work,and home.on the day of the accident,however,his parents specifically instructed him not to use the vehicle.paul insured the truck under a general liability insurance policy it issued to the father construction company.
at the time of the accident,long children,charles rhoten,and jennifer rhoten,were riding in the truck bed.the driver lost control of the truck while turning onto a dirt road,and the vehicle swerved into a ditch and rolled,landing on its side.and jennifer were ejected from the truck bed and suffered serious injuries.tragically,died from his wounds.
b.the paul policy 
the paul policy insured the general liabilities of the construction company owned by the driver father,including liabilities arising from the use of covered autos.the policy coverage limit for a single car accident was.neither party disputes the truck involved in the accident was a covered auto under the policy.
in the auto liability protection portion of the policy,under a heading entitled who is protected under this agreement,the policy stated 
any permitted user.any person or organization to whom you given permission to use a covered auto you own,rent,lease,hire or borrow is a protected person.
at.pursuant to this provision,paul denied liability coverage for the driver operation of the pickup truck on the day of the accident.in its letter to the teen driver parents denying liability coverage,paul stated,the driver admits to have previously taken the keys to the vehicle he was driving without the knowledge or permission of you,as his parents,or anyone associated with the construction company.doc,amended,ex.based on these facts,paul concluded the driver was not a permissive user and therefore no coverage is provided to him under the automobile policy.id.
but paul denial of liability coverage did not answer whether the policy um coverage was triggered by the accident or whether the coverage would be available to and jennifer.indeed,the denial of liability coverage undergirds long argument that the um coverage applies.
in general,under the um coverage,paul agreed to pay all sums any protected person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured or underinsured vehicle.at.both and jennifer were potentially protected persons under this um coverage because they were riding in a covered auto.id.at.but even assuming and jennifer were protected persons,the question remains whether the truck at issue was uninsured at the time of the accident.
the policy defines uninsured vehicle as including a vehicle for which an insurance or bonding company denies coverage.id.at.thus,long argues paul denial of liability coverage for the accident made the truck an uninsured vehicle such that and jennifer could recover um benefits.
legal proceedings 
several months after the accident,natalie and jennifer counsel and sent a demand letter to paul.paul denied um coverage.
in its letter denying um coverage,paul stated,we have previously denied coverage responsibility for any claims against the liability of the driver of the vehicle at issue,because that person was not a permitted driver however,that denial of coverage did not mean that the vehicle itself was an uninsured vehicle doc,amended,ex.paul went on to explain that it was not denying that there is coverage for this vehicle.we have denied coverage for the driver who caused the accident.kansas law recognizes this difference.id.
long disagreed with paul interpretation of kansas law,as well as its interpretation of the policy um provisions,and filed suit.in due course,long moved for summary judgment,arguing kansas law mandated um coverage for her children on the facts presented,and even if such coverage was not statutorily mandated,the paul policy nevertheless provided it.see long paul fire marine ins,d.the court denied long motion in relevant part stating kansas law does not requir e uninsured motorist coverage under the paul policy in cases such as that presented here.nor can the court accept plaintiff argument that the language of the policy nevertheless mandates coverage.id.at.after receiving this favorable ruling,paul moved for judgment on the pleadings and dismissal.the court granted its motions.
subsequently,long added her own insurer,american standard,as a defendant.long policy with american standard included and jennifer as insured parties,and long sought um coverage under that policy on behalf of her children.american standard moved for summary judgment,but this time the district court ruled in favor of long,holding that the american standard policy did not unambiguously deny coverage under the facts of the case.long am.standard ins.of,d.in light of this ruling,american standard opted to settle long claim,and paid out the full extent of her policy um coverage.
despite this recovery,long appeals,claiming the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings and dismissing her claims against paul 
ii.analysis 
we review the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings and its dismissal of long claims under the same de novo standard.corder lewis palmer sch.dist,cir.we assume long allegations are true and ask whether the pleadings state a claim for relief that is facially plausible,not merely speculative.id.because this is a diversity case,we must ascertain and apply the state law to determine the plausibility of long claims.rusakiewicz lowe,cir quoting wade emcasco ins,cir.here,the relevant state law of us to analyze the case using a inquiry.
first,we ask whether the kansas uninsured motorist statute mandates coverage under the facts presented.if so,the case ends there t he provisions of the statute are to be considered a part of every automobile policy in this state.state farm mut.auto.ins.cummings,d,abrogated on other grounds,cashman ex rel.cashman cherry.but if the kansas statute is inapplicable,we must proceed to an analysis of the paul policy itself to the extent the policy does not conflict with or attempt to diminish or omit the statutorily mandated coverage,it would be controlling as between the parties.see also halsey farm bureau mut.ins,employing the approach.
a.the kansas um statute 
kansas law requires car insurance to protect against accidents caused by uninsured motorists 
no automobile liability insurance policy shall be delivered or issued in kansas unless the policy contains a provision in such automobile liability insurance policy sold to the named insured for payment of part or all sums which the insured or the insured legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the uninsured owner or operator of a motor vehicle 
stat.ann.a emphasis added.according to the kansas supreme court,t he purpose of is to provide the individual who is covered by the standard automobile liability policy with a right against his or her own insurer equal to that the insured would have against the uninsured tortfeasor.farm bureau mut.ins,quoting rich farm bureau mut.ins.
long argues the statute must be liberally construed in favor of coverage and should be read to require paul to cover her children injuries.some kansas cases appear to support this contention since the uninsured and underinsured motorist statutes should be liberally construed to provide broad protection to the insured.jones auto.club,d,see also rich,at the purpose of the legislation is to fill the gap inherent in motor vehicle financial responsibility and compulsory insurance legislation.this coverage is intended to provide recompense to innocent persons.but this is a general statement of policy,and must yield to specific statutory requirements.
as an initial matter,a does not require that a tortfeasor insurance policy protect an innocent accident only requires that the injured person policy provide um coverage.indeed,the language of a mandates um coverage only in such automobile insurance policy sold to the named insured.emphasis added.we therefore look not to the paul policy covering the pickup truck,but to the american standard policy that insured long and her children from injuries caused by uninsured motorists.the district court concluded that unlike the paul,under the facts of this case,clearly excluded coverage for users the american standard policy did not unambiguously deny coverage for long children.see long,d at.of course,whether the kansas um statute or the relevant policy language mandated coverage under the american standard policy is a legal question not before issue has been settled by the parties.but at the very least,long children recovered benefits from their own insurer to bridge the gap in coverage left by the paul permissive user exclusion.the purpose of a therefore appears to have been satisfied in this case.
moreover,kansas courts have not construed the statute to mandate that a vehicle owner insurance policy provide um coverage for nonpermissive users of the owner insured vehicles or passengers of nonpermissive users the kansas supreme court faced an insurance dispute similar to this one in farmers insurance schiller.in that case,the owner of a pickup truck,who was arranging to sell the truck,lent the vehicle to a potential buyer for the evening,instructing that only the buyer was allowed to drive.that night,the the owner the keys over to schiller and a friend.
it is unclear who drove the truck that or the someone wrecked it,and schiller sustained personal injuries.the owner insurer,farmers,filed an action for declaratory judgment to determine whether it was required to cover schiller,though neither he nor his friend had permission to drive the truck.
schiller argued that because farmers denied him personal injury benefits,a mandated that he receive um coverage.the kansas supreme court disagreed.it held,t he uninsured motorist statute was not enacted to provide coverage for everyone a guest passenger of an unauthorized user,which passenger does not fall within the definition of insured contained in the vehicle owner policy,is not within the coverage mandated by the uninsured motorist statute schiller,at.
in a later case,hilyard clearwater,the kansas supreme court reaffirmed that the mere denial of general insurance coverage does not trigger the um statute.there,an insurance company denied liability benefits for the family members of several insured parties pursuant to a policy household exclusion.the plaintiffs argued this denial of coverage triggered um benefits.but the kansas supreme court held that a did not mandate um coverage under those facts the statute does not contemplate a situation where the uninsured owner or operator is the owner of an automobile liability insurance policy.hilyard,at.
long argues hilyard has little precedential value because the kansas court of appeals purported to limit hilyard to its particular facts.see cummings,at.long argument is incorrect for several reasons.first,as a federal court sitting in diversity,we apply the law as set forth by the relevant state highest court.the decisions of lower state courts,while persuasive,are not dispositive.see wade,at.
second,although cummings revisited the holding of hilyard,it ultimately arrived at a similar conclusion a n offending vehicle is not to be considered as uninsured when the driver or owner of that vehicle is covered by the requisite minimum liability coverage.cummings,at see also id.at if either the owner or driver of an automobile has purchased minimum coverage,the vehicle is not uninsured.and cummings never suggested hilyard was incorrectly decided.unlike cummings,hilyard concerned the operation of a valid insurance policy exclusion the kansas supreme court denied um coverage in hilyard because to do otherwise would have emasculate d the exclusion clause in the policy.cummings,at.in contrast,no policy exclusions were implicated in only question was the definition of an uninsured vehicle.for precisely this reason,the court in cummings found hilyard did not apply to the facts of that case 
schiller and hilyard thus establish that the kansas statute does not mandate um coverage for long children under the paul policy.the teen driver here,like the driver in schiller,was not permitted to drive the truck at the time of the accident,and long does not argue otherwise.consequently,as guest passenger s of the unauthorized user,long children are not entitled to um benefits from paul under a.schiller,at.
moreover,as in hilyard,the mere fact that paul denied liability coverage to the driver does not mean it is simultaneously required to provide um coverage for passengers.the teen for the nonpermissive user provision in the paul insured under that same policy.as the kansas supreme court stated,the um statute does not contemplate the situation at the driver is insured but,because of a legitimate policy exclusion,the claimant characterizes him as uninsured to gain access to statutory um benefits.hilyard,at.
the kansas legislature has not modified the um statute to abrogate the schiller and hilyard decisions,and we must presume it agrees with their holdings.halsey,at quoting in re adoption of.we therefore conclude that a does not mandate paul to provide um benefits to and jennifer 
b.the policy language 
because we conclude a does not mandate um coverage under the facts presented,we must advance to the second stage of the um analysis an examination of the paul policy itself.
long asserts that even if the kansas um statute is inapplicable,the paul policy afforded coverage greater than the statutorily mandated minimum coverage.aplt.br.at.this argument proceeds in three parts paul,an insurance company,denied coverage for the accident under the nonpermissive user exclusion,the policy broadly defines uninsured vehicle as one for which an insurance or bonding company denies coverage,and therefore,the paul um coverage is applicable to this case.the crux of the argument is part.paul definition of uninsured vehicle.
under kansas law,we must interpret the paul policy to give effect to the intention of the parties.brumley lee.though we construe ambiguous terms against paul as the drafter of the policy,we must not find an ambiguity if a reasonable construction of the,one that makes the contract fair,customary,and such as prudent persons would intend leads us to a single interpretation.marquis state farm fire cas.moreover,a reasonable construction of the policy must be based on a reading of all pertinent policy provisions we must avoid a critical analysis of a single,isolated provision.id.citing arnold of.ultimately,our task is to determine what a reasonably prudent insured would underst
