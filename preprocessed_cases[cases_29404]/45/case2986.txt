c.the third amended cross complaint 
some of the allegations in shekhter third amended seem somewhat wild and others have already been determined not to support a valid claim under california law.it bears emphasis that the truth of the claims in the third amended have never been proven to be true.
shekhter third amended alleged as follows.in,the state of california the state and financial filed a lawsuit against shekhter and others.the plaintiffs and their counsel,kass and the manning law firm,knew the lawsuit was meritless but,because of its press worthiness,the defendants would be coerced to settle it.before december,kass and the manning law firm began representing allstate.the intended to share information obtained in financial action with allstate.that information was to be used in this lawsuit,which was filed on october,by allstate.in early january,kass spoke with shekhter.shekhter was threatened with civil and criminal sanctions unless he would testify falsely.in about,cline deposition was commenced in the financial action filed in but was adjourned without allowing for.in february,kass,the manning law firm,financial,and the state began retaliating against shekhter.this was because shekhter refused to falsify evidence.the retaliation consisted of identifying shekhter as a fictitiously named defendant.also,in the third amended,shekhter alleged kass submitted false information to government entities for ulterior and improper purposes.shekhter alleged,these attempts to coerce a settlement of an unmeritorious claim through improper and fraudulent means continue as of this filing.in about mid,allstate,acting through kass and the manning law firm,began directly communicating with clients of various lawyers in violation of the code of professional responsibility and unfair business practice law.shekhter learned of this practice in august when he came into possession of a document entitled,material statement in support of complaint for violation of state insurance frauds prevention act the material statement.
formal settlement discussions in the financial action began in august.the state,kass,the manning law firm,and financial participated in the discussions.shekhter objective,of which the were aware,was to buy peace even though he denied any wrongdoing.the also knew shekhter was willing to settle only if he received an assurance the manning law firm would never pursue him again on behalf of the state or any insurer.kass promised shekhter no such litigation would be pursued.kass misrepresented that he was not aware of any other pending or potential litigation.on october,shekhter executed the settlement agreement in the action filed by financial.
in fact,however,on october,allstate had filed the present lawsuit.the allstate lawsuit had been filed under seal.allstate was represented by the manning law firm and kass.at no time did kass,the manning law firm,the state,financial,allstate,or anyone else tell shekhter about the present lawsuit.in october,the material statement was submitted to the state and other governmental entities for improper purposes including inducing the government to wrongfully prosecute shekhter,thereby forcing him to settle the meritless financial action.in late october,the financial action was settled pursuant to an agreement drafted by kass and the manning law firm.the state signed the agreement without disclosing that the present lawsuit had been filed under seal.
shekhter further alleged that the allstate action was served as a publicity counter measure.service occurred at a time when publicity negative to allstate was emanating from the northridge earthquake.in february,the state,kass,the manning law firm,and allstate breached the settlement agreement by disseminating nationally syndicated articles based upon information made confidential by the settlement agreement.in march or april,allstate,kass,and the manning law firm contacted various broadcasting companies.advised that they had filed a suit against the largest fraud ring ever to operate in los angeles county.no effort was made to inform the broadcasters or publishers of the limitations created by the confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement.in april,cline was interviewed by nationally syndicated personnel at the manning law firm offices in breach of the confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement.in october,cline was deposed in allstate midwest offices.the deposition was taken after cline claimed to have received a threatening phone call.the telephone call was made by an allstate or manning law firm employee at their behest in order to create a facade to avoid producing cline for deposition locally.this scheme was employed to harass and deter the defense of the present lawsuit and to coerce a settlement.in november,allstate,acting by and through kass and the manning law firm,perpetrated a fraud on the court and an abuse of process by filing documents containing false information and forged signatures.in april,shekhter filed his first amended.in retaliation,allstate,kass,and the manning law firm made a false report to the federal bureau of investigation fbi to the effect that shekhter had been threatening witnesses,including cline.in may,at a deposition of cline,the manning law firm revealed that she was under witness protection and special agents of the fbi would be attending the deposition.
in his first cause of action,shekhter alleged he was fraudulently induced to enter into the settlement of the financial lawsuit filed in.the second cause of action alleged,alternatively,that kass,the manning law firm,financial,and the state made negligent misrepresentations which induced shekhter to enter into the settlement agreement.the third cause of action alleged financial and the state breached the settlement agreement in multiple respects.in his fourth cause of action,shekhter alleged kass and the manning law firm breached the settlement agreement,particularly the confidentiality provision.the fifth cause of action alleged kass,the manning law firm,the state,and financial fraudulently accepted shekhter payments under the october settlement agreement without disclosing that the present lawsuit had been filed.shekhter alleged kass,the manning law firm,the state,and financial did not intend to comply with the settlement agreement.the sixth cause of action alleged,alternatively,that the acted negligently.the seventh cause of action alleged kass,the manning law firm,and allstate intentionally interfered with shekhter economic advantage under the settlement agreement.in his eighth cause of action,shekhter alternatively alleged negligent interference with his economic advantage.the ninth cause of action alleged abuse of process against kass,the manning law firm,and allstate in that they filed the present action as a publicity stunt allstate engaged in specific tactics to extort a settlement they filed the present action under seal so that shekhter would continue to pay settlement monies without knowing that the settlement agreement had already been breached they knowingly and intentionally submitted false and forged documents to the court they falsely accused shekhter of witness intimidation to the fbi and they had the fbi special agents attend depositions to intimidate shekhter and force him to settle the action.
the tenth cause of action of the third amended was brought by shekhter individually and on behalf of the general public.it alleged the committed unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section et and violated the unruh civil rights act,et in that they had engaged in discrimination against minorities discriminated against attorneys representing minorities in their claims practices and had contacted clients of various lawyer d efendants without placing claimant attorneys on notice or procuring their authorization,constituting a violation of professional codes and standards shekhter further alleged cross d efendants engaged in unfair and deceptive business,advertising and solicitation practices,including but not limited to a engaging in tactics constituting obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury b utilizing press and media resources for the collateral purpose of embarrassing,slandering,exploiting and ultimately extorting settlement monies on meritless claims c employing illegal criteria for the payment of claims,including paying less on claims of persons of minority status d utilizing colossus an illegal set of claim criteria e discriminating against individuals of minority decent sic,including those of hispanic,russian jewish dissent sic,origin,background or persuasion f retaliating and discriminating against members of the plaintiff bar,who represent minorities or who themselves are russian,jewish or of other minority status g contacting clients of various lawyer d efendants herein without said lawyers knowledge or acquiescence or authorization h by misrepresenting themselves to clients of various lawyer d efendants and the use of intimidating investigatory techniques i by systematically and intentionally violating the unruh civil rights act and j other unfair and deceptive business practices according to proof.in his tenth cause of action,shekhter sought injunctive relief,disgorgement of profits,and statutory penalties.

d.the trial court rulings 
following demurrers,the remaining causes of action were the third for contract breach and specific performance against financial the fourth for contract breach against kass and the manning law firm and the tenth against allstate,kass,the manning law firm,and financial for violation of the unfair practices and unruh civil rights acts.the motions of allstate,kass,and the manning law firm pursuant to section were considered in relation to the third,fourth,and tenth causes of action.the trial court denied the section motions.the court then considered the motion of kass and the manning law firm to compel arbitration as to the fourth cause of action.financial also sought to compel arbitration as to the fourth cause of action.it ordered arbitration and stayed litigation as to the third breach of contract against financial and fourth breach of contract against kass and the manning law firm causes of action only.the trial court further concluded the damages limitation in the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable and is refused enforcement.the cause of action which then remained to be tried was the tenth cause of action for unlawful business practices and violation of the unruh civil rights act brought against kass,the manning law firm,financial,and allstate.
iii.discussion 
kass,the manning law firm,financial,and allstate contend the trial court erred in denying their section motions as to the tenth cause of action because the unfair business practices and unruh civil rights act claims are based on allegations that fall within the scope of section and shekhter did not establish he would probably prevail on that claim.as noted above,at the time the trial court ruled on the section motions only the third,fourth,and tenth causes of action remained.the tenth cause of action was the only remaining cause of action as to allstate.both the fourth and the tenth causes of action remained as to kass and the manning law firm.both the third and tenth causes of action remained as to financial.financial,kass,and the manning law firm stand by the position they took in the trial court concerning the third and fourth causes of action respectively those claims must be arbitrated.we asked the parties to brief the question whether kass,the manning law firm,and financial could challenge the trial court ruling on the section motion as to only one cause of action when there were remaining claims.therefore,kass,the manning firm,financial,and allstate all contend the special motion to strike should have been granted as to the tenth cause of action for purported unfair business practices and violations of the unruh civil rights act.we conclude,as discussed below,that the trial court erred in denying the special motions to strike the tenth cause of action.
we address first the issue of whether a special motion to strike can apply to one cause of action when other claims remain to be resolved.section is not entirely clear as to whether it is to apply to an individual cause of action.section,subdivision a states that the legislature was responding to the disturbing increase in lawsuits,which suggests that only when an entire action is resolved can a special motion to strike be filed.however,section,subdivision b states,a cause of action against a person shall be subject to a special motion to strike italics added.the express language of section,subdivision b allows a single cause of action to be stricken.the fact that other claims remain does not bar a trial judge from granting a section special motion to strike.our conclusion in this regard is buttressed by the requirement that the special motion to strike procedure be construed broadly,subd.a briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,dowling zimmerman th,d.
additionally,we address the issue of whether the special motions to strike the tenth cause of action should have been granted on the merits.the burdens of proof on a special motion to strike pursuant to section were described by the court of appeal in paul for council hanyecz th,d,as follows section,subdivision b,requires the trial court to engage in a process when determining whether a defendant section motion to strike should be granted.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold prima facie showing that defendant acts,of which the plaintiff complains,were ones taken in furtherance of the defendant constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.wilcox superior court th,d.if the court finds that such a showing has been made,then the plaintiff will be required to demonstrate that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b dupont
