two questions are presented by this case.the first question is whether considerations of public policy require the adoption of a blanket rule barring concurrent counsel or cocounsel from suing one another for indemnification of legal malpractice damages.we conclude public policy does not require the adoption of such a blanket rule.the second question is whether insurers of attorneys sued for legal malpractice may be subrogated to the attorneys indemnity claims against concurrent counsel or cocounsel.while legal malpractice claims are not ordinarily assignable,we conclude the policy considerations against assignment are not applicable here.
for the reasons stated,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which had reversed the judgment of the trial court granting a nonsuit.
factual and procedural background 
sandra musser is an attorney who practices family law.she represented pam scott in divorce proceedings in.musser filed a petition for spousal and child support set to be heard on july.at that hearing,scott husband declared that he had filed for bankruptcy and the support hearing was continued.musser arranged for douglas provencher,a bankruptcy specialist,to obtain relief from the automatic stay imposed by the bankruptcy court.provencher did not obtain relief from the stay,but advised musser that she could proceed with the hearing to set support.provencher advised musser that the support hearing would not violate the stay if the court did not enter the support order until after the stay was lifted.this advice was contrary to legal authority.musser asserts provencher did not even attempt to research the issue.acting on provencher advice,musser continued with the hearing,although the family law judge warned her she might be violating the automatic stay in so doing.
thereafter,mark scott appealed the grant of spousal and child support and in an unpublished opinion,the court of appeal reversed the support awards on the grounds they were void ab initio,as the hearing setting support violated the automatic stay.
facing punitive damages for violation of the automatic stay,pam scott settled with her former husband for less than the original support order.she then sued musser for malpractice and breach of contract.musser against pam scott for attorney fees and costs.musser moved for summary judgment on the ground that scott had not sued the sole negligent party,provencher.the court denied musser summary judgment motion,finding musser was vicariously liable for provencher negligence.
musser requested that provencher and his insurance carrier contribute to a settlement offer to pam scott,but provencher refused.musser then filed a against provencher for indemnity and settled the case with pam scott.mark scott also filed a complaint against musser for her part in the violation of the automatic stay.musser again requested provencher and his insurer to contribute to a settlement but was again refused.musser then amended her against provencher to allege these additional damages,and settled with mark scott.
the settlements paid to pam and mark scott included of which was paid directly by musser as her insurance policy deductible and in waived legal fees and costs.in addition,musser and her insurer,home insurance company hereafter home,spent in defending both malpractice actions.fn.omitted.
musser first amended for indemnity against provencher alleged three causes of action implied contractual indemnity,equitable indemnity,and tort of another.the first two sought as damages the money paid by musser and home and the in waived fees and costs.fn.omitted.the tort of another cause of action sought expended in defending the malpractice actions.provencher answered,raising several affirmative defenses,including that musser had violated code of civil procedure section in failing to join home as a party,since home paid all but the deductible toward the settlement,and that musser had split her cause of action for waived fees because musser had failed to name provencher in her against pam scott for fees.he also raised statute of limitations defenses.in november,musser moved for summary adjudication as to several of provencher affirmative defenses.after hearing,judge gary thomas ruled that home was in essence a party to the action,and was authorized to sue in musser name that musser had not split her cause of action,as the same cause of action was not involved in musser fee action against pam scott as in her indemnity action against provencher.the court also ruled that the action against provencher was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel for the same reason.the judge also ruled in favor of musser on the statute of limitations issue,finding the indemnity causes of action within the limitations period and that the tort of another cause of action was for malpractice,the statute of limitations for which was triggered by discovery so that triable issues of fact remained as to when musser discovered her actual harm.
by january,provencher was represented by new counsel and the case had been transferred to a new trial judge.in pretrial motions in limine,provencher moved to bar musser from seeking damages based on the settlements because home,and not musser,had paid the settlements.provencher also urged that musser had waived her claim for fees in the settlement and that the dismissal with prejudice following settlement barred musser fee and cost claim.finally,he argued that the action was in reality a legal malpractice action which could not be assigned to home.musser argued these issues had been decided in the summary adjudication motion and that the new motion was therefore an impermissible motion for reconsideration,made without new law or facts.
judge vernon smith ruled that the action was in fact a legal malpractice claim,which could not be assigned to the insurer.therefore,musser could not introduce evidence of the settlements paid by home.judge smith further found that musser could not introduce evidence of fees and costs she had waived when she settled with pam scott and that the dismissal with prejudice following the settlement included those waived fees and costs.these rulings effectively struck all damage claims,except for the deductible paid by musser personally.thereafter,on april,the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit as to the deductible claim,preventing that damage claim from being presented to the jury.on october,following its grant of nonsuit on all musser claims,the court entered judgment against musser and in favor of provencher on musser.this timely appeal followed.
the court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded the matter for further proceedings.the court held musser was not barred from seeking indemnification from provencher.the court also held the trial court erred in ruling that musser malpractice insurer could not pursue a subrogation claim against provencher.the court further held the trial court erred in dismissing that portion of musser action in which she sought recovery from provencher of fees owed her by the client,notwithstanding musser settlement with the client.finally,the court held the trial court erred in granting a nonsuit as to musser claim for the insurance policy deductible amount that she paid that was not subrogated or assigned to her malpractice insurer.
ii.discussion 
again,we consider two questions in this case.the central one is whether concurrent counsel or cocounsel should be permitted to sue one another for indemnification of legal malpractice damages.assuming that,under the circumstances of this case,musser should be permitted to sue her concurrent counsel,provencher,for indemnification of malpractice damages,the question then arises whether home,musser insurer,may be subrogated to her indemnity claim against provencher.we turn,first,to the indemnification question.
whether concurrent counsel or cocounsel may sue one another for indemnification of malpractice damages 
in american motorcycle superior court cal d,ama,this court held that,in general,one cotortfeasor may obtain partial equitable indemnity from another on a comparative fault basis.w e concur with dean prosser observation in a related context that t here is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss,for which two defendants were unintentionally responsible,to be shouldered onto one alone,while the latter goes scot free.prosser,law of torts ed.from the crude rule of traditional indemnity doctrine,and the similarly inflexible per capita division of the narrowly circumscribed contribution statute,we have progressed to the more refined stage of permitting the jury to apportion liability in accordance with the tortfeasors comparative fault.accordingly,we hold that under the common law equitable indemnity doctrine a concurrent tortfeasor may obtain partial indemnity from cotortfeasors on a comparative fault basis.ama,at.
our decision in ama expressly acknowledged a number of significant exceptions to th e general rule of indemnity,including immunity for good faith settlements and exclusivity of workers compensation.ama,supra,cal d at,fn.indeed,at least one subsequent appellate court has concluded that ama makes not a rule of general application but a rule riddled with exceptions.partial indemnity is permitted only in appropriate cases.citations.thus,irrespective of the equities between or among multiple tortfeasors,the right is subject to qualification and countervailing considerations may limit recovery.as suggested by dean prosser,the granting of indemnity in any situation represents a judicial choice of policy citation and courts have long recognized that the doctrine is not available where it would operate against public policy.citation.western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d,western steamship fn.omitted.
in the footnote in western steamship that supports the statement that courts have long recognized that the doctrine of equitable indemnity is not available where it would operate against public policy,we listed,among others,several cases in which indemnification for malpractice was barred where a predecessor attorney was seeking indemnification from his successor.western steamship,supra,cal th at fn,d.in such cases,which we will refer to as cases,the california courts of appeal,with one much criticized exception,have barred indemnification.see held arant d.held gibson,dunn crutcher superior court d.gibson,dunn goldfisher superior court d.goldfisher holland thacher d.holland austin superior court th,d but see parker morton d.
the courts of appeal have given various reasons for barring indemnification in cases,and they have not always explained their reasoning fully,but an examination of their opinions reveals two fundamental policy considerations.the first policy consideration is avoiding conflicts of interest between attorney and client the threat of an indemnification action would arguably create a conflict of interest between the successor attorney and the client because the greater the award the successor attorney managed to obtain for the client in the malpractice action,the greater the exposure to the predecessor attorney in the indemnification action.see,held,supra,d at.the second policy consideration is protecting confidentiality of communications in order to defend against an indemnification action,the successor attorney might be tempted to compromise the confidentiality of communications with the client.see,goldfisher,supra,d at.
the question we must consider,therefore,is whether allowing equitable indemnity would be contrary to public policy when one concurrent counsel or cocounsel sues another.
claims made by concurrent counsel or cocounsel against one another for damages arising from their joint representation of a mutual client have been the subject of four published opinions by the court of appeal.
equitable indemnity was the theory upon which relief was sought in two of the four cases,and in both of those cases relief was barred.kroll tract paris paris th,d kroll tract shaffery wilson,elser,moskowitz,edelman dicker th,d shaffery.
breach of fiduciary duty was the theory in the other two cases.joseph saunders,weissburg aronson th,d pollack lytle d.in those two cases,the underlying concurrent counsel or cocounsel owe one another a fiduciary duty not to handle their mutual client case in such a way as to reduce or eliminate their anticipated attorney accepted by one court pollack and rejected by the other saunders.
in a companion case,beck wecht cal th,d,we consider the latter one concurrent counsel or cocounsel may sue another for breach of fiduciary duty on the theory that the latter malpractice in handling their mutual client case reduced or eliminated the fees the former expected to realize from the representation.in this case,we will confine ourselves to the question whether concurrent counsel or cocounsel may sue one another for indemnification of malpractice damages.
in kroll tract,supra,th,d,the client,who had been jointly represented by insurance counsel kroll tract and counsel paris paris,sued insurance counsel for malpractice,and insurance counsel against cumis counsel for equitable indemnity.insurance counsel argued that the policy grounds on which equitable indemnity is barred in cases were inapplicable because the two lawyers had shared responsibility in the underlying action in which the client claimed the malpractice occurred and neither of the lawyers was representing the client in the malpractice action.id.at,d.the court of appeal rejected the argument,although it suggested that the question whether a claim for equitable indemnity should be allowed in concurrent counsel or cocounsel cases should be decided by examining,on a basis,whether the policy considerations for barring such a claim applied.id.at,d.
under the facts presented in that case,the court of appeal held,the policy considerations for barring an indemnity claim did apply.kroll tract,supra,th at,d.although the two counsel shared the common goal of defending the client in the underlying lawsuit,the court of appeal observed,they filled separate roles.ibid.kroll tract was hired by the insurer,who provided a defense under a reservation of rights,while paris paris was the client personal counsel and remained as cumis counsel.the insurance defense attorney is placed in a position of conflict when issues of coverage are asserted by the insurer through a reservation of rights.addressing this problem,the court in san diego federal credit union cumis ins.society,supra,d,held that an insurance company must pay for independent counsel for its insured when there are divergent interests of the insured and insurer brought about by the insurer reservation of rights to deny coverage under an insurance policy.this holding was codified in civil code section in.the cumis doctrine requires complete independence of counsel citation,who represents solely the insured citation.since it is almost unavoidable that,in the course of investigating and preparing the insured defense to the third party action,the insured attorney will come across information relevant to a coverage or similar issue,it is quite difficult for an attorney beholden to the insurer to represent the insured where the insurer is reserving its rights regarding coverage citation.kroll tract,at,d.t he issues of undivided loyalty,tendencies,and the preservation of the privilege,the kroll tract court concluded,remain under these circumstances.id.at,d.
the kroll tract court then contrasted concurrent representation cases with crouse brobeck,phleger harrison th,d crouse,a case in which the policy considerations barring indemnification in cases were held inapplicable to an indemnity claim by a successor attorney against his predecessor.kroll tract,supra,th at,fn,d.the crouse court had found that t he former attorney is not subject to any conflict of interest and has no continuing privileged communications or work product to protect.crouse,at,d.the kroll tract court entered a reservation we are not prepared to agree with the crouse court sweeping statement for all purposes.kroll tract,at,fn,d.however,kroll tract continued,the particular facts in crouse showed there were no conflicting duties during the former attorney representation of the dissatisfied client thus,the court r
