factual and procedural summary 
rios contacted whilt to procure insurance coverage for her jewelry store in santa barbara.whilt solicited uca and other insurance brokers for quotes for a commercial package policy for rios retail jewelry store.as a part of this request,whilt submitted an application requesting a quote for special business and personal property coverage.whilt prepared the application for insurance for her the application was silent as to whilt status as a broker.
the underwriter for uca advised whilt that it would not quote special form coverage with a commercial package policy for rios,unless the building had been upgraded regarding wiring,plumbing,heating,and roofing.when whilt informed uca that there were no such upgrades,uca refused to offer special form coverage.in fact,uca had returned rios application to whilt after uca wrote on the application the limits for business income coverage which wilt had neglected to provide and,most significantly,uca struck out the word special and wrote over it the word basic.one of the differences between the special form coverage and the basic broad form coverage is that the latter does not insure against theft.uca then provided a policy quote reflecting the counteroffer for only basic broad form coverage through scottsdale at a cost of.
thereafter,whilt requested that uca bind and issue property liability coverage for rios property per your quote of effective.in doing so,whilt requested for rios the basic broad form coverage that did not insure against theft.
scottsdale thus issued to rios the policy it had quoted,effective february,through february.and on february,whilt prepared and presented a policy binder for rios,with scottsdale noted as the insurer.the policy binder prepared and presented by whilt mistakenly represented that the policy included special form coverage.
rios believed the policy she obtained was the type of policy she had authorized whilt to get for her,which specifically would have included theft coverage.by march,whilt received from scottsdale a copy of rios insurance policy,which did not include special form coverage that would have provided theft insurance.
on june,rios jewelry store was burglarized.rios suffered a theft loss that she believed was covered by her insurance policy.rios promptly tendered the loss to whilt,who referred the claim to uca.on july,scottsdale rejected rios insurance claim because the policy did not cover loss from theft.on august,whilt finally delivered a copy of the insurance policy to rios.
the trial court granted summary judgment against rios on her various causes of action against scottsdale,uca,and lin lan.the court observed,in part,that whilt,who was rios insurance broker,was primarily responsible for failing to obtain the type of policy requested,which should have included coverage for theft.
discussion 
no valid cause of action for breach of insurance contract.
in the first amended complaint,rios alleged that scottsdale breached the insurance contract by failing to honor the policy and indemnify her for her loss.however,the plain language of the policy issued does not include coverage for loss due to theft.theft is simply not one of the specified and enumerated perils covered by the policy.
it is well settled that it is the burden of the insured to show that a loss falls within the basic scope of coverage of a policy.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.when an occurrence is clearly not included within the coverage afforded by the insuring clause,it need not also be specifically excluded.glavinich commonwealth land title ins.d.the analysis of an insurance policy,like any other contract,is guided by the mutual intent of the parties,which is found,if possible,solely in the written provisions of the contract.aiu ins.superior court cal d.the clear and explicit meaning of those provisions,as interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,controls the interpretation unless the terms are either used by the parties in a technical sense or are given special meaning by the usage of the terms.ibid.
in the present case,the provisions of the policy clearly and unambiguously do not provide coverage for theft.theft is not included among the specified and enumerated perils covered by the policy issued.see pryor state farm fire cas.d.
nor is there any merit to the argument by rios that the binder issued by whilt,her own agent,constituted the policy,as opposed to the actual policy itself.the policy binder was prepared and presented by whilt,and it mistakenly represented that the policy included special form coverage.however,whilt mistaken representation within the binder that the policy was a special form policy is for several reasons of no consequence regarding any liability by scottsdale.
the insurance code declares that an insurance binder may be deemed an insurance policy only for the purpose of proving that the insured has the insurance coverage specified in the binder.however,the statute further provides that purpose of a binder is merely to assist the insured in proving to third parties that it has coverage until the actual policy is issued.see,subd.d.and a binder is only valid for a period not exceeding days from the date of execution of the binder,or,if not specified,for that period of days,subd.c.no binder shall remain valid on or after the date that the insurance policy is issued with respect to which the binder was given.ibid.therefore,even if the binder prepared by whilt could be deemed the actual policy for a limited time,the binder expired on february,the date the actual policy was issued,and long before rios incurred her theft loss on june.
moreover,whilt mistaken representation within the binder that the policy was a special form policy can not be imputed to scottsdale or uca.as indicated by whilt deposition and a declaration by an underwriter for uca,whilt was an agent for the insured and not an agent of the insurer for the purposes in question.as specifically detailed in the producer brokerage agreement between whilt and uca,the broker whilt is not the agent of and has no authority to bind uca or any of uca authorized insurance companies,such as scottsdale,for any coverage on new or renewal business or claim thereunder.the broker also has no authority to make any changes in terms and conditions of any policy of insurance issued through uca.
indeed,put quite simply,insurance brokers such as whilt,with no binding authority,are not agents of insurance companies,but are rather independent contractors marsh mclennan of,city of los angeles d,italics added.consistent with the general rule that a broker has no binding authority and is as a matter of law not a general agent for the insurer,the insurance code specifies that an insurance broker is a person who,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transacts insurance other than life insurance with,but not on behalf of,an insurer,italics added see also.here,the insurer actually issued the policy quoted to whilt in the counteroffer,and it did so up
