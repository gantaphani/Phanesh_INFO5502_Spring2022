lexington insurance company lexington sought a declaratory judgment in the district court that it is not liable for payment of a medical malpractice claim against its insured,western pennsylvania hospital west penn,because west penn notified lexington of the claim more than a year and a half after the policy period ended.the district court found for lexington,determining that the claim was governed by lexington excess coverage provision created by endorsement of the policy,which provides,coverage and that the policy required west penn to notify lexington of any claims before the close of the policy period,which it failed to do.
west penn relies on endorsement,which provided that the lexington policy would apply immediately over the coverage limit of the pennsylvania cat fund described infra.west penn contends that endorsement and endorsement are mutually exclusive,such that,where,as here,the cat fund took responsibility for paying the underlying claim,the notice provisions contained in lexington occurrence permits a more flexible time limit for reporting claims than under endorsement apply instead of endorsement notice provisions.the district court,however,rejected west penn argument that endorsement superseded endorsement,and held that west penn failure to timely report the claim relieves lexington of liability under the terms of the policy.for the reasons that follow,we agree with the district court that the two endorsements are complementary and not exclusive,and that endorsement time bar applies.
in view of this conclusion,this appeal turns on whether west penn gave lexington notice of the claim during the policy period.west penn general counsel admitted that she did not report the lieb claim until february,well after the policy period,and the first correspondence in the record between west penn and lexington regarding the lieb claim is a letter dated february.nevertheless,west penn relies on an internal lexington document,called an hpl create sheet,which contained a notation that arguably suggests that west penn reported the medical malpractice claim to lexington during the policy period.while we find this document to be barely admissible evidence,notwithstanding strong objections to it on authentication and hearsay grounds,we conclude that its probative value is too slight to enable west penn to survive summary judgment.
neither is west penn notice contention supported by the speculative affidavit and deposition testimony of west penn general counsel,karen barringer,who merely assumed that lexington had been made aware of the claim.this absence of evidence,coupled with the concession of west penn general counsel that west penn did not provide notice during the policy period,compels the conclusion that a reasonable jury could not find compliance with the notice requirement.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of lexington.
factual and procedural background 
on may,elizabeth and harry lieb filed a medical malpractice claim in state court against west penn,alleging that,eleven years earlier,the lieb daughter,kathryn,suffered brain damage as a result of west penn negligent delay in performing a caesarean section.west penn submitted a notice of claim to its primary professional liability insurer,phico insurance company phico,under the terms of its policy.phico provided west penn with institutional professional liability coverage for medical incident claims made against west penn and reported to phico between january,and january,the phico policy.
the phico policy was a policy,which provided coverage for any claim actually reported during the policy period,even if the incident occurred in prior years.see paul fire marine ins.barry,d.the phico policy states that it will pay for damages caused by a medical incident which occurs on or after the initial effective date and for which claim is reported to company during the policy period.emphasis added.
phico,however,did not ultimately pay the lieb claim because it referred the matter to the medical professional liability catastrophe fund the cat fund,which is governed by the pennsylvania health care services malpractice act.stat.ann.et.when a claim is made against a health care provider more than four years after the incident giving rise to the claim,the cat fund takes responsibility,in the place of a primary insurer,for defending the claim and for indemnifying the health care provider for the first one million dollars.such claims are commonly referred to as claims.because the lieb claim was asserted more than four years after the occurrence giving rise to it,the cat fund assumed phico responsibility for defending west penn in the ensuing litigation.as it emerged,however,the damages resulting from the lieb claim exceeded the one million dollars of cat fund coverage.
during this same period,lexington provided two types of coverage to west first,it provided liability coverage on an occurrence basis as set forth in lexington policy form lexington occurrence policy.in contrast to a policy,an occurrence policy provides coverage if the incident giving rise to the claim occurred during the policy period,regardless of when the claim is ultimately brought against the insured,provided the claim is reported to the insurer as soon as practicable.see city of harrisburg int l surplus lines ins,aff opinion cir.
second,lexington provided excess coverage for medical professional liability over and above the primary insurer policy limits lexington excess policy.this expansion of coverage was effected by endorsement which provided excess coverage to west penn on proof that it had purchased primary medical liability coverage.this excess policy was,by its terms,coverage,meaning that the lexington policy incorporated the terms and conditions of the primary phico policy for medical malpractice claims.as mentioned above,the phico policy extended coverage to claims that were both made and reported during the policy period,even if the injury occurred prior to the policy period.because the lieb claim exceeded the coverage limits under the cat fund and the phico policy,lexington excess policy was implicated.
endorsement of the lexington policy provided,in relevant part 
medical professional form 
provides read carefully 
insuring agreement professional liability coverage 
insofar as coverage is available to the insured in the underlying insurance as set forth in the schedule of underlying insurance,this policy applies to liability arising out of medical incidents.all of the terms and conditions of said underlying insurance shall apply to this insuring agreement except as otherwise expressly stated herein.
the dispute on appeal arises out terms of endorsement and the interplay between endorsement and endorsement,described below.
the lexington policy expired on december.on the last day of the phico and lexington policy period,west penn advised lexington of claims,but lexington contends that the lieb claim was not among those discussed.lexington submits that west penn did not give notice of the lieb claim until february,more than a year after the policy ended.as west penn failed to notify lexington of the lieb claim until after the policy terminated,lexington asserts it should not be required to cover the claim.
lexington filed suit against west penn seeking a declaratory judgment that it could deny coverage for the lieb claim.on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for lexington.the district court held that the lexington insurance policy was unambiguous in requiring west penn to provide notice of medical malpractice claims during the policy period,as required by endorsement,language.because the court found that west penn had conceded that it did not report the lieb claim to lexington until february,it held as a matter of law that lexington was not required to cover the claim.west penn timely moved for reconsideration,which was denied.
west penn appeals the district court grant of summary judgment,asserting that the lexington policy did not require notice of the claim to be given during the life of the policy and alternatively,that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether west penn gave lexington notice prior to december.we describe the basis for jurisdiction and our standard of review in the margin 
ii.was west penn required to give notice during the policy period 
west penn disputes that it was required to give notice to lexington during the policy period.as this is a diversity case,we must apply pennsylvania law to interpret the lexington policy.under pennsylvania law,the interpretation of an insurance contract is a matter of law for the court.madison constr.harleysville mut.ins.where a provision of a policy is ambiguous,the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer,the drafter of the agreement.where,however,the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous,a court is required to give effect to that language.id.quoting gene harvey builders,pennsylvania mfrs.ass n,ins.contractual language is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.id.quoting hutchison sunbeam coal.
west penn primary argument is that endorsement provision does not apply to the lieb claim because the cat fund substituted for phico in this case.west penn first points to the portion of endorsement that provides,i nsofar as coverage is available to the insured in the underlying insurance,to argue that endorsement provision only applies when the underlying medical malpractice claim is actually paid by the primary policy.west penn contends that since the cat fund assumed responsibility for the lieb claim,coverage was not available under the phico policy,and thus endorsement does not apply.
additionally,west penn points to endorsement,which it contends renders endorsement,and thus terms of the phico policy,inapplicable to claims like the lieb claim.endorsement,entitled coverage claims,provides 
in the event underlying insurance shall not be applicable to any claim for the reason that the cat fund shall assume or be required to assume primary responsibility for payment,coverage under this policy as to such claim shall apply as excess immediately over the limit of liability of the cat fund.
all other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
west penn argues that endorsement and endorsement are mutually exclusive provisions,such that,where the cat fund assumes responsibility for payment,the notice provisions contained in lexington occurrence policy,rather than phico notice requirements,should control.
condition f of the form,see supra note,sets forth the notice provisions for lexington occurrence policy.entitled duties in the event of an occurrence,claim or suit,condition f states that west penn must notify lexington as soon as practicable of an occurrence which may result in a claim under this policy.relying on condition f,west penn contends that it was required to report the lieb claim as soon as practicable,rather than during the policy period,as would have been required under the phico policy.
lexington responds that endorsement and are complementary,not exclusive,and that the policy must be read as a whole so as to give effect to both endorsements.in lexington submission,the purpose of endorsement was to provide medical professional liability coverage to west penn so long as west penn purchased primary coverage.endorsement,it is contended,served a different purpose it recognized that claims,like the lieb claim,are particularly susceptible to drop down coverage disputes because the indemnity available from the cat fund may be less than the underlying policy limits endorsement avoids this problem by providing that coverage under this policy as to such claim will apply as excess immediately over the limit of liability of the cat fund it does not,however,negate the policy requirements applicable to medical professional liability coverage.
the district court found lexington arguments persuasive,holding 
although the court agrees that endorsement requires lexington to provide umbrella coverage to west penn for liability over the cat fund limit,nothing in endorsement suggests that endorsement is ineffective when endorsement is implicated.contrary to west penn claims,these two endorsements are complementary.endorsement requires lexington to provide excess professional liability coverage while endorsement makes explicit that lexington remains liable for coverage even if the cat fund supplants phico as underlying insurer.
in support of this conclusion,the district court also reasoned that of condition f occurrence language,which permits reporting a claim as soon as practicable of an occurrence which may result in the claim under this policy,would be inconsistent with the follow form,claims made language in endorsement and the phico policy,which would clearly require reporting during the policy period.
we agree with the district court that the logical reading of the lexington policy is to find endorsement and to be complementary rather than mutually exclusive.first,we look to the plain language of endorsement.see reliance ins.moessner,cir if the terms of the policy are clear and unambiguous,the general rule in pennsylvania is to give effect to the plain language of the agreement.endorsement is titled medical professional form and it states in all capital letters provides read carefully.this provision makes clear that medical malpractice coverage was provided in a,fashion.
moreover,endorsement states that any exceptions to this coverage would need to be expressly stated.endorsement does not appear to constitute such an express exception to endorsement,given that endorsement does not directly mention endorsement or its notice requirement,nor does endorsement clearly implicate the terms of endorsement.thus,the absence of an express exception in endorsement bolsters reading endorsement and as complementary rather than mutually exclusive.see.of transp.manor mines,e ffect must be given to all provisions in the contract.
second,it would strain both logic and insurance industry practice to extend condition f as soon as practicable notice provision to claims like the lieb claim.as the district court recognized,condition f clearly speaks in terms of,not,coverage.lexington policy form provides only coverage,which is clearly inapplicable to the lieb claim,where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred in or,well before the effective date of the lexington policy.thus,lexington persuasively argues,west penn proffered interpretation renders endorsement nonsensical because the remaining lexington policy terms and conditions would not provide coverage for the lieb indeed any claim assumed by the cat fund.that is because,by its very nature,the cat fund only covers claims that occur more than four years prior to the claim,while an occurrence policy covers only those incidents that occur during the policy period.
to extend condition f notice provisions to a claim that occurred eleven years prior to the policy period would make little sense given the important differences in the role played by and policies for both the insurer and the insured.we have noted the importance of these distinctions 
notice provisions serve different purposes in occurrence and policies.in an occurrence policy,notice provisions are included to help the insurer investigate,settle,and defend claims they do not define coverage by contrast,the event that invokes coverage under a claims made policy is transmittal of notice of the claim to the insurance carrier thus,an extension of the notice period in a claims made policy constitutes an expansion of coverage,gratis,resulting in the insurance company exposure to a risk substantially broader than that expressly insured against in the policy.
policies are less expensive because underwriters can calculate risks more precisely since exposure ends at a fixed point.extension of time periods would significantly increase both the risk to insurers and the cost to insureds.if the potential exposure period is extended policies must necessarily become more expensive.
american cas.continisio,cir quoting zuckerman national union fire ins,internal citations omitted.by providing coverage for medical professional liability,endorsement establishes a category of coverage not available under lexington occurrence policy because policies do not cover claims,like the lieb claim,where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred before the policy period.
furthermore,under west penn proposed interpretation of the policy,endorsement would expand the coverage under lexington occurrence policy to claims that occurred more than four years prior to the policy date and would allow west penn to report such claims after the policy period.such an expansion of coverage would give west penn the best of both the occurrence and worlds when it comes to claims.the language of endorsements and does not support this result.
in contrast to west penn strained reading of endorsement,we note endorsement obvious and significant purposes to ensure that the excess policy would still apply in the event that the cat fund assumed liability,and to prevent a dispute in the event that the cat fund payment limits are lower than phico policy limits.indeed,west penn does not address what appears to be the operative portion of endorsement,which provides that coverage under this policy as to such claim shall apply as excess immediately over the limit of liability of the cat fund.thus,the district court interpretation is the most logical reading of the policy endorsement purpose is simply to make clear that the excess coverage will apply in the event the cat fund takes responsibility for payment of a claim 
notwithstanding this conclusion,we acknowledge the facial appeal of west penn argument that the introductory phrases of endorsements and render the endorsements mutually exclusive.endorsement states that it applies only i nsofar as coverage is available in the underlying insurance.endorsement,on the other hand applies i n the event the underlying insurance shall not be applicable to any claim for reason that the cat fund shall assume or be required to assume primary responsibility for payment west penn contends that,where the cat fund assumes responsibility for payment,endorsement must not apply,because if endorsement applied even when the primary insurer did not actually pay the claim,the phrase i nsofar as coverage is available would be stripped of meaning.
in response,lexington notes that the language of the two phrases differs endorsement uses the word available while endorsement uses the word applicable.lexington contends that the phico policy may be generally available even in situations where such insurance is not applicable to a specific claim because the cat fund took over responsibility for paying that claim.lexington provides several other examples of when the phico policy would be available but not applicable to a specific claim,such as where the medical liability arose out of a criminal act or where phico did not have to pay because of its exhaustion limits.this reading highlights the important principle of pennsylvania contract law,which requires courts to give effect to all of the language of the agreement whenever possible.see manor mines,at.particularly in light of the foregoing discussion and the difficulties inherent in west penn approach,we accept lexington distinction between the terms available and applicable,and find endorsement to govern the notice requirement for claims.
lastly,west penn argues that even if the district court interpretation was reasonable,the agreement was ambiguous,and under pennsylvania law,ambiguities should be resolved in favor of coverage.as we have explained,however,we do not believe the policy is ambiguous as to the notice requirements under the policy.see america,ellwood group,cir a contract is not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not agree on the proper construction.quoting duquesne light westinghouse,cir.therefore,we hold that west penn was required to abide by the phico policy notice provisions,which required west penn to report the lieb claim during the policy period 
iii.was notice given to lexington during the policy period 
west penn argues that even if the lexington policy required notice of the lieb claim to be given during the policy year,there is a genuine issue of material fact whether west penn gave lexington notice prior to december.the district court did not engage this argument,stating only that west penn concedes that it did not report the lieb claim to lexington until february.
there is certainly evidence to support the district court supposition that west penn conceded its failure to report the lieb claim during the policy period.west penn general counsel,paula hooper,admitted in her affidavit that she did not provide notice until february.moreover,the first written communication in the record that mentions the lieb claim is a letter from the hooper to lexington dated february.
west penn,however,points to two pieces of evidence which it contends establish a genuine issue that the lieb claim was reported during the policy period an internal lexington document,called an hpl create sheet,and the deposition testimony of west penn assistant general counsel,karen barringer.
a.the hpl create sheet 
the hpl create sheet consists of a printed form,which has been filled out with handwritten notations,providing information such as the name of the insured,the claimant,the policy number,and a space for description of the loss.the form is dated august,and specifically refers to the lieb claim.the key portion of the form,for our purposes,is a entry which originally read date of loss.that phrase has been crossed out and date of rpt is handwritten.
the only evidence in the record regarding the nature and purpose of this document is the deposition testimony of denzil white,an employee of a lexington affiliate,aig technical services aigts,who had been responsible for assembling documents produced in response to west penn discovery requests.white testified as follows 
q.what is an hpl create sheet 
it used by the department to get information about the claim and policy information to create the claim on our system.
q.this is the cover sheet that you use to give to your data processing people so that they would open files in toolkit and lms is that right 
do you complete these 
q.these are completed by the director,to your knowledge 
to my knowledge,yes.
can you identify this handwriting as the handwriting of ruane 
a i am not sure.
do you have any reason to believe that rpt does not signify report 
i do know what it means.
have you made any inquiry of anybody to determine who wrote that and what it means 
do you see the date at the top 
q.that is august,is it not 
do you have any reason to believe that that is anything other than the date that this document was drafted and placed in your files 
i am not sure.
as a threshold matter,lexington claims that the hpl create sheet is inadmissible either because it can not be properly authenticated or because it is hearsay and not within any exception to the hearsay rule.we find,however,that the document is likely to be admissible.nevertheless,the probative value of this document is insufficient to withstand summary judgment.
authentication 
while the point is extremely close,we conclude that the hpl create sheet meets the minimal requirements for authentication under federal rule of evidence a.rule a states the requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.we have repeatedly noted that t he burden of proof for authentication is slight.mcqueeney wilmington trust,cir see also link of north america,cir.in link,we elaborated on the standard for authentication of documents 
t he showing of authenticity is not on a par with more technical evidentiary rules,such as hearsay exceptions,governing admissibility.rather,there need be only a prima facie showing,to the court,of authenticity,not a full argument on admissibility.once a prima facie case is made,the evidence goes to the jury and it is the jury who will ultimately determine the authenticity of the evidence,not the court.the only requirement is that there has been substantial evidence from which they could infer that the document was authentic.
at applying this standard,in united states mcglory,cir,we held that handwritten notes met rule standard for authentication even though a handwriting expert could not definitely determine that the notes were in the defendant writing,finding that the circumstantial evidence linking the notes to the defendant was sufficient.for example,we relied on the fact that the notes were found in the trash outside the defendant residence,some of the notes were on paper from a notebook found in defendant home,and the contents of the notes were consistent with defendant use of initials and other code words.id.at.
when we combine white testimony with the circumstantial evidence of the authenticity of the document,in particular the fact that it was produced by lexington pursuant to discovery requests,we believe that there is a sufficient foundation for a jury to determine that this document is what it is purported to be a lexington hpl create sheet.see mcqueeney,at t he fact that the copies were produced by the plaintiff in answer to an explicit discovery request for his sea service records,while not dispositive on the issue of authentication,is surely probative.in re japanese prods.antitrust,cir,rev on other grounds,d the exhibits have the appearance,content,and substance typical of board minutes.they were produced by the defendants pursuant to a discovery order in this proceeding.they come from a source where such minutes are likely to be kept no more evidence was needed to establish a prima facie case of authenticity than the record contains.citations omitted see also burgess premier,cir holding that evidence found in defendant warehouse was adequately authenticated simply by its being found there.
while it is troubling to us that the author of the handwritten notations remains unknown,and that white could not be sure of correct date,there does not appear to be any genuine dispute that the hpl create sheet was filled out by a lexington employee for the purpose for which this sheet is typically used,to search for data on a claim.
the real controversy between the parties on this issue relates to what the document purports to be or more particularly,what it tends to prove.in lexington submission,the document is evidence only of the hpl create sheet itself,not at all proof that west penn reported the lieb claim to lexington during the policy period.but for authentication purposes,rule a does not require the document to be probative of a particular fact,but requires only that there be sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the document is what its proponent claims it to be.see in re japanese prods.antitrust,at focusing on the limited question of genuineness to establish authenticity under rule.because we agree that the hpl create sheet is what it purports to lexington internal document used to retrieve information regarding conclude that the authentication requirement is satisfied.
lexington submits that,even if the document can be authenticated,it is hearsay and does not fall into any exception to the hearsay rule under the federal rules of evidence.hearsay is an statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.c.we have doubts,however,that the declaration in handwritten words date of rpt constitutes a statement under the hearsay rule.a statement is defined as an oral or written assertion.a.the advisory committee notes clarify that nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one.a advisory committee note.
white stated that the purpose of the hpl create sheet is to request information about a claim from the data processing department.in this sense,the information on the hpl create sheet is more in the nature of an inquiry than an assertion.courts have held that questions and inquiries are generally not hearsay because the declarant does not have the requisite assertive intent,even if the question convey s an implicit message or provides information about the declarant assumptions or beliefs.long,see also united states lewis,cir while assertion is not defined in the rule,the term has the connotation of a positive declaration.the questions asked by the unknown caller,like most questions and inquiries,are not hearsay because they do not,and were not intended to,assert anything.citation omitted see also weinstein federal evidence ed.
for example,in long,the circuit held that an unidentified caller inquiry into whether keith still had any stuff was not hearsay despite the clear inference from this statement that keith in fact had stuff or that,more generally,keith was involved in drug distribution.at.in united states jackson,cir,the panel determined that the question is this kenny was not hearsay under rule a and c.the court held that,even though it might be possible to imply that the declarant believed kenny was in possession of the pager and therefore he was the person responding to the declarant message t he mere fact that the declarant conveyed a message with her question does not make the question hearsay.id.at.
in this case,white deposition suggests that the hpl create sheet is an inquiry into whether the data processing department can find information on a claim based on certain criteria.notwithstanding the fact that this inquiry could reveal assumptions the declarant might have made about the lieb particular that the date of report was december,can infer from the hpl create sheet purpose that the declarant was not making an assertion,but rather was asking a question,which does not constitute hearsay under rule a and c therefore,because we find that the hpl create sheet ultimately could be rendered admissible under the federal rules of evidence,it can be used to oppose lexington summary judgment motion note,supra.
genuine issue of material fact 
notwithstanding the hpl create sheet likely admissibility,this document can not preclude summary judgment because it has such minimal probative value that it could not be a basis on which a jury could find that west penn had in fact reported the lieb claim on or before december.white,who provides the only evidence in the record dealing with this document,could not discern the meaning of the notations on the hpl create sheet,identify the person who filled out the form,or even verify that the report was created on the date listed at the top of the form.without further information about this form and the notations,a factfinder could not reasonably draw any inference from this document.
more specifically,white testified that the purpose of the document is to retrieve information about a claim from the data processing department.the purpose is not,for example,to record the date of report or other information about the is merely a search tool.as noted above,while the fact that the hpl create sheet is in the nature of an inquiry,rather than assertion,renders it admissible as not hearsay,this same fact also diminishes the probative value of the information on the sheet because,viewing the notation as an inquiry,it can not be used to prove that the date of report was in fact december.see united states oguns,cir a question can not be used to show the truth of the matter asserted headley tilghman,cir viewing a question as providing circumstantial evidence of the assumptions underlying the question,but not as probative of the truth of the items inquired about.
there is no evidence of why this unknown employee used december,as the inquiry date,or whether this employee had any basis for using such date other than the fact that this was the last day of the policy period.additionally,the hpl create sheet is dated august,long after the end of the policy period.thus,we agree with lexington that,even viewing this document and white testimony in the light most favorable to west penn,the evidence shows at most that,more than a year and a half after the policy period,an unknown lexington employee filled out the hpl create sheet to search for information about the lieb claim using december,as the report date.
while we may not weigh evidence at the summary judgment stage,we further note that,pitted against this cryptic document,is the affidavit of west penn general counsel conceding that she notified lexington of the lieb claim on february,than a year and a half after the policy period ended.her february,letter makes no reference to prior communications between west penn and lexington,and simply provides a report of the claim.in light of this admission,and without any other information about this document,we do not believe a jury could reasonably rely on the hpl create sheet to find that west penn in fact reported the claim prior to december.we therefore conclude that this document is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to when west penn reported the lieb claim.
deposition and affidavit of karen barringer 
west penn next points to the deposition testimony and affidavit of karen barringer,who served as west penn assistant general counsel during the relevant period.west penn asserts that her testimony could establish that west penn provided lexington with notice of the lieb claim at the claims meeting.
barringer deposition testimony was as follows 
i know that lexington had the loss runs.i know that the loss the claim was reported to phico and then to the cat fund in of.and i would find it hard to believe that it did make it to the loss runs,and i have to make the assumption that they had information about that claim from at least that source,and potentially others that i do remember 
q.other than the phico loss runs that were presented,was there any other information that was presented to lexington with respect to claims made to phico a t the claims conference,at any other point during the policy period 
i am very comfortable that we touched on it at the claims conference.i would assume there are or were correspondence keeping lexington apprised of cases as they were developing.but i do specifically recall any piece of correspondence or any snippet of a conversation that i may have had.
barringer affidavit stated,
while i have no specific recollection of a discussion of the lieb claims at the lexington claim review meeting,there were no questions for which responses were outstanding on december.i provided lexington with all claim information that its claims staff requested at the meeting,including any information that lexington may have requested regarding the lieb claims.
we disagree with west penn that this evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact.barringer admitted in both her deposition and her affidavit that she had no specific recollection of reporting or discussing the lieb claim.her belief that the claim was reported was predicated on her assumption that the claim was included in the loss runs which she provided to lexington at the claims meeting.
while barringer deposition testimony that she touched on the lieb claim at a claims conference appears at first blush to make this a close issue,and while juries often do resolve such conflicts in testimony,we agree with lexington that this testimony is too speculative to defeat lexington motion for summary judgment.see hedberg indiana bell,cir speculation does not create a genuine issue of fact instead,it creates a false issue,the demolition of which is a primary goal of summary judgment.see also adler stores,cir finding no genuine issue of material fact as to whether employer had knowledge of a sexual harassment incident where plaintiff could not remember when or exactly what was said in her discussion with her supervisor 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that west penn has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the date of notice hence,the district court appropriately determined as a matter of law that notice was not given during the claims period.
iv.conclusion 
as we have determined that west penn was required to give notice during the policy period,and as there is no genuine issue of material fact that timely notice was given,we will affirm the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of lexington.
contrary to the majority view,i believe that endorsement of the lexington insurance company lexington policy is inapplicable in this matter and that western pennsylvania hospital west penn is entitled to excess coverage under the terms of that policy.under those terms,where a claim,such as the lieb claim,is not covered by west penn primary insurer phico,but is instead covered by the medical professional liability catastrophe fund the cat fund,the default notice provisions of the lexington policy apply.under those notice provisions,west penn gave timely notice.alternatively,even assuming that the majority construction of the contract is correct,i believe west penn has created a genuine dispute as to whether notice was timely given.i therefore respectfully dissent.
the central question here is whether west penn was required to give lexington notice of the lieb claim by december,pursuant to endorsement,or within a reasonable time,pursuant to endorsement and lexington default notice requirements.if west penn is right that endorsement does not apply,then under pennsylvania rule,lexington may not refuse coverage unless it was prejudiced by late notice.see brakeman potomac ins.as lexington concedes it was not prejudiced,west penn would be entitled to coverage.
the interplay between endorsement,endorsement,and the cat fund is critical to the notice issue.as the majority explains,if west penn failed to notify lexington of the lieb claim within the policy period january,to january,lexington may refuse coverage if and only if endorsements and are with respect to claims like the lieb claim.lexington may not refuse coverage if those endorsements are alternatives to one another,if endorsement applies only to phico claims and not to claims.
the plain language of the two endorsements at issue here clearly favors west.endorsement applies where coverage is available to the insured in the underlying insurance as set forth in the schedule of underlying insurance.in other words,endorsement would apply if the phico policy were available to west.endorsement applies i n the event underlying insurance shall not be applicable to any claims for the reason that the medical professional liability catastrophe fund cat fund shall assume or be required to assume primary responsibility for payment.that is,if the cat fund assumes responsibility for a claim,as it does here for the lieb claim,then endorsement,not endorsement,applies endorsement goes on to provide that the terms of the lexington policy are otherwise unchanged.on its face,the lexington policy in no way invokes the reporting requirements of the phico policy with respect to claims.as such,the pennsylvania rule applies,and since lexington concedes it can not show prejudice,it must provide west penn with coverage.
the majority asserts that endorsements and are complementary,largely on the grounds that both phico and claims are,rather than.as such,the majority reasons that it would be illogical to apply the default notice provisions of the lexington policy to claims because those provisions are intended to apply to the otherwise coverage of the lexington policy.
the majority is right in its assumption that the cat fund operates on a model.pennsylvania law provides that i n the event that any claim is made against a qualified health care provider more than four years after the breach of contract or tort occurred which is filed within the statute of limitations,such claims shall be defended and paid by the fund.stat.ann.tit.in,the statute was amended to trigger coverage only if the fund has received a written request for indemnity and defense within days of the date on which notice of the claim is given to the health care provider or his insurer.id.this reporting requirement,consistent with traditional policies,is not subject to the brakeman rule.see.med.soc.liab.ins.commonwealth of.med.prof l liab.catastrophe loss fund.
the majority is also right that policies almost always predicate coverage on reporting of a claim by the insured to the insurer within the policy period.a insurance policy represents a distinct exchange between insurer and insured.see pizzini am.int l specialty li
