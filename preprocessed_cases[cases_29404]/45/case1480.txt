in this diversity action for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay an insurance claim,bluewood,appeals the judgment of the district court entered on a jury verdict against the cincinnati insurance company cincinnati.although the jury found in favor of bluewood,it did not award any damages beyond the that cincinnati had already paid on bluewood insurance claim.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
bluewood is the managing agent of the broadmoor apartment complex in jefferson city,missouri,and the beneficiary of an insurance policy issued by cincinnati that covered broadmoor against enumerated losses,including certain types of water damage.on the morning of december,james cain and steve sweeten,the maintenance staff at broadmoor,learned that water was running under the door of a apartment in building upon opening the door,cain and sweeten saw water falling from the ceiling and running down the walls.at least four inches of water had accumulated on the floor.cain and sweeten shut off the water and electricity to building c,whose eight units were vacant,and proceeded to check the building other seven apartments.later that day,cain and sweeten discovered a similar problem in building b,which had five vacant units and three units with tenants who had left their apartments unattended from december to december.
after cain and sweeten located the sources of the burst pipe in one of the apartments in each started to execute an improvised plan to dry the apartments.first,cain and sweeten used a squeegee to push standing water out the front doors of several apartments.next,cain and sweeten removed the carpets and underlay pads in the apartments that had been saturated with water.this task occupied much of cain and sweeten time for at least four days and perhaps as long as a week.during that period,a member of broadmoor staff rented six fans and at least one dehumidifier,which cain and sweeten used in the wet apartments on a rotating basis.in addition,cain and sweeten attempted to accelerate the drying process by cycling each apartment heating and air conditioning units and opening windows when weather conditions seemed favorable.eventually,cain and sweeten noticed mold growing in some of the apartments that had been exposed to water.
neither cain nor sweeten had any experience or expertise in the field of water what both parties sometimes refer to as water remediation.yet in the weeks that followed this incident,bluewood did not hire a professional to assist cain and sweeten.
in late december or early january,john morrissey,bluewood president,called john rowe,the insurance agent who sold bluewood the cincinnati policy that covered broadmoor.while the substance of this conversation is disputed,its result is clear rowe did not contact cincinnati to file a claim at that time.on january,a representative from bluewood home office in louis visited broadmoor to inspect the damage to buildings b and c.the next day,rowe submitted a loss notice form to cincinnati,thereby indicating that bluewood intended to file a claim.
cincinnati and bluewood each hired insurance adjusters to estimate the value of the loss in terms of the cost to remediate or replace the damaged property within buildings b and c at broadmoor.cincinnati adjuster reached an estimate of,excluding the cost of mold remediation,which cincinnati insisted was not covered under the policy.bluewood adjuster reached an estimate of,which included the cost of at least some mold remediation.these competing estimates reflected differences in the adjusters conclusions about the extent of the damage as well as a broader disagreement between cincinnati and bluewood over the question whether bluewood complied with its contractual obligation to mitigate its damages.
cincinnati paid bluewood.shortly thereafter,bluewood exercised its right under the policy to demand an appraisal of the loss.although cincinnati and bluewood each selected one of the two appraisers,who then agreed on an umpire,bluewood objected to cincinnati proposed agreement for submission to appraisal.in turn,cincinnati filed this action in federal court,seeking a declaration that the policy appraisal provision allowed cincinnati to deny bluewood claim for additional damages,notwithstanding the result of the proposed appraisal.bluewood raised five counterclaims,asserting,among other things,that cincinnati had breached its contractual obligations and that cincinnati refusal to pay bluewood insurance claim was vexatious and unreasonable.when the parties agreed that their central dispute was over the amount of damages,the district court decided to treat the case as a diversity action for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay an insurance claim.in effect,bluewood became the plaintiff and cincinnati the defendant.
after a trial held in september,the jury returned a verdict in favor of bluewood,but it did not award any damages beyond the that cincinnati had already paid.the district court denied bluewood motion for a new trial.bluewood appeals,asking this court to vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
ii.discussion 
bluewood primary argument on appeal is that the district court applied the wrong measure of damages to the loss at broadmoor.according to bluewood,the district court error caused it to deliver a defective instruction to the jury and to improperly exclude expert testimony from one of bluewood proposed witnesses.

the parties agree that missouri law governs this case thus,we consider the missouri supreme court interpretation of missouri law to be authoritative.see paul fire marine ins.schrum,cir.if the missouri supreme court has not yet spoken on a particular issue,we must predict its decision by examining relevant state precedent,analogous decisions,considered dicta,and any other reliable data.lindsay hartford accident indem,cir alteration in original quoting ventura titan sports,cir.
under missouri law,if an insurance policy is unambiguous,it will be enforced as written,unless a statute or public policy requires a different result.peters employers mut.cas.in this case,the insurance policy provisions concerning the valuation of a loss are unambiguous namely,the policy provides that cincinnati will determine the value of covered property according to the property actual cash value at the time of the loss.the policy later defines actual cash value as replacement cost less a deduction that reflects depreciation,age,condition and obsolescence.accordingly,the district court gave the following instruction instruction to the jury 
if you find in favor of bluewood,on its insurance claim you must award bluewood,such sum as you may find from the evidence to be the actual cash value of the damaged property.
actual cash value as used in this instruction means the cost to replace the damaged property less a deduction that reflects depreciation,age,condition and obsolescence,if any.
bluewood contends that the unambiguous terms of the policy should not have been enforced as written because section of the missouri revised statutes sets a different measure of damages.section provides 
whenever there is a partial destruction or damage to property covered by insurance,it shall be the duty of the party writing the policies to pay the assured a sum of money equal to the damage done to the property,or repair the same to the extent of such damage,not exceeding the amount written in the policy,so that said property shall be in as good condition as before the fire,at the option of the insured.
emphasis added.the missouri supreme court has held that the amount of a cash payment equal to the damage done to the property is to be determined by the difference in value of the property immediately before and immediately after the loss.wells.prop.ins.placement facility.thus,bluewood made an offer of proof that the difference in the fair market value of buildings b and c at broadmoor was.this figure substantially exceeded both cincinnati and bluewood estimates of the cost to remediate or replace the damaged property within those buildings and,respectively.
the district court concluded that section applies only to cases involving losses caused by fire.as a result,the district court gave instruction,which established that the measure of damages under the policy was the cost to replace the damaged property within buildings b and c at broadmoor less a potential deduction for depreciation,age,condition and obsolescence rather than the difference in the fair market value of the damaged buildings.over bluewood objection,the district court also excluded expert testimony from david nunn regarding the fair market value of broadmoor before and after the loss.bluewood maintains that these decisions constituted prejudicial errors because the provision of section supplies the measure of damages in cases involving losses caused by water or any other covered risk.the missouri supreme court has not announced whether section applies to losses caused by risks other than fire,so we are left to predict how it would resolve this issue.
we begin with the text of the statute.see state ex rel.burns whittington,the primary rule of statutory interpretation is to give effect to legislative intent as reflected in the plain language of the statute.bluewood argues that we should read the disjunctive or as separating section into two independent clauses.on this view,the first clause establishes a option that applies to losses caused by any risk,and the second clause establishes a option that applies only to losses caused by fire.
this argument has some surface appeal,for c anons of construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings.reiter sonotone,d.moreover,the grammatical rule of the last antecedent holds that a limiting clause or phrase here,as before the fire should ordinarily be read as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immediately follows here,the option.barnhart thomas,d.but neither of these rules is absolute.see id.noting that the rule of the last antecedent can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning reiter,at.noting an exception to the rule of the disjunctive or where the context dictates otherwise.
more than any grammatical considerations,the phrase appearing at the end of section at the option of the insured informs the meaning of the statute two principal clauses.in this context,option implies a choice between two forms of compensation a cash settlement or a course of repairs.see wells,at section provides any insured with two options.he may elect either to take a cash payment or to have the insurer repair the property.we reject bluewood proposed interpretation of section because it would eliminate the insured choice in cases where the loss is caused by a risk other than fire.if the option applies only to losses caused by fire,then a cash settlement would become the exclusive option in cases,like this one,where the loss was caused by water.in practice,the phrase at the option of the insured would be transformed into at the option of the insured,except where the loss is caused by a risk other than fire.we are not convinced that the missouri supreme court would adopt an interpretation of section that produces such an incongruous result.see bachtel miller county nursing home,the provisions of a legislative act are not read in isolation but construed together,and if reasonably possible,the provisions will be harmonized with each other.instead,we predict that the missouri supreme court would harmonize the statute two principal clauses by holding that the limiting phrase as before the fire identifies the one and only type of partial destruction or damage to property covered by insurance that triggers the insured right to choose its preferred form of compensation.
bluewood argues in the alternative that we should disregard the limiting phrase as before the fire in light of the expansion of insurance coverage beyond losses caused by fire that has occurred in the years since section was enacted.on this view,both the option and the option now apply to losses caused by any covered risk.we reject bluewood alternative construction of section because it would turn the limiting phrase as before the fire into mere surplusage.notwithstanding the expansion of insurance coverage over the last years,we predict that the missouri supreme court would decline bluewood invitation to disregard part of the statutory text.see state ex rel.ssm health care louis neill,when interpreting a statute this court is required to give meaning to every word of the legislative enactment.
the parties identified four decisions in which the missouri court of appeals has mentioned that section might extend to losses caused by risks other than fire.in the first of these decisions,the court of appeals noted that the plaintiff in favor of extending section to cases involving wind theoretically correct but ultimately not dispositive because of a failure of proof.cady hartford fire ins.in the three other decisions,the court of appeals cited cady for the proposition that section might potentially apply to situations other than losses due to fire but avoided reaching the merits of the issue porter shelter mut.ins,herring prudential prop.cas.ins,lopez am.family mut.ins.bluewood argues that these snippets of dicta suggest that section does extend to losses caused by risks other than fire.we disagree.the court of appeals passing references to section merely confirm that the statute reach is an open question.the decisions on which bluewood relies do not conclusively establish the position of the court of appeals on that issue,much less the position of the missouri supreme court.
after examining the relevant authorities,we predict that the missouri supreme court would find that section applies only to cases involving losses caused by fire.contrary to bluewood proposed constructions,the most natural reading of section holds that the limiting phrase as before the fire identifies the one and only type of partial destruction or damage to property covered by insurance that triggers the insured right to choose between a cash settlement and a course of repairs.this interpretation harmonizes the statute two principal clauses and gives meaning to every word of the statutory text.consequently,we reject bluewood contention that the district court misinterpreted missouri law concerning the proper measure of damages in this case.we also reject,without further comment,bluewood derivative arguments that instruction established the wrong measure of damages and that the district court improperly excluded expert testimony from david nunn insofar as those arguments are premised on the applicability of section.
we now address bluewood remaining arguments,starting with bluewood three alternative challenges to instruction.apart from setting the measure of damages under the policy,instruction also provided that bluewood had a duty under the law to mitigate its is,to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to minimize its damages.bluewood initial contention is that the district court failed to define the term ordinary care.bluewood next asserts that the district court phrasing implied an absolute duty to abate and stop the water and mold damage at broadmoor,even if that was not scientifically possible.last,bluewood argues that the district court description of bluewood duty to mitigate its damages gave the jury a roving commission to return an unlawful verdict.
