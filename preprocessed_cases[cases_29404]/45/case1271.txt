this diversity suit over insurance coverage arises out of a suit filed in a texas state court by microtherm,a manufacturer of water heaters,against united plastics group upg.the texas suit complained about a component that upg had sold microtherm.microtherm won that case,obtaining a judgment for million.the wausau insurance company,upg primary liability insurer,brought the present suit in the federal district court in chicago against upg for a declaration that its policy does cover the judgment.wausau settled with upg,but meanwhile ohio casualty,upg excess liability insurer,had intervened in wausau suit,seeking a similar declaration.after a bench principal evidence in which,however,was simply the record of the texas district judge ruled that ohio casualty was liable on its excess policy for the damages assessed by the texas court,up to the million policy limit.other insurers had reimbursed upg for a total of million,but the judge declined to subtract that amount from the million judgment in determining ohio casualty liability to upg,on the ground that it was unclear whether any part of the million related to losses covered by ohio casualty policy.in its present posture,therefore,the case is upg versus ohio casualty,with ohio casualty the appellant,having lost in the district court.the substantive issues all agree are governed by illinois law.
in an ordinary hot water heater,a tank full of cold water is heated and the heated water piped to the premises hot water taps.microtherm,in contrast,makes a tankless water heater,which it calls the seisco.cold water enters the heater at one end,is heated as it passes through,and comes out the other end as hot water,which is piped to the hot water taps.the main component of the heater is the plastic chamber in which the water is heated.upg made the chamber out of a plastic manufactured by dupont called zytel.dupont recommended a certain temperature range for molding zytel.but upg used a significantly lower temperature and as a result the water chambers it made and sold to microtherm were defective and caused many of the water heaters that contained them to fail.
in microtherm sold water heaters containing chambers manufactured by upg.between the start of the next year and the trial in texas of microtherm suit against upg,of the water chambers ruptured,though only to ruptured while ohio casualty policy,which expired in september,was in force.the ruptures caused the heaters to stop working,generally by shorting the heater circuit board.in some instances the rupture caused the heater to leak,damaging carpets or other property on the owner premises.the various mishaps created customer dissatisfaction,leading,microtherm complained,to a big fall off in its business.the texas jury issued a special verdict in which it found that upg had knowingly misrepresented the quality of its heaters by failing to disclose that it had ignored dupont recommendations regarding the proper temperature range at which to mold the water chambers.the jury awarded damages equal to the cost to microtherm of repairing or replacing the water heaters,but that cost came to only million most of the million jury award was for lost profits resulting from customers anger at microtherm,though there was also a small award of punitive damages.
the insurance policy that ohio casualty sold to upg is a standard comprehensive general liability policy and obligates the insurer to indemnify the insured for sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law because of property damage caused by an occurrence during the policy period.property damage is defined in the policy as physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.accident is not defined,but its meaning is illuminated by the exclusion in the policy of coverage for liability based on harms that are expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.
property was damaged as a result of the defective manufacture of the water chambers.for example,the water chambers themselves were damaged when they ruptured.but damages resulting from physical damage to the insured own property are expressly excluded from coverage.ohio casualty ins.bazzi constuction,cir illinois law hamilton die cast,united states fidelity guaranty,cir same jeffrey stempel,stempel on insurance contracts,ed.the circuit boards,however,were also damaged by some of the ruptures,and they were microtherm property rather than upg.and sometimes the rupture of the water chamber caused the heater to leak onto and damage the property of the heater owner,and that was not upg property either.
even the water chambers were not its property after it sold the heaters containing them to microtherm.but that is not the test of coverage the test is whether the damaged property was the property of the insured when the defect on which the insured liability was based came into being.travelers ins.penda,cir illinois law stempel,supra.
upg manufactured only the water chamber.the rest of the heater was therefore other property and so we have the following possible causal chains between the manufacturing defect and the business losses that were the main component of the texas jury verdict water heater because the circuit board losses as customers learn about the defective heaters and turn away from microtherm water heater because the circuit board to other property of the losses when,as before,disgusted customers turn away from microtherm.in either situation the question is whether because of property damage in the comprehensive general liability policy makes the insurance company the insurer of those business losses.
as in tort law,mcpherson schlemmer,public service of indiana,bath iron works,cir dan dobbs,law on remedies,ed,so in law,once there is damage to property the victim can recover the nonproperty,including business,losses resulting from that damage and not just the diminution in the value of the property,imperial casualty indemnity high concrete structures,cir american home assurance,cir aetna casualty surety general time,cir allan windt,insurance claims and disputes,ed stempel,supra.ohio casualty argues that illinois insurance law is different,citing travelers ins.eljer.but the question in that case was not liability for consequential damages it was whether physical damage within the meaning of the policy had occurred when a defective plumbing system was installed,or not until later,when the system broke and caused damage the court held it was the latter.
a much better case for ohio casualty is viking construction management,liberty mutual ins,d.viking contracted to manage the construction of a school for a town.through the negligence of a subcontractor of viking,a wall at the construction site collapsed,causing property damage.the town sued viking for breach of contract,seeking damages just for the cost of repairing the damage,and viking sought indemnity from liberty mutual.the court held that the damages were not because of property damage within the meaning of the general comprehensive liability policy.all that the town had sought in its suit against viking was the cost of replacing the defective wall,which the court equated to a defective product supplied by viking.the town was not seeking recovery for a loss caused by damage to other property caused by the wall collapse.
the viking decision,if a sound interpretation of the cgl policy and we about to see that it is,scotches any claim that upg might have to coverage of its liability for the cost to microtherm of repairing or replacing any of the defective water chambers or any other business losses resulting from the sale of the defective heaters,as distinct from the cost of repairing the heaters damaged by the defective water chambers or other business losses resulting from that damage only the latter cost arose from damage to property other than the defective product itself.this conclusion tracks the econom
