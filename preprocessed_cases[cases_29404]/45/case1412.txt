the chicago flood of occurred when the chicago river sprung a leak and drained into a tunnel system connecting many buildings in the loop.events were set in motion in august and september,when great lakes dredge dock replaced the pilings dolphins protecting the kinzie street bridge.because of great lakes carelessness,poor maps or other directions provided by the city,or a combination of events,great lakes drove dolphins into the riverbed immediately above one of the tunnels that had been built almost a century earlier to move coal and other freight without tying up the city streets.buildings in chicago no longer burn coal,but the old tunnels have found new uses,such as carrying chilled water for air conditioning or hosting electric power and communications lines.cracks in the ceiling of the tunnel,caused by the work in the river,grew as the weeks passed.deterioration could have been stopped if the damage had been detected during inspections and the roof shored up pending repairs,but this did not happen.on april,the roof caved in and the waters of the chicago river rushed through the tunnel system,flooding basements and streets throughout downtown chicago.damage has been estimated at more than million and by some accounts more than billion.navigation on the river was halted for about a month while the tunnel was repaired.jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d,affirming cir,holds that great lakes request for limitation of liability under comes within the admiralty jurisdiction.our case concerns not the amount of liability but the allocation of responsibility among great lakes insurers.as part of a settlement the city of chicago and a class of injured parties have succeeded to great lakes rights under the policies,but for clarity we refer to great lakes as the insured.
insurance coverage could have been simple.great lakes acquires insurance to match its fiscal year,from august through july.both the damage to the tunnel and the flood occurred during one policy year.at the beginning of august great lakes was the beneficiary of three relevant policies a primary policy with a cap of million and two excess policies purchased by its corporate parent itel corporation,and on which great lakes was an additional insured a first excess policy providing million in coverage,and a second excess policy providing million in additional coverage.both of these excess policies were underwritten by a consortium that for convenience we call the london insurers.details about the participants would have been relevant and likely would have led to dismissal if jurisdiction depended on diversity of citizenship,see indiana gas home insurance,cir,but admiralty jurisdiction saved the day.things grew complicated when itel sold its subsidiary to the blackstone dredging partnership on october,the damage to the roof of the tunnel,but before the flood.the spinoff made it impossible for great lakes to remain as an additional insured on itel policies.so as part of the transaction itel and blackstone arranged for great lakes to be deleted as an insured on the first excess policy the london insurers then wrote an identical million policy naming blackstone as the insured and great lakes as an additional insured,charging exactly the premium that had been refunded to itel for the cancellation of the remaining term on the original policy.the million excess policy was canceled,but blackstone purchased a million excess policy from continental insurance.thus when the damage to the tunnel roof occurred,great lakes had million worth of excess coverage,all through the london insurers when the roof collapsed,great lakes had only million in coverage,of which million was supplied by the london insurers and million by continental.the parties call the policies in force when the dolphins were driven the policies and the policies in force when the flood occurred the policies.we follow suit.
the change in both the identity of the underwriters and the maximum coverage between the first and second periods has led to conflict.continental contended in the district court that the policies supply all of the coverage,because that is when great lakes weakened the tunnel roof.the london insurers,by contrast,contended that only the policies were triggered,because they were in force when the flood occurred.they concede that the policies cover damage to the tunnel itself,but this loss is trivial compared with the damage sustained by businesses whose basements were flooded and by the utilities that had laid cables in the tunnels.great lakes contends that all excess policies were triggered and should be the maximum indemnity is not the million or million great lakes had in force at any one time,but million,the sum of all policy limits in force in either period.the district court agreed with great lakes,issuing a declaratory judgment that the london insurers must pay up to million and continental up to million,no matter who suffered each loss and no matter when the losses occurred.the judge added that all insurers must pay prejudgment interest and that the london insurers must pay a penalty of almost million for bad faith in delaying recognition that chicago was an additional insured on the million primary policy.see d principal ruling dist.lexis,wl,order resolving remaining issues dist.lexis,wl,declaratory judgment.
only one of the policies was written out in full,but the parties agree that its language is universally applicable.thus all policies cover property damage caused by an occurrence,a term defined as 
an accident or a happening or event or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unintentionally results in property damage during the policy period.all such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises or location shall be deemed one occurrence.
the district court concluded that both the damage to the tunnel structure and the losses from flood waters are occurrences under this definition.while this case was being litigated in the district court the parties agreed that illinois law supplies the rule of decision the london insurers have changed their tune on appeal,arguing that federal law governs in an admiralty action.see continental casualty anderson excavating wrecking,cir applying federal law to an insurance dispute in admiralty.that new line of argument has been met by a claim of forfeiture.to simplify analysis we follow the parties original agreement,though with some sidelong glances at admiralty law.see kamen kemper financial services,d courts are entitled,though not required,to apply a body of law chosen by the parties even if this is not the law the court would choose on its own.
the district judge rejected as unsupported by either the policies language or illinois case law the london insurers contention that only a person who suffers injury while the policies are in effect may resort to those policies.this was the principal ground on which the london insurers sought to restrict coverage of the policies to the cost of repairing the tunnel.having concluded that all of the policies apply to all injuries,the district judge then stacked the coverage limits on two grounds first,this is what zurich insurance raymark industries,did in an asbestosis case second,the policies omit an clause found in a standard form prepared by lloyd of london.both the london insurers and continental have appealed.continental no longer argues that all liability must be borne by the london insurers,but it does oppose stacking and prejudgment interest.the london insurers object to stacking,to the use of the policies to cover flood losses,to prejudgment interest,and to the penalty.a third appeal,concerns the district judge costs award.we stayed briefing on this appeal because costs must be reconsidered in light of our disposition of the merits.we start with stacking.
stacking.great lakes argues,and the district court held,that it can pick any policy during either period and require its insurer to bear the whole loss up to the limit of liability.if this does not cover the loss,the insured names a second policy,and so on until all have been exhausted.the strategy is known variously as stacking and joint and several liability an unusual use of that phrase,but one entrenched in insurance decisions.see olin insurance of north america,cir.see also comment,allocating progressive injury liability among successive insurance policies,chi.a recent decision by this court concludes that stacking is not an appropriate response to a single tort that spans multiple policy periods.see sybron transition security insurance,cir.that would be clear enough if,for example,the tunnel had collapsed before great lakes finished driving the dolphins.all responsibility would be under the policies then in force that great lakes acquired a new corporate parent in october,and a new set of insurers,would not require those insurers to pay just because some of the victims of the tort had continuing losses,or because the losses could not be quantified until the new policy period.one occurrence,one policy.that what the definitional clause says.why should things be otherwise because the piles were driven in the first period and the roof caved in during the second in either case great lakes committed a single tort,with the same injury.so following the approach of sybron and olin,which sybron followed is incompatible with stacking.but both olin and sybron applied new york law perhaps illinois law is different.
relying on zurich insurance,the district court concluded that illinois is different.zurich insurance rejected the position taken by some courts that the sole trigger for coverage in cases occurs when the disease becomes manifest.instead,the supreme court of illinois held,the policies in force when asbestos is inhaled and when the disease becomes manifest are available for indemnity.the opinion went on to say that the limits of each policy are available,from which the district court inferred that illinois has adopted joint and several liability.but zurich insurance interpreted the language of particular policies the supreme court of illinois did not establish a principle that transcends the text of insurance contracts.at least two appellate decisions in illinois since zurich insurance have concluded that the supreme court of illinois does not require joint and several liability independent of policies language.see missouri pacific international insurance,d,outboard marine liberty mutual insurance,d.see also roman catholic diocese of joliet,interstate fire insurance,d.like the intermediate appellate courts in missouri pacific and outboard marine,we think it likely that,when squarely faced with the question,the supreme court of illinois will follow the better reasoned and more numerous decisions of other jurisdictions that make policies language the benchmark for stacking.see not only olin representing new york law but also,public service of colorado wallis,northern states power fidelity casualty,united insurance,sharon steel aetna casualty surety,utah gulf chemical metallurgical associated metals minerals,cir commercial union insurance sepco,cir.we add,for completeness,that if maritime rather than state law supplies the rule of decision,we would hold,for reasons given in olin and sybron,that stacking is inappropriate unless the policies provide for cumulation.
great lakes does not rely on any language in the london insurers or continental policies.instead it observes that the insurers could have put explicit language in their policies.the absence of such language implies,great lakes insists,that cumulation of policy limits is a coverage paid for by the premium.maybe so,although it is familiar in both contractual and legislative drafting that people,guarding against a misreading with a plenitude of negations then the absence of one possible negation is a poor reason to conclude that the text has any particular meaning.instead of seeking to draw inferences from missing language,we use more valuable clues.recall that the premium for the million policy did not change when blackstone replaced itel as great lakes parent corporation.yet if the division of the original policy into two on october,the date of its spinoff from itel raised the effective policy limit for the fiscal year to million,surely an additional premium would have been charged.there ai no such thing as a free lunch,even in the insurance business.great lakes never carried more than million of coverage at any moment,and in connection with the spinoff it cut that maximum to million.yet,if stacking is allowed,coverage went from million on october to million on october,even though the premium reflected a reduction to million.that is exceedingly unlikely.the parties transactions thus demonstrate that there is only one limit for the policy year,even though the corporate reorganization led to the creation of two policies,each in force for a shorter period.this conclusion also respects the language of the policies.they do not use the text from the model form,but they do say all such exposure to substantially the same general conditions existing at or emanating from one premises or location shall be deemed one occurrence.this means that the whole loss from the tunnel collapse is one occurrence even if parts of the injury were felt in two policy periods.thus it remains only to determine which period is the right one.
trigger and allocation.the million policy was in force the entire year,as was a million policy so for this policy it is unnecessary to determine whether the trigger falls in the first period or the second.continental no longer contests the district court conclusion that its million policy was triggered by the collapse,so continental must indemnify great lakes for any loss in the million to million band.the portion of the district court judgment providing that an excess policy,once triggered,is available from the first dollar of loss,is untenable continental need not pay until the underlying limits have been exhausted.
the only remaining question about triggering and allocation is whether the london insurers million,policy is available.in principle the answer could be yes chicago suffered a loss when its tunnel was damaged while the policies were in force.but no one thinks that it would have cost more than million or even more than million to repair the tunnel,and the policy does not come into play until all underlying policies have been exhausted.this makes it impossible to see how the policy that ended on october,could have been triggered,unless the future claims of businesses harmed by the flood are projected back into the policy period.yet in illinois,as elsewhere,an occurrence policy is not triggered unless loss to the claimant happened while that policy was in force,pekin insurance janes addems chevrolet,d,seegers grain kansas city millwright,d,great american insurance tinley park recreation commission,d.this is exactly what the policy itself provides,in direct language,by defining property damage as an accident or happening or event that results in a physical injury to tangible property during the policy period emphasis added.no loss to businesses in the loop occurred until april.
great lakes relies on cases such as zurich insurance that address occupational diseases,pollution,products liability,or other events characterized by long delay between the wrongful act and the manifestation of harm.in cases of this kind,zurich insurance held,policies in force at the time of the wrongful acts,in addition to those in force while the harm occurred and became manifest,may be triggered.see also eljer manufacturing,liberty mutual insurance,cir.the extent to which the supreme court of illinois subscribes to this principle has been called into question by travelers insurance eljer manufacturing.lexis,wl,which held in circumstances identical to our eljer decision that the installation of a defective product does not trigger coverage until the harm from the defect comes to pass.but the extent to which the supreme court of illinois subscribes to its own opinion in eljer and thus disagrees with our eljer holding from has been called into question by the grant of rehearing in that case.see.lexis.eljer has been rebriefed and reargued in the supreme court of illinois,and until a fresh decision is released state insurance law is up in the air.
waiting for that decision is unnecessary,however,because the cases such as zurich insurance and our opinion in eljer involve damage to the same property over multiple periods.here the injured persons are distinct the city suffered injury when the dolphins were driven into the tunnel ceiling during the first period,and businesses as well as the city were injured when the ceiling collapsed and the flood occurred during the second period.the definitions in the policies show that the businesses did not suffer property damage,and so there was no occurrence triggering coverage,until the collapse in april.
what is more,even after the damage to the tunnel,the loss was preventable.our problem is not at all like asbestosis,where once fibers accumulate in the lung there is nothing to do but wait and see whether disease develops.here there was a cure inspection and repair.that is to say,even after the pile driving there was still an insurable event whether a collapse would occur before the city detected the damage and repaired the tunnel.not until the second period did the city fail to take precautions that could have avoided all loss to businesses.in february while the policies were in force inspectors discovered a foot of water in the tunnel and saw cracks in its ceiling,yet failed to take steps that would have prevented the roof collapse.see in re chicago flood litigation,d.hence the occurrence is in the second period so far as the victims of the flood are concerned.the london insurers million policy therefore has not been triggered.
prejudgment interest.the district court made the london insurers and continental jointly and severally liable for more than million in prejudgment interest for delay in funding an million settlement that great lakes reached with the city and some of the injured businesses.our ruling on the stacking question requires revision of that decision in part continental can not be held jointly and severally liable.moreover,because continental policy does not come into play until the underlying limits of million have been exhausted,continental is not obliged to fund any of this settlement and can not be required to pay interest for delay.the london insurers million policy was triggered,however,and the london insurers do not dispute that they tarried in providing indemnity.
both the district court and the parties have treated prejudgment interest as a matter to be resolved under admiralty law.they do not remark the inconsistency of this approach with their resort to illinois law to determine other issues.prejudgment interest is an aspect of full compensation and therefore is available under admiralty law neither equitable considerations nor the existence of a bona fide dispute about liability affect the running of interest.see city of milwaukee cement division of national gypsum,d in re oil spill by the amoco cadiz,cir.see also,west virginia united states,d general motors devex,d.the award of interest for the delay in funding the settlement therefore is unexceptionable.
part of the award,however,reflects not delay in funding the settlement but delay in handing over the entire limits of the million policy after great lakes assigned its rights under this policy to chicago and a class of injured parties.it is not clear to us why the assignment created any obligation to pay an underlying loss still must be established.this aspect of the district judge decision seems to have been influenced by her assignment of joint and several liability with stacking out of the case the matter of interest on amounts other than the settlement needs a fresh look.nor is it clear that interest has been adequately separated from the losses.if,for example,compensation for the time value of money is built into a victim claim for damages,a separate award of prejudgment interest would be double counting.so although we agree with the district court that admiralty norm of prejudgment interest should be applied,we remand for a recalculation that is limited to eligible amounts under the million policy and does not include any interest against continental.
penalty.the primary million policy had a separate limit of million for legal expenses incurred in defense of claims made against the insured.the london insurers disbursed the policy limit of indemnity and expended the full million in legal costs on behalf of great lakes.nonetheless,the district judge ordered the london insurers to pony up an extra in indemnity and an additional in defense outlays as penalties for failure to treat chicago as an additional it was,by virtue of its contract with great lakes and a clause in the policy promising indemnity to great lakes customers.the london insurers did not tarry in recognizing their obligation to defend and indemnify great lakes,but recognizing the obligation to chicago,which was not named on the face of the policy,took additional time.because the london insurers paid out the policy limits on behalf of great lakes,chicago received none of the benefit even though it was an insured.by requiring the london insurers to provide an extra in indemnity and almost in defense expenses,the district court sought to put chicago in the position it would have occupied had the london insurers recognized that under this policy they owed to chicago the same duties they owed to great lakes.
the london insurers principal response on appeal is that the delay in responding to chicago demands for indemnity and defense should be chalked up to a series of bureaucratic errors and miscommunication among its brokers and lawyers.illinois authorizes penalties for refusals and delays by insurers,see ilcs a provision authorizing awards of attorneys fees,but negligence can not be treated as bad faith,the london insurers insist.like the district court,we find it difficult to see how the problem can be ascribed entirely to paperwork problems.the london insurers did not disburse the policy limits until april,well after they had recognized that chicago is an additional insured.cases such as travelers indemnity citgo petroleum,cir,which hold that it is not bad faith to pay the policy limits on behalf of one insured if no claim has been made by or against another,therefore do not help the london insurers.see western alliance insurance northern insurance,cir.more to the point,neither of the fifth circuit cases rests on illinois the fact that illinois does not use bad faith to describe an insurer state of mind or to distinguish between negligent and intentional wrongdoing.it is just a label applied to objectively unreasonable conduct that injures an is to say,negligence.see transport insurance post express,cir illinois law twin city fire insurance country mutual insurance,cir illinois law adduci vigilant insurance,d,kavanaugh interstate fire casualty,d.illinois courts have adopted a confusing label for a familiar concept,one that lacks any requirement of scienter.
appellate review of a finding is deferential.see venture associates zenith data systems,cir psi energy,exxon coal usa,cir.we do not think that the district court committed a clear error or abused its discretion.it is of course hard to know what sanction is appropriate the london insurers ask how the district court could be sure that chicago would have obtained the benefit of in indemnity and in legal expenses had they discharged their duties.it is a good question other numbers would have been possible.but the difficulty of reconstructing how things would have gone in an alternate reality is a principal reason why appellate courts accept reasoned resolutions by triers of fact,and because the district judge approach is a sensible claims made by third parties against chicago greatly exceed,so it could have used the affirm this aspect of the judgment except to the extent the district judge added in prejudgment interest to the award of in legal expenses.as with the award of interest on the settlement,it is unclear whether the district judge properly separated interest from loss.if the already includes compensation for the time value of money,there is no basis for prejudgment interest
