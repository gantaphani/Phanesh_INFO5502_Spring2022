introduction 
article xiii,section of the california constitution imposes a tax of percent on the amount of gross premiums received each year by each insurer doing business in this state cal,art.xiii,subd.b,italics added,subds.c d.the tax differs from the corporate franchise tax imposed on all other businesses,which is calculated on the basis of the business net income.tax.code,subd.f,italics added.
the issue in this appeal is whether california physicians service,doing business as blue shield of california blue shield,and blue cross of california,doing business as anthem blue cross blue cross collectively,real parties are insurers under the california constitution gross premium tax provision.
a taxpayer brought a mandamus action to compel state officials to collect the gross premium tax from real parties.real parties contended,inter alia,they could not,as a matter of law,be regarded as insurers under the constitution gross premium tax provision,because they are health care service plans under the knox keene health care service plan act of,health and safety code section et the knox keene act.they argued that regulatory status determines if an entity is an insurer and subject to the gross premium tax under the constitution.the trial court agreed with real parties and sustained their demurrers without leave to amend.we reverse,and conclude,pursuant to people ex rel.roddis california mut.cal d roddis,that the taxpayer can maintain this action because the complaint alleges facts sufficient to support an inference that indemnifying against future contingent medical expenses represents a significant financial proportion of real parties businesses.
facts and procedural history 
plaintiff michael myers filed this action against the state board of equalization boe,the state insurance commissioner,and the state controller collectively,the state defendants,to compel the state defendants to assess and collect the gross premium tax from real parties.plaintiff alleges real parties are among the largest health insurers in this state by virtue of the significant premiums they collect in exchange for agreeing to indemnify their enrollees against contingent medical expenses,largely through preferred provider organization,or ppo,plans.despite this,plaintiff alleges real parties have not paid the gross premium tax that is paid by every other company that issues similar indemnity health insurance contracts.
the trial court sustained real parties demurrers to plaintiff complaint on three grounds.as for the principal ground,which we address in the major part of this opinion,the court concluded that real parties could not,as a matter of law,be regarded as insurers under the constitution gross premium tax provision,because they are health care service plans under the knox keene act and,as such,are subject to a different regulatory scheme than the one that governs the business of licensed insurance companies in this state.the court also concluded that plaintiff action was barred,under the res judicata doctrine,by a judgment in a prior taxpayer action to compel the boe to assess and collect the gross premium tax from blue cross.finally,the court determined that plaintiff lacked standing because the requested relief would effectively enjoin the state from collecting the corporate franchise tax from real parties.for the reasons discussed in this opinion,we reject each of these grounds,and reverse the judgment.
allegations regarding blue shield 
the california medical association incorporated blue shield in as a mutual benefit corporation.blue shield founding purpose was to arrange health care for californians with limited incomes,originally less than per year,who did not have adequate funds to pay for medical treatment.
in its early years,blue shield contracted directly with california physicians to provide covered medical services to blue shield subscribers for a set periodic rate.under this original model,blue shield had no contractual obligation to indemnify its subscribers for medical expenses rather,the financial risk of providing expensive medical care that exceeded the contracted rate fell entirely upon the treating physicians who had contracted with blue shield.
beginning in the,blue shield expanded its membership and services by removing existing income restrictions and offering health care indemnity contracts that obligated blue shield to pay for its members medical treatment.at the time,state law only required blue shield to register with the california attorney general as a knox mills act health plan,even though the knox mills act lacked regulatory oversight mechanisms to ensure blue shield maintained sufficient reserves to meet its growing indemnity obligations.
in,the legislature repealed the knox mills act and enacted the knox keene act.in,the department of corporations designated blue shield a california health care service plan hcsp one of four original licensees under the knox keene act.as a former knox mills health plan,and in recognition that blue shield issued primarily health indemnity contracts,the department of corporations permitted blue shield to continue to write new indemnity contracts as a hcsp,unlike the vast majority of other hcsps licensed under the knox keene act.
blue shield utilizes a form of health contract that allows members to obtain covered medical care from preferred providers at discounted group rates.under this arrangement,the hospitals and physicians with whom blue shield contracts comprise blue shield preferred provider organization ppo.blue shield members who obtain medical care from preferred providers pay smaller costs than for medical care received from providers,while blue shield pays reduced rates for the medical care preferred providers render to blue shield members.consistent with their indemnity structure,the ppo contracts provide that if blue shield pays for medical treatment stemming from injuries caused by a third party,then blue shield will retain an equitable right to restitution to recover the medical costs paid by blue shield of california on a basis.
over the last decades,blue shield has offered two broad product lines ppo plans and health maintenance organization hmo plans as of june,blue shield reported that members were enrolled in its ppo plans across california.blue shield ppo membership is approximately twice that of the members enrolled in its hmo plans.as of june,blue shield ppo network consisted of physicians and hospitals.
ppo plans are customarily characterized as health insurance plans and,as such,are subject to oversight by the department of insurance.like other ppo plans,blue shield ppo contracts are indemnity health contracts that place the financial risk of paying a member covered contingent medical care costs on blue shield,less the required deductible and payment by the member.despite this,while other ppo plans offered in california are subject to regulation by the department of insurance,blue shield ppo plans are overseen by the department of managed health care dmhc blue shield regulator since under the knox keene act.in its final report of its routine medical survey of blue shield of california,dated october,the dmhc disclosed that blue shield was permitted the option to include its preferred provider organization ppo products under the jurisdiction of the department of corporations,the state regulatory agency for the knox keene act at that time.
as of the filing of the complaint,blue shield had over million enrollees for its ppo and hmo plans,representing the third highest enrollment of all health carriers in california and generating nearly billion in annual premiums or dues.in,blue shield paid over billion for medical expenses,representing over three times the amount blue shield paid for capitated expenses billion.figures set forth in the complaint suggest blue shield has paid at least two to three times more in medical expenses over the last decade as compared to charges paid under a capitation agreement.
since,blue shield has been exempt from all state franchise tax,including the gross premiums tax,pursuant to findings made by the franchise tax board ftb under former revenue and taxation code section according to the ftb opinion letter,blue shield status could be subject to forfeiture in the event blue shield change s the character of its organization,the purposes for which it was organized,or its method of operation.
allegations regarding blue cross 
blue cross was established in as a hospital service organization.in,blue cross implemented one of the first ppo programs in california.three years later,blue cross formed its first hmo plan.in,blue cross changed its status to a for profit health plan.
blue cross was regulated by the department of insurance until january,when,through a series of legislative acts,it came under the jurisdiction of the department of corporations the predecessor to blue cross current regulator under the knox keene act,the dmhc.the same legislative acts deemed blue cross a grandfathered knox mills health plan and enabled blue cross,like blue shield,to continue issuing health plans with an indemnity component even after the dmhc assumed regulatory jurisdiction 
blue cross ppo plans provide coverage for doctor office visits,hospital stays,emergency medical treatment,medical diagnostic services,outpatient services,prescription drugs and other medical benefits.the amounts blue cross pays under its ppo contracts are dependent upon coinsurance and deductable options and whether the medical care is provided by a blue cross physician or a hospital that charges a lower volume discount rate negotiated by blue cross.blue cross ppo plans also provide coverage for more costly medical treatment.
the complaint alleges on information and belief that blue cross issues more ppo plans in california than any other hcsp or insurance company in the state,and that more blue cross members receive benefits under its ppo products than its hmo products.the complaint also alleges on information and belief that blue cross,like blue shield,was given the option to have the department of corporations oversee its ppo plans,rather than the department of insurance,which oversees all other ppo health insurance plans issued in california.
blue cross financial statements from through show blue cross annual payments on behalf of its members have been approximately five to six times larger than its capitation payments to healthcare providers over the subject decade.in,blue cross payments totaled more than billion,as compared to the billion in fixed fees it paid pursuant to capitation agreements with physicians and hospitals.since,when blue cross came under the jurisdiction of the department of corporations pursuant to the knox keene act,blue cross has not paid any gross premium taxes.
the lawsuit 
in november,the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights ftcr and shari rosenman collectively,the ftcr plaintiffs filed a taxpayer action pursuant to code of civil procedure section against the boe,the state controller and the state of california.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the assessment and collection of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid gross premium taxes owed to the state of california by blue cross on the premiums it receives from its ppo health insurance plan subscribers the lawsuit.
the ftcr plaintiffs alleged the ppo plans sold by blue cross are a type of indemnity health insurance and that approximately percent of blue cross health insurance business in california was attributable to its ppo products.at all relevant times,however,blue cross allegedly paid the franchise tax on its net profits,not the gross premium tax paid by other health insurers selling ppo indemnity insurance products.this allegedly allowed blue cross to reap an enormous competitive advantage over other health insurers in california.as the ftcr plaintiffs asserted in their complaint,a lthough the franchise tax rate of is greater than the premium tax rate of,because the base for the gross premium tax is gross premiums instead of net income,the gross premium tax collects a greater share of an insurance company premium revenue than is proportionally collected from a health plan by the franchise tax.the ftcr plaintiffs maintained that the relief sought would level the playing field for all california health insurers and result in a more competitive and fair environment for health care insurers.
the public entity defendants and blue cross,as a real party in interest,filed demurrers to the ftcr plaintiffs complaint.the demurrers argued the plaintiffs lacked standing under code of civil procedure section because the relief sought would effectively enjoin the ftb from collecting the franchise tax from blue cross and the public entity defendants had no duty to collect the gross premium tax because blue cross was a hcsp under the knox keene act and,therefore,not an insurer under article xiii,section of the constitution.
the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.with respect to the constitutional issue,the court concluded blue cross was not an insurer under article xiii,section.citing the fact that i nsurers are registered with and regulated by the insurance commissioner and department of insurance,while blue cross had been licensed as a hcsp under the knox keene act since,the court reasoned that the legislature and relevant state agencies,including the department of insurance,the dmhc,and the ftb,had determined that blue cross was a health plan and not an insurer for tax purposes.because,in the court view,these agencies made discretionary policy determinations with respect to blue cross status,the court concluded such determinations were not subject to judicial review by means of a taxpayer action.accordingly,the court held blue cross status as a licensed hcsp was dispositive and barred declaratory or injunctive relief compelling the public entity defendants to assess and collect the gross premium tax from blue cross.
while acknowledging the demurring parties argument that the ftcr plaintiffs action could not be maintained under code of civil procedure section because it would necessarily enjoin the ftb from collecting the franchise tax,the trial court applied a different analysis to the standing issue.the court reasoned that a taxpayer has standing under code of civil procedure section to compel the collection of a tax only if the subject public agencies have nondiscretionary duties that required the collection of those funds.working from that premise,the court settled on the same rationale that it employed to resolve the constitutional issue that is,because the relevant agencies made a discretionary policy determination to characterize blue cross as a hcsp,and hcsps are not subject to the gross premium tax,the court concluded the ftcr plaintiffs had no standing to compel the public entity defendants to collect the gross premium tax.
the ftcr plaintiffs appealed from the judgment,but then abandoned the appeal before submitting the case to the appellate court for a decision.
the instant action 
in july,plaintiff filed the instant action,styled as a verified for writ of mandamus and declaratory judgment,against the state defendants.the complaint sought to compel the state defendants to perform their respective ministerial duties mandated by the california constitution and revenue and taxation code regarding the determination,assessment,and collection of the gross premium tax with respect to real parties.the complaint also sought a declaratory judgment determining whether blue shield and blue cross are insurers as that term is used within article xiii,section of the california constitution.plaintiff asserted he had standing to sue for the requested relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
the complaint central theory for relief is that real parties ppo products are indemnity health insurance contracts and,because these indemnity products represent the vast majority of real parties business in the state,the complaint asserts real parties are insurers under the constitution and the premiums they collect in california are subject to the gross premium tax.despite this,the complaint alleges the state defendants have failed to perform their ministerial duty to assess and collect the gross premium tax from real parties.that failure,the complaint asserts,constitutes a waste of tax monies owed to the state warranting mandamus.
after the trial court related the instant action to the lawsuit filed by the ftcr plaintiffs,the parties filed a joint initial status conference statement setting forth their respective positions on the core factual and legal issues presented by the complaint allegations.the boe stated it had no position regarding plaintiff entitlement to relief,observing that under the relevant revenue and taxation code provision the boe duty to assess the gross premium tax is under the direction of the department of insurance and purely ministerial.the controller similarly stated that it makes no determination as to whether entities,such as real parties,are insurers for purposes of administering the gross premium tax.the controller added,this determination is made by the insurance commissioner.as for the insurance commissioner,he stated the core legal issue is whether real parties are insurers subject to gross premium tax under california constitution article xiii,section.the commissioner contends the answer is yes.
real parties filed separate demurrers to the complaint.both demurrers asserted the judgment in the lawsuit barred the instant action under the res judicata doctrine and that,on the merits,real parties status as a licensed knox keene hcsp regulated by the dmhc not the insurance commissioner conclusively established they were not insurers subject to the gross premium tax.blue cross also argued,as it had in the lawsuit,that plaintiff lacked standing under code of civil procedure section because the relief he sought would effectively enjoin the ftb from collecting franchise tax from blue cross.blue shield also challenged plaintiff standing,but argued it was lacking with respect to the relief affecting blue shield because such relief a writ of mandate compelling the state defendants to collect gross premium taxes from blue shield was inconsistent with blue shield status.
plaintiff opposed the demurrers,arguing,among other things,that the requisite elements of res judicata were not present,but even if they were,the court should invoke the doctrine public interest exception in view of the public revenue component and constitutional dimension of the claims the real parties regulatory designation under the knox keene act could not trump the state defendants ministerial duty to collect the gross premium tax from entities substantially engaged in the business of selling indemnity insurance in california and real parties standing arguments were based on flawed interpretations of the relevant legal authorities.
the trial court sustained real parties demurrers without leave to amend.the court determined that all elements for invoking res judicata were present and declined to apply the public interest exception,observing this case deals with questions of economic public policy that do not lie within this court prerogative.the court also determined that real parties regulatory designation under the knox keene act was dispositive and precluded a finding that real parties were insurers subject to the gross premium tax under the constitution.finally,the court concluded plaintiff lacked standing under code of civil procedure section,reasoning that the gross premium tax is in lieu of other taxes and,therefore,the relief requested by plaintiff would inherently enjoin collection of the corporate franchise tax paid by blue cross.
discussion 
taxation of insurance companies in california 
before we address the issues in this case,we must place this matter in context by examining the specific taxing scheme for insurers that lies at the heart of this controversy.in california,insurance companies are taxed differently than other corporations doing business in the state.while regular corporations are subject to a corporate franchise tax of percent,calculated on the basis of the corporation net income tax.code,subd.f,italics added the california constitution imposes a tax of percent on the amount of gross premiums received each year by each insurer doing business in this state cal,art.xiii,subd.b,italics added,subds.c d.for most types of insurers,this tax is in lieu of all other taxes and fees payable to the state,except property taxes and vehicle license fees,subd.f.thus,insurance companies do not pay tax on other forms of income,such as investment income,and income earned from other trades or businesses.see mutual life ins.city of los angeles cal d,the in lieu provision was intended to preclude the state or any of its subdivisions from exacting any other revenue from the specified corporations except local taxes on real estate and was granted in exchange for the payment of a tax on gross,rather than net,premiums,and at an adjustable rate higher than would otherwise be applied.
a july report by the legislative analyst office observes that t he economics of the insurance industry is a key reason for the special treatment of insurance companies with respect to taxation in california.the report explains the rationale as follows most corporate franchise tax taxpayers calculate their income by subtracting costs incurred in the production of a good or service from the revenues received from their sale.insurance companies,by contrast,collect their revenues up front in the form of premiums,then make payments to policyholders based on contingent events that occur many months or years later.thus,it can be difficult to match up revenues to related expenses.in an income tax framework,insurers ideally would be allowed to deduct the current value of all future obligations claims covered by the insurance policies they have written when calculating their taxable income for a given year.however,b ecause the actual amount of these obligations is uncertain,as are the amount of investment earnings on accumulated premiums received during the intervening period,an accurate determination of the theoretically appropriate amount of taxable income proves very difficult to achieve in practice.for this reason,the legislative analyst office report concludes,a gross premiums tax was adopted.
knox keene licensed health care service plans 
the other leg of this controversy concerns the regulatory regime applicable to licensed hcsps under the knox keene act.again,some background in this area is necessary to put our resolution of the parties opposing positions in context.
in,the legislature adopted the knox keene act with the express intent and purpose to promote the delivery and the quality of health and medical care to the people of the state of california who enroll in,or subscribe for the services rendered by,a hcsp by accomplishing all of the following a ensuring the continued role of the professional as the determiner of the patient health needs b ensuring that subscribers and enrollees are educated and informed of the benefits and services available c prosecuting malefactors who make fraudulent solicitations or who use deceptive methods d helping to ensure the best possible health care for the public at the lowest possible cost by transferring the financial risk of health care from patients to providers.e promoting effective representation of the interests of subscribers and enrollees.f ensuring the financial stability thereof by means of proper regulatory procedures.g ensuring that subscribers and enrollees receive available and accessible health and medical services rendered in a manner providing continuity of care.h ensuring that subscribers and enrollees have their grievances expeditiously and thoroughly reviewed by the dmhc.health saf.code.
in relevant part,the knox keene act defines those hcsps that are subject to the law regulations as any person who undertakes to arrange for the provision of health care services to subscribers or enrollees,or to pay for or to reimburse any part of the cost for those services,in return for a prepaid or periodic charge paid by or on behalf of the subscribers or enrollees.health saf.code,subd.f.hcsps as defined in and regulated by the knox keene act are under the jurisdiction of the dmhc.health saf.code.though such entities are authorized to provide direct payment or reimbursement coverage for their enrollees medical expenses,hcsp are statutorily exempted from the insurance department jurisdiction,and are not subject the insurance code regulations.ins.code,subd.g.this exemption extends to hcsps offering coverage through a ppo plan.
finally,because hcsps include,by definition,entities that agree to pay for or to reimburse enrollees for the cost of medical services in exchange for a prepaid or periodic charge health saf.code,subd.f,the knox keene act includes capitalization requirements and vests financial oversight authority in the dmhc,subd.c.
the complaint alleges sufficient facts to find real parties are insurers under the gross premium tax provision of the constitution 
with the forgoing background,we can distill the novel constitutional question presented by this appeal as follows are allegations that real parties receive a substantial share of their annual premiums in exchange for agreeing to indemnify enrollees against contingent medical expenses sufficient to state a claim that real parties are insurer s subject to the constitution gross premium tax we hold the answer is yes,because these allegations support an inference that indemnifying against future contingent claims represents a significant financial proportion of real parties businesses as balanced against the health care service aspect of their businesses.accordingly,we conclude the trial court erred in sustaining real parties demurrers.
to reiterate,the constitution imposes the gross premiums tax on each insurer doing business in this state cal,art.xiii,subd.b,italics added,subds.c d.in relevant part,the constitution defines the term insurer to include insurance companies or associations and reciprocal or interinsurance exchanges.cal,art xiii,subd.a.the definition,by its use of the word includes,is not restrictive,and our supreme court has looked outside the constitution,to definitions provided by the insurance code,for guidance in assessing the scope of the gross premium tax provision.see,metropolitan life ins.state bd.of equalization cal d,metropolitan life title ins.state bd.of equalization cal th.
as the court observed in metropolitan life,t he legislature has defined insurance as a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another against loss,damage,or liability arising from a contingent or unknown event.metropolitan life,supra,cal d at,quoting ins.code.the person who undertakes to indemnify another by insurance is the insurer,and the person indemnified is the insured.ins.code,see metropolitan life,at.under these definitions,insurance necessarily involves two elements a risk of loss to which one party is subject and a shifting of that risk to another party and distribution of risk among similarly situated persons.metropolitan life,at,citing california physicians service garrison cal d.
plaintiff contends the complaint allegations demonstrate that real parties are insurers under the constitution gross premium tax provision,notwithstanding that real parties are statutorily designated as hcsps for regulatory purposes.in support of this contention,plaintiff relies upon our supreme court opinion in metropolitan life.there,the court recognized that the gross premium tax purpose is to exact payments from insurers doing business in california by approximat ing the volume of business done in this state,and thus the extent to which insurers have availed themselves of the privilege of doing business in california.metropolitan life,supra,cal d at.and,for this purpose,the supreme court stressed that we must look beyond the formal labels the parties have affixed to their transactions and seek,rather,to discern the true economic substance of the arrangement.id.at.
as for the complaint allegations,plaintiff emphasizes that real parties receive a substantial portion of their premiums each year in exchange for agreeing to indemnify their enrollees against a risk of loss occasioned by contingent medical expenses,and in doing so,real parties contracts effectively spread the financial risk posed by those contingent medical events among the millions of californians who pay premiums to enroll in real parties ppo plans.specifically,the complaint alleges blue shield paid over billion for indemnity claims in,as compared to billion for based claims,and blue cross paid over billion for indemnity claims,as compared to billion for based claims.plaintiff contends application of the gross premium tax must be determined by examining real parties business activity in the state not simply their regulatory status and the complaint allegations support the claim that real parties operate as insurers for purposes of imposing the constitution gross premium tax.
plaintiff contends this is a factual issue,which the trial court improperly resolved on demurrer by drawing unwarranted inferences from real parties regulatory obligations.rather than resolve the issue based solely on regulatory status,plaintiff argues the trial court should have applied the test set forth in roddis to assess whether the complaint allegations concerning real parties business activities supported the claim that they are insurers under the constitution gross premium tax provision.because roddis supplies a legal standard against which plaintiff allegations may be measured,we will review the case in some depth.
in roddis,the insurance commissioner brought suit to restrain california mutual association cma from carrying on business as an insurer without first securing a certificate of authority pursuant to insurance code section.roddis,supra,cal d at.cma,which contracted with doctors who agreed to render services to cma dues paying members and to look exclusively to cma for payment of a scheduled fee id.at,claimed it was a health care service plan under the knox mills act the predecessor to knox keene.the roddis court explained if cma is an insurer then it is subject to the supervision of the insurance commissioner and it must provide capital ins.code,and a surplus ins.code,and pay premium taxes.if,as cma contends,it is a health care service plan pursuant to the knox mills plan act code,then it is subject to the supervision of the attorney general and need not meet any statutory financial responsibility requirements,as no provisions existed in the knox mills act to assure the financial solvency of health care service plans.roddis,at.
the roddis court began its analysis with the knox mills act statutory language,which defined a health care service plan as any organization whereby any person undertakes responsibility to provide,arrange for,pay for or reimburse any part of the cost of any health care service for a consideration consisting in part of prepaid or periodic charges but the provisions of this article shall not apply to such a plan operated by an insurer roddis,supra,cal d at.while the knox mills act did not define the term insurer,the court noted i nsurance necessarily involves the element of indemnity.ibid.thus,the court reasoned,the extent of indemnity offered by the entity represented the critical dividing line between whether an entity was a health care service plan or insurer under the knox mills act.as the court explained,the knox mills act permits a health care service plan to reimburse a member and thus indicates that service plans may include some indemnity features,but by excluding an insurer from the definition of a health care service plan the legislature has evinced an intention to limit the extent of indemnity features permissible.it is this limit we must now determine.id.at.
to determine this limit and thus ascertain the proper regulatory characterization of an entity claiming to be a knox mills health care service plan the roddis court observed two policy considerations must drive the analysis.roddis,supra,cal d at.first,the court explained,w here indemnity features are present,the member bears the risk of personal liability for medical services.this is the insurance risk which can be protected against by financial reserves to assure that the member will receive the benefits for which he has paid.ibid.as for the second considera
