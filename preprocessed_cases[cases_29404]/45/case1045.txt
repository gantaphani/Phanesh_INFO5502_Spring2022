plaintiff janet mohnkern brought suit claiming she was owed attorneys fees under florida law by defendant the professional insurance company.the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment,and mohnkern now appeals that decision.we now affirm.
the district court adequately recited the convoluted facts of this case 
this is one of a number of satellite cases spawned by the litigation in liberte capital group et al capwill,case cv and involving the viatical insurance industry 
it is undisputed that the professional insurance company pic issued a life insurance policy,policy,to broderick blacknell blacknell,a florida resident,in the amount of.however,blacknell health problems and attendant medical bills led to him selling his policy in return for a sum less than the policy limits.
in november,janet mohnkern mohnkern invested with alpha capital group alpha,which solicited investors for placements in viatical settlements.mohnkern funds were placed in escrow with viatical escrow services,llc ves until she was placed in the blacknell policy.on march,mohnkern was assigned the blacknell policy in exchange for of her initial investment.the remainder of mohnkern investment was placed in another policy and is not at issue in this litigation.the assignment of the blacknell policy to mohnkern was recorded by pic in april noting the approval of absolute assignment with janet mohnkern.amended,ex.
in april,alpha and a company called liberte capital group,another viatical settlement firm,commenced an action in federal district court against their escrow agent,james capwill,alleging that capwill misappropriated funds it held in escrow for alpha and liberte.the district court appointed a receiver,and instructed the receiver to satisfy the claims of creditors,including investors and other parties,in the order of legal priority see liberte capital group,llc capwill,cir.the district court expanded the receiver duties on november,to cover all interests in any and all insurance policies funded by investors which liberte capital,llc or alpha capital,llc contacted,which are or were in the name of james capwill,capwill,cwn group or any other name,either as nominee owner or as trustee for the purpose of managing and administering insurance policies in which one of the foregoing either is named as owner,beneficiary or trustee,including,but is not limited to death claims it is undisputed that the blacknell policy was listed by name,and included,in the district court order establishing a receivership.
the district court summarized the remaining facts as follows 
blacknell passed away on november.due to difficulties in ascertaining information about the location of blacknell death,it was not until october,that alpha escrow agent,northeast escrow services,llc nes,forwarded the certified death certificate and a copy of the policy assignment to mohnkern.approximately ten days later,mohnkern submitted her claim to pic on the blacknell policy.the claim form indicates it was received on october,by retirement accounts,and forwarded to pic and received by them on november.
in investigating the claim,pic determined that mohnkern was not the named beneficiary to the policy which required,in part,that blacknell estate sign off on the claim.by letter dated november,pic advised mohnkern that it needed certain documentation in order to proceed with the processing of her claim.pic states,and mohnkern does not dispute,that pic received the requested documentation from her on november.
by early january,pic stood ready to pay the policy proceeds to mohnkern.on january,pic emailed mohnkern that it was waiting to hear from nes on the status of the premium payments and wanted clarification from mohnkern as to whom premium payment refunds were to be returned.on january,pic received an email from nes and responded to nes as follows 
thank you for your.i authorized payment of the policy proceeds to janet mohnkern this morning.if you believe this decision is incorrect please let me know as soon as possible.i have not received confirmation yet as to when the check will go out but i assuming a few days.i will let janet mohnkern know as soon as i receive confirmation.my decision was based on the collateral assignment.the only remaining information i needed from you was on the premium refund.i believe that premiums were paid for a few months following the date of death.janet mohnkern believes that the premium refund should go to her,but i wanted to get your agreement on that issue prior to returning premiums to janet.do you agree that any excess premium payments should go to janet mohnkern and not to northeast escrow services thank you very much for your help with this matter.

ge financial assurance.
later that same day,nes advised pic of the following 
dear scott 
have been directed by the federal receiver,william wuliger to express our concern over the payment of this death benefit.i understand that this death claim has been in the process for many months,but it is wuliger position that the court must okay the payment of this benefit.wuliger is putting a motion before the court today for direction.
will forward to you,by mail,a letter explaining the situation along with the motion from court appointing wuliger the receiver and northeast escrow services as the escrow agent over alpha capital group.we then ask for your patience.will forward to you the motion as who is to be paid,as soon as receive it.
unfortunately,this policy is wrapped up in the receivership of alpha capital group and mohnkern does not know the decision by wuliger to allow the court to decide 
operations.
pic advised mohnkern of these developments on january.the receiver filed his motion on the blacknell death benefit in the liberte action on january,and it was approved by the court on january.in accordance with the directive in the court order,pic payed the proceeds from the blacknell policy to nes,the escrow company utilized by the receiver and at the court direction,nes placed the monies in a segregated account.
mohnkern filed this litigation on march,in the middle district of florida and it was subsequently transferred to the northern district of ohio on april.following unsuccessful settlement discussions,this court stayed the case sub judice,until mohnkern intervened in the liberte action regarding her contractual rights.subsequent to a fairness hearing on the method of distribution regarding the alpha investors,mohnkern motion for release and distribution of the blacknell proceeds was dismissed.on appeal,the sixth circuit reversed and remanded for a hearing as to the ownership of the blacknell policy proceeds,consistent with mohnkern due process rights.liberte capital group,llc capwill,cir.
after remand,in december,mohnkern and the receiver resolved the contractual dispute and mohnkern received in return for settlement of her contractual claim.upon notification of that settlement,the court lifted the stay in the present lawsuit.mohnkern sets forth four causes of action in her amended complaint as follows that defendant failure or delay in payment was a violation of florida statute and that defendant acted unreasonably and in violation of plaintiff statutory rights that defendant has an absolute statutory obligation to pay her attorneys fees and interest in accordance with florida law and declaratory relief in regards to plaintiff entitlement to attorneys fees and interest under florida law.
the district court went on to hold that the principal inquiry was whether mohnkern was due attorneys fees under florida statute.the lower court held that taking into consideration pic action and responses to the receiver and court order,to award attorneys fees,in this instance,would be to penalize an insurer when it was without power to resolve the conflict and would be contrary to the intent of the statute.
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.hardesty hamburg,cir.summary judgment is proper where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
attorneys fees 
mohnkern argues that because she was forced to litigate in order to receive payment under the blacknell policy,the statute is automatically triggered,and pic must pay her attorneys fees under the statute.pic argues that in order for attorneys fees to be awarded under,the insurer must wrongly deny paying a benefit,causing the insured to resort to litigation.here,it was the receiver action and the resulting court order that halted pic from paying the proceeds of the blacknell policy to mohnkern.according to pic,it never denied the benefit and was without power to resolve mohnkern claim.
the florida statute at issue reads in relevant part that u pon rendition of a judgment against an insurer and in favor of any named beneficiary under a policy,the trial court shall adjudge in favor of the beneficiary a reasonable sum as fees or compensation for the beneficiary attorney.stat.florida courts have held that a settlement is the functional equivalent of a verdict in favor of the insured.wollard lloyd.of lloyds,so d.and,as the eleventh circuit has recognized,an insured may recover attorneys fees under when reaching a settlement.see united states pepper steel alloys,cir.
the issue we must decide is simple does the florida statute automatically award attorneys fees upon a successful outcome by the or does the statute require the insurer to have wrongfully caused the to resort to litigation before attorneys fees can be awarded 
the purpose behind is to place the insured or beneficiary in the place she would have been if the carrier had seasonably paid the claim or benefits without causing the payee to engage counsel and incur attorneys fees.as the florida supreme court said in ins.of am.lexow,so d,
florida courts have consistently held that the purpose of section and its predecessor is to discourage the contesting of valid claims against insurance companies and to reimburse successful insureds for their attorneys fees when they are compelled to defend or sue to enforce their insurance contracts.clay prudential ins.of america,so d.
the district court correctly relied on government employees ins.geico battaglia,so d,the battaglia court held that geico could not be penalized for a trial court order staying arbitration that had the effect of delaying the payment of battaglia claim,and causing battaglia to resort to litigation.the florida court stated that t he purpose of section is to penalize a carrier for wrongfully causing its insured to resort to litigation to resolve a conflict when it was reasonably within the carrier power to do so.when the claim is one that the carrier reasonably can expect to be resolved by a court,rather than by itself,then section does not generate a punitive fee.so d at internal citations omitted.
the facts show that mohnkern was compelled to sue to enforce her rights under the blacknell policy,thereby fitting within the language of the statute.however,pic did not contest her valid claim,nor did it ever truly deny her claim.pic acted pursuant to a court order when it paid the blacknell proceeds into the receiver escrow account instead of to mohnkern.pic never wrongfully caused mohnkern to resort to litigation,rather pic was forced to abide by the district court order.if pic had refused to follow the district court order and paid mohnkern instead of the receiver,it would have risked being held in contempt by the district court.it was the receiver and the district court which compelled mohnkern to intervene in the liberte action to assert her contractual rights under the blacknell policy.and under battaglia,because pic was without power to resolve mohnkern claim in the face of the district court order,does not apply.id.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of pic motion for summary judgment.
statutory interest 
mohnkern also argues the district court erred in denying her claim for interest under florida statute.even though mohnkern raised it in her motion for summary judgment,the district court did not address her claim for interest in its order granting pic summary judgment.
mohnkern argues that under where a beneficiary is ultimately determined to be entitled to insurance policy proceeds,the insurance carrier is statutorily liable for interest from the date the insurer receives written due proof of the death of the insured persons.here,mohnkern argues she was entitled to interest from november,through the date she received her settlement on december,a period of four years and one month.according to the statute,she was entitled to an annual interest rate of at least percent.
pic argues that it paid the proceeds of the blacknell policy,along with the applicable interest under,to the receiver.those funds were kept in a segregated account by the escrow agent.yet,as pic points out,mohnkern received in her settlement with the receiver,which apparently represents only in interest.pic states that it paid over in interest to the receiver,not including the interest garnered in the account.according to pic,because it paid the applicable interest under the statute,it is not liable for additional interest simply because mohnkern was not able to recover more money from the receiver.
we find that pic argument has the most merit.it paid the policy proceeds plus statutory interest to the receiver pursuant to a valid court order.it is not clear what else pic could have done.to compel them to pay interest again would be penalizing them for following a court order,and making them pay double interest on the death benefit.mohnkern cites no cases,and we do not find any,that would require pic to pay interest after it abided by a court order and paid the benefit plus interest to the receiver.all of the cases relied on by mohnkern involve the denial and of a death benefit.here,the benefit was paid,just not to mohnkern.the fact that mohnkern was then unable to recoup all of the interest paid by pic was not due to any wrongful denial of benefit by pic.accordingly,the district court denial of mohnkern claim for interest under is affirmed.
based on the foregoing,we affirm the district court denial of mohnkern motion for partial summary judgment and grant of pic motion for summary judgment.
i respectfully dissent from the majority decision to deny janet mohnkern attorney fees under.stat.as the majority recognizes,op.at,mohnkern satisfies the only requirements for such recovery as set forth by the plain text of she was the of a life insurance policy,she was compelled to sue to enforce her rights,and the litigation resulted in a determination that she was entitled to the policy proceeds.because is applicable to this case,and because the district court that ordered pic to pay nes instead of mohnkern was without authority to resolve the issue,mohnkern is entitled to attorney fees.
as the supreme court of florida has recognized,i f the dispute is within the scope of and the insurer loses,the insurer is always obligated for attorney fees.ins.of am.lexow,so d,emphasis added.in determining whether a dispute comes within the scope of,florida courts look to the purpose of the statute,which is to discourage the contesting of valid claims against insurance companies and to reimburse successful insureds for their attorney fees when they are compelled to defend or sue to enforce their insurance contracts.id.at.thus,the statute serves two general purposes to deter insurers from taking actions that compel insureds into litigation by punishing those that do,and to compensate the insureds when they are so compelled.
examining the current case under this rubric,it is clear that the compensatory purpose of is applicable.as the majority acknowledges,mohnkern was compelled to sue to enforce her rights under the blacknell policy.op.at.as a result,at the time of settlement mohnkern had paid in attorney fees and litigation costs to recover the on the policy for which she had initially paid.
as to the deterrent or punitive purpose,a brief review of pic actions is helpful.pic informed mohnkern on january,that it was ready to pay her the blacknell policy proceeds,and that such payment would take place upon resolution of an unrelated collateral matter the following day,lynn day from nes emailed scott holman at pic day was trying to wrap mohnkern file up,and wanted to know if pic had decided to pay mohnkern the policy proceeds.within ten minutes,holman replied that based on the collateral assignment,pic had authorized payment to mohnkern.holman went on to say,i f you believe this decision is incorrect please let me know as soon as possible.this solicitation of advice was entirely unprompted,as day had made clear that she was asking for an update only for the purpose of wrapping up mohnkern file,not to weigh in on the issue.nonetheless,a few hours later,day replied that it was the federal receiver position that the court must okay the payment of this benefit,and that the receiver was putting a motion before the court today for direction.pic agreed to await action by the receiver and the district court.this led to the court order,which then led to pic paying the policy proceeds to nes,not mohnkern.
i think it is clear that the punitive or deterrent purpose of is well served on these facts.despite having determined that mohnkern was entitled to the proceeds,pic chose to involve nes and the receiver in the process instead of paying mohnkern the proceeds as required under the insurance contract,with the result that mohnkern was forced to initiate this litigation.accordingly,this case is within the scope of,and,because mohnkern prevailed,pic is obligated for attorney fees.see lexow,so d at if the dispute is within the scope of and the insurer loses,the insurer is always obligated for attorney fees.
the cases relied on by the majority do not undermine this conclusion.they merely prove that does not award attorney fees to every who ultimately prevails in litigation,a point that i am willing to concede.but that is not determinative of whether mohnkern is entitled to attorney fees under based on the facts and circumstances of this case.my reading of the florida case law,including all of the cases cited in the majority opinion,indicates that does not award attorney fees to a victorious only where the insurer did not wrongfully deny benefits,and that the florida courts have applied this exception to awarding of fees only in two distinct factual settings,neither one of which applies to this case.
first,the florida courts have found that the insurer did not wrongfully deny benefits where,at the time the insurer was alleged to have denied benefits,it was under no obligation to pay.for example,in liberty national life ins.bailey,so d,which the majority cites at op.at,the insured submitted a claim form and treating physician statement that erroneously reflected her illness as predating her policy,which caused the insurer to deny her claim.when the insured brought suit before attempting to correct or explain the errors in her submissions,she was not entitled to attorney fees under,because upon receipt of the insured initial claim,the insurer had no obligation to pay.so d at see also time ins.arnold,so d same general fact pattern as bailey and cited by the majority at op.at.additionally,in tristar lodging,arch speciality ins,d,cited by the majority at op.at,at the time the insured filed suit,the insurer had already paid a number of claims and was in the process of adjusting the remaining claims.the court declined to award attorney fees because there was no indication of when the remaining claims were due and payable,and therefore,it was impossible to say that the insurer had failed to pay timely.with no breach of a duty to pay,benefits were not wrongfully denied or withheld,and attorney fees were not appropriate.d at.
clearly,pic is not helped by this line of cases,and the majority is mistaken to conclude otherwise.there is no dispute that,at the time pic paid nes the blacknell policy proceeds,pic was under a contractual obligation to pay mohnkern those proceeds.mohnkern submitted all of the necessary paperwork to claim her benefits,and pic informed mohnkern that it had approved her receipt of the benefits.furthermore,as i will explain below,pic was not relieved of this obligation by the district court order instructing it to pay nes.
the majority similarly errs in its reliance on government employees ins.geico battaglia,so d,which falls squarely within the line of cases.in battaglia,the insured,who had uninsured motorist coverage through geico,was injured in a collision with the tortfeasor,who had liability coverage through florida farm bureau ffb.the insured filed an action against the tortfeasor and ffb.after one year of litigation,the tortfeasor disappeared and refused to cooperate,causing ffb to deny coverage on the basis that its defense had been prejudiced by the tortfeasor actions.after this denial,the insured sought arbitration on its uninsured motorist policy.with no opposition from geico,arbitration was granted.but prior to the final hearing date,geico located the tortfeasor,who was then deposed by counsel for all interested,ffb,and the insured.ffb reinstated coverage for the accident,and,as a result,geico moved for a stay of arbitration and initiated a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that it was not liable for the uninsured motorist coverage due to the availability of ffb coverage.the court granted a stay of arbitration but dismissed both sides motions for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action.thereafter,the tortfeasor again disappeared,once again causing ffb to deny coverage based on the tortfeasor lack of cooperation.after this denial of coverage by ffb,the insured filed a motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that he was entitled to the uninsured motorist coverage from geico.the court entered summary judgment to that effect,and also granted insured attorney fees under.
the florida district court of appeals reversed the attorney fees determination,finding that geico never wrongfully denied coverage.the court reasoned 
at the times ffb was affording coverage,geico was not obligated to do so.from the time the trial court stayed the arbitration after ffb reinstatement of coverage,until ffb again denied coverage after tortfeasor disappeared for the final time,there was no coverage obligation on the part of geico.it was eminently reasonable for geico to seek resolution of that fact by declaratory judgment and to obtain a stay of arbitration during that period.given the last coverage denial by ffb geico did not deny coverage or reject arbitration.it did resist the imposition of attorney fees against it,which it had every right to do.
so d at.in other words,because the insured had only uninsured motorist coverage through geico,geico was obligated to pay on that policy only if ffb denied coverage.after ffb reinstated coverage,geico was not obligated to the insured for any coverage and it was therefore not a wrongful denial of coverage to seek a declaratory judgment to that effect and a stay of arbitration on that basis.clearly,as with bailey and tristar,the rationale of battaglia in denying attorney fees was that the insurer did not wrongfully deny benefits to the insured because,during the time in question,the insurer was under no duty to pay the insured.thus,for the same reasons bailey and tristar are inapplicable to the current case,so is battaglia.
the second factual setting in which the florida courts have found no wrongful denial of coverage is where the insurer does not deny liability but simply bec o me s involved in a dispute over which of two claimants i s entitled to the benefits of the policy,and a court conclusively decides the issue.lexow,so d at citing manufacturers life insurance cave,so d equitable life assurance society nichols,so d see also manufacturers life insurance cave,so d crotts bankers shippers ins,so d.among these cases,the majority relies on nichols and crotts.op.at.in nichols,the insured,prior to h
