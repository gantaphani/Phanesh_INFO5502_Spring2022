ai zhen huang brought this lawsuit against her former employers,brad hunter and haute,for injuries she claimed occurred in the course of her employment at hunter residence.haute and hunter did not have workers compensation insurance,and suit was brought under labor code section,which allows an action at law for damages against an uninsured employer.in such an action,labor code section mandates a presumption that the injury to the employee was a direct result and grew out of the negligence of the employer,and the burden of proof is upon the employer,to rebut the presumption of negligence.
the question presented on this appeal is whether the presumption of negligence in section includes a presumption that the injury occurred in the course of the worker employment.we conclude it does not.an employee seeking damages from an uninsured employer has the same burden of proof as an employee seeking workers compensation benefits the employee bears the burden of proving her injury was sustained in the course of her employment.under section,if an injury arising from the employment is shown,it is presumed to have resulted from the employer negligence,and the employer is required to rebut that presumption to avoid liability.the trial court concluded huang did not meet her burden to prove her injury arose from her employment,impliedly declining to believe huang testimony that she was injured during her employment,and instead crediting other evidence from which it could be inferred her story was not true.since there was substantial evidence to support the court conclusion,we are obliged to affirm the judgment in the employer favor.
factual and procedural background 
ai zhen huang was employed as a housekeeper,working and living at the home of brad hunter,but was on the payroll of haute,a furniture manufacturing business in which hunter was a partner.she was employed in that capacity for about two years,until she was terminated on april.
on august,huang filed this negligence action against hunter and haute collectively,the employer.she alleged that on april,the day before her termination,she was injured in a fall from a ladder on which she had climbed to wash the top of a high window in hunter home.huang suit was authorized under labor code section,which permits an injured employee to sue an employer who fails to secure workers compensation insurance hunter filed a against huang for battery,alleging huang assaulted him when he fired her,and for negligence,asserting she hosed down new limestone floors inside his house,causing damage to the floors and walls.both hunter and haute sued huang for unlawful tenancy,alleging huang allowed her daughter to live in hunter home without permission and falsely listed hunter home as her daughter address in school records,and for identity fraud and unfair business practices,alleging huang used haute information and forged names on forms to secure a home loan after her termination.
a bench trial was held in october.according to huang testimony,she was between five and eight feet up the ladder at the time of the fall she clarified that her feet were about five feet off the ground when she fell.ordinarily she used a squeegee about three feet long when she washed the windows.she told hunter about her fall from the ladder that same evening and told him she needed to see a doctor,but he did not offer to send her to a doctor.the next day,hunter told huang to the grout from new limestone floors after the construction crew left.that evening,when the workers left around,she was in pain and could not carry a pail of water into the house to mop the floor.instead,she brought a hose into the house to fill the pail and overfilled it,covering the floor with water.hunter arrived home at this point and became very angry.after huang and hunter got the water out of the newly paved rooms at around,hunter fired huang.he told her to leave immediately.huang became upset and angry,and begged hunter to let her stay the night,but he refused.huang left that night.shortly thereafter,huang filed a workers compensation claim for her injuries,and later filed this suit 
hunter testified that on april,huang did not tell him she had fallen or was in pain.he stated the window huang said she was cleaning when she was huang also identified from a sliding glass door eight feet high.a plot plan and photograph were introduced in evidence.according to hunter,he did not own a ladder at the time,and his current housekeeper,who is shorter than huang,cleans the door using the squeegee and with no need for a ladder.as to the events of the following day,hunter testified he returned home to find water flowing under the front door and running down the stairs into the street.the walls were wet,and water was a couple inches deep in certain places.he was shocked and upset,fired huang and asked her to leave.he knew she lived with her brother on weekends and was not concerned about where she would go.huang dragged her tv,vcr and suitcases to her car she showed no sign of pain or injury and did not mention any injury.huang became hysterical,and hunter called the police,who forced huang to leave.the water from the hose damaged the plaster walls of hunter home and caused wiring problems.hunter testified he was not notified of huang injury until several months after her termination 
in addition to testimony from huang and hunter,huang presented medical testimony about her injury from vincent mitzelfelt mitzelfelt testified that tests revealed bulging and protruding discs in huang lumbar spine area.mitzelfelt testified huang injuries were consistent with the fall as huang described it in the patient history given to him he prescribed medications,physical therapy,ultrasound treatment,hot packs and the like.when this course of treatment did not produce satisfactory results,mitzelfelt sent huang to an organization called pain net for epidural injections and sympathetic blocks,and eventually recommended surgery.prior to mitzelfelt testimony,counsel offered huang medical bills and reports in evidence.the court sustained the employer objection on grounds of lack of foundation,lack of authentication,and hearsay,telling huang counsel it would reconsider the ruling if huang were later able to lay a foundation.huang counsel made no further motion for admission of the documents.
after trial was concluded,the court found,b ased upon all the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,that huang did not meet her burden of proof that she was injured at defendants premises or in her employment by defendants,and the employer did not meet its burden of proof to establish the necessary elements of any of the claims made in the.judgment was entered on november,and huang then filed this appeal.
discussion 
huang principal argument is that the trial court did not properly apply the presumption of negligence required by labor code section.that section applies to lawsuits authorized under section against employers who fail to secure the payment of workers compensation.under section,it is presumed that the injury to the employee was a direct result and grew out of the negligence of the employer,and the burden of proof is upon the employer,to rebut the presumption of negligence.moreover,the employer may not assert various defenses,including contributory negligence and assumption of the risk.
huang claims section provides a presumption that the worker injury occurred in the course of her employment,and places the burden to prove otherwise on the employer.for this proposition,huang cites greitz sivachenko d.while greitz contains language that arguably may be read to support huang point,in fact greitz does not reach so far.moreover,other cases and the workers compensation scheme itself make it clear that the worker has the burden of showing that her injury occurred in the course of her employment.in short,nothing in section removes from the plaintiff the burden to prove she was injured in the course of the business of the employer.thus 
on its face,section states nothing about the burden of proof that an injury occurred in the course of employment.it merely provides that,if a worker is injured,it is pre
