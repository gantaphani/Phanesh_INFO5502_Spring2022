walker claim was tendered to hsin automobile insurer,farmers insurance group farmers.farmers agreed to provide a defense for hsin and bbrc.hsin and bbrc also tendered the claim to ace.on june,ace indicated to hsin counsel that it was still investigating coverage,but that its preliminary coverage evaluation entitles the insureds to a defense in the walker lawsuit,subject to the conditions of the policy and applicable law.nevertheless,ace never retained defense counsel for hsin and bbrc.it eventually paid farmers for attorney fees.

on october,ace filed a complaint for declaratory relief against hsin,bbrc and hou institution.the complaint sought a judicial declaration that ace had no duty to defend or indemnify from the claims asserted in the walker action.on october,ace filed a first amended complaint adding walker as a defendant.
on june,the parties in the walker action attended a settlement conference and agreed to settle walker claims.they signed a written agreement on june.under the terms of the settlement,the walker defendants agreed to stipulate to liability and to allow a trier of fact to determine the amount of damages.the walker defendants agreed to pay the farmers policy limit of and to assign any claims and causes of action they might have against ace or their agents or brokers to walker.in return,walker agreed not to execute the judgment against the walker defendants.

meanwhile,on august,ace filed a summary judgment motion in its declaratory relief action.the hearing on the motion was scheduled for september.walker moved to continue the hearing because of the stay,because the settlement was still pending court approval,and because she needed time to conduct discovery.walker requested the hearing be continued to january.the trial court granted a continuance to october.
on october,walker filed a in the ace action.in her capacity as assignee of the walker defendants claims she alleged causes of action for breach of the duty to defend,negligence,misrepresentation,breach of contract,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.she alleged ace knew hsin was seeking coverage that would protect him and bbrc from claims arising from theories of negligence and the alter ego doctrine and told hsin and bbrc such coverage would be provided,yet failed to provide such coverage.ace demurred to the.
when walker filed her opposition papers to the summary judgment motion,she again requested a continuance to allow her time to conduct discovery.walker stated the court had approved the settlement in the walker action on september,but that she needed days to conduct discovery.walker argued she needed time to conduct discovery regarding the allegations set forth in ace complaint and in her.walker claimed she needed to talk to representatives of bbrc and the insurance agent who sold the ace policy to find out what was said with regard to who would be the named insured on the policy.walker needed this information to support her claim that the policy inadvertently listed hou institution instead of bbrc as the named insured.walker also claimed she needed to depose the insurance agent to support her claim of negligence and misrepresentation in failing to deliver the agreed upon coverage.
on november,the trial court issued its written ruling on ace summary judgment motion.it denied walker request for a continuance and granted ace motion for summary judgment.
as to the request for continuance,the court stated that walker proposed conducting discovery into an alleged error in naming hou as the insured instead of bbrc and into the representations made concerning the nature and scope of the policy.the court stated that the dispositive issue in the summary judgment motion was whether the claim made by walker was within the terms of the policy,and that the items she proposed for discovery would not lead to facts essential to her opposition on that issue.
as to the summary judgment motion,the trial court found the policy express exclusion for any claim for bodily injury or property damage arising from the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any auto owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured to be dispositive of the issue of coverage.
on december,the trial court ruled on ace demurrer to walker.the trial court sustained the demurrer to the causes of action for breach of the duty to defend,breach of contract,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing without leave to amend.the court found its earlier ruling on the summary judgment motion which found no possibility of coverage dispositive of these issues.
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the negligence and misrepresentation causes of action with leave to amend.the court ruled the complaint did not allege that auto coverage was requested and not provided and did not sufficiently allege a misrepresentation.
on january,walker filed a first amended for damages containing a single cause of action for breach of the duty to defend.ace again demurred on the ground it could not be liable for breaching a duty to defend where the court had already ruled there was no actual or potential coverage under the policy.ace further argued there could be no resulting damages from failure to defend because the walker defendants were fully defended by another insurer.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal followed.
