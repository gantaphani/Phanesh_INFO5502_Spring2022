the preliminary issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in determining that no jury trial was effectively demanded on the single remaining issue regarding the life insurance policy before the district court on remand,mega obligation to pay,or in different terms,pieniozek entitlement to payment.we conclude that the district court properly determined that no timely jury demand was filed and served by either party with respect to the only issue before it on remand.further,we find no error with respect to mega remaining issues on appeal,and affirm the judgment of the district court.
ii.facts and procedural history 
the basic facts are as follows.in september,kellie pieniozek applied for a life insurance policy with mega and also applied for accidental death coverage.the application reflected an income of per week.mega issued a life insurance policy to pieniozek with a death benefit of and an accidental death benefit of.
pieniozek died on december,in a accident when she swerved to avoid striking a deer.defendant was a passenger in the car at the time.mega does not contend suicide or foul play in connection with pieniozek death.
after pieniozek filed a claim with mega on his wife life insurance policy,mega discovered that pieniozek was earning much less than per week.mega claims that if it had known pieniozek actual income,it would have not issued a policy,or it would have issued a policy with lower coverage.
on may,mega filed a two count complaint for declaratory judgment.count of the complaint sought a declaration that mega was entitled to rescind kellie pieniozek life insurance policy on the grounds that pieniozek misrepresented her income on the policy application.in count,mega sought an alternative declaration that if the district court determined that mega was not entitled to rescission,the accidental death benefit was not payable because accidental death was not established by an autopsy.no jury was demanded.
pieniozek filed an answer on october.the answer was a general denial and no jury was demanded.on december,and without leave of court,pieniozek filed an amended answer which included a jury demand.except for the jury demand,the amended answer was identical to the original answer.
after mega moved for summary judgment and with leave of the district court,pieniozek filed counterclaims,with jury demand,for payment on the life insurance policy count and bad faith count.mega answered and also moved for summary judgment on the counterclaims.pieniozek opposed mega motion and moved for summary judgment on his counterclaim for breach of contract.
the district court granted mega motion for summary judgment as to pieniozek bad faith claim,but granted pieniozek motion for summary judgment as to the contract claim and entered judgment for pieniozek.both sides appealed.this court affirmed the district court in granting summary judgment in favor of mega on pieniozek bad faith claim,but vacated and remanded for resolution by a the issue of mega obligation and pieniozek entitlement under the life insurance policy.see mega life health ins.

both parties again appealed.mega appeal claims that the district court erred by ruling that a jury trial was not required on remand,by not applying the law of the case with respect to the insured annual income and finding the term annual income to be ambiguous,and by awarding interest at a rate of.pieniozek acknowledges that his appeal regarding dismissal of his amended is moot unless the case is remanded.
iii.law and analysis 
neither party timely demanded a jury trial 
the first issue requiring resolution by this court is whether the district court properly denied mega contention it was entitled to a trial by jury upon remand from the first appeal.we address that issue at the outset because if the district court erred,a reversal and remand would be required.
interpretation of the federal rules of civil procedure presents a question of law subject to de novo review,and denial of a jury trial is reviewed with the most exacting scrutiny.city of morgantown royal ins.burns lawther,cir citing mcbride sharpe,cir.the right to trial by jury is fundamental,and this court indulge s every reasonable presumption against waiver.lamarca turner,cir quoting aetna ins.kennedy.

in its complaint,mega sought a declaration that it was entitled to rescind kellie pieniozek life insurance policy because the annual income stated on her insurance application was a material misrepresentation.this case came before the district court on diversity jurisdiction,and under alabama law,materiality of a misrepresentation on a policy application is triable by a jury.bennett mutual of omaha ins,cir citing federal kemper life assurance first bank,cir state farm ins.whiddon,so d alfa life ins.lewis,so d,citing bennett,at clark.farm bureau mut.cas.ins,so d.mega could have demanded a jury trial in its complaint for rescission but failed to do so.
pieniozek answered on october,in the form of a general denial and did not make a jury demand.on december,pieniozek filed,without leave of the district court,an amended answer which included a jury demand.the amended answer was identical to the original answer save for the jury demand.
amendments not introducing new issues do not renew a party right to demand a jury trial.guajardo estelle,cir citing.general life ins.breslin,cir the original answer of the appellant,which did not contain a demand for a jury trial,contained a denial of the allegations of the appellee complaint the amended answer,which contained a demand for a jury trial,did not raise any issues which were in any material way different from those presented by the original answer.in such a case the waiver originally made remains effective and the subsequent demand is ineffective,abrogated on other grounds by thornburgh abbott,d.pieniozek amended answer demanding a jury trial was ineffective because it was outside the time parameters for demanding a jury trial established by rule and did not raise new issues upon which a party may properly demand a jury trial.
subsequently,with leave of the district court,pieniozek filed counterclaims for breach of contract and bad faith.the counterclaims included a jury demand.
the question that emerges is whether pieniozek counterclaim for breach of contract,accompanied by a request for a jury,raised a new issue within the meaning of rule that would give rise to a renewed right to demand a jury.the term new issues has been interpreted to mean new issues of fact,not new theories of reco
