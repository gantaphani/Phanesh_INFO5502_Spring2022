in this case of first impression,we examine the scope,application and limitations of insurance code section that statute defined and authorized a specific mechanism for the creation by physicians of cooperative corporations and trusts in order to provide,by means of interindemnity contracts,indemnity and defense coverage for medical malpractice claims.the statute authorized the establishment of a trust to be funded by member contributions and assessments which would be utilized,along with the income derived therefrom,to provide malpractice defense and indemnity coverage.
section,however,imposed certain limitations on that coverage.such limitations,as are relevant here,related to the requirement of a time sensitive good standing membership of any physician seeking coverage for an asserted malpractice claim.the record clearly demonstrates that such requirement was not met in this case.therefore,the coverage required to support the order of a trial court approving the payment of a claim from trust funds is not present.as a result,we hold that the pending petition for a writ of mandate,directing the trial court to vacate its order approving the payment of a claim on behalf of a physician who was not entitled to coverage,must be granted.
factual and procedural background 
in response to a perceived medical malpractice crisis,the legislature in,enacted emergency legislation permitting the creation of cooperative corporations consisting solely of physicians and surgeons.section became effective on october,as an emergency measure and authorized the formation of interindemnity arrangements among groups of physicians to provide indemnity and defense coverage for any medical malpractice claims that might be asserted against members of the cooperative corporations created under the statute.we are concerned here with two entities formed pursuant to the statute physicians interindemnity cooperative corporation pic and physicians interindemnity trust pit.the physician members,including the petitioner herein,paid the initial contribution and subsequent assessments that were to be used to fund defense and indemnity coverage.
by the summer of,malpractice claims against several of the members of the pit had increased in number and severity to the point where the pit could not continue in operation without levying and collecting a massive assessment against all of the members in order to pay estimated potential liabilities of million in september of,an assessment of million was approved by pit board of trustees and all members were so advised.at about the same time,the board prepared and submitted to the members a proposed plan for winding up and terminating the trust as of september.this plan,which also involved an offer by norcal mutual insurance company to provide prospective coverage for all members commencing october,was approved by of the members.the pit,however,would remain liable under the plan for all claims that had been asserted by the cut off date of september.
unfortunately,the pit was unsuccessful in collecting the new assessment from the physician members.as a result,on march,the california department of corporations filed an action against pit and pic seeking,among other things,the appointment of a receiver.on march,david gill,the real party in interest herein,was appointed as receiver hereafter,receiver and was given authority to enforce and collect all debts of the pit and pic,including unpaid member assessments the receiver also undertook to resolve,settle or otherwise dispose of all of the then outstanding malpractice claims that had been asserted on or before september.
one of those claims had been asserted by young mi kim young against joong tai kim,who,until march,had been one of the physician members of pit.kim became a member of pit on march,with coverage retroactive to april.kim treatment of young a minor child six years of age that led to the latter malpractice claim began on or about december,and thus fell within the period for which coverage was provided by pit.apparently,kim treatment of young extended into,after which she saw other doctors in an attempt to resolve problems apparently created by kim negligence.
sometime prior to january of,young filed an action in the los angeles superior court entitled young mi kim joong tai kim.county no.bs.pit undertook to defend kim and provided him counsel.in january,the matter was sent to arbitration pursuant to an agreement that had been signed on young behalf at the time of her first visit to kim.thereafter,discovery was taken and the matter ultimately went before the arbitrator on august.on september,after a hearing,at which neither kim nor any counsel on his behalf were present,the arbitrator issued an award in the principal sum of,plus interest from the date the award was confirmed.the superior court entered an order confirming that award on november.
kim was not present at the arbitration,and it was consequently handled as an uncontested matter,because sometime prior to june,he apparently had fled the country to avoid sentencing on a federal charge of filing a false tax return.he had pled guilty to that charge on october,and had been scheduled to be sentenced on june,
as already indicated,kim membership in pit ended on march.beginning in early,kim had became delinquent in the payment of the quarterly fees due to pit.in march of,pit sent a notice to kim stating that due to his failure to pay the quarterly fees for the and quarters of,the quarter of and the special assessment due on december,totaling,his membership could be terminated.by a letter dated march,pic notified kim that his membership was terminated pursuant to section of the pit agreement effective march,
on or about september,young submitted to the receiver a medical malpractice claim seeking payment of her judgment against kim.the total claim was then in the sum of,with interest calculated through september.on august,the receiver made a motion in the superior court for approval of young claim.in support of his motion,the receiver recited the general factual circumstances described above and then argued that pit was liable to pay young judgment even though kim had breached the pit agreement by failing to pay quarterly fees and one assessment and,as a result,had been terminated as a member approximately months prior to the entry of young judgment.the receiver rationalized this result by arguing that section should be read as terminating only the member right to indemnification,but not necessarily the pit obligation to victims of the member malpractice to reject a third party claim solely because of a member breach and termination is an absurd result inasmuch as the pit was created to protect the innocent victims of medical malpractice from the mistakes and breaches by their doctors.
petitioner opposed the motion,on the grounds that the provisions of section of the pit agreement precluded such liability of pit see fn,ante and,in addition,the payment of young claim would directly offend section,subdivision a and d 
the trial court rejected petitioner argument and,relying on the previous ruling by judge shook see fn,ante,granted the receiver motion to approve the payment of young claim out of pit funds petitioner then sought relief in this court by extraordinary writ.we issued an order to show cause,provided a briefing schedule and set the matter for oral argument.
contentions of the parties 
petitioner primary argument is that there is no legal basis for imposing liability on pit for the judgment obtained by young.such a result,he argues,is directly contrary to the express provisions of section,subdivision a and d see fn,ante and similarly conflicts,with the clear provisions of sections and of the pit agreement see fn,ante.petitioner likewise takes direct issue with the receiver argument that the legislature intent in enacting section was to protect the interests of malpractice victims rather than provide a legal mechanism to assist physicians in obtaining economic malpractice coverage.petitioner rejects the receiver contention that a claimant could have rights,the available assets of pit,greater than those of the physician members.
the receiver,on the other hand,vigorously argues that both the relevant statutory provisions,as well as the pit agreement,must be read so as to protect the interests of the claimants over those of the physician members of pit.to do otherwise would provide a financial incentive for members to breach the pit agreement so as to preclude a recovery against pit and thus lessen their ultimate liability.the receiver also contends that it would be inequitable to deny young claim on the ground of kim termination prior to entry of the judgment in young favor.finally,the receiver makes two technical procedural arguments relating to petitioner standing to oppose the receiver motion or to challenge court approvals of claim settlements made by the receiver and petitioner failure to serve young in this proceeding since it is the payment of her judgment that is at issue.
discussion 
the power of a claimant to recover from the pit was limited by both relevant statutory provisions and the agreement establishing the pit 
as we have already indicated,the legislature enacted section in in response to a perceived medical malpractice crisis.mundy mutual protection trust d.mundy.it authorized interindemnity agreements among and between physicians and the creation of an interindemnity corporation and a trust to provide indemnity for the members of the corporation.it was designed to provide doctors with an alternative to costly medical malpractice insurance.this statute permitted physicians and surgeons to pool their resources to cover medical malpractice claims.the cooperative ventures formed pursuant to this legislation,however,were prohibited from representing that they were insurance companies,subd.f.
under the statute,the terms of a physician membership in the trust is to be governed by a trust agreement,subd.a.a prospective member receives a disclosure statement which contains,on the first or cover page,a legend in boldface type reading substantially as follows the interindemnity arrangement contemplated herein provides that participating members have unlimited personal liability for assessments which may be levied to pay for the professional negligence or other liability authorized by this section.no assurances can be given regarding the amount or frequency of assessments which may be so levied,or that all participating members will make timely payment of their assessments to cover the professional negligence or other liability authorized by this section,subd.c.thus,each physician member agreed to accept unlimited personal liability for any and all assessments made by the board of trustees of pit in order to pay outstanding qualified claims.
if a malpractice claimant obtained a judgment against a member,the claimant had the right to directly assert that member rights to indemnification from the trust,subd.a.prior to a judgment or settlement,a claimant did not have a direct right of action against the trust.mundy,supra,d at.upon entry of final judgment,however,the claimant would have a lien on the trust corpus,which lien would serve as security for payment of the judgment,but such lien would be limited to the extent of the judgment debtor rights to indemnification,subd.a italics added.
in addition,the trust agreement was required to contain provisions whereby the membership of a physician who did not pay an assessment,or who otherwise failed to comply with the trust agreement,could be terminated by the board of trustees,subd.a d and e.the statute provided that,upon such termination,the indemnity coverage shall thereupon terminate as to all claims then pending against that the person and in respect to all occurrences prior to the date of that termination of membership,subd.a d and e italics added.
this statutory limitation upon the power of a claimant to call upon assets of the pit was reinforced and restated in sections and of the agreement signed by all physician members establishing the pit see fn,ante.
on this record,the receiver had no legal basis for seeking an order to disburse pit funds to young 
there is no dispute in this record that kim membership in pit,and thus his entitlement to indemnity,was terminated effective march,pursuant to the provisions of section,subdivision a d and e as well as section of the pit agreement.it is equally undisputed that young claim against kim was not reduced to judgment until november,nearly months later.indeed,the arbitration hearing on which the judgment was based did not even commence until august,nearly one and a half years after kim right to indemnification under the pit had been terminated.
the mandatory legal consequences of these undisputed facts was that kim right to indemnify coverage was thereupon terminated as to all claims then pending against kim and in respect to all occurrences prior to the date of the termination of membership,subd.a d and e,italics added.
the receiver does not dispute this conclusion but argues and persuaded the trial court to conclude that young was nonetheless entitled to assert her claim against the pit.put another way,the receiver takes the position that even though kim may have lost his right of indemnification,young was still entitled to the payment of her judgment.the receiver cites three reasons for his position pit is equitably estopped to deny young claim denial of young claim would be contrary to the legislative purposes behind the enactment of section and disapproval of young claim would harm the public by rendering interindemnity malpractice coverage agreements meaningless.none of these arguments has any merit.
a.there is no basis for estopping pit denial of young claim 
at the time that young first asserted her claim and filed the action in which her judgment was ultimately rendered,kim was entitled to indemnification.an attorney was provided by pit.following the termination of kim coverage,however,that defense assistance was withdrawn the receiver argues that young was never informed that pit could withdraw kim defense and terminate its liability for coverage and,in reliance on such state of ignorance,agreed to arbitrate her claim,thus effectively delaying the time when a judgment could be entered.the receiver,however,provides absolutely no factual support for this speculative conclusion.we are not informed as to the date when young allegedly agreed to arbitrate a dispute that she may have been contractually bound to arbitrate in any event.similarly,we have not been advised as to whether or not the arbitration could have reasonably been held at any time prior to march,the date of the termination of kim coverage nor are we told as to whether a judicial resolution of the dispute could have occurred and resulted in the entry of a judgment prior to that date.finally,we are provided with no factual basis for concluding that pit intended that young act on her assumed ignorance of the terms and conditions of kim coverage under the trust or that any acts or omissions of pit in any way induced reliance on young part.thus,at least two of the elements of estoppel are only supported by the speculative argument of the receiver.this is obviously insufficient.
the receiver also argues that pit should be estopped to deny young claim on the ground that it failed to disclose the terms and conditions of its coverage liability to hospitals when it provided certificates of participation to its members,including kim.this argument is more than a little puzzling.assuming there was such a disclosure failure with respect to hospitals,it is not clear how such fact would impact the handling of young claim.in any event,the certificate issued to the physician members clearly spelled out that coverage was restricted and subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement and that a named participant may withdraw,or be expelled,from participation in the trust at any time.italics added.this secondary argument by the receiver likewise is not sufficient to establish a basis for estoppel 
denial of young claim is consistent with the legislative purpose and intent behind section and would not harm the public 
the receiver argues that section was enacted to benefit the public and therefore to deny young claim would effectively undermine that purpose and harm the public.petitioner,on the other hand,insists that the legislative purpose of section was to provide members protection from medical malpractice claims.stoops abbassi th,d.we find ourselves in agreement with petitioner.that was our view when we filed our decision in stoops and it is our view today.
as we recognized in stoops,and as the court in mundy stated in its historical discussion of the statute,the legislature considered this an emergency measure d ue to the continuing medical malpractice insurance crisis and that it was necessary that this act take effect immediately so that the interindemnity arrangements may commence functioning at the earliest possible time in order to avert the loss of services provided by health care providers.citation.mundy,supra,d at.
such clear expression of legislative purpose in no way supports the receiver argument.the legislature was obviously concerned about public safety being harmed by a reduction in the number of physicians available to serve the public in light of ever escalating insurance premium costs.who would be entitled to enforce claims and under what circumstances was spelled out in the statute and in the pit agreement.the latter document,in section see fn,ante,provided that before retroactive coverage could be available to a member such as kim,the member would have to be legally obligated to pay the amounts as damages for an injury and that such damages had to be finally determined by a final judgment against the member entered on or after the commencement date in this case,march,and the termination date in this case,march.
we therefore reject the receiver argument that a denial of young claim would somehow undermine the overall legislative purpose behind the enactment of section.just the opposite is true.the legislature purpose is clear.it was to allow physicians to band together and enter into agreements providing interindemnity coverage for those members against whom claims had been asserted.strict conditions for coverage were imposed by both statute and contract.we can not avoid the mandate of such unambiguous specific conditions by adopting some imaginary legislative goal that is belied by the statutory and contractual language,read as a whole,and the clear legislative history.
for the same reasons,we can not conclude that a denial of young claim would in any way harm the public interest as argued by the receiver.we see no reason to believe that physician members would deliberately breach their obligations under the pit agreement so as to avoid liability to claimants.the receiver concern in this regard is overblown.a member who took such action would lose coverage yet he or she would still have personal liability on the claim.moreover,the pit membership,as a group,has a right to rely upon the strict enforcement of the rules to which they all agreed and which limit and restrict the circumstances under which expenditures from the trust fund will be made.
there is no merit to the receiver arguments regarding service or standing 
the receiver claims that the petitioner,whose predecessor had filed this matter as a class action,does not have standing to proceed as a plaintiff because no class has been certified and he has not been certified as a class representative.we need not really address that argument since the petitioner chen is a physician member of pit and,as such,has a substantial personal interest in preventing improper disposition of pit assets.as we have already explained,the physician members,including chen,have unlimited personal liability for all assessments that are made in order to satisfy the claims of qualified claimants.every claim that is approved for payment out of the trust fund will have a direct and immediate adverse economic impact on chen.put another way,he is a party defendant in this action and,to the extent that claims are improperly paid,he would be directly and adversely affected.assessments against petitioner would be increased.
thus,there is no question,that petitioner is a party who can legitimately and individually claim a beneficial interest in the subject matter of the trial court order that we review.that a class has not been certified is of no significance.carsten psychology examining com.cal d,a beneficial interest means some special interest to be served or some particular right to be preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the public at large.petitioner would,in any event,be entitled to oppose the receiver motion as an individual.
the receiver also complains that the petitioner chen has not been formally substituted in as the petitioner in intervention.it would,however,seem pointless to deny to petitioner consideration of his objection because of technical matters of form when any such application would clearly be granted and the trial court has apparently permitted the petitioner chen to proceed without a formal substitution the interests of judicial economy and expeditious resolution of disputes dictate our rejection of this technical argument that would only serve to delay our decision in this matter for no useful purpose.
finally,the receiver contention that the petition was required to be served on young is without merit.the receiver cites us to no relevant authority requiring that young be made a party to these writ proceedings.the receiver sought authority to pay young judgment from pit assets.the trial court ruling,and the decision of this court,will have no impact on that judgment or on any vested right of young.it is true that young might be a proper party to these proceedings as her interests might be indirectly affected by our decision see manfredi levine superior court th,d.thus,she could have sought to participate.she did not.clearly she is not a necessary party since a decision may be reached in her absence.put another way,while young might be entitled to participate by an intervention application,it is not required that she be made a party moreover,she did not seek to intervene in the trial court action.she will be no more adversely affected by our decision than any other unsatisfied claimant of any other physician member of pit.
disposition 
the petition for writ of mandate is granted.let a writ of mandate issue directing the trial court to vacate its order of september,granting the receiver motion and to enter a new and different order denying the same.petitioner shall recover his costs incurred in these writ proceedings.
unless otherwise indicated,all statutory references are to the insurance code.
the legislature expressly stated that the act was an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health,or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution,and shall go into immediate effect.the facts constituting such necessity are due to the continuing medical malpractice insurance crisis,it is necessary that this act take effect immediately so that the interindemnity arrangements may commence functioning at the earliest possible time in order to avert the loss of services provided by health care providers.stats,ch.
there were approximately malpractice claims against various members of the pit that were either unresolved or unpaid as of september.
