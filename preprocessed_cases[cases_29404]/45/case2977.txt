in late and early medpartners,medpartners,and a different entity,southern california medical corporation scmc,filed lawsuits against appellants albert barnett,gloria mayer mayer and thomas mayer mayer the underlying action.in the underlying action,medpartners and scmc alleged appellants engaged in a variety of misconduct,including making disparaging remarks about them.appellants tendered the defense of the underlying action to respondent fireman fund insurance company firemans,asserting they were additional insureds under a comprehensive general liability policy the cgl policy issued by firemans to medpartners.firemans rejected the tender.
in the present lawsuit,appellants alleged firemans refusal to defend and indemnify them in the underlying action breached its obligations under the cgl policy.firemans demurrer to the complaint argued appellants were not entitled to a defense or indemnity because there was no possibility appellants were acting in an insured capacity when they committed the conduct alleged in the underlying action and the conduct alleged in the underlying action was not covered by the cgl policy.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and this appeal followed.

barnett is a physician who founded and owned scmc,a professional medical corporation that operated an integrated health care delivery system the system providing primary and specialty medical services and inpatient and outpatient hospital services under capitated contracts with health maintenance organizations.in november scmc entered into a contract with caremark physician services,caremark under which caremark managed the operations of the system on behalf of scmc,but reserved to scmc the exclusive control over all decisions relating to the practice of medicine.this reservation was required to comply with california prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.see,generally,conrad medical bd.of california th,d.
in medpartners,a large physician practice management company,acquired caremark.following the acquisition barnett and mayer became executive officers of medpartners and mayer became an employee of medpartners.medpartners is the named insured under the cgl policy issued by fireman.
after medpartners acquired caremark,medpartners made fundamental changes in the management and organizational structure of the system.appellants expressed concern to medpartners and others that,under the changes implemented by medpartners,the system would no longer be supervised and directed by physicians concerned and entrusted with providing quality care to patients instead the system would be directed by a corporation more concerned with corporate revenues than with the benefits provided to patients,thereby adversely affecting patient care and violating california prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.appellants sought to advance the interests of medpartners by urging medpartners to comply with california prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.
in november medpartners terminated appellants as officers and employees of medpartners.one reason for the terminations was to retaliate against appellants for their complaints about medpartners noncompliance with the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.medpartners then filed the underlying action against appellants scmc subsequently filed a complaint in intervention in the underlying action.medpartners lawsuit alleged,among other things,that appellants told numerous persons within and outside of the medpartners organization that medpartners methods of doing business were flawed and would result in medpartners failure,and made other representations that disparaged and damaged medpartners.medpartners complaint pleaded causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,intentional interference with contractual relations,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and fraud.
scmc complaint in intervention alleged similar misconduct by appellants and that appellants made disparaging and damaging remarks about scmc.scmc complaint in intervention pleaded claims for declaratory relief and for intentional interference with contractual relations.
appellants asked fireman to defend and indemnify them in connection with both medpartners complaint and scmc complaint in intervention.appellants asserted they were additional insureds under the cgl policy issued to medpartners,and that the allegations of the complaint created a potentially covered claim for personal injury advertising injury within the meaning of the cgl policy.fireman declined to defend or indemnify appellants.
b.the present action 
appellants filed this action against fireman,alleging its refusal to defend and indemnify them in the underlying action breached the contractual and good faith obligations owed to them under the cgl policy.fireman demurrer to appellants complaint asserted two arguments.first,fireman argued appellants were not insureds under the cgl policy because barnett and mayer qualified as insureds only with respect to their duties as medpartners officers,and mayer qualified as an insured only for acts within the scope of his employment.fireman argued that under milazo gulf ins.d.milazo,acts by an additional insured that are antagonistic or hostile to the business interests of the named insured can not be acts within the scope of their employment or with respect to their duties as officers of the named insured.second,fireman argued that in the underlying action medpartners and scmc did not allege facts suggesting any possibility that appellants alleged misconduct would be a covered act within the personal injury or advertising injury coverages of the cgl policy.
appellants argued that cgl policy contained no language barring coverage under the circumstances alleged in the underlying action,and that milazo was distinguishable because it involved insuring clauses and factual circumstances different from those present here.appellants also argued that even if milazo excluded coverage for medpartners lawsuit,milazo rationale had no application to a third party action like the scmc lawsuit.finally,appellants argued that in the underlying action medpartners and scmc alleged facts that could support liability for defamation within both the personal injury and the advertising injury coverages of the cgl policy.
the trial court sustained fireman demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed appellants complaint this appeal argues the trial court ruling was in error.

principles governing duty to defend 
the interpretation of the meaning of an insurance policy and the scope of coverage are questions of law.western mutual ins.yamamoto th,d.whether a third party action asserts a potentially covered claim under the policy triggering the duty to defend requires us to interpret the language of the insuring agreement and is a question of law.alex robertson imperial casualty indemnity th,d potential for coverage under insuring language presents issue of law century transit systems,american empire surplus lines ins.th,d potential for coverage in light of policy exclusions presents question of law union oil international ins.th,d whether clause is ambiguous and whether insured has objectively reasonable expectation of coverage are questions of law subject to de novo review on appeal.
fireman does not deny that the cgl policy covers liability of its insureds for defamation and requires fireman to defend appellants against a lawsuit in which they were potentially liable for defamatory statements made in their insured capacities an insurer must defend any action that seeks damages potentially within the coverage of the policy.gray zurich ins.cal d.conversely,the insurer owes no duty to defend when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue that could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,quoting gray,supra,at,fn,italics omitted.however,to be entitled to a defense,the insured must prove the existence of a potential for coverage,while the insurer must establish the absence of any such potential.in other words,the insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not.montrose,supra,at,d,italics omitted.the determination of whether the duty to defend exists is made initially by comparing the allegations in the third party complaint with the terms of the policy,and considering extrinsic facts that reveal a possibility the claim may be covered by the policy.the existence of the duty to defend turns on all facts known by the insurer at the inception of the third party lawsuit.id.at,d.if the facts alleged by the third party or known to the insurer create any potential for indemnity under the policy,the insurer must provide a defense even though noncovered acts are also alleged by the third party action.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.
in this case,we address two issues.first,assuming appellants were insureds under the cgl policy,did the underlying action assert a potentially covered claim against them and second,did appellants qualify as insureds under the cgl policy 
analysisa.the defamation claims fall within the personal injury coverage 
the personal injury coverage of the cgl policy provides coverage for injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services.this clause covers claims against the insured for defamation.truck ins.exchange bennett th,d.appellants argue the underlying action raised a potentially covered claim for defamation because the complainants alleged that appellants told numerous persons that medpartners methods of doing business were flawed and would result in medpartners failure,and made other representations that disparaged and damaged medpartners and scmc.these allegations,argue appellants,trigger the personal injury coverage of the cgl policy.
fireman argues,however,that personal injury coverages of liability policies apply only to acts enumerated by the policy as covered offenses.fibreboard hartford accident indemnity th,d.it cites lindsey admiral ins,for the proposition that the insurer has no obligation to defend unless the underlying complaint alleges all of the elements necessary to establish an enumerated offense.from this foundation,fireman argues the complaints in the underlying action did not allege all of the elements necessary to state a cause of action for defamation,and therefore it had no duty to defend the underlying action 
however,the duty to defend arises when the facts alleged in the underlying complaint give rise to a potentially covered claim regardless of the technical legal cause of action pleaded by the third party.cna casualty of california seaboard surety d,disapproved on another point in montrose chemical superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the complaints in the underlying action alleged appellants told third persons that medpartners methods of doing business were flawed and would result in its failure and made other representations that disparaged and damaged medpartners and scmc.these allegations trigger at least a potential for coverage under the personal injury coverage for defamation provided by the cgl policy 
b.the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege firemans breached a duty to defend barnett and mayer against medpartners complaint 
our discussion of the coverage afforded by the cgl policy to appellants for any defamation claim treated the underlying action as having been filed by parties with no relationship to the cgl policy.however,the underlying action by medpartners is a claim by the named insured under the cgl policy.appellants are covered as additional insureds under that policy subject to any applicable exclusionary language to the extent they were engaged in discharging their duties as corporate officers or acted within the scope of their employment.
when a person seeks coverage as an additional insured under a policy issued to a corporation as the named insured,an officer or employee of the corporation is entitled to a defense if he or she was acting in an insured capacity when allegedly engaged in the conduct.see,generally,olson federal ins.d.section ii of the cgl policy identifies who qualifies as additional insureds under the cgl policy it provides that executive officers of medpartners are insureds,but only with respect to their duties as your officers the allegations of the complaint,which we accept as true on demurrer were that barnett and mayer a t all times relevant were executive officers of medpartners,acting with respect to their duties as medpartners executive officers,and that they were acting to advance the interests of medpartners when they expressed concerns that the changes implemented by medpartners would violate california prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine.these allegations,if true,could show that barnett and mayer defamatory statements that medpartners methods of doing business were flawed and would result in medpartners failure and other representations that disparaged and damaged medpartners were made in their capacities as executive officers seeking to discharge their duties to assure that medpartners fulfilled its legal obligations.accordingly,there exists a potential that barnett and mayer were acting in an insured capacity when they allegedly engaged in the conduct,and therefore barnett and mayer have stated a cause of action against fireman for breach of the duty to defend the medpartners complaint.
however,the claim by mayer stands on a different footing because,unlike the protection afforded to officers,the employee subdivision of section ii of the cgl policy that extends coverage to mayer as an employee of medpartners expressly excludes or limits coverage based on the identity of the party making the claim.the employee section section ii,subdivision,which covers employees for acts within the scope of their employment,specifies in pertinent part that no employee is an insured for b odily injury or personal injury t o you.italics added.because defamation is covered only by virtue of the personal injury coverages of the cgl policy,the limitation contained in section ii,subdivision.a excludes from coverage any claim against an employee for defaming the named insured.because the only covered offense potentially raised by the medpartners complaint against mayer was that he defamed medpartners,the policy exclusion eliminates any potential that mayer would be covered for medpartners claim against him.
fireman cites several cases to support its argument that when an individual is an additional insured under a policy issued to an entity and the entity sues the individual for conduct detrimental or injurious to the entity,as a matter of law there can be no duty to defend under the primary insured policy.however,the cases cited by fireman do not support that broad proposition.the principal case cited by fireman is milazo,supra,d,in which a partnership was insured under a comprehensive general liability policy,and a partner was an additional insured with respect to his liability as a partner.id.at.the partnership sued milazo,an individual partner,alleging that he breached his fiduciary duty by misappropriating a partnership opportunity the insurer defended milazo under a reservation of rights.the jury verdict held milazo liable for misappropriating the partnership opportunity,and the issue on appeal was whether the insurer was obligated to indemnify milazo.id.at.the milazo court,after concluding the policy covered the partnership liabilities and provided coverage to milazo as an additional insured only to the extent he had derivative liability for the partnership liabilities,held there was no obligation to indemnify him in his insured capacity.the milazo court reasoned that a partner who acts to misappropriate a partnership asset or opportunity is necessarily engaged in conduct adverse to the partnership,and because the partnership entity could not be liable for such misconduct,milazo could have no derivative liability and therefore the insurance did not cover the claim against him id.at.
milazo is distinguishable from the instant case in important aspects.first,unlike the insuring language that the milazo court construed as providing coverage for only derivative liability,the insuring language of the cgl policy does not appear to condition coverage for executive officers on the requirement that the corporation have direct liability for their misconduct.second,and more importantly,the milazo court evaluated the duty to indemnify after a trial that established the additional insured misconduct was necessarily committed in his individual capacity in contrast,fireman duty to defend is tested by whether there was any potential that barnett and mayer alleged conduct was committed with respect to their duties as executive officers.accord,farr farm bureau ins.of nebraska cir,fn.test for coverage is not whether slander falls within scope of duties of officer,but whether officers were acting on behalf of the corporation as opposed to themselves when they engaged in the alleged behavior.because the complaint alleges barnett and mayer were seeking to further the corporate interests when they criticized medpartners,it is possible they were engaged with respect to their duties as executive officers when they committed the alleged misconduct and therefore a potential for coverage exists.
the other california cases cited by fireman do not support fireman broad contention.for example,in olson federal ins,supra,d,the plaintiff argued he was entitled to a defense as an additional insured under a policy issued to olson farms the court rejected the claim because the dispute did not arise out of his conduct as a director of olson farms but instead involved a dispute over the management of a different corporation.id.at.in plate growers d,the court did not consider the interpretation of an insurance policy or the duty to defend the issue was whether the corporate agents were entitled to indemnity from their employer under corporations code section.in transamerica ins.sayble d,the court held merely that an errors and omissions policy issued to an attorney required allegations of negligence while rendering services to his clients and did not provide coverage for a dispute arising from dissolution of a law partnership.finally,in republic indemnity schofield,supra,th,d,the court held only that a workers compensation policy did not protect the employer officers against a claim for constructive discharge because the policy insured the employer,and the officers were not the employer.
the authorities from other jurisdictions cited by fireman are not persuasive.in farr farm bureau ins.of nebraska,supra,the named insured corporation sued the plaintiffs former directors or officers of the corporation,alleging they breached their fiduciary duty by trying to thwart a sale of the corporation.the insurer rejected plaintiffs tender of the defense to the insurer,plaintiffs sued the insurer,and the trial court ruled after a bench trial that there was no duty to defend the plaintiffs under a comprehensive general liability policy worded similarly to the cgl policy.id.at.farr noted the officers were insureds only with respect to their duties as officers,and concluded the insurer had no duty to defend because an officer can not be acting with respect to his or her duties when that fiduciary duty to the corporation is breached,and all torts pleaded against the officers in the underlying action necessarily involved breaching their fiduciary obligations to the corporation.id.at.the farr court buttressed its conclusion by noting the purpose and intent of the policies were to cover the corporation liability to third persons rather than internal disputes among shareholders.to the extent this observation contains an implicit interpretation of the policies in farr as providing protection to officers only when the claim against them is lodged by third persons,the cgl policy does not limit coverage for officers based on the identity of the claimant.
we decline to apply farr to this case.first,farr is silent on what precise conduct the officers in farr were accused of committing and assume d without deciding that the conduct giving rise to the underlying lawsuit would satisfy the policy definition of personal injury.farr farm bureau ins.of nebraska,supra,at.this assumption contributed to an incomplete,and in our opinion,erroneous,analysis of the duty to defend because deciding whether an officer conduct occurred with respect to his duty as an officer can not be determined in a vacuum.although the undisclosed conduct of the officers in farr may have been outside the duties of an officer,fireman cites no authority suggesting that an officer who seeks to further the interests of his corporation by criticizing management changes,or by erroneously suggesting these changes could violate the law or result in the failure of the corporation,is as a matter of law acting outside of his duties or in breach of his fiduciary obligations.second,a central tenet of farr analysis that each of the torts pleaded in the underlying action requires a breach of one or more fiduciary duties shows the farr court focused on the causes of action pleaded rather than the operative misconduct,which is not the approach used in california for purposes of evaluating the duty to defend.cna casualty of california seaboard surety,supra,d at.it is facts,not a technical,legal cause of action pleaded by third party,that give rise to a potential for a covered claim.finally,farr states that the insurance policies were intended to protect officers when they are properly carrying out their duties and are designed to protect the officer who acts to advance the business interests of the corporation,not the officer who acts in a manner that is antagonistic toward the corporation business interests.farr farm bureau ins.of nebraska,supra,at.the farr court concluded the officers there were not acting in an insured manner here,barnett and mayer alleged they were carrying out their duties as officers and were acting to further medpartners interests.
we conclude that,at least for purposes of demurrer,barnett and mayer,but not mayer,have stated facts sufficient to state a cause of action against fireman for breach of the duty to defend them against medpartners complaint in the underlying action.
c.the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege fireman breached a duty to defend all appellants against scmc complaint 
fireman does not dispute that the cgl policy insures appellants against claims for defamation made by third parties if appellants were acting in their insured capacity at the time the alleged defamatory comments were made.accordingly,
