defendant pacific indemnity pacific,which issued a fire insurance policy to plaintiff quaker hills,llc quaker hills,on a home that was destroyed by fire during the policy period,appeals from so much of a final judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,deborah batts,judge,as granted summary judgment to quaker hills on its claim for a declaratory judgment that an clause in the policy,purporting to reduce pacific total liability to percent of any covered loss,is void as a matter of new york law,and that pacific is liable to quaker hills for the entire amount of loss coverage shown in the fire insurance policy.quaker hills from so much of the judgment as ruled that it is not entitled to recover replacement costs in excess of the stated loss coverage amount on the house.for the reasons that follow,we reject quaker hills arguments on the on the appeal,we certify to the court of appeals for the state of new york questions as to whether the clause in the fire insurance policy is enforceable under new york law.
background 
at all pertinent times,quaker hills,a limited liability company incorporated in new york,owned real property in pawling,new york,on which its principal,trevor davis,a real estate developer,built a home in or about.in march,the home was destroyed by fire,a loss covered by a homeowner insurance policy the applicable policy or policy issued to quaker hills by pacific.the following description of the policy,together with its several antecedent policies and its history,is taken largely from the memorandum and order of the district court,reported at wl.the court description,which unless otherwise noted below is not substantially in dispute,was based on statements by the parties filed pursuant to rule of the local rules for the southern district in connection with each side motion for summary judgment.
a.the insurance policies 
quaker hills first obtained homeowner insurance from pacific on the home and its contents for a period beginning in december.the coverage limits were for the dwelling and for the contents.see wl,at.the premium charge for this first policy was.see id.
in august,pacific obtained an insurance replacement cost appraisal that indicated that the home replacement value was.see id.intermediaries in the various dealings between quaker hills and pacific prior to with regard to the subsequent policies covering the home included insurance broker haskell brokerage haskell and a company called c s planning,to which davis irwin cohen was a consultant.in early october,haskell informed cohen that the existing policy would be canceled on october.pacific contends that the reason was nonpayment of premium then due quaker hills does not dispute that haskell so informed cohen,but does dispute the reason.the record does not indicate that the first policy was in fact canceled.indeed,quaker hills shortly received valuation questions with respect to a renewed policy 
on october,janice collins of c s planning emailed davis assistant delia sic mitchell seven questions to answer concerning the of the existing p olicy on october,collins forwarded to haskell ed redbord a fax cover note enclosing the email with davis handwriting on it,and stated in her cover memo ed,as per our conversation this is what trevor wrote on it.janice in this email,davis answered the first five questions regarding the value of various contents of the house by placing zeros next to them.for the final question,reading desired amount of replacement coverage you want for dwelling appraised at august appraisal,davis wrote.davis does not dispute that he made these notations however,he claims these were not answers to the questions since he had no way of knowing what the estimated value of the items was.
wl,at emphases added.
in november,pacific issued a renewal policy second policy for the period december,to december,which provided coverage for the dwelling in the amount of reflecting the recent no coverage for the home contents.see id.at.the stated premium for the second policy was.however,pacific also added a apportionment of loss clause,to this policy,which stated as follows 
in the event of a covered loss to your house,other permanent structure s or contents,including all related coverages for your house and contents,the amount of the covered loss will be apportioned between you and.as follows.first,we will apply the base or any applicable special deductible to the amount of the covered loss.second,we will pay of the amount of the covered loss remaining after the application of the base or special deductible the remaining of a covered loss to your house is the amount apportioned to you.
second policy,coverage update,at emphasis added.this mean t that pacific alleged maximum liability for a covered loss would be of the stated coverage amount of,wl,at and quaker hills premium was reduced from to,see id.the district court noted that pacific claim ed it added the apportionment of loss clause to provide approximately the requested in coverage,and that quaker hills denie d ever requesting less than full coverage under the policy.id.
on january,that second policy was canceled for nonpayment of premium.coverage was not restored until june.at plaintiff request,a new policy third policy was issued,effective june,through june.the third policy also contained a apportionment of loss clause and the total premium was.id.
before the end of the period covered by the third policy,a fourth policy was issued,effective january,through january,contain ing the same apportionment of loss clause as the third p olicy.id.the fourth policy had a policy limit of.id.it also contained an extended replacement cost coverage provision versions of which had also been included in the second and third policies pursuant to which,under certain conditions,pacific would pay all reconstruction costs,even if this amount is greater than the amount of coverage for your house shown in your coverage summary,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,pacific obligation under that provision was limited,in part,as follows 
if you can not repair,replace or rebuild your house because your primary mortgagee or its assignees has recalled your mortgage,we will pay the reconstruction cost up to the amount of coverage shown in the coverage summary for your house,minus what is due to the mortgagee.
id.internal quotation marks omitted.this fourth policy was renewed for another year running from january,through january,id.at,and contained the terms of the policy in effect at the time of the fire that destroyed the home.
after the fire,quaker hills submitted a timely claim to pacific,seeking more than million in losses and extended replacement costs.pacific refused to pay extended replacement costs and refused to pay more than percent of the stated loss coverage.the home was never rebuilt.
in september,bank of america the bank,which held the mortgage to the property,commenced a foreclosure action with respect to the home.thereafter,quaker hills and the bank entered into a standstill and forbearance agreement,in which quaker hills acknowledged that it was in default and the bank agreed to delay demanding full payment of the outstanding mortgage.pacific agreed to pay directly to the bank the amount that pacific conceded was owed under the policy,approximately million,or percent of the stated coverage amount.see wl,at.
b.the present action 
quaker hills commenced the present action in the district court,with jurisdiction premised on diversity of citizenship,alleging that pacific breached the insurance contract by refusing to pay the full stated amount of loss coverage in the policy,and to pay replacement costs.quaker hills sought a declaratory judgment to that effect,along with damages totaling approximately million including the replacement costs.in support of its claim for payment of the full amount of loss coverage,quaker hills asserted,inter alia,that the policy clause is unenforceable in new york state the state because it does not conform to the minimum requirements imposed by new york law as reflected in the state standard fire insurance policy.
pacific opposed quaker hills challenge to the clause,contending,inter alia,that such clauses are analogous to enforceable clauses,and that,in any event,davis had specifically insisted on the clause in order to reduce the premiums payable on the policies.pacific opposed quaker hills claim for replacement costs on the ground that quaker hills had not been able to rebuild the house because its mortgage on the property had been recalled.following discovery,each side moved for summary judgment.
in its memorandum and order dated august,the district court,after describing the events as set forth in part above,granted the motion of quaker hills in so far as it sought a declaration that the policy clause was void under new york law and that quaker hills was entitled to.see wl,at.the court denied the motion of pacific to dismiss the complaint or limit quaker hills recovery to percent of that amount.the court also rejected quaker hills claim for replacement costs.see id.
the district court ruling as to the stated amount of loss coverage 
as to the clause,the district court stated that a lthough the parties dispute whether davis consented to the apportionment of loss clause,and although the factual record is clear that he at worst initiated,and at best was aware of and assented to its inclusion in the policy,his initiation or consent to the clause wa s irrelevant because the clause is void as a matter of law under new york law.wl,at.the district court noted that new york law has codified a standard fire insurance policy that sets minimum coverage standards for such policies,see ins.law mckinney,and that a fire insurance policy must include terms and provisions no less favorable to the insured than those contained in the standard fire policy,wl,at quoting f a.although an insurance company is free to offer the insured terms that are more favorable than the mandated minima,
a policy that contains a less favorable term than the minimum provided in the state standard fire policy is enforceable as if it conformed to the statutory standard.webster realty great am.surplus lines ins,see also sr int l bus.ins.world trade ctr,d.
wl,at.the district court noted the statutory minima set out in e,which provides that the insurer must insure the insured 
to the lesser amount of either 
the actual cash value of the property at the time of the loss,or 
the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after such loss,without allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair,and without compensation for loss resulting from interruption of business or manufacture,or 
to an amount not exceeding dollars 
ins.law e.the district court thus stated that under new york standard fire insurance policy,the policy must at least provide the lesser of either the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss the replacement cost or the value of the property as predetermined in the policy.wl,at emphases added.the court noted that 
t he third provision in the new york standard fire policy allows for valued policies.nichols hartford fire ins,see also pattern jury instructions.a valued policy is one in which the value of the property covered by the policy is predetermined by the parties so that in the event of a total loss,it is not necessary to prove the actual value,and the value is conclusive unless there has been fraud or mistake.id.
wl,at emphasis added.
therefore,new york standard fire policy,clearly sets a minimum floor of the lesser of the three options,woodhams allstate fire and cas,d,emphasis added,and the policy must at least provide the lesser of either the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss the replacement cost or the value of the property as predetermined in the policy.
wl,at.in the present case,
t he applicable policy,in effect at the time of the fire loss,provides coverage for a loss up to,with an extended replacement cost provision,which would allow a homeowner to collect the replacement cost if certain conditions precedent were met.hence,the applicable policy in its unmodified form meets the minimum standards of the standard fire insurance policy by providing the replacement cost of the property.however,with the apportionment of loss clause,the applicable policy provides substantially less coverage than the minimum,by providing only of the replacement cost.
id.emphases added.
the district court stated that it was unable to find specific case law in new york that addressed anything like the apportionment of loss clause here but the court found it clear that the clause in the policy was a less favorable term than new york standard fire policy.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the policy clause was void as a matter of new york law,and that the policy must be enforced as if its terms complied with the statute.see id.at.
what the parties got with the applicable policy was a fire policy that,on its face,had a policy limit of.however,the apportionment of loss clause did nothing other than reduce that policy limit of by to and allow quaker hills to pay less in premiums while the court is faced with the inequity of allowing quaker hills to recover on a cont r act davis not only agreed to,but asked for,the sleight of hand by the parties here is not supported by the new york standard fire policy,or otherwise by new york law.given that this case implicates the highly regulated insurance industry,here the insurance company loses.
wl,at see id.at as the apportionment of loss clause is inconsistent with the minimum coverage required by new york law,the apportionment of loss clause is deemed void,and the applicable policy will be enforceable as if it conformed to the statutory standards.
although pacific contended that the clause was not void because it was analogous to clauses,which new york courts have upheld as valid,see aldrich great american insurance,dep t,the district court rejected the analogy.the district court read the new york cases as finding clauses viable only where the insured suffered a partial,rather than a total,loss 
a clause divides the risk between the insurer and the insured in the event of a partial loss if the insured has failed to carry insurance up to a certain percentage of the value of the property,typically.see life ins.glen falls ins,misc,aff.div.dep t,aff,explaining how clauses operate and why insurers use them see also couch on ins.ed.coinsurance clause in property insurance requiring that the property be insured for a minimum percentage of its total value and making the insured a coinsurer to the extent that the coverage falls below the specified minimum.the purpose of,therefore,is to protect homeowners by encouraging them to value fairly their own property,and not undervalue it in order to receive a lower premium.id.at,aldrich,at.
wl,at emphasis added.the court stated that 
a lthough the apportionment of loss clause in the present case also divides the risk between the insurer and the insured,it is fundamentally different from a clause.first,all of the cases containing a clause involved a partial loss,not a total loss.second,unlike a coinsurance clause,which is designed to encourage homeowners to value properly their property,the apportionment of loss clause here has no real purpose other than to make a policy appear to be a policy.thus,the apportionment of loss clause is not analogous to a valid clause.
id.at emphasis added.
the district court ruling as to replacement costs 
the district court rejected quaker hills claim for replacement costs,ruling that the bank commencement of the foreclosure constituted a recall of the mortgage within the meaning of the policy,which,under the limitations stated in the extended replacement cost provision,relieved pacific of the obligation to pay such costs.the court noted that although quaker hills disputed that the mortgage had been recalled,the policy itself stated that it use s words in their plain english meaning.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court therefore understands recall to have its ordinary meaning of cancel,revoke.recall,the free merriam webster dictionary,http last visited july.bank of america has undisputedly issued plaintiff default notices demanding payment in full of all mortgage debts,thereby cancelling or revoking their loan to plaintiff.
the judgment 
a final judgment was entered,with no specification of the dollar amount that quaker hills is entitled to recover and without mention of replacement costs.the judgment stated as follows 
defendant having moved for summary judgment on both of plaintiff claims,seeking dismissal of the complaint in its entirety,or in the alternative,dismissing the complaint to the extent recovery is sought by plaintiff above defendant apportioned share of the loss under the insurance policy plaintiff having for summary judgment,and the matter having come before the honorable deborah batts,united states district judge,and the court,on august,having rendered its memorandum and order granting plaintiff motion for summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment on defendant liability to plaintiff under the fire policy granting plaintiff motion for summary judgment declaring the apportionment of loss clause void,and denying defendant motion for summary judgment in its entirety,it is,
ordered,adjudged and decreed that for the reasons stated in the court memorandum and order dated august,plaintiff motion for summary judgment seeking a declaratory judgment on defendant liability to plaintiff under the fire policy is granted plaintiff motion for summary judgment declaring the apportionment of loss clause void is also granted and defendant motion for summary judgment is denied in its entirety,accordingly,the case is closed.
judgment dated august,judgment.
quaker hills wrote to the district court on september and,indicating a need for a corrected judgment to state the precise amount quaker hills is entitled to collect from pacific on the policy after crediting pacific with its payment on quaker hills mortgage,and to award quaker hills prejudgment interest.on september,pacific filed its notice of appeal from the judgment.on september,the district court ordered that the docket be reopened and it stated that all proposed motions would be held in abeyance pending resolution of the appeal.
ii.discussion 
quaker hills has from so much of the judgment as implicitly denies its claim for replacement costs.we affirm the district court denial of the claim for replacement costs substantially for the reasons stated in the district court memorandum and order,see part.above.
pacific has appealed from so much of the judgment as declares that the policy clause is void and that pacific is not entitled to a reduction of its liability to percent of the stated loss coverage amount in the policy.it also challenges a ruling by the district court that rejected materials proffered by pacific after the court deadline for discovery had passed.as pacific has not shown that the court discovery ruling was an abuse of discretion,we decline to disturb it,and we decline to consider the materials belatedly submitted.we write to address the issue of the policy clause,and to certify questions concerning that issue to the court of appeals for the state of new york.
a.the new york standard fire insurance policy 
certain aspects of new york insurance laws are relatively clear.new york law specifies alternative minimum levels of coverage that must be provided in fire insurance policies for insured parties in the state.as indicated above,of the new york insurance law provides,in subsection e,a form known and designated as the standard fire insurance policy of the state of new york.ins.law a.the form standard form or new york standard form states that the insurer does insure the insured 
to the lesser amount of either 
the actual cash value of the property at the time of the loss,or 
the amount which it would cost to repair or replace the property with material of like kind and quality within a reasonable time after such loss,without allowance for any increased cost of repair or reconstruction by reason of any ordinance or law regulating construction or repair,and without compensation for loss resulting from interruption of business or manufacture,or 
to an amount not exceeding dollars 
id.e.option allows the owner and the insurer to disregard the property actual value and agree to have the policy specify instead the amount the insurer will pay the insured in the event that the property is totally destroyed.where the parties have agreed upon the value of the insured property in the event of future loss,the policy is said to be a valued policy,nichols hartford fire insurance,dep t nichols and if it be decided that the loss was total,then under the valued policy the plaintiff would be entitled to receive the amount of the policy,lee hamilton fire insurance.specification of such an amount generally,absent fraud or mistake,relieves the parties,where the loss is total,of the need to determine either the property actual cash value at the time of loss or the cost of replacing the property.see,nichols,at,at.
with exceptions that are not pertinent here,the statute provides that 
n o policy or contract of fire insurance shall be made,issued or delivered by any insurer or by any agent or representative thereof,on any property in this state,unless it shall conform as to all provisions,stipulations,agreements and conditions with such form of policy 
ins.law b emphases added.thus,while an insurer is free to deviate from the new york standard form by providing terms that are more favorable,see,webster realty great american surplus lines insurance,webster although the standard form allows the insurer to require that an action on the policy be brought within a period,the insurer may permissibly omit reference to any limitations period and thereby allow such an action to be brought within the general statutory limitations period for an action on a contract,a fire insurance policy must include terms and provisions no less favorable to the insured than those contained in the standard fire policy,ins.law f a emphasis added.accordingly,t he standard policy is the minimum level of coverage permissible for an insurance company to issue.lane security mutual insurance,lane see also woodhams allstate fire casualty,d,the standard policy clearly sets a minimum floor of the lesser of the standard form three options.
where a policy contains one or more terms that are less favorable than those in the standard form,new york courts have held that the policy is enforceable as if it conformed to the statutory standard,it is enforced as if the violative provision were not included.webster,at,at,see,tag,llc commet,tag.in webster,the issue was the timeliness of an action brought to recover on a policy that provided a limitations period despite the standard form provision of a period.although the court concluded that the action was untimely,it ruled that the action was properly dismissed on the basis of the statute,not on the basis of the policy as written.see id.at,at.in lane,the controversy involved the scope of a policy provision for an exclusion from coverage the new york court of appeals ruled that the exclusion was unenforceable as written because the policy exclusionary term an insured was broader than the term the insured in the standard form 
t he an insured language contained in defendant policy offers an innocent party significantly less coverage than the language the insured.since the latter phrase is that adopted by the legislature in the insurance law,use of the former violates that statute requirement that all fire policies offer the level of coverage provided in the standard policy.
at,at,other internal quotation marks omitted.see also tag,at,at,holding that a policy provision expressly precluding liability for damages caused by terrorism was inconsistent with the standard policy,which does not provide for such an exclusion.
