an owner of commercial property that was vandalized while vacant brought an action against its insurer to recover for lost rent.the parties filed competing motions for summary adjudication as to whether the insurer was liable for rent in the absence of a tenant.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer,from which the owner appeals.we hold that under the terms of the policy,recovery for lost rent did not require the owner to have an existing tenant,and there are triable issues of fact as to whether the property would have been rented but for the vandalism damage.therefore,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
