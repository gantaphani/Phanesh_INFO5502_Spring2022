this diversity case arises out of a dispute over a construction contract and an attempt to mediate that dispute through the district court alternative dispute resolution program.appellee fidelity and guaranty insurance company fidelity executed,as surety,a performance bond on behalf of appellant star equipment company star for work on a water main installation project that star was to perform for appellee town of seekonk,massachusetts seekonk.appellants charlene and john foran the forans,the principals of star,executed a general agreement of indemnity,promising to reimburse fidelity for any losses,costs,and expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by fidelity as a result of the performance bond issued to star.
after seekonk declared star to be in default on its construction contract with the town,fidelity filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the rights and obligations of the parties under the performance bond.the parties entered mediation and emerged with a settlement memorandum of understanding,signed by all the parties and their attorneys.when star and the forans refused to go forward with the settlement,fidelity and seekonk filed a motion to enforce the memorandum as a settlement of all claims in the case except the claim of fidelity against star and the forans for indemnification,which had been explicitly reserved in the settlement agreement.the district court granted that motion,and subsequently granted fidelity motion for summary judgment on the indemnification claim.after a damage hearing,the court found that star and the forans were liable to fidelity for,plus costs and interest.star and the forans appeal the enforcement of the settlement agreement,the summary judgment ruling,and the amount of the damage award.we affirm.
on june,star entered into a contract with seekonk to install replacement water mains in the town.fidelity executed a performance bond and a labor and materials payment bond on behalf of star,guaranteeing star contractual obligations to seekonk.
these bonds were issued in reliance on a general agreement of indemnity gai,executed by star and the forans on june,indemnifying fidelity in connection with any bonds issued on behalf of star for its construction projects.this agreement provided that star and each of the forans,in their personal capacities the indemnitors,would indemnify fidelity and hold it harmless from and against all claims,damages,expenses,losses,costs,professional and consulting fees,disbursements,interests and expenses of every nature which fidelity may sustain,incur or become liable for by reason of having executed or procured the execution of any bond.the agreement stated that fidelity may settle or compromise any claim,liability,demand,suit or judgment upon any bond or bonds executed or procured by it,and any such settlement or compromise shall be binding upon the indemnitors.
shortly after commencing work in july on the seekonk water main project,star encountered site conditions that were materially different from its expectations.john foran advised seekonk of these difficulties and sought a contract adjustment to account for the greater time and costs involved in completing the work.although seekonk engineer told him that he would look into it,he asked star to continue working and it did.three weeks later,on august,seekonk officials met with the forans and representatives from fidelity.all parties had lawyers present at the meeting.the parties agreed that star would leave the job,seekonk would pay star for work completed,and the contract between the parties would be void without further recourse.fidelity encouraged star to accept this agreement.star then left the job,but star and seekonk could not agree on the amount the town owed the company for the work it had completed.star claims the amount owed at the time it left the job was approximately.
on september,seekonk sent a letter to fidelity,notifying it that star was in default of its contractual obligations and demanding payment under the performance bond.star denied that it was in default.on february,fidelity filed this declaratory judgment action against star,the forans,and seekonk,seeking to clarify its obligation under the performance bond.star brought a against seekonk asserting a right to payment for the work it had already performed at the time it left the job.seekonk,in turn,asserted a against star for breach of contract.the parties agreed to submit the case to mediation through the court alternative dispute resolution program.

a approval by appropriate municipal authorities and 
b execution of customary releases and settlement agreement.
the document was signed by each of the parties,their counsel,and the mediator.the mediator reported to the court that significant progress was made towards full settlement of this matter.
subsequently,seekonk obtained the requisite municipal approvals and the releases were drafted and their language approved by star counsel.however,the forans asserted that no binding settlement agreement had been reached and refused to execute the releases,claiming that their agreement to settle with seekonk was contingent on a satisfactory resolution of the indemnification dispute with fidelity.fidelity and seekonk then filed a joint motion to enforce settlement agreement,which the indemnitors opposed.the court initially denied this motion without explanation or hearing.fidelity and seekonk then filed a joint motion for reconsideration.on november,the court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration.it then entered an order,on november,granting the motion and enforcing the settlement memorandum of understanding as a settlement agreement.fidelity paid seekonk pursuant to the terms of the agreement.
on march,fidelity filed a motion for summary judgment on its indemnification claim against star and the forans.the indemnitors filed an opposition to the motion,asserting bad faith on the part of fidelity as a defense to the indemnification agreement.on march,the court entered an order granting fidelity motion for summary judgment,concluding that the defendants ha d failed to present any material facts which would give rise to a factual dispute as to a want of good faith on the part of fidelity.
the court then held a hearing on damages on april.fidelity and the indemnitors stipulated that the amount of loss payments fidelity had made pursuant to the performance and payment bonds,including fidelity attorney fees,was the indemnitors argued,however,that fidelity damage award should be reduced by to account for the value of the indemnitors against seekonk.the district court rejected this argument,explaining that the could not be used to offset fidelity damages because the indemnitors had agreed to drop that claim against seekonk in the settlement memorandum of understanding.accordingly,on april,the court issued a judgment in favor of fidelity against the indemnitors for,plus costs and interest.
