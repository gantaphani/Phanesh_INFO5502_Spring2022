in this insurance case,american home assurance american seeks to recover pursuant to an insurance policy that first specialty insurance corporation first specialty issued to maine coast marine construction,mcmc.the case presents us with two questions whether a watercraft exclusion in the policy first specialty issued to mcmc applies to a barge being pulled by a tug and whether maine law would bar all recovery if the barge is excluded,even though the tug is not excluded.the district court found the exclusion barred all recovery and granted summary judgment to first specialty.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
for the purposes of summary judgment,the facts are as follows.fore river dock dredge,frdd hired mcmc to deliver a construction barge,the,to a site on the merrimack river in newburyport,ma,using a tug,the seawind ii.on december,guy splettstoesser,an employee and of mcmc,set out from gloucester,ma,using the tug to push the barge.on account of deteriorating weather conditions,splettstoesser went from pushing the with the seawind ii to towing it using a cable.as he attempted to maneuver the tug and barge to enter the merrimack river,strong winds pushed the barge alongside the tug and then pushed both out of the channel,grounding them on plum island.
first specialty had issued an insurance policy to mcmc,the company that was actually operating the seawind ii as it towed the.american had issued an insurance policy to frdd,the company that hired mcmc to deliver the barge.as a result of a settlement with frdd,american has incurred expenses of approximately.in response,american obtained a settlement from mcmc and splettstoesser in a subrogation suit that american brought on behalf of frdd.mcmc and splettstoesser agreed to judgment being entered in favor of american against themselves in the amount of approximately,providing,however,that american would seek to collect the money from first specialty,mcmc insurer.first specialty then sought declaratory relief against american to the effect that it was not liable for these damages.
through this procedural history,american now stands in the shoes of mcmc and seeks to recover on mcmc insurance policy with first specialty.this policy obliges first specialty to pay damages that mcmc is legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury or property damage resulting from an occurrence.an occurrence is defined in the policy as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.the policy contains the following exclusion

ii.discussion 
on appeal of grants of summary judgment,we apply de novo review to any legal issues and to the question of whether there exists a genuine dispute of material fact requiring a trial.new eng.surfaces du pont de nemours,cir.
though a shipwreck figures in this case,the policy at issue is a general commercial liability policy and the case comes before us under our diversity jurisdiction,not under our maritime jurisdiction.there is no dispute that we must apply maine law to resolve the two issues in this appeal.
does the watercraft exclusion apply to the 
maine law on insurance policy interpretation can be set forth as follows 
whether a given insurance contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.the language of a contract of insurance is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.in addition,a policy is ambiguous if an ordinary person in the shoes of the insured would not understand that the policy did not cover claims such as those brought nevertheless,the court must interpret unambiguous language in a contract according to its plain and commonly accepted meaning.finally,in determining whether an insurance contract is ambiguous,the rule in maine requires an evaluation of the instrument as a whole.
a contract of insurance,like any other contract,is to be construed in accordance with the intention of the parties,which is to be ascertained from an examination of the whole instrument.all parts and clauses must be considered together that it may be seen if and how far one clause is explained,modified,limited or controlled by the others.

the is a watercraft.
the first question we must confront is the meaning of the term watercraft.first,it can not be reasonably questioned that a watercraft is a craft for use in or on water.and we can see no reason to disagree with the district court conclusion,made after consultation with the oxford english dictionary,that craft,in this context,refers to vessels of all kinds for water carriage.first specialty ins.me.coast marine,d,citing oxford english dictionary,craft meaning v ed hereinafter oed see also oed,watercraft def.defining the term as a vessel that plies on the water such vessels collectively.under this definition,it would be plain and commonly accepted that the,which is a vessel for use in the water,and which moved across water to reach its destination,was a watercraft.see oed,vessel def.defining vessel as a ny structure designed to float upon and traverse the water for the carriage of persons or goods a craft or ship of any kind,now usually one larger than a and often restricted to craft or those plying upon the larger rivers or lakes.
though no maine case addresses the meaning of this term,persuasive precedent from other jurisdictions supports this conclusion.see,terra,lake charles dredging towing,cir noting that a watercraft exclusion clearly applies to the movements of the barges themselves,but allowing recovery on other grounds.mut.cas.ins.state,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,holding,on summary judgment,that a lthough a is not used in the same way as most other watercraft,and although it serves important mining functions in addition to water transport,it is nonetheless clearly within the meaning of watercraft contemplated by the insurance policy.henry.sugars,so d,finding,on summary judgment,no coverage under a watercraft exclusion for a docked barge sloan steel erectors equip.rental.union ins,per curiam a barge is a watercraft.see also illinois kentucky,d concluding that kentucky evidence of taxation of barges and other watercraft failed to establish its territorial claims against illinois.
cases suggesting otherwise are easily distinguishable in that they involve the use of a barge or its equipment.see consol.am.ins.mike soper marine,cir finding ambiguity in the word watercraft in the context of deciding that a watercraft exception did not apply when a crane amputated an arm ison roof,cir finding coverage despite a watercraft exclusion where a pleasure boat struck a work barge docked at a coal conveyor facility,since the policy showed it was intended to cover the work done at such a facility and since the barge was used as a base for the conveyor and was not intended to be used and was not being used as a transportation vessel ayers c d contractors,d,relyin
