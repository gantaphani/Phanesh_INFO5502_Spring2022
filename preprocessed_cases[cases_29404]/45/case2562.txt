jean simes simes died of cancer less than four months after purchasing an annuity that provided for monthly benefit payments as long as she lived.plaintiffs carol grenall and mike sutton,the administrators of her estate the estate,sought to rescind the annuity based on a mistake of fact,namely,that simes was unaware at the time of the contract that she was terminally ill.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the issuing company,defendant united of omaha life insurance company united.we affirm because plaintiffs failed to establish an essential element for rescission based on mistake of fact.
factual and procedural background 
the essential facts are undisputed for purposes of appeal 
simes submitted a signed annuity application to united agent on october,along with a single premium of.united then issued a policy for a single premium immediate annuity,effective the date of simes application.simes received a copy of the policy six weeks after her application.the cover page of the annuity policy includes the following provision read your policy carefully.it includes the provisions on the following pages.if you are not satisfied with your policy,return it to us or our agent within days after you receive it.we will refund the single premium and cancel the policy as of its date of issue.among the provisions that followed,the annuity policy provided for monthly payments of to simes for life only specifically,a life contingent payable as long as the annuitant lives.
on january,after receiving three benefit payments,simes was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.she died less than a week later on january.united stopped making annuity payments in april when it learned of her death.
the estate filed suit against united,alleging two causes of action,for breach of contract and declaratory relief,in a form complaint.the breach of contract claim alleges that united had refused to make payments under the terms of the annuity until the sum of the benefit payments equals the single premium.the declaratory relief cause of action seeks resolution of a dispute between the parties as to their respective rights under the annuity policy.
united moved for summary judgment,claiming the terms of the contract provided for a life annuity and did not require a refund of the premium to the estate.accordingly,united maintained it was entitled to summary judgment on the breach of contract and declaratory relief causes of action.in its opposition to the motion,the estate characterized the annuity as a contract of adhesion and raised issues of procedural and substantive unconscionability.
the trial court granted summary judgment on the breach of contract cause of action,concluding that the undisputed facts showed that united had not breached the payment option to which the parties agreed,as the contract required monthly benefit payments only during simes lifetime the court denied the motion as to the declaratory relief cause of action,concluding that the evidence raised triable issues of material fact as to whether simes made a unilateral mistake in agreeing to the life annuity payment option,justifying reformation,and whether surrounding circumstances justified rescission and restitution based on a mistake of fact or a mistake of law 
after additional discovery,united renewed its motion for summary judgment on the declaratory relief cause of action,arguing that the estate could not prevail on the factual issues identified in the trial court prior order.united asserted that there was no evidence of a mistake by simes or of what was in her mind when she purchased the annuity.in its opposition,the estate raised a single claim for rescission based on a mistake of fact.specifically,the estate produced evidence that simes did not know she had a terminal illness when she entered the annuity contract or during the statutory rescission period.the estate also argued that the contract was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.united responded with authority rejecting rescission of annuity contracts under these circumstances.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of united,concluding that simes undetected cancer did not constitute a mistake of fact rendering enforcement unconscionable.the trial court noted that purchasers of annuities assume the risk of dying before recouping their investments and concluded it was reasonably foreseeable that simes would die before the benefit payments matched her premium.under these circumstances,the trial court held that it was reasonable to allocate to simes the risk of a mistake regarding her health and life expectancy.
judgment in favor of united was entered on june.the estate filed a timely notice of appeal.united filed a motion to dismiss and for sanctions simultaneously with its respondent brief.this court deferred a ruling on the motion pending its decision on the merits 
discussion 
an appellate court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo,as it raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of the arguments and evidence before the trial judge.knight hayward unified school dist.th,d see kolodge boyd th,d.summary judgment is proper if there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.in this case,the parties agree that the material facts are undisputed for purposes of appeal.based on these undisputed facts,united contends it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the estate rescission claim.
the facts on which the estate relied below purport to show the following simes did not know at the time of her application and during the statutory rescission period that she had terminal ovarian cancer that would result in her death four months later simes illness affected her ability to make decisions and simes did not receive a copy of the annuity policy until.the sole issue argued by the estate on appeal is whether these facts provide a legal basis for rescission of the life annuity contract based on a mistake of fact.we hold,as a matter of law,that they do not,for the following reasons.
california law permits rescission of a contract when a party consent is given by mistake,subd.b donovan rrl cal th,d,donovan.on this basis,the estate asserts a right to rescind the annuity policy,alleging that simes would not have entered the contract but for a mistake of fact,specifically,the terminal illness she did not know she had.a mistake of fact may consist of a b elief in the present existence of a thing material to the contract,which does not exist.the alleged mistake therefore may be characterized as simes erroneous belief at the time of the contract that she was in good health and had a reasonable life expectancy.
a mistake of this nature does not support a claim for rescission.the estate asserts a unilateral mistake and offers no evidence that united had reason to know of or caused the mistake.accordingly,to prevail at trial,the estate would have been required to prove the following simes was mistaken regarding a basic assumption upon which she made the contract the mistake materially affected the agreed exchange of performances in a way that was adverse to simes simes did not bear the risk of the mistake and the effect of the mistake was such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable.see donovan,supra,cal th at,d.the facts on which the estate relies demonstrate that it can not establish the third of these elements 
we conclude,based on the nature of the contract and the alleged mistake,that simes bore the risk of the mistake,as a matter of law.a contracting party bears the risk of a mistake when the agreement so provides or when the party is aware of having only limited knowledge of the facts relating to the mistake but treats this limited knowledge as sufficient.donovan,supra,cal th at,d,citing rest d contracts.additionally,the court may allocate the risk to a party because it is reasonable under the circumstances to do so.donovan,at,d.the contract in this case does not expressly assign the risk of the alleged mistake.nonetheless,parties who contract for life conti
