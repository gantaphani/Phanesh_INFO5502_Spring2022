the young women christian association of the national capital area ywca appeals the grant of summary judgment to several insurance companies,contending principally that the district court erred in its choice of law ruling and,alternatively,in its application of law,having failed to abide by the language of the insurance policies and the applicable rules for construction of insurance contracts.we reverse the district court choice of law ruling and its application of law,and we remand the case for consideration of exclusions under the policies and related issues.
on november,ywca contracted with tiber construction company tiber,a virginia corporation,for the construction of a new building at and g streets,in washington,by subcontract,dated february,tiber engaged beer precast concrete,beer,of ontario,canada,to furnish and install precast concrete panels for the building.beer cast the panels for the ywca building in and delivered and installed the panels.before shipping them to the district of columbia,beer the panels.the architect on the project advised tiber,however,that some of the panels were unacceptable because they were chipped,warped,cracked,discolored,or without homogenous distribution of aggregate.beer agreed to patch the precast panels and all of the panels at all elevations using cleaning agents and scrub brushes in an attempt to achieve uniformity of the finish.the washing took place around october.nine years later,in late or early,the ywca became aware of,staining,and the precast concrete panels.
on august,ywca filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia against tiber for breach of contract and against beer for breach of contract,breach of warranty,negligence,and misrepresentation.following the grant of summary judgment to tiber on tiber and beer for contribution and indemnification,the parties stipulated that any judgment against tiber would be entered against beer.the misrepresentation claim was dismissed pretrial.on the remaining claims,ywca presented evidence at trial regarding three causes of the damage to the concrete panels.the evidence of ywca two experts,mark williams and bernard erlin as well as beer expert,william logan,showed that the primary cause of the deterioration of the panels was the introduction of excessive chloride ions when beer improperly the panels.this exposure to excessive chloride ions caused the steel imbedded in the panels to corrode,resulting in the cracking of the panels.the deterioration was exacerbated by beer failures to manufacture the panels with sufficient concrete cover over the imbedded steel,and to use galvanized reinforcing mesh,to protect the steel from attack by chloride ions where the concrete cover was less than inches thick,as required by the contract specifications and industry standards.the corrosion of the imbedded steel and the resulting cracking was an ongoing,insidious process the chloride ions slowly advance through the concrete until they reach the steel,corroding it on a progressive and continuing basis.
the jury found that tiber and beer had breached their contract with the ywca,that beer was negligent,and that ywca had suffered million in damages.the jury also found that tiber and beer had failed to prove that the ywca knew or reasonably should have known that there was a condition in the panels that would cause a person exercising ordinary care to make further inquiry as to the reasons for that condition.the district court entered judgment on january,for the ywca in the amount of costs included.
the ywca then filed suit,on april,in the district court for the district of columbia against beer seven canadian insurers the insurers during to,the period spanning the manufacture of the panels to the discovery of the damage 
kansa general international insurance company kansa issued a comprehensive general liability policy with a million limit,and an excess umbrella policy for million,for the term from july,to july.
allstate insurance company of canada allstate issued a comprehensive general liability policy with a million limit,and an excess umbrella policy for million for the term from july,to july.
new hampshire insurance company new hampshire issued two comprehensive general liability policies with terms of july,to july,and july,to july,with limits of million each.
halifax insurance company halifax issued two comprehensive general liability policies with terms of july,to july,and july,to july,with limits of million each.
norad reinsurance company,norad issued a comprehensive general liability policy with a term of july,to july,and a limit of million.
richmond insurance company barbatos,richmond issued a policy for the term of july,to july.
american home assurance company american home issued a comprehensive general liability policy with a term of june,to july,and a limit of million.
the ywca reached a settlement with allstate,and on may,the district court dismissed ywca claims against allstate.ywca suit against richmond was dismissed.the district court entered a default judgment against norad.ywca was unsuccessful in its effort to collect from kansa.kansa filed for bankruptcy in december,and on march,the superior court of quebec quebec court issued a order.on april,the canadian liquidator disallowed ywca submission of proof of its claims against kansa because there was no injury during the policy period within the meaning of kansa policies,exclusions under the policies were implicated,ywca failed to give timely notice to kansa of its alleged claims,and ywca did not comply with the liquidator request that it disclose the actual amount of its alleged damages.when ywca did not,when granted additional time,make the requested disclosure,the quebec court entered a judgment against ywca on february,on its claims against kansa.
meanwhile,in the district court here,on november,ywca,kansa,new hampshire,and halifax filed for summary judgment.on august,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that district of columbia law should apply to the construction of the insurance policies,and that ywca and american home motions for summary judgment should be denied and new hampshire and halifax motions for summary judgment should be granted.by order dated january,the district court rejected the magistrate judge choice of law recommendation,concluding instead that canadian law applied.
thereafter,the district court granted kansa motion to dismiss on grounds of comity,and in the alternative granted kansa motion for summary judgment.the district court also granted summary judgment to the three remaining insurers.applying ontario law to determine whether there was coverage under the insurers policies,the district court identified four relevant triggers of coverage under ontario law.the court rejected the continuous trigger,which includes all times from exposure to the harm to its manifestation,because no canadian court had applied it.it also rejected the manifestation trigger,for which the trigger is the moment at which the damage becomes apparent or is discovered,because canadian courts other than a quebec trial court,including the ontario court,had rejected it.the district court distinguished canadian cases that had applied an trigger,which looks to the time at which the damage actually occurred,explaining that both pickford black canadian general insurance,can,and dawson creek zurich insurance,lexis,at,did not involve a single exposure that inevitably caused damage over time,but involved both an initial exposure and a later event that could be said to have caused the injury.in contrast,the court stated that several canadian courts had applied the exposure trigger,for which the triggering event is the exposure to the harm that causes the damage rather than the resulting damage to the property.
the district court then turned to the policies at issue.observing that the terms of the halifax policy speak of exposure during the policy period,and noting that the process was the single moment of exposure at which time the damage became inevitable,the court found that no triggering event had occurred during halifax policy period.rather,the exposure took place during the term of allstate policy.finding that the new hampshire and american home policies did not indicate which trigger applies,the court construed the terms of these policies,namely,injury,destruction,and damage,to refer only to the moment of the initial exposure at which time the damage becomes inevitable.because,under the district court analysis,the process was the causative event when the damage became inevitable and there was no intervening causative event during the new hampshire and american home policies,it followed that these policies were not triggered.
on appeal,ywca contends that the district court erred in ruling that canadian law applies to its claims against the insurers arising from beer negligence and breach of contract in the district of columbia.ywca contends first,that the district court erred in failing to conclude that there was no conflict of laws between the district of columbia and ontario because both apply a continuous trigger.ywca contends alternatively that,under the substantial interests test,the correct choice of law is that of the district of columbia where the ywca building is located,and that under district of columbia law,a continuous trigger applies to comprehensive general liability policies when the injury is continuous or progressive.see wrecking of,ins.of.alternatively again,ywca contends that even if ontario law applies,the district court erred in relying on law of the province of saskatchewan that conflicts with the law of ontario,explaining that in international comfort products royal insurance company of canada,lexis,at ont,ontario rejected the exposure trigger theory adopted in university of saskatchewan fireman fund insurance company of canada,lexis sask.ywca maintains also that ontario application of the continuous trigger is consistent with the leading decision of the supreme court of canada on the construction of insurance policies,reid crowther partners simcoe erie general insurance,can,and that the district court failed to apply this precedent when it subjected all of the policies to an exposure trigger theory even though the language of the policies insures against occurrences.
because there is diversity of citizenship among the parties to this litigation,the law of the forum state supplies the choice of law standards.klaxon stentor.under district of columbia law,the court must first determine if there is a conflict between the laws of the relevant jurisdictions.eli lilly home ins,citing fowler v.a a,duncan.only if such a conflict exists must the court then determine,pursuant to district of columbia choice of law rules,which jurisdiction has the more substantial interest in the resolution of the issues.see nationwide mut.ins.richardson,eli lilly,at greycoat hanover f.liberty mut.ins.
it is unnecessary to engage in a conflict of laws analysis.both ywca and the insurers agree that the relevant jurisdictions are the district of columbia and ontario.examination of both forums laws reveals that no conflict of laws exists because both would apply a continuous trigger to the policies where the damage can be characterized as being continuous or progressive 
neither the highest court in ontario nor the supreme court of canada has addressed which trigger theory applies to policies.but in reid crowther partners simcoe erie general insurance,can,the supreme court of canada set forth general principles for interpreting insurance contracts that direct courts to the language of the particular insurance policy 
in each case the courts must examine the provisions of the particular policy at issue and the surrounding circumstances to determine if the events in question fall within the terms of coverage of that particular policy in each case,the courts must interpret the provisions of the policy at issue in light of general principles of interpretation of insurance policies,including,but not limited to 
the contra proferentem rule 
the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly and 
the desirability,at least where the policy is ambiguous,of giving effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties.
examination of the language in the insurers policies indicates the appropriateness of applying a continuous trigger.the halifax policies cover occurrences and define an occurrence as including a continuous or repeated exposure during the policy period to a condition or conditions which result in injury to or destruction of property neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.similarly,the american home policy covers accidents and defines accident as including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in property damage neither expected nor intended from the standard point of the insured.the plain terms of these policies support application of the continuous trigger where,as here,the exposure to the damaging excessive chloride ions was continuous in nature.although the insurers,like the district court,take the position that there was only a single exposure that caused continuous damage,this characterization of the nature of the damage is belied by undisputed evidence describing the damage.that evidence showed that the damage was the result of continued exposure to excessive chloride ions that migrate through the concrete,and that the initial exposure to the chloride ions thus resulted in continuous exposure to those same ions as they migrated through the concrete and slowly corroded the steel.
in addition,the language of the new hampshire policies also indicates the appropriateness of applying the continuous trigger.the new hampshire policies cover physical injury to or destruction of property which occurs during the policy period,and define occurrence as including injurious exposure to condition which results,during the policy period,in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.the district court interpreted this language as setting forth an exposure trigger.yet the policy language provides that it is the property damage and not the exposure to it that must occur during the policy period.the language is thus consistent with the continuous trigger theory,which defines damage broadly to include the entire process of damage from exposure to manifestation when the damage is of a continuous and progressive nature.keene ins.of.
even if the insurers policies might reasonably be read differently,the contract interpretation principles set forth by the supreme court of canada point to application of the continuous trigger.first,the policy is to be construed against the drafters.see reid crowther,at.neither halifax,nor new hampshire,nor american home contend in their brief that the contra proferentem rule is inapplicable to its policy because it did not draft it.nor do they contend that the language of the policies was imposed by statute.second,even if there is doubt as to which party drafted the policies,the coverage provisions are to be interpreted broadly.id.thus,under canadian principles of contract interpretation,the court is to interpret the policies to maximize coverage,which also points to application of the continuous trigger theory.
this result is consistent with the law of ontario,which recognizes a continuous trigger theory.in a case not cited by either side in their briefs,an ontario superior court judge in alie bertrand frere construction,lexis ont,provided a thorough and persuasive analysis of the relevant considerations in applying trigger theories.in alie,the court considered which of the four triggers to apply for coverage of property damage consisting of continuous deterioration of the foundations of homes caused by the use of fly ash in the concrete.id.at.the court rejected the exposure theory as being inconsistent with the language of the policies.id.at.the policies provided coverage for property damage occurring during the policy period.id.because the damage was continuous,the court rejected limiting coverage to only the policy that covered the period of exposure.id.the court rejected the manifestation theory,as being inconsistent with the polici
