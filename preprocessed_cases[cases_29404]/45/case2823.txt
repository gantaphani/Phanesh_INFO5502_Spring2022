the employer of an employee injured on the job,after paying workers compensation benefits out of its retention,sought reimbursement from the california insurance guarantee association ciga.the trial court denied the requested relief because the employer claim was not a covered claim under insurance code section,subdivision c.the employer contends the court erred in interpreting subdivision c,because it is not an insurer within the meaning of that provision.it also contends that it has a right to proceed directly against the manufacturer of the overhead door that injured the employee.
we disagree on both counts.first,the employer,as a for purposes of providing workers compensation benefits,is deemed to be an insurer providing other insurance within the meaning of insurance code section,subdivision c.therefore,its claim is excluded as a covered claim and ciga is not responsible for the amounts paid to the injured employee from the employer retention.furthermore,to permit the employer to recover the sums directly from the manufacturer of the door,whose insurer was insolvent,would be to permit the employer,as an insurer for the purposes of workers compensation insurance,to obtain indirectly what it could not obtain directly from ciga.we affirm.
john michael roth roth,a nutrilite products nutrilite employee,was injured on november,during the course and scope of his employment.while roth was on nutrilite premises,a metal overhead trailer door fell to a closed position,striking him in the back of the head.roth suffered injuries to his head,neck and left hand.
nutrilite paid workers compensation benefits to roth through,nutrilite independent third party workers compensation benefits administrator.nutrilite had workers compensation insurance through insurance company of pennsylvania.however,nutrilite was responsible for the first per incident,as its retention 
in october,roth filed a complaint against door company,alleging that it had designed and manufactured the door.he asserted causes of action for negligence,strict products liability and breach of warranty.
in november,nutrilite rskco.filed a complaint in intervention.it sought reimbursement for the workers compensation benefits it had paid to roth on account of his injuries.nutrilite ultimately paid at least in workers compensation benefits to roth.
door had insurance coverage through united pacific insurance company.roth claim was covered by that insurance.united pacific insurance company was a subsidiary of reliance insurance company.reliance insurance company was declared insolvent on october.
roth settled his claim against door before trial and dismissed his complaint.on the date scheduled for trial on the complaint in intervention,door stipulated to liability.the matter went to trial on the issue of whether a workers compensation subrogation claim is considered a covered claim under the laws applicable to ciga,and if not,whether nutrilite could proceed directly against door.
the court ruled against nutrilite,for two reasons.first,it held the complaint in intervention was barred by insurance code section,subdivision c because nutrilite,as a permissively employer,was an insurer pursuant to labor code section and because its claim as set forth in the complaint in intervention was a subrogation claim.second,insurance code section,subdivision c barred the complaint in intervention because nutrilite was not the original claimant as its claim for reimbursement of workers compensation benefits was derivative and also because nutrilite claim was a claim by way of subrogation.
nutrilite filed an appeal from the judgment.
discussiona.ciga covered claims 
ciga was formed to provide insurer insolvency insurance for its members.pursuant to insurance code section,ciga pays and discharges covered claims.the term covered claims is defined in insurance code section,subdivision c.subdivision c defines covered claims as the obligations of an insolvent insurer 
however,insurance code section,subdivision c contains a number of exclusions from this definition.subdivision c provides in pertinent part covered claims does not include any obligations to insurers,insurance pools,or underwriting associations,nor their claims for contribution,indemnity,or subrogation,equitable or otherwise 
insurance code section,subdivision c provides covered claims does not include i any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured nor ii any claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name and does not include any claim asserted by an assignee or one claiming by right of subrogation 
at issue is whether the trial court correctly interpreted these provisions in determining,in essence,that nutrilite claim against ciga was not a covered claim.
workers compensation subrogation under ciga provisions 
nutrilite contention 
nutrilite claims that the trial court,in interpreting insurance code section,subdivision c,incorrectly applied california ins.guarantee argonaut ins.d,rather than burrow pike d.nutrilite claims there is a split of authority between the appellate courts in the fifth district burrow and the third district argonaut,and that the trial court should have followed the former as the better reasoned.we disagree.
burrow pike 
we first address burrow pike,supra,d,on which nutrilite relies.in that case,the plaintiff,an employee of the department of transportation,was injured when struck by a truck.the plaintiff filed suit against the owner and the operator of the truck.the department of transportation,seeking to recoup the money it had paid to the plaintiff in workers compensation benefits,filed a notice of lien claim against any judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff.during the pendency of the action,the defendants insurer became insolvent.
the defendants then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the claim of lien,and the trial court granted the motion.thereafter,the jury returned a verdict in the amount of in favor of the plaintiff.however,because the plaintiff and the defendants had stipulated that the workers compensation credit was,the trial court reduced the amount of the award to.the department of transportation filed an appeal,claiming the trial court lacked jurisdiction to determine the validity of the lien claim or to affect its right to seek reimbursement for workers compensation expenses it had paid.the appellate court agreed with the department of transportation,and reversed the judgment.
at the outset,we observe,first,that burrow pike,supra,d.revolves around certain procedural peculiarities,most notably the judgment on the pleadings with respect to the claim of lien and,second,that the discussion of the workers compensation subrogation issue is in dictum.the appellate court held there was no legal basis for the granting of the motion for judgment on the pleadings against the department of transportation,which was not a party to the action,and there was no basis for reducing the verdict.id.at.for this reason,the appellate court not only reversed the judgment on the verdict,but also permitted a the withdrawal of the stipulation that was based on the order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings and b a limited new trial on the issue of the department of transportation concurrent negligence.id.at.
the appellate court then noted that it was arguably unnecessary to address the merits underlying the decision of the trial court.burrow pike,supra,d at.for the purposes of judicial economy,it did so anyway.the defendants asserted that the claim of lien was barred by,inter alia,the insurance code section,subdivision c exclusion from covered claims of claims presented by any person other than the original claimant or claims asserted by right of subrogation.the appellate court reviewed the insurance code section,subdivision c definition of covered claims,and certain exclusions therefrom,including the exclusion for one claiming by right of subrogation.burrow pike,supra,d at,italics omitted.it also considered the underlying purpose of ciga.the court concluded that,f
