in this appeal,we must decide whether a loss payable clause,patterned after the iso insurance services office,standard mortgagee clause,is a standard loss payable clause.we also must determine various coverage and exclusion issues concerning a mortgagee claim under an homeowner policy.while the policy was in force,the named insured transferred title and moved out of the home.the home was then demolished for redevelopment purposes.upon the insured default on the note,the mortgagee foreclosed against the deed of trust.due to the impairment of security caused by the demolition of the residence,the mortgagee sustained a loss for which it filed a claim on the policy.after the insurer denied the claim,the mortgagee filed suit.the trial court entered summary judgment for the insurer,finding the loss payable clause is not a standard loss payable clause that protects the mortgagee from defenses available against the named insured.we reverse the summary judgment with directions.
background 
in late,john and joan veenstra purchased a beachfront home in corona del.to finance the purchase,the veenstras borrowed from plaintiff home savings of america.the loan was secured by a deed of trust.
defendant continental insurance company issued the veenstras a continental link plus homeowner policy.home savings was named in the policy as the mortgagee.the policy mortgagee clause states in relevant part if a mortgagee is named in this policy,any loss payable under building coverage shall be paid to the mortgagee and you,as interests appear if we deny your claim,that denial shall not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee,if the mortgagee a notifies us of any change in ownership,occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware b pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium c submits a signed,sworn statement of loss continental promised not to cancel or fail to renew the policy without first giving home savings days notice.
in about january,while the policy was in effect,the veenstras,without home savings knowledge,transferred title to their property to a company called old world craftsman owc.owc is owned by grey fox,which,in turn,is owned by the veenstra family trust,which was established by the veenstras for their children.the veenstras leased back their home from owc for several months before vacating the premises,without home savings knowledge,in about may.in september,owc,having obtained the proper permits,demolished the home in order to construct new townhomes payments continued to be made on the veenstras loan and insurance policy.
in december,for reasons unrelated to this litigation,continental notified the veenstras and home savings that their policy would not be renewed upon its expiration on march.
in the spring of,after a new foundation was poured,the veenstras loan went into default.in the fall of,home savings began foreclosure proceedings.for the first time,home savings learned of the transfer of title and demolition of the residence.
at the foreclosure sale,home savings acquired the property for a credit bid,which was less than the unpaid loan balance together with interest and foreclosure costs of.home savings then resold the property for,leaving an loss of plus interest.
in june,home savings through an independent adjuster,public adjusters submitted a claim to continental for what it called the theft of the residence.under description of damage,the claim stated only thing left of house is a dirt lot with a slab and possibly some rough plumbing.
continental responded to home savings claim in july with a reservation of rights letter requesting additional documentation.in january,continental,based on the advice of its coverage counsel,rejected home savings claim for lack of a covered loss.home savings disputed the denial of its claim for theft,and suggested that the loss be treated,alternatively,as a claim for vandalism.continental,again on the advice of coverage counsel,denied the claim.
in august,home savings filed suit against continental.home savings alleged causes of action for breach of contract,breach of a third party beneficiary contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and bad faith.
continental moved for summary judgment or,alternatively,summary adjudication.home savings filed a for summary adjudication.the parties sought a determination of continental duty to provide coverage under the mortgagee clause.home savings asserted that the mortgagee clause is a standard or union loss payable clause whereby home savings,as mortgagee,is free of the defenses available against the veenstras.continental contended that the mortgagee clause is a simple or open loss payable clause whereby home savings,as mortgagee,remains subject to all defenses available against the veenstras.in addition,continental asserted it owed no coverage as a matter of law because,among other things at the time of loss,the veenstras no longer owned and lived in the residence as required under the building coverage clause owc intentional demolition of the residence for redevelopment purposes is not a covered loss because it was not a fortuitous event and the inadequacy of the security to cover home savings loss was caused by the faulty,inadequate or defective planning,construction or maintenance of the premises,which is specifically excluded under the policy.
the trial court entered summary judgment for continental,based on the absence of a duty to cover home savings claim.having classified the mortgagee clause as a simple or open loss payable clause,the trial court held home savings subject to all defenses available against the veenstras.accordingly,the trial court found that because the veenstras did not own and live in the property at the time of loss,there was no coverage for home savings loss under the building coverage clause.in addition,the trial court held that the intentional demolition of a residence is not a fortuitous act and,hence,is not a covered loss.
discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate only where no material issue of fact exists or where the record establishes as a matter of law that a cause of action asserted against a party can not prevail.after examining the facts before the trial judge on a summary judgment motion,an appellate court independently determines their effect as a matter of law.nicholson lucas th,d.
in reviewing insurance contracts,we apply the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation,seeking to give effect to the parties mutual intent.where the contractual language is clear and explicit,it will prevail.if,however,the policy is ambiguous or uncertain,the policy must be interpreted to give effect to the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.if an ambiguity may be reasonably resolved by either of two constructions,we must select that which is most favorable to the named insured or mortgagee.witherow united american ins,mortgagee held to be entitled to coverage under standard mortgage clause for destruction by fire of the insured premises,where the evidence failed to show the mortgagee knew the insured had transferred title to the property.exclusions are construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.arenson national auto.cas.ins.cal d,named insured held to be entitled to personal liability coverage for fire damage to school property intentionally caused by the named insured minor son.nuffer ins.of north america d.named insured held to be entitled to coverage where he did not participate in or ratify his agent arson,and payment under the policy would not substantially benefit the agent.
two types of loss payable clauses 
the simple or open loss payable clause was first added to insurance policies with the intention of protecting the secured creditor.the simple or open loss payable clause directs the insurer to pay the proceeds of the policy to the lienholder,as its interest may appear,before the insured receives payment on the policy.under this type of policy,the lienholder is simply an appointee to receive the insurance fund to the extent of its interest,and its right of recovery is no greater than the right of the insured.there is no privity of contract between the two parties because there is no consideration given by the lienholder to the insured.accordingly,a breach of the conditions of the policy by the insured would prevent recovery by the lienholder.foremost ins.allstate ins,fns.omitted.
to afford even greater protection to the secured creditor,it became customary to modify the simple or open loss payable clause to provide that the lender coverage could not be forfeited by the act or default of any other person.this modified provision originally known as a union or new york clause came to be known as a standard mortgage clause.citation.gibraltar financial lumbermens.insurance companies have used standard loss payable clauses in real estate fire insurance policies since at least.hastings westchester fire ins.foremost ins.allstate ins,supra,at,fn.at,fn,citing lehto,the standard mortgage clause under attack the lender insurance claim when a borrower commits arson.
under the standard loss payable clause,a lienholder is not subject to the exclusions available to the insurer against the insured because an independent or separate contract of insurance exists between the lienholder and the insurer.in other words,there are two contracts of insurance within the with the lienholder and the insurer and the other with the insured and the insurer.foremost ins.allstate ins,supra,at at,fns.omitted.
the typical consideration given by the lienholder in return for obtaining a standard clause is the lienholder promise to pay premiums on demand.the union,standard or new york clause provides that the acts or neglect will not invalidate the insurance provided that if the fails to pay premiums due,the shall on demand pay the premiums.in return for incurring premium liability,the is freed from the policy defenses which the insured might have against the.the union,standard or new york loss payable clause is then an agreement between the and the insurer independent of the policy contract between the and the insurer.appleman,insurance law and practice,vol,glens falls insurance porter,so.bank of commerce occidental fire casualty,so d dca southern ins.first national bank at orlando,so d dca.progressive american ins.florida bank at daytona beach,so d.
standard clauses 
some standard loss payable clauses explicitly provide that the mortgagee shall be free of the defenses available against the named insured t his insurance,as to the interest of the mortgagee only,shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or the owner of the within described property nationwide mut.ins.hunt.a california appellate court held in that such language constituted a standard loss payable clause.witherow united american ins,supra.at.
witherow does not resolve this case,however,because the continental link plus mortgagee clause contains different language.the continental policy states in relevant part if a mortgagee is named in this policy,any loss payable under building coverage shall be paid to the mortgagee and you,as interests appear if we deny your claim,that denial shall not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee 
continental contends that because this language differs from that of the clause in witherow,home savings is subject to the defenses available against the veenstras.home savings,on the other hand,contends that it is free of those defenses because the continental mortgagee clause is a standard loss payable clause that provides a separate contractual relationship between continental and home savings.home savings also relies on the fact that a standard loss payable clause virtually identical to the continental clause,the iso insurance services office,standard mortgagee clause,has been adjudicated by courts in other jurisdictions to comprise a standard loss payable clause 
c.the iso standard mortgagee clause 
the continental mortgagee clause is almost identical to the iso standard mortgagee clause.we have discerned only one difference,contained in a single sentence found in both policies.that sentence in the iso clause provides if a mortgagee is named in this policy,any loss payable under coverage a or b will be paid to the mortgagee and you,as interests appear.the corresponding sentence in the continental policy reads if a mortgagee is named in this policy,any loss payable under building coverage shall be paid to the mortgagee and you,as interests appear.
coverage a in the iso policy applies to dwellings on the residence premises,and coverage b applies to other structures on the residence premises set apart from the dwelling by clear space.the iso policy defines residence premises to mean the one family dwelling,other structures,and grounds or that part of any other building where you reside and which is shown as the residence premises in the declarations.residence premises also means a two family dwelling where you reside in at least one of the family units and which is shown as the residence premises in the declarations.
building coverage in the continental policy applies to any building at an insured location.you must own the building and use it mainly as a private residence.
continental contends that because coverage a and b in the iso policy differ from building coverage in the continental policy,the judicial opinions upholding the iso standard mortgagee clause as a standard clause are irrelevant to this case.we are not convinced.like the building coverage clause in the continental policy,coverage a and b in the iso policy apply only to buildings used by the named insured as a private residence.while unlike the continental building coverage clause,coverage a and b do not expressly require that the named insured own the building used as a private residence,this appears to be a distinction without a difference,at least for our purposes.both the continental and iso policies state that a change in ownership,occupancy,or risk will not defeat coverage for the mortgagee,provided that the mortgagee notifies the insurer of any change of ownership,occupancy,or risk of which the mortgagee is aware.even though ownership and occupancy are requirements of coverage as far as the named insured is concerned under the continental building coverage clause,a change in ownership and occupancy will not defeat coverage for the mortgagee,provided the mortgagee gives notice of the changes of which it is aware.
within the continental policy,to the extent,if any,the ownership and occupancy requirements of the building coverage clause are inconsistent with the mortgagee clause,the terms of the mortgagee clause must prevail.while all clauses of an insurance contract should be construed together,and the provisions of a mortgage clause must be read together and harmonized with the balance of the policy when reasonably possible,the mortgage clause must prevail in the case of an irreconcilable conflict between it and other provisions of the policy.that is,insofar as the provisions of the policy are inconsistent with,and antagonistic to,the clause protecting the interest of the mortgagee,they must be regarded as inapplicable in determining his or her rights.couch on insurance ed,fns.citations omitted.
courts in west virginia and mississippi,jurisdictions that statutorily require the use of standard loss payable clauses in fire insurance policies,have analyzed the clause and found it to be a standard clause.jones wesbanco bank parkersburg,lumbermens mut.cas.thomas so d.continental attempts to distinguish jones and lumbermens on the basis of the absence of a california statute requiring the use of standard loss payable clauses.we are not convinced,however,that the absence of such a statute in any way lessens the persuasive authority of the other decisions.
the court in jones did not blindly conclude,solely on the basis of the west virginia statute,that the clause is a standard clause.instead,the jones court specifically compared the clause with the new york standard fire policy statutorily designated the west virginia standard fire policy and determined that the clause adheres to the mandates of,and the corresponding requirements of the new york standard fire policy adopted in west virginia.jones wesbanco bank parkersburg,supra.at at.
the west virginia standard fire policy provides in relevant part that if the insurer shall claim that no liability existed as to the mortgagor or owner,it shall,to the extent of payment of loss to the mortgagee,be subrogated to all the mortgagee rights of recovery,but without impairing mortgagee right to sue or it may pay off the mortgage debt and require an assignment thereof and of the mortgage jones wesbanco bank parkersburg,supra.at at.the clause under review in jones provides in relevant part if a mortgagee is named in this policy,any loss payable under coverage a or b will be paid to the mortgagee and you,as interests appear if we deny your claim,that denial shall not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee,if the mortgagee a notifies us of any change of ownership,occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware b pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium and c submits a signed,sworn statement of loss id.at at.
jones concluded that the clause is a standard loss payable clause because it establishes a separate contract between the mortgagee and the insurer.jones explained the mortgage clause at issue states,in pertinent part,that if motorists mutual den ies the insureds claim,that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee,if the mortgagee fulfills three requirements specifically set forth in that provision.the mortgage clause further imposes upon motorists mutual certain obligations if it pay s the mortgagee for any loss and den ies payment to the insureds.this policy language clearly indicates that wesbanco rights thereunder are not dependent upon the insureds right to recover.thus,despite jones conviction of arson,which precluded recovery under the policy,wesbanco rights,as the lender under a deed of trust named as mortgagee,are not disturbed.jones wesbanco bank parkersburg,supra.at at.
courts in other jurisdictions that,like california,have no statutory requirement regarding standard mortgagee clauses,have also determined that the loss payable clause is a standard clause.the south carolina supreme court,in nationwide mut.ins.hunt,supra,held that the clause is a standard clause,stating insurance company argues that the clause is not a standard clause because it does not contain precisely the same wording of such clauses,specifically,the interest of the mortgagee only,shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor or the owner we disagree.the clause,with its wording if we deny your claim,that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee,is substantially the same as the wording of typical standard clauses.it would elevate form over substance to adopt insurance company argument.at at.
continental loss payable clause is a standard clause 
so far as we are aware,every court to consider the matter has found the clause to be a standard loss payable clause.see,jones wesbanco bank parkersburg,supra,lumbermens mut.cas.thomas,supra,so d nationwide mut.ins.hunt,supra.for reasons previously stated,we reject continental attempts to distinguish those cases based on a minor difference in language found in a single sentence in both policies.
welch requires strict construction of the continental clause 
in,the california supreme court considered whether a fire insurance policy ambiguous mortgagee clause was an open or a standard loss payable clause.welch british american.cal.that clause,which was part of the form of policy known as the new york standard form id.at,read if,with the consent of this company,an interest under this policy shall exist in favor of a mortgagee or of any person or corporation having an interest in the subject of insurance other than the interest of the insured as described herein,the conditions hereinbefore contained shall apply in the manner expressed in such provisions and conditions of insurance relating to such interest as shall be written upon,attached,or appended hereto.id.at.
in analyzing the above clause,which one justice criticized for being as awkward and as difficult to put any meaning into as any that has come under my observation in judicial investigations welch british american,supra,cal.at,mcfarland,concurring,the court applied the rule of strict construction against the insurer.the supreme court explained in welch it is well established that conditions which provide for a forfeiture of the interest of the assured or other persons claiming under the policy,are to be strictly construed against the insurance company,and if there is any ambiguity in a policy which may reasonably be solved by either one of two constructions,that interpretation shall be adopted which is the most favorable to the assured,or in this particular case,to the beneficiary in the deed of trust.id.at.
the california supreme court held the mortgagee clause in welch was a standard clause that had freed the mortgagee from all such conditions,except such as are repeated at the time of the creation of that interest by being at that time again,in substance at least,written upon the policy or attached or appended thereto.welch british american,supra,cal.at,italics added.as there were no conditions applicable to the mortgagee that were again written upon,attached or appended to the policy,the california supreme court held the mortgagee was free of the conditions applicable to the named insured.accordingly,even though the named insured had violated a forfeiture clause requiring transfers of title to be approved by the insurer,the mortgagee interest in the policy was unaffected by that transgression.id.at.
the supreme court in welch noted that several other states new york,minnesota,north dakota,wisconsin,new jersey,and michigan had statutorily prescribed the use of the same mortgagee clause as in welch.although none of those states had judicially construed the mortgagee clause,six other states nebraska,washington,mississippi,illinois,iowa,and missouri had judicially construed the same clause and found it to be a standard loss payable clause.
the continental clause is identical to the iso clause 
applying the rule of strict construction against the insurer welch british american,supra,cal.at,we conclude the continental link plus mortgagee clause,which for all relevant purposes is identical to the iso standard mortgagee clause,is a standard loss payable clause.even were we to find the clause to be ambiguous,which we do not,we would have to resolve the question against the insurer.the hallmarks of a standard clause are present in the form of the provisions requiring notice to the mortgagee prior to cancellation,and payment of premiums by the mortgagee upon demand.in case of doubt,a clause in a policy providing for payment of the proceeds to a mortgagee is construed as a standard mortgage clause rather than as a mere designation of a person to receive payment of a loss.an agreement in a policy insuring a mortgagor and containing an clause not to cancel the policy without notice to the mortgagee,effects a contract of insurance directly with the latter,and is,in effect,a union mortgage clause.couch on insurance,supra,fns.omitted.
coverage exists under the continental policy 
continental contends there is no coverage for a claim based on a third party intentional destruction of a residence for redevelopment purposes.we refer to related decisions concerning the willful destruction of property by the named insured and by third parties.
willful destruction of property by the named insured 
insurance code section provides an insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the wilful act of the insured accordingly,the named insured who commits arson in order to recover under a homeowner policy will be barred from collecting on the policy.the mortgagee will likewise be barred from recovering on the policy if the policy contains a simple loss payable mortgagee clause.see,couch on insurance,supra,if the insured has been guilty of such misconduct as bars his or her recovery on the policy,the mortgagee is likewise barred where the insurance is payable to the m
