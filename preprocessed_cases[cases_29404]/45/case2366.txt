under exclusion g,mercury need not provide coverage for bodily injury to anyone included in the policy definition of an insured.because part i defines an insured as including all residents who inhabit the same dwelling as the named insured,mercury need not provide coverage for bodily injury to anyone inhabiting the same dwelling as chu.mercury calls this a resident exclusion.

mercury motion for summary adjudication

in december the court judge luis rodriguez considered and granted the motion.the order stated,there is no triable issue as to any material fact and mercury is entitled as a matter of law to summary adjudication in its favor and against chu and pham.the court determines and declares that mercury insurance policy clearly and unambiguously excludes coverage for pham judgment obtained 
against chu at the time of the accident,chu and pham inhabited the same household and the insurance policy excludes coverage for bodily injury suffered by residents of the same household as the named insured under exclusion g of the policy.mercury has no duty to indemnify chu with respect to the judgment rendered in favor of pham.the only issue remaining with respect to mercury action was its request to be reimbursed defense fees and costs.
mercury motion for jop 
the following month,mercury filed a motion for jop directed against chu.mercury asserted that because the trial court determined in granting summary adjudication that mercury had no duty to indemnify chu for pham judgment,mercury could not have breached the insurance policy,acted in bad faith,or negligently handled pham claim against chu.
chu and pham did not oppose the motion and stipulated they would agree to the entry of a judgment in favor of mercury on the while preserving the right to appeal.
dispute over fees and costs 
on february,mercury chu counsel a proposed judgment stating the following judgment was in mercury favor the insurance policy excluded coverage for pham lawsuit and mercury was entititled to be reimbursed for defense fees and costs incurred in pham lawsuit in the sum of against chu.
on march,chu objected to the proposed judgment inclusion of the defense costs.on march,mercury submitted a proposed amended judgment increasing the amount of reimbursable defense costs to.chu filed an objection to the proposed amended judgment.chu stated he was not given an opportunity to review the documentation pertaining to the award and mercury had not met its burden of proving entitlement to defense fees and costs.
j.the court ruling 
on march,the trial court granted the jop as to chu and vacated the trial date.the court directed mercury to file a revised judgment.based on chu representation he planned to file objections,the court stated it would set the matter for a hearing after the objections had been filed.
on april,chu submitted a judgment that did not include language requiring chu to reimburse mercury for the defense fees and costs.two days later,mercury objected to the judgment on the grounds that it did not include reimbursable defense costs.on april,the court judge william claster signed and entered chu judgment.
mercury motion for entry of judgment 
before discovering judgment had been entered,mercury filed a motion for entry of judgment on may,requesting the judgment include a reimbursement award of,or alternatively,set the matter for trial to determine if mercury was entitled to reimbursement and if so,the amount thereof.mercury explained the amount of attorney fees increased because mercury received an additional bill from defense counsel.
chu opposed the motion arguing the issues had already been ruled upon and a final judgment entered.chu asserted it was too late to make a motion for reconsideration.he also argued mercury was not entitled to recover fees and costs incurred in pham action because there was a potential the claims were covered under the policy.moreover,if mercury had settled the case within policy limits as demanded by the injured party no defense costs or attorney fees would have been incurred.
mercury filed a reply,asserting it was not served with the judgment and it was therefore improperly entered.mercury stated the issue of reimbursement was never adjudicated nor ruled upon by the court.it was not an issue raised in the summary adjudication or jop.mercury argued the judgment should be vacated.
at the hearing on the motion,mercury counsel requested the matter be set for trial on the complaint for declaratory relief for the court to determine the reimbursement issue.judge claster denied mercury request for a trial and its motion for entry of the amended proposed judgment.
the trial court minute order stated,the j udgment will stand as previously entered.the notice of ruling stated the court adopted its tentative ruling,and the following a s mercury specifically notes in its r eply,mercury never filed any motion seeking an award of fees it had incurred in the underlying action in these proceedings.citation.it is thus undisputed that mercury never obtained any right to recover on its claim for reimbursement of the fees incurred in the underlying action and that it had not requested such relief when it signed a stipulation for entry of judgment.as mercury claim for recovery of attorney fees in the underlying action was a claim for affirmative relief,which it did not ever pursue before stipulating to entry of judgment,it can not now seek,through a motion for entry of judgment,a judgment granting it such affirmative relief.the judgment entered on april,is therefore correct the clerk shall give notice of entry of judgment as entered on april.the notice of ruling added the court additional observation that mercury never asked the court to determine if it had a duty to defend chu,and this issue can not now be brought before the court.
chu and pham appeal the trial court order granting summary adjudication in favor of mercury,interpreting the automobile policy as not providing coverage for injury to chu college roommate.they raise the following arguments exclusion g based upon the definition of resident was overbroad,inconspicuous,and defeated chu reasonable expectation of coverage the policy created illusory coverage for a large classification of people and therefore must be conspicuously located in the policy to properly alert the insured of the unusual coverage restrictions and the definition of resident was ambiguous and should be construed in chu favor.for the reasons stated below,we conclude the judgment must be reversed.

general principles regarding automobile insurance 
after years of judicial straining to reconcile the oftentimes competing interests of automobile liability insurers,their insureds and the state interest by way of a general public policy making owners of motor vehicles financially responsible to those injured by them in the operation of such vehicles citation,the legislature announced the public policy in regard to provisions authorized or required to be included in policies affording automobile liability insurance,farmers ins.exchange cocking cal d,cocking meritplan ins.woollum d.concurrently with the adoption of section,the legislature also enacted section,carefully delineating the minimum required coverages of,and the extent of permitted exclusions to coverage in,policies of automobile liability insurance issued in this state.state farm mutual auto.ins.ammar d,fn.omitted ammar.
section,subdivision c,lists the only permissible exclusions from coverage allowed under california law for an automobile liability insurance policy.any exclusion not expressly authorized by section is therefore impermissible and invalid.citation.california state auto.inter ins.bureau gong d.it provides t he insurance afforded by any policy of automobile liability insurance to which subdivision a applies,including the insurer obligation to defend,may,by appropriate policy provision,be made inapplicable to any or all of the following liability assumed by the insured under contract.liability for bodily injury or property damage caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.liability imposed upon or assumed by the insured under any workers compensation law.liability for bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his or her employment.liability for bodily injury to an insured or liability for bodily injury to an insured whenever the ultimate benefits of that indemnification accrue directly or indirectly to an insured.liability for damage to property owned,rented to,transported by,or in the charge of,an insured.a motor vehicle operated by an insured shall be considered to be property in the charge of an insured.liability for any bodily injury or property damage with respect to which insurance is or can be afforded under a nuclear energy liability policy.any motor vehicle or class of motor vehicles,as described or designated in the policy,with respect to which coverage is explicitly excluded,in whole or in part,subd.c,italics added.
relevant to this case,section,subdivision c hereafter the c exclusion,authorizes the carriers of automobile liability insurance to provide for exclusion of claims of liability coverage for bodily injury brought by an insured.specifically,the exclusion permits exclusion of liability to either an insured or an insured whenever the ultimate benefits of that indemnification accrue directly or indirectly to an insured,subd.c.
we note the eight permitted exclusions discussed in section,subdivisions c,refer to the insured and an insured.these two terms are further defined in section,subdivision c,as follows the insured as used in paragraphs,and shall mean only that insured under the policy against whom the particular claim is made or suit brought.an insured as used in paragraphs and shall mean any insured under the policy including those persons who would have otherwise been included within the policy definition of an insured but,by agreement,are subject to the limitations of paragraph of subdivision d designated driver exclusion.thus an insured is any person who fits the definition of an insured regardless of whether he or she was expressly excluded from coverage by the insured in an effort to reduce the premium.see yamasaki mercury casualty ins.th,fn.to reduce premium insured excluded from policy a person who would normally operate the subject vehicle but either because of age or driving record is considered a high risk.simply stated,the legislature permits a person excluded from beneficial coverage to be deemed an insured for purposes of the exclusions listed in paragraphs and of section,subdivision c.
case authority regarding the c exclusion 
there are many cases that have defined the extent to which the eight statutorily authorized exclusions control an insurer ability to exclude automobile liability coverage.we begin by reviewing our supreme court decision in cocking,supra,cal d,that addressed challenges to the c exclusion on both public policy and equal protection grounds.in that case,the insurer farmers brought a declaratory relief action against the insured husband and the insured wife wife seeking to avoid indemnifying husband under his automobile policy for damages he caused wife while she was a passenger in a car driven by husband.the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of wife based on the conclusion the c exclusion was unconstitutional.our supreme court disagreed and reversed,concluding the statute was consistent with state public policy and was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose,and therefore,did not deny equal protection.cocking,supra,cal d at.
in the cocking case,the insurance policy contained the following exclusion t his policy does not apply under part i liability insurance to the liability of any insured for bodily injury to a the named insured,or b a relative of the named insured who is a resident of the same household.another relevant provision of the policy provided that if the insured named in item of the declarations is an individual,the term named insured includes his spouse if a resident of the same household.it is undisputed that at the time of the accident wife and husband were married and living in the same household.accordingly,all parties agree that the exclusion,if valid,would bar bodily injury coverage for her injuries.cocking,supra,cal d at.the supreme court noted the policy exclusion was expressly authorized by section,subdivision c cocking,supra,cal d at.
the court first addressed wife public policy argument based on the theory the exclusion was unenforceable because it violated public policy expressed in civil code section,subdivision a,making every person responsible for his or her own negligent acts.cocking,supra,cal d at.wife also asserted section conflicted with the general policy favoring adequate recovery for persons injured in automobile accidents.citation.cocking,supra,cal d at.
the court explained public policy claims had been repeatedly rejected both by us and the court of appeal.citations.cocking,supra,cal d at.it was referring to one of its opinions written in,in which the court observed,in a line of cases extending at least back to,supported by authorities from other jurisdictions extending back considerably further than that,the courts of this state have indicated that a liability insurance provision excluding the named insured or members of his family from coverage is valid and not in contravention of public policy.citations.in view of these authorities the legislature in amended section to expressly permit such an exclusion.citation.cocking,supra,cal d at,italics added.
with respect to wife specific contentions,the court reasoned,the c e xclusion is not contrary to the policy expressed in the civil code because it is that an injured party,such as wife,retains the full unrestricted right to sue the negligent insured.citation.the exclusion affects only the right to reach insurance proceeds for the satisfaction of any judgment obtained.second,and more fundamental,reliance upon general principles favoring recovery for injuries is misplaced.with respect to the specific issue before us,the public policy of this state is contained not in broadly expressed generalized abstractions but in the applicable statutory provisions themselves.section expressly recites that the legislature declares that the public policy of this state in regard to provisions authorized or required to be included in policies affording automobile liability insurance or motor vehicle liability insurance issued or delivered in this state shall be as stated in this article,and that this article expresses the total public policy of this state respecting the contents of such policies,italics added.thus,section,subdivision c,is not only consistent with state public policy,it itself constitutes and expresses that policy.citation.t he legislature decision to authorize automobile insurers to continue to exclude bodily injury liability to an insured under the policy is supported by a variety of rational,legitimate reasons.that we may disagree with some or all of these reasons affords no justification whatever for the substitution of our own view of what is proper public policy for that of the legislature.citation.cocking,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court also considered wife challenge on equal protection grounds,arguing the exclusion was irrational and arbitrary.the court stated,the applicable review standard for testing the constitutionality of the c exclusion,is the traditional or restrained standard which requires courts to uphold the validity of a legislative classification if it rationally relates to a legitimate state purpose.citations.in applying this standard,courts must conduct a serious and genuine judicial inquiry into the nature of the connection between the particular classification and the legislative goals.citation.cocking,supra,cal d at.
the cocking court reasoned,as previously noted,the challenged provision permits,but does not require,automobile insurers to continue to exclude coverage for bodily injury liability to insureds usually,family household members.the primary basis underlying the use of this exclusion has been well described in a recent indiana case t he concept of a household exclusion is a common one which has long enjoyed judicial support.its purpose is to prevent suspect legal actions which may not be truly adversary and over which the insurer has little or no control.such an exclusion is a natural target for the insurer protection from collusive assertions of liability.t he freedom of the parties to exclude risks from an insurance contract is well established citations.citations.defendants argue that the prevention of fraud or collusion has been deemed to be an insufficient and overbroad justification for a blanket rule of immunity from suit.citations.a statute which purported to immunize an insured driver from bodily injury liability actions by other insured family members might be constitutionally invalid i t is unreasonable to eliminate causes of action of an entire class of persons simply because some undefined portion of the designated class may file fraudulent lawsuits.citation.cocking,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court decided that in the case before it,no such immunity is conferred,and no such causes of action are abrogated.rather,the legislature has merely excluded one class from mandatory liability coverage,consistent with a preexisting judicial rule,founded upon freedom of contract and the insurer legitimate interest in minimizing future losses attributable to fraud or collusion.these considerations fully satisfy the rational basis test.the legislature reasonably may have concluded that the benefits to the public from automatically including family member coverage in all automobile liability policies were outweighed by the probable adverse consequences of such a rule.it is not unreasonable to suppose that substantial increases in premiums would be forthcoming if such coverage were declared mandatory.it may well have been a legislative concern that an increase in the costs of liability insurance might result in an appreciable increase in the number of uninsured drivers to the ultimate detriment of the general public.in addition,family members are frequently protected by the medical coverage provisions of the insured policy,or by other medical or casualty insurance,thereby diluting the necessity for liability coverage.the legislature may have deemed it unwise to require an insured to purchase expensive liability insurance in order to protect himself or another insured from potential injuries.cocking,supra,cal d at.finally,our supreme court concluded that to require family member liability coverage against the better judgment of the contracting parties would constitute an unprecedented judicial interference into private contractual and economic arrangements in direct contravention of the public policy legislatively expressed in section.cocking,supra,cal d at.
in conclusion,the cocking court determined an insurance policy resident relative exclusion was in sync with public policy and was constitutionally sound because it was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.since the cockingopinion,a large body of case law has developed concerning resident relative exclusions insurance policies typically define relatives as members or residents of the named insured household.courts have held that the term resident is not inherently ambiguous kibbee blue ridge ins.th,kibbee,although it may be ambiguous in a particular context.national auto.cas.ins.underwood th.the meaning of the term resident varies according to the circumstances and facts of the case.utley allstate ins.th,utley.
consequently,over the past years various iterations of the definition of resident relative have been the subject of judicial interpretation,with the terms being broadly construed when the result is to find coverage and narrowly construed when the result is to preclude it.what most courts appear to agree upon is the term residence connotes any factual place of abode of some permanency,more than a mere temporary sojourn.citations.this understanding is consistent with dictionary definitions of the term resident as one who dwells in a place for a period of some duration and residence as a temporary or permanent dwelling place,abode,or habitation to which one intends to return as distinguished from a place of temporary sojourn or transient visit.citations.kibbee,supra,th at.
several of the cases interpreting resident relative exclusion clauses have concerned children who were the subject of custody orders.in such cases,there is no test for determining a child residency,but the usual rules of contract interpretation and the common understanding of the terms resident and residence provide clear direction as to the factual inquiry a court must undertake in determining the applicability of the resident relative exclusion.kibbee,supra,th at.the determination turns on whether the child regularly spends time in the household in question,such that there exists a continuing expectation of the child periodic return on intervals regular enough that the household is the child home during the time the child is there,as opposed to a place of infrequent and irregular visits.citation.ibid.thus,a child who spends substantially equal amounts of time with each parent on a regularly rotating basis can be said to reside with each parent.id.at.
for example,in kibbee,supra,th at page,a custody order provided the children would live with each parent for alternating periods.however,after the father moved to mexico with his new wife,the children lived exclusively with the mother.during a vacation at the father home in mexico,one of the children and father drowned.id.at.the mother sought recovery from the father new wife,who tendered the defense to her homeowner insurance policy.the insurance company refused to provide coverage based on the policy resident relative exclusion clause.after the new wife sued the insurance company for breach of contract,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance company.ibid.
the kibbee court reversed the ruling,concluding the children were not residents of the father household at the time of their visit to mexico.the court found it significant that there were no plans for future visits by the children,and that the children had brought with them only the clothing and toys they needed for the period.kibbee,supra,th at.the court held,the conclusion is inescapable that while staying with their father in mexico the boys were on a mere temporary sojourn.ibid.
another interesting case is afrasiabi state farm fire casualty th,in which this court held the fact a relative pays rent to the insured homeowner did not affect his or her exclusion as a resident relative.it would not be at all unusual for parents to charge rent to adult children who return to the parental home.if payment of rent was made a determining factor in cases involving the resident relative exclusion,it would vitiate the goal of screening out collusive lawsuits.the courts in california have recognized that the resident relative exclusion serves the public policy of insulating insurers from questionable claims.id.at.
analysis of nonrelative resident exclusion 
mercury cites the above statutory and case authority to support its position there is nothing wrong with expanding the relative resident exclusion to nonrelatives.it asserts the same policy and constitutional arguments would apply.we disagree.
in this case of first impression,mercury seeks approval of a new nonrelative resident exclusion.we call it new because we found no case authority,law review article,or treatise examining the c exclusion application to any class of persons other than relative residents.mercury cites to no authority permitting an insurance company to achieve liability immunity from a significantly larger class of people based on their residency status alone and presumably without their knowledge or consent.
we begin by examining the scope of the new exclusion.mercury policy exclusion section contains,clearly and plainly,the exact language contained in the c exclusion.as explained,the legislature statutorily authorized mercury to exclude claims of liability for bodily injury brought by an insured.mercury policy defines an insured in part i of the policy as including four categories of people as follows named insured and any relative persons listed in the policy permissive drivers and residents other than those described in categories and defined above as relatives and all named insureds.in addition,the policy defines resident broadly as anyone who inhabits the same dwelling as the named insured.inhabits and dwelling are not further defined.
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.on the other hand,i f the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.citations.t he court must interpret the language in context,with regard to its intended function in the policy.citation.bank of the west superior court cal th.
in the many cases discussing the resident relative exception,the term resident varies according to the circumstances and facts of the case.utley,surpa,th at.however,generally in those cases an insured in the context of applying the exclusion is limited to a small class of family members residing together with some degree of permanence.a cousin or aunt who temporarily visits a relative home for the night is not an insured as defined by the resident relative exception cases.
we found no authority,and certainly nothing in the supreme court cocking opinion,authorizing expansion of the exception to nonrelatives residing together.to the contrary,the cocking opinion addressed the limited issue of whether wife could seek benefits from husband automobile policy.the court ruled the legislature enacted the c exclusion to codify the state public policy that permitted insurers to exclude the named insured or members of his family.cocking,supra,cal d at,italics added.the court rejected wife constitutional challenges after concluding the legislative classification related to the legitimate state purpose of preventing suspect legal actions which may not be truly adversary.id.at.the court determined excluding resident relatives served the public policy of insulating insurers from collusive assertions of liability.ibid.
simply stated,the entire crocking decision is based on the premise the c exclusion is being applied to a relative who resides with some permanence with the named insured.we conclude the court reasoning does not apply to nonrelatives inhabit ing the same dwelling as the named insured.cohabitation can be temporary and involve complete strangers.there is no legal basis to assume insurers face the same risk of fraudulent lawsuits.college roommates often are complete strangers who do not have direct pecuniary interests or legal responsibilities with respect to each other.
it appears that mercury new nonrelative resident exclusion raises the following issue of first impression did the legislature intend for there to be limits to how an insurer may define an insured in its policy for purposes of the c exclusion we recognize the legislature did not identify any particular group or class or persons when it enacted the c exclusion.as noted in the dissenting opinion of justice work in ammar,supra,d at pages,the simple fact is,the legislature did not so identify resident relatives,any more than it so identified nonrelatives with whom the insured resides,or members of the insured saturday night poker club.the c exclusion was limited to excluding only those persons who fall within the category there named insureds.
as we now explain,examination of california mandatory insurance statutory scheme and public policy goals provide defined limits to who may be named an insured in an automobile liability policy.the c exclusion giving insurers immunity from liability for bodily injury to an insured,which can be any insured under the policy must be read together with sections and.section defines insured as the person or persons to whom any policy subject to this article is issued as named insured and any other person to whom coverage is afforded under the terms of any such policy.italics added.pursuant to section,coverage can only be afforded to persons having an insurable interest.if the insured has no insurable interest,the contract is void.
as a general rule liability insurance,like other forms of insurance,must be supported by an insurable interest in the covered risk.couch on insurance,fn.omitted osborne security ins.d,the object to be obtained by this rule,the reason for its being,is avoidance of wagering contracts.for the purposes of liability insurance,an insurable interest is to be found in the interest that the insured has in the safety of persons or the freedom from damage to property,which might give rise to suits against him or her in case of their injury or destruction.this interest does not depend upon the insured legal or equitable interest in property but solely upon whether he or she may be charged at law or in equity with the liability against which the insurance is procured.therefore,title is not the test of an insurable interest in a contract of liability insurance.insurance carried for the account of whom it may concern covers anyone having an insurable interest in the insured property at the time of the happening of the loss.couch on insurance,supra,fns.omitted.thus,an individual has an unlimited insurable interest in his or her own personal liability.for example,a father who procures a liability policy on an automobile registered in his name but used by and in possession of his minor child has a definite insurable interest in that the parent would be liable in the event the child damaged or injured third persons while driving.however,a mortgagee of an automobile who has neither possession nor control of the car does not have an insurable interest for the purposes of liability insurance covering the operation of the vehicle.ibid.
section codified this rule,defining an insurable interest as,every interest in property,or any relation thereto,or liability in respect thereof,of such a nature that a contemplated peril might directly damnify the insured,is an insurable interest.a mere contingent or expectant interest in anything,not founded on an actual right to the thing,nor upon any valid contract for it,is not insurable.
accordingly,to be an insured the nonrelative resident must have an insurable interest.pham does not have an insurable interest in the nature of the potential legal liability for chu vehicle or chu actions as a driver.unlike a or other familial relationship,there is simply no basis to hold pham liable in the event chu damaged or injured a third person while driving the insured automobile owned entirely by chu.pham and chu were unrelated.they were not business partners they each paid rent separately to aunt diana.the record suggests they did not have a close friendship.none of chu roommates would have a potential insura
