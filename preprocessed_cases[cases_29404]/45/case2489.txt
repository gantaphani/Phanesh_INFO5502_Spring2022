liability insurance policies for commercial motor vehicles typically include an omnibus clause.as pertinent here,that clause defines as an insured one who is vicariously liable for the conduct of a named insured or a permissive user in using or operating the covered vehicle.
in this appeal,we conclude that such an omnibus clause may make a person or entity that is potentially vicariously liable under the peculiar risk doctrine an insured,and thereby entitled to a defense pursuant to the insurance policy.under the peculiar risk doctrine,one may be held vicariously liable if he hires an independent contractor to do work that is likely to create a peculiar risk of harm to others unless special precautions are taken.
the alleged peculiar risk in the present case arose out of a accident at the lone entrance of a construction site.there is evidence that this intersection entrance required the trucker to make a while driving westbound in eastbound lanes,encroach on at least two pedestrian crosswalks,jump a curb,and drive across a sidewalk.
we reverse a summary judgment and a stipulated judgment that concluded,as a matter of law,that the trucker insurers did not owe a duty to defend the contractor under any vicarious liability theory.
factual and procedural background 
in this action,plaintiff and appellant american states insurance company american seeks a defense on behalf of its the underlying defendant and respondent insurers,progressive casualty insurance company progressive and wilshire insurance company wilshire.american also seeks a declaration that progressive provide the primary coverage for the lawsuit.
the collision occurred as follows.on july,victor meza,a trucker,was driving a at the only entrance to a construction site in san diego when the rear portion of his trailer ran over a pedestrian,yevdokia bristman bristman.as a result,both of bristman legs had to be amputated.meza was the sole owner and operator of the tractor truck and was insured by progressive.western trucking llc western was the sole owner of the trailer and was insured by wilshire.
at the time of the accident,meza was hauling dirt under an agreement with western.western in turn was operating under an oral agreement with vinci pacific corporation vinci,the grading contractor on the construction project the project.the project general contractor was garden communities garden.the project developer was trii llc trii.vinci was a named insured under a commercial auto policy issued by american garden and trii were additional insureds under that policy.vinci,garden and trii collectively,the vinci parties tendered their defense of the pedestrian bristman action bristman lawsuit to american.american accepted the tender under a reservation of rights.
the complaint in the bristman lawsuit,which was filed in san diego superior court,alleged in part a cause of action for motor vehicle negligence against the vinci parties,claiming that they employed meza and that meza and western were their agents.the bristman lawsuit also alleged that the vinci parties were liable for failing to take necessary safety precautions at the project intersection entrance.meza and western,in turn,against each other and the vinci parties,alleging that the vinci parties were vicariously liable.
american tendered the defense of the vinci parties in the bristman lawsuit to progressive and wilshire.in denying this tender,progressive and wilshire noted that the vinci parties were not named or additional insureds under the progressive or wilshire policies,and were not using the truck involved in the bristman accident.
in the bristman lawsuit,the vinci parties individually moved for summary judgment.as relevant here,those parties disputed bristman claim that they were vicariously liable for meza operation of his truck.in denying these summary judgment motions,the bristman trial court found in part that there were triable issues of material fact concerning whether garden retained control over meza operation of his truck,whether the peculiar risk doctrine applied,and whether vinci was a substantial factor in causing bristman injuries 
that brings us to the present action,which american filed in sacramento superior court hereafter defense lawsuit.through this action,american seeks declaratory relief concerning progressive and wilshire duty to defend the vinci parties in the bristman lawsuit,and reimbursement of sums american paid in defending the bristman lawsuit 
in the defense lawsuit,american moved for summary adjudication and wilshire moved for summary.both motions raised the dispositive issue of whether progressive and wilshire had a duty to defend the vinci parties in the bristman lawsuit.after taking judicial notice of the bristman the sense that progressive and wilshire had notice of plaintiff bristman contentions and supporting trial court in this defense lawsuit found,as a matter of law,that progressive and wilshire did not have any duty to defend the vinci parties in the bristman lawsuit.the defense trial court found that there was no agency relationship between and the vinci parties,and that the peculiar risk doctrine did not apply.a judgment for wilshire,and a stipulated judgment for progressive,followed.this appeal from american then ensued.
discussion 
backgrounda.the issue 
the dispositive issue is whether there is a triable issue of material fact that american insureds,the vinci parties,were potentially vicariously liable in the bristman lawsuit under the theory of retained control establishing agency or under the doctrine of peculiar risk.we answer no as to the retained control theory,but yes as to the peculiar risk doctrine.accordingly,as we shall explain,progressive and wilshire owed the vinci to this potential vicarious liability under the peculiar risk duty to defend them in the bristman lawsuit,absent additional evidence regarding this duty.
standard of review 
a summary judgment is to be upheld if all the evidentiary papers we review that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we do not resolve factual issues but ascertain whether there are any to resolve.code civ,subd.c colores board of trustees th,d colores flait north american watch th,d.

legal principles governing duty to defend and burden of proof in summary relief context 
a liability insurer must defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts that give rise to the potential of liability under the policy.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose gray zurich insurance cal d,gray amato mercury casualty th,d.
the insurer duty to defend the insured includes both the named insured s and anyone else included in the policy definition of insured.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,hereafter croskey see also maryland casualty nationwide ins.th,d.
in determining its duty to defend,the insurer must consider facts from any complaint,the insured,and other sources.montrose,supra,cal th at,d,gray,supra,cal d at,croskey,supra.an insurer does not have a continuing duty to investigate the potential for coverage if it has made an informed decision on coverage at the time of tender.gunderson fire ins.exchange th,d.however,where the information available at the time of tender shows no coverage,but information available later shows otherwise,a duty to defend may then arise.see marie general star indemnity th,d croskey,supra.
in an action in which some claims are potentially covered and others are not,the insurer must defend the entire action,including those claims for which there is no potential coverage under the if those claims predominate.it is enough that a single claim is potentially covered by the policy the insurer owes a duty to defend even if all other claims against the insured are clearly not covered.this duty to defend the entire mixed action is justified,not contractually,but prophylactically,as an obligation imposed by law in support of the insurance policy.buss superior court cal th,d,buss,fn.omitted horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d,cassady morgan,lewis bockius llp th,d croskey,supra.this duty to defend an entire action continues until the insurer produces undeniable evidence supporting an allocation of a specific portion of the defense costs to a noncovered claim.horace mann,supra,cal th at,d,see also id.at,d.the defending insurer may have a right to be reimbursed for defense costs allocable solely to claims for which there was no potential coverage under the policy.buss,supra,cal th at,d.
in resolving the question of whether a duty to defend in the context of a summary judgment motion in a declaratory relief insurer has a higher burden than the insured.t he insured need only show that the underlying claim may fall within policy coverage the insurer must prove it can not the insurer,in other words,must present undisputed facts that eliminate any possibility of coverage.montrose,supra,cal th at,d,vann travelers companies th,d.

with these legal principles and policy language in mind,we turn to the two issues of vicarious liability here the theory of retained control establishing agency,and the doctrine of peculiar risk.
ii.the theory of retained control establishing agency 
iii.the peculiar risk doctrine 
generally,an employer,hirer of an independent contractor is not liable for the negligence of the contractor or its employees.the exceptions to this rule,however,are numerous.castro,supra,d at.one of these exceptions is the peculiar risk doctrine as expressed in restatement second of torts,sections and.castro,at.toland sunland housing group,cal th,d,toland griesel dart industries,cal d,griesel,overruled on other grounds in privette superior court cal th,d,privette.
restatement second of torts,section provides one who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create,during its progress,a peculiar unreasonable risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken,is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the absence of such precautions if the employer a fails to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take such precautions,or b fails to exercise reasonable care to provide in some other manner for the taking of such precautions.italics added.
restatement second of torts,section states one who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken,is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the failure of the contractor to exercise reasonable care to take such precautions,even though the employer has provided for such precautions in the contract or otherwise.italics added.
given this italicized difference in language between restatement second of torts,sections and,as well as the sections respective placements in the restatement direct and vicarious liability sectors,older decisions have characterized section as direct liability for an employer and section as vicarious liability.toland,supra,cal th at,d,griesel,supra,cal d at,castro,supra,d at.see rest d torts,topic,introductory note to.
more recent decisions from our state supreme court,however,have characterized the nature of liability set forth in both sections and of the restatement second of torts as essentially vicarious liability.toland,supra,cal th at,d,privette,supra,cal th at fn,d.as toland explained u nder both sections and,the hiring person liability is cast in the form of the hiring person breach of a duty to see to it that special precautions are taken to prevent injuries to others in that sense,the liability is direct.yet,peculiar risk liability is not a traditional theory of direct liability for the risks created by one own conduct liability under both sections is in essence vicarious or derivative in the sense that it derives from the act or omission of the hired contractor,because it is the hired contractor who has caused the injury by failing to use reasonable care in performing the work.we made this point in privette,supra,cal th at page,d,in footnote the conclusion that peculiar risk is a form of vicarious liability is unaffected by the characterization of the doctrine as direct liability in situations when the person hiring an independent contractor fails to provide in the contract that the contractor shall take special precautions.toland,supra,cal th at,d.
the characterization of both section and section of the restatement second of torts as vicarious liability follows because the principal distinction in application of sections and concerns the employer and the independent contractor he has hired and not the liability of the employer to others.where there is a special peculiar risk of physical harm,the employer is liable to third persons injured as a proximate result of the independent contractor negligence whether or not there is an agreement requiring the independent contractor to take special precautions.kelleher empresa hondurena de vapores,d,italics as added by quotation of kelleher in toland,supra,cal th at,d.the existence of the contract between the employer and the independent contractor,while not affecting the rights of others,does,however,significantly affect the rights of the employer and independent contractor by obligating the independent contractor to indemnify the employer for loss occasioned by his liability to others.kelleher,at,citing rest d torts,com.e.in short,a person held liable under the doctrine of peculiar risk is entitled to equitable indemnity from the independent contractor citations.thus,although peculiar risk is sometimes described as a nondelegable duty rule,it is in effect a form of vicarious liability.privette,supra,cal th at,d.
consequently,in light of toland and privette,the peculiar risk doctrine set forth in sections and of the restatement second of torts is essentially a doctrine of vicarious liability.and the doctrine relates to special risks,peculiar to the work to be done,and arising out of its character,or out of the place where it is to be done,against which a reasonable man would recognize the necessity of taking special precautions peculiar does not mean that the risk must be one which is abnormal to the type of work done,or that it must be an abnormally great risk.it has reference only to a special,recognizable danger arising out of the work itself.rest.torts,com.b.castro,supra,d at.
that brings us to the issue of the
