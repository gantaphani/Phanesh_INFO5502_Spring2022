plaintiffs global naps,frank gangi,william rooney,and janet lima collectively,global naps or gnaps brought this diversity action against defendant federal insurance company federal insurance,seeking reimbursement of litigation expenses incurred in the course of defending a lawsuit brought by verizon at the time verizon filed its complaint,global naps was covered by a combination insurance policy issued by federal insurance that obliged the insurance company to defend any insured against a suit seeking damages for personal injury.the policy pertinently defined personal injury as injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses,committed in the course of your business b malicious prosecution.global naps argues that the verizon complaint adumbrated a claim for malicious prosecution,see continental cas.gilbane,triggering federal insurance duty to defend the lawsuit.
the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment,concluding in a thorough and decision that the verizon action could not be construed to adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution.for the reasons that follow,we agree that federal insurance was not obligated to defend the verizon action under the terms of the policy.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court.
global naps and verizon are telecommunications carriers offering local telephone service to customers in new york and new england.under the telecommunications act of the telecom act,local exchange carriers must permit competing carriers to interconnect with their telephone networks,thereby allowing customers of different local carriers to connect to each other.generally,only the carrier of the customer who originates a phone call bills the customer,even though the carrier of the party on the receiving end also incurs costs to connect the call.thus,if a verizon customer calls a global naps customer,verizon would initially bill its customer for the phone call,and then compensate global naps for handing off the call to its own customer.the telecom act obliges local exchange carriers to establish reciprocal compensation arrangements that govern the originating carrier obligation to reimburse the terminating carrier.the rates that a terminating carrier may charge are set by the public utility commission puc or public service commission psc for each state,and are generally based on minutes of use mous generated by traffic sent to that carrier network.
on september,global naps filed an administrative complaint before the new york psc encompassing two distinct claims.first,global naps alleged that verizon unlawfully withheld reciprocal compensation for mous invoiced in august.the second claim sought a declaration from the psc that global naps was entitled to the same rate of reciprocal compensation from verizon for calls terminating with its internet service provider isp customers as for all other telephone traffic.in february,global naps withdrew its claim for payment of the august invoice from the psc complaint.one month later,the psc issued a declaratory ruling upholding global naps position on the second claim.
on may,verizon brought the lawsuit underlying this matter in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the complaint alleged that global naps had fraudulently billed verizon for tens of millions of dollars in reciprocal compensation charges for telephone calls that were never made,or that if made,were of substantially shorter duration than claimed on gnaps bills.in total,verizon articulated nine causes of action in its complaint,including violations of rico,the telecom act,and the massachusetts deceptive trade practices act,as well as breach of contract and unjust enrichment.of particular significance to this case,verizon alleged that global naps prosecution of its administrative complaint before the new york psc was a predicate act supporting rico liability 
defendants prosecution and maintenance of the new york psc proceeding relating to the number of mous involved was itself a fraud,designed to confuse bell atlantic and conceal the nature of defendants racketeering activity.gangi and rooney in particular submitted papers,and directed gnaps counsel to submit papers and take positions,that defendants knew were false and misleading.
conspicuously absent from verizon lengthy complaint was any cause of action for malicious prosecution arising from global naps prosecution of the psc action.indeed,as the district court observed in its decision,the term malicious prosecution does not appear anywhere in verizon complaint.nonetheless,global naps asserts that various references to the psc proceedings in verizon complaint adumbrated a claim for malicious prosecution,triggering federal insurance duty to defend the verizon action.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
duty to defend 
both parties agree that massachusetts law governs this dispute.the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc has stated that 
the question of the initial duty of a liability insurer to defend actions against the insured is decided by matching the complaint with the policy provisions if the allegations of the complaint are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms,the insurer must undertake the defense otherwise stated,the process is one of envisaging what kinds of losses may be proved as lying within the range of allegations of the complaint,and then seeing whether any such loss fits the expectation of protective insurance reasonably generated by the terms of the policy.
continental,at quoting sterilite continental cas,internal citations and footnote omitted.
the sjc has stressed the broad scope of this duty.see rubenstein royal ins.of america,an insurer must tread cautiously regarding its duty to defend an insured against actions in view of the expansive interpretation given to that duty.boston symphony orchestra,commercial union ins,it is axiomatic that an insurance company duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.accordingly,the absence of any explicit claim for malicious prosecution in the verizon complaint is not dispositive.we must look beyond the specified causes of action to determine whether the underlying allegations are reasonably susceptible of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution.liberty mut.ins.sca services.
malicious prosecution 
the elements of malicious prosecution 
to determine whether the allegations contained in the verizon complaint state or adumbrate a claim for malicious prosecution,we must first identify the elements of the offense.the district court concluded correctly that the elements of a claim for malicious prosecution are governed by new york law because both the psc proceeding and the verizon complaint were filed in new york.see ethicon,aetna cas.sur,holding that the state where the underlying action is filed should furnish the malicious prosecution standard.under new york law 
the elements essential to the maintenance of an action to recover damages for malicious prosecution are the commencement of a judicial proceeding against the plaintiff,at the insistence of the defendant,without probable cause,with malice,which action was terminated in favor of the plaintiff,and to the plaintiff injury 
felske bernstein,citing berman silver,forrester schisano.global naps resists this doctrinaire conception of malicious prosecution,insisting that this phrase should be understood according to its ordinary meaning and not treated as a legal term of art in construing liability insurance policies,the supreme judicial court ordinarily looks to common usage,eschewing reliance upon nice legal distinctions that would not be apparent to the lay policyholder.global naps further argues that employing a lay understanding of malicious prosecution should lead the court to find a defense obligation because a reasonable lay insured would expect malicious prosecution coverage to apply to allegations that it had prosecuted a baseless claim to advance a fraudulent scheme.
an ordinary meaning approach to construing malicious prosecution claims has been reje
