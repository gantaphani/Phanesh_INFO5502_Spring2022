in my eight years experience in processing contestable claims,i have earned approval to clear contestable claims up to.this approval is granted only upon a foundational knowledge and experience in processing all types of claims and the proven ability to work independently with minimal direction and supervision.processing claims of various types has allowed me to become effective in interpreting contract law and insurance statutes.claim processing has also strengthen sic my analytical and problem solving skills especially in the analyzing of the medical information received during the handling of contestable claims.
during her deposition,mcallister acknowledged this description is an accurate portrayal of what she had been doing as a senior claims examiner.
mcallister was skilled in following detailed claims manuals.the foreword to the incontestable claims manual for life claims processing contains the following language no guide can be written in sufficient detail to cover all facets of claims handling.a large percentage of our work can not be guided by a rule book it has to be learned on the job.a claims examiner becomes a professional through continued education,training,and experience.nothing is more important than good common sense judgment.the foreword to the contestable claims manual contains nearly identical language,but also makes the following statement the claims philosophy of the company is to do more than the law requires with respect to fair claims handling practices.our policy is to bend over backward to give the rights of our insureds as much importance as those of the company.we seek to find ways to pay,not ways to decline to pay,all valid claims,promptly and courteously.
mcallister had responsibilities relating to the investigation of claims,such as the ability to direct claims handling and to expedite investigations.she was required to thoroughly review investigation reports when they arrived to determine if further handling was necessary.for example,whenever it appeared an insured may not have disclosed material medical history,mcallister had to determine whether to ask the investigator to do more work or to refer the claim to the medical department.mcallister was also required to be on the lookout for fraudulent claims.when discussing accident investigations,the manual states if the possibility of a misrepresentation is learned during the investigation,consider whether or not it should be pursued for additional documentation.

the district court grant of summary judgment to transamerica must be reviewed de novo.mayer nextel west,cir.summary judgment for transamerica is proper if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to mcallister and giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences,shows there are no genuine issues of material fact and transamerica is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.
ii.discussion 
administrative exemption 
the flsa was enacted to eliminate labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health,efficiency,and general of workers.a.to further that goal,the flsa requires employers to pay employees overtime pay for working more than forty hours in a workweek.a.however,an employee is exempt from the overtime requirements if she is employed in an administrative capacity,as defined by the secretary of labor.a.transamerica has the burden to prove mcallister is exempt from overtime compensation.fife harmon,cir.
in its implementing regulations,the dol created a long test and a short test to determine whether an employee is employed in an administrative capacity.see.as the district court properly recognized,mcallister position must be analyzed under the short test.see e,a.under the short test,transamerica must prove the following mcallister was paid on a salary basis of at least per week mcallister primary duty consisted of the performance of office work directly related to management policies or general business operations of the employer or the employer customers and mcallister performance of such primary duty included work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.a.
salary basis 
transamerica must first prove it paid mcallister on a salary basis of at least per week.e,a.mcallister was paid on a salary basis if she regularly received a predetermined amount of pay,which constituted all or part of her compensation,and was not subject to reduction based on the quality or quantity of the work she performed.a.in,mcallister annual salary exceeded,which was paid in semimonthly payments of and was all or part of her compensation.
on appeal,mcallister argues she was not paid on a salary basis because she was required to work overtime.but transamerica never disciplined her or docked her pay for missing work,or even threatened her with a dock in pay for missing work.see auer robbins,d salary basis test denies exempt status only when employer actual practice involves making deductions from pay or a policy creates a significant likelihood of such deductions see generally boykin boeing,cir t he focus of the regulations is to prohibit employers from claiming that their employees are compensated on a salary basis when the employees are subject to deductions in pay.haywood am.van lines,cir the dol regulations prohibit monetary discipline of exempt employees.fife,at employees receiving predetermined amounts of pay each pay period which were not subject to reduction did not lose exempt status just because they were paid extra for overtime work.nothing in the record shows mcallister salary was in jeopardy of being reduced based on the quality or quantity of the work she performed.thus,w
