labor code section,subdivision d allows an employer that leases or borrows an employee from another employer to fulfill its statutory obligations to obtain worker compensation insurance by contracting with the other employer for the other employer to obtain such coverage.in this case,three client companies allegedly leased workers from an employee leasing company pursuant to an agreement by which the employee leasing company was to obtain worker compensation insurance covering the leased workers.the client companies injured workers were later denied worker compensation coverage under the worker compensation policy allegedly obtained by the employee leasing company.the client companies sued the marketing company that introduced the client companies to the employee leasing company.the marketing company tendered its own defense to the employee leasing company carrier contending it was a third party beneficiary of the worker compensation policy.when a defense was refused,the marketing company against the insurance company claiming insurance bad faith.in these consolidated actions we agree with the insurer that the marketing company is not a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract.
facts and procedure 
these consolidated cases involve employee leasing services provided by either omne staffing services,omne staffing,or omne staff leasing services,omne leasing,to three client companies omne staffing is a delaware corporation.omne leasing is a florida corporation.infinet marketing services,dba infinet insurance and financial network infinet,is a texas corporation in the business of providing marketing services to employee leasing companies.
in,the predecessor of american motorist insurance company amico issued worker compensation and employer liability policy number to omne staffing hereafter,the policy.the policy requires amico to pay all worker compensation benefits required by law to be paid by the named insured,and to defend the named insured in any proceeding against it for those benefits.omne staffing is the only named insured on the policy,and the policy contains no provision or endorsement for coverage of alternate or additional employers.
the client companies involved here include suburban plastering,dba proline plastering and martin marcowall sometimes collectively referred to as suburban,which are the plaintiffs in suburban plastering et infinet insurance and financial network,et,orange county superior court case hereafter,the suburban action.the other client company is wendt painting,which is the plaintiff in wendt painting,infinet insurance and financial network,et,orange county superior court case hereafter,the wendt action.at the heart of both actions are the client companies claims that promised worker compensation insurance was not obtained,exposing them to civil liability when workers were injured.
the suburban complaint 
in july,suburban filed its complaint against infinet and other defendants alleging various tort and statutory causes of action arising out of its relationship with omne staffing and infinet.the suburban complaint alleged that in january,the two client companies,suburban and martin had negotiated with omne staffing and infinet for omne staffing and infinet to act as of the client companies employees and,among other things,procure worker compensation insurance,process payroll,and submit payroll tax payments to federal and state authorities covering those employees.although no written contract was fully executed,throughout,the client companies paid omne staffing large sums of money in the range of million combined,which fees included the client companies worker compensation insurance premiums.by early,the client companies learned omne staffing had not procured worker compensation insurance covering their leased employees.omne staffing assets had been seized by the federal government and criminal proceedings commenced against it.apparently,by the time this action was commenced omne staffing and omne leasing were in bankruptcy,and they were not named as defendants.
infinet answer to the suburban complaint included a general denial of all allegations of the complaint.infinet also raised numerous affirmative defenses,including that the client companies had failed to mitigate their damages by adequately pursuing worker compensation insurance coverage which,on information and belief,was purchased for the benefit of the client companies workers 
the wendt complaint 
wendt also filed an action for misrepresentation,conversion,and breach of contract against infinet and other defendants.the second amended complaint contained similar allegations to those in the suburban complaint.wendt alleged there was a business relationship between infinet and omne staffing regarding obtaining worker compensation insurance for workers assigned to wendt by omne staffing.infinet represented to wendt worker compensation insurance for its leased workers would be obtained by and through its business relationship with omne staffing wendt and infinet entered into a contract concerning omne staffing provision of leased workers to wendt,and infinet had breached the agreement by failing to procure worker compensation insurance.an insurance producer,first union,issued certificates of insurance to wendt indicating there was coverage for its leased workers,and wendt paid premiums to omne staffing.but the policy that had been obtained did not cover wendt leased workers.
infinet in the suburban and the wendt actions 
in both the suburban action and the wendt action,infinet filed virtually identical against the client companies and amico,for declaratory relief and,as to amico,for breach of duty to defend and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.infinet alleged the worker compensation policy issued by amico to omne staffing covered the employees leased to the client companies and the client companies had failed to compel amico to honor its obligations under the policy 
in both,infinet specifically described itself as an independent provider of marketing services for professional employer organizations,putting small to companies together with companies like omne staffing.omne staffing would then act as the general employer for the client companies workers,providing necessary administrative services and obtaining worker compensation insurance.infinet alleged it was only the matchmaker between omne staffing,as general employer,and the client companies,which became special employers.infinet alleged the amico policy covered all persons who worked for omne staffing,and by law it covered the client companies leased workers.infinet denied that it is a general employer of any kind 
infinet alleged the client companies injured workers filed worker compensation claims,which the client companies tendered to amico.but amico denied defense or indemnity coverage to the client companies.when the client companies then filed this action against infinet,infinet tendered its own defense to amico under the policy.amico denied infinet a defense or indemnity because infinet was not an insured under the policy.
infinet sought a declaration as to the client companies and its own rights under the amico policy.it also alleged causes of action against amico for breach of the insurance contract,breach of the duty to defend,and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained in the insurance policy.
amico motions for summary judgment 
amico filed virtually identical motions for summary judgment in both cases arguing there was no triable issue of fact as to whether infinet was an insured under the policy.the face of the policy was unambiguous the only named insured was omne staffing,and there was nothing on the face of the policy,or any other evidence,that infinet was an express or intended beneficiary of the policy.amico undisputed facts included that amico issued the policy to omne staffing,and listed only omne staffing as a named insured.omne staffing and omne leasing were separate corporations,and amico denied coverage to infinet because it was not an insured under the policy.
in its opposition,infinet did not dispute the contents of the policy,or that omne staffing was the only named insured on the policy.infinet contended section,subdivision d,as a matter of law,made it a third party beneficiary of the amico policy because it was alleged to be a employer of omne staffing leased employees.in its separate statement,infinet presented petitions filed by amico in three unrelated worker compensation proceedings,not involving workers of suburban,martin,or wendt,to join infinet as a party defendant because infinet was possibly also an employer of the injured workers involved in those proceedings.
ruling in the suburban action 
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in the suburban action.it found amico had demonstrated infinet was not a named insured on the policy.furthermore,infinet did not demonstrate it was an employer within the meaning of section,subdivision d,and the petitions filed by amico in the three worker compensation proceedings did not constitute evidence infinet was such an employer.the court noted infinet does not argue that it is actually a,and to the contrary,had specifically alleged in its omne staffing was the general employer and it had merely acted as the matchmaker between omne staffing and the client company leasing employees from omne staffing.
ruling in the wendt action 
a different trial court denied amico motion for summary judgment in the wendt action.as in the suburban action,the trial court found amico had met its initial burden to show infinet was not entitled to coverage under its policy by showing infinet was not a named insured,shifting the burden to infinet to demonstrate coverage.but,the court agreed that under section,subdivision d,all of omne staffing leased employees were third party beneficiaries of the amico policy.the court concluded that although infinet denie d it is an employer,the fact that amico filed a petition in the workers compensation case seeking a finding that infinet is an employer,created a triable issue of fact as to whether infinet in fact was a 
the appeal and the writ 
infinet appealed from the judgment in the suburban case.amico filed a petition for writ of mandate in the wendt case.in the writ proceeding,we issued an order to show cause and stayed the trial court proceedings on infinet in the wendt case,but left the trial court with discretion to sever infinet from wendt complaint.we subsequently ordered the two appellate proceedings consolidated.
discussion 
the issues presented in the appeal and the writ are the same.infinet alleged amico breached the policy duty to defend and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to defend and indemnify infinet on the underlying suburban and wendt complaints and in various worker compensation proceedings.amico contends there was no potential for coverage for infinet,and it is entitled to summary judgment in both actions,because infinet was not a named insured on the policy and infinet failed to establish it is an intended third party beneficiary of the policy.
on appeal,we independently review summary judgment rulings.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a defendant moving for summary judgment bears the burden of demonstrating that one of the elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense code civ,subd.p see also aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.once sufficient evidence is produced to meet this burden,the onus shifts to the plaintiff to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that a triable issue of material fact exists.ibid.
no duty to defend or indemnify 
it is well established a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d,italics added.but where there is no potential for coverage,there is no duty to defend.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d.
the duty to defend is contractual in nature.alex robertson imperial casualty indemnity th,d.furthermore,expectations of coverage must be reasonable in light of the plain language of the policy.citation.ibid.the policy in this case covers worker compensation claims against the insured,defined as an employer named in item of the information page of the policy,which in turn identifies only omne staffing as an insured.there is no other language in the policy identifying any additional insureds.thus,both trial courts properly concluded amico had met its initial burden to establish there was no coverage for infinet under the policy because it was not a named insured.the burden then shifted to infinet to demonstrate the policy was expressly intended for its benefit,a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him.
for infinet to qualify as a third party beneficiary of the policy,it must show the policy was procured expressly for its benefit,or that it is a member of the class of persons for whose benefit it was procured.diamond woodworks,supra,th at,d.it can not enforce the contract just because it would receive some benefit from its performance.ibid.
infinet seeks to establish coverage by invoking section,subdivision d.it argues pursuant to that section,as a matter of law,it is in the class of person for whose benefit the insurance contract between omne staffing and amico was made.we disagree.
section embodies the worker compensation exclusive remedy rule.every employer must secure worker compensation insurance,and worker compensation is the exclusive remedy for an injured worker against his or her employer.one exception to the exclusive remedy rule is when the employer fails to secure payment of worker compensation.
section,subdivision d,provides an employer may secure the payment of compensation on employees provided to it by agreement by another employer by entering into a valid and enforceable agreement with that other employer under which the other employer agrees to obtain,and has,in fact,obtained workers compensation coverage for those employees.in those cases,both employers shall be considered to have secured the payment of compensation within the meaning of this section and s ections and if there is a valid and enforceable agreement between the employers to obtain that coverage,and that coverage has been in fact obtained employers who have complied with this subdivision shall not be subject to civil,criminal,or other penalties for failure to provide workers compensation coverage or tort liability in the event of employee injury,but may,in the absence of compliance,be subject to all three.
infinet argument is premised on its claim it is,or might be,a employer of the injured workers.it argues that under section,subdivision d,if an employee has more than one employer,if any one of those employers has worker compensation insurance,then all employers,special or general,are deemed third party beneficiaries of the policy.that is not what the statute says.
subdivision d was added to section in ab,in direct response to the douglas oil case.douglas oil company of california western asphalt service,th,d,review granted june,review dismissed.in that case,an injured worker was employed by a general employer the employee leasing company,and a special employer the client company.pursuant to its agreement with the special employer,the general employer obtained worker compensation insurance which provided benefits for the injured employee.nonetheless,the injured worker brought a civil tort action against the special employer.douglas oil held to comply with section,both the general employer the employee leasing company and the special employer the client company had to purchase a worker compensation policy.because the client company had not obtained its own policy,it was not protected by the exclusive remedy rule.
section,subdivision d,was enacted to allow general and special employers to come to an agreement to ensure that the workers are fully covered by workers compensation insurance but not to burden both employers with redundant premium payments.assem.com.on insurance,on assem.bill reg.sess.may,see also com.on industrial relations,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.july,purpose of section,subd.
