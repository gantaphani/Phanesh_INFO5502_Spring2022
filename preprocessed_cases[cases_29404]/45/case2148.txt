in this declaratory judgment action,plaintiffs mark andrew tobin,helen hunter,and craig mackay the plaintiffs leased vehicles from ford motor company or a ford subsidiary collectively ford and now seek to recover under an insurance policy that defendant michigan mutual insurance company michigan mutual issued to ford.because ford and michigan mutual,as the contracting parties,agreed that the policy was not intended to cover retail lessees of ford,the district court reformed the policy between ford and michigan mutual to exclude medical payment and uninsured motorist coverage to retail lessees,including the plaintiffs.after review of plaintiffs appeal,we certify questions to the florida supreme court.
factual background 
plaintiffs leases with ford 
this consolidated appeal arises out of three separate automobile accidents involving vehicles leased from ford.mark tobin,while driving a vehicle that he leased from ford,was injured in an accident with an uninsured driver.helen hunter was similarly injured in an accident with an uninsured driver while driving a vehicle that she had leased from ford.ana and jonathan mackay were killed in an accident with an uninsured driver while the mackays were traveling in a vehicle leased from ford.
the red carpet lease agreements hunter and the mackays entered into with ford provide that lessor is not providing vehicle insurance or liability insurance and require that the lessee must insure the vehicle during this lease.similarly,the lease agreement for tobin vehicle states that t he lessee must insure the vehicle for the term of the lease.
michigan mutual policy 
ford entered into a separate insurance agreement with michigan mutual the policy,which contains three sections.the commercial general liability section provides coverage for ford premises and operations activities.the business auto section provides coverage for a group of vehicles used by ford for business purposes.the personal auto section is designed to provide coverage to a group of vehicles assigned to ford management personnel under the lease evaluation program.the lease agreement signed by the ford personnel in the lease evaluation program,unlike the retail lease agreements signed by the plaintiffs here,specifically states that the company ford provides insurance on the vehicle during the term of the lease.ford employees who participate in the lease evaluation program also receive a certificate of insurance and an identification card that indicates their coverage under the michigan mutual policy.
this consolidated appeal involves only the personal auto section of the michigan mutual policy and specifically what is entitled the personal auto policy supplement auto supplement to the policy.we outline the key provisions of the auto supplement.the first page of the auto supplement is a declarations sheet that lists the named insured.specifically,item of the declarations sheet lists the named insured as ford motor company,its subsidiaries,and any person to whom an automobile has been assigned,leased or loaned.emphasis added.
item on that same declarations sheet describes the vehicles insured as follows description of auto see endorsement fo rd.in turn,endorsement fo rd defines your covered auto as vehicles with one of these three tag designations vehicles vehicles and vehicles.these three tag designations are used by ford to specify vehicles assigned,leased,or loaned to ford employees and retirees for business or personal use.none of these tag designations is used for vehicles leased to retail customers,such as the plaintiff lessees.
further,the auto supplement provides primary coverage to the insured for liability,for medical payments,and for uninsured motorist coverage.insured in the medical payment section of the auto supplement is defined as 
you or any family member 
a.while occupying a motor vehicle 
any other person while occupying your covered auto.
insured in the uninsured motorist section of the auto supplement is defined similarly to the medical payment section as 
you or any family member.
any other person occupying your covered auto.
in addition to primary coverage,the auto supplement contains the following language,providing contingent loss and excess auto liability coverage to the named insured and excluding such excess liability coverage to lessees as follows 
this policy,however,shall provide contingent loss and excess auto liability coverages for autos included in the following programs 
red carpet lease 
but only as respects the liability of the named insured.no coverage is provided to lessees,agents,or permissive users 
although reciting what we believe to be certain provisions at issue in this appeal,we point out that the michigan mutual policy,including the entire auto supplement,is in the record 
ii.procedural background 
summary judgment motions 
tobin,hunter,and the personal representative of the mackays estate filed suits against michigan mutual seeking motorist coverage under the auto supplement to the michigan mutual policy issued to ford it is the plaintiffs position that this auto supplement is broad enough to cover them as well,and in fact must cover them under florida law.
in ruling on certain summary judgment motions,the district court concluded that florida law governs the interpretation of the policy.the court further acknowledged that a florida intermediate appellate decision in perez michigan mutual ins,so d,held that a retail lessee of ford was covered by the same michigan mutual policy at issue here.
the florida court in perez emphasized that item of the auto supplement lists the named insured as ford motor company,its subsidiaries and any person to whom an automobile has been assigned,leased or loaned.emphasis added.from this language,the perez court concluded that retail lessees were insureds and thus entitled to coverage as persons to whom the automobile was leased 
the federal district court,however,disagreed with the perez decision for several reasons.first,the district court noted that item following item on the same declarations sheet entitled description of auto,in effect limits the coverage to certain vehicles and expressly directs the reader to see endorsement number fo rd.in turn,endorsement number fo rd to the auto supplement defines your covered auto under that supplement as only autos with certain tag designations,as follows 
any auto which has been designated with the following tag letters 
l leased vehicles 
e executive vehicles 
s sales vehicles 
it is undisputed that these tag numbers l,e,and s are issued to ford employees or retirees who lease vehicles and that none of plaintiffs vehicles has these tag numbers because plaintiffs vehicles are in the red carpet lease program,a retail lease program.secondly,the district court noted that the contingent liability provision specifically stated that no coverage is provided to lessees under the red carpet lease program,as follows 
this policy,however,shall provide contingent loss and excess auto liability coverages for autos included in the following programs 
red carpet lease 
but only as respects the liability of the named insured.
no coverage is provided to lessees,agents,or permissive users.
thirdly,the district court examined two unpublished state court decisions that concluded that ford retail lessees were not covered under this same michigan mutual policy.negron michigan mut.ins,cv.july,massachusetts bay ins.amerisure.the negron court noted that,while a superficial reading of only the personal auto policy supplement might include the plaintiffs in the category of named insured,the endorsements and more specific language of the policy make it clear that the plaintiffs and their vehicle are not insured under the michigan mutual policy.negron,at.the district court concluded that the negron and massachusetts bay decisions read the policy as a whole and were far better reasoned than perez.
although disagreeing with perez,the district court then acknowledged that a federal court applying state law is bound to adhere to decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state highest court would deci
