this suit filed under alleges that the state of michigan has failed to provide services required by the medicaid program.plaintiffs,westside mothers,other advocacy and professional organizations,and eight named individuals allege that defendants james haveman,director of the michigan department of community health,and robert smedes,deputy director of the michigan medical services administration,did not provide the early and periodic screening,diagnosis,and treatment services mandated by the medicaid act and related laws.
the medicaid program,created in when congress added title xix to the social security act,provides a federal subsidy to states that choose to reimburse poor individuals for certain medical care.see et.supp medicaid act harris mcrae,d.although participation in the program is voluntary,participating states must comply with certain requirements imposed by the act and regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services.wilder virginia hosp,d.like all other states,michigan participates in the medicaid program.since,operating under a waiver from the health care finance administration,michigan has provided eligible residents medicaid services by requiring them to enroll in health maintenance organizations,which provide medical care in exchange for a flat monthly fee per participant.at.
the medicaid act and related regulations set out a detailed list of services every state program must provide.see et et.the act allows the secretary of health and human services to limit or end payments to a state whose medicaid program does not provide these services.see.
at issue here is the federal requirement that participating states provide early and periodic screening,diagnostic,and treatment services for individuals who are eligible under the plan and are under the age of.id.a b see also id.r defining such services same.the required services include periodic physical examinations,immunizations,laboratory tests,health education,see r,eye examinations,eyeglasses,see id.r,teeth maintenance,see id.r,diagnosis and treatment of hearing disorders,and hearing aids,see id.r.
in,plaintiffs sued the named defendants under,which creates a cause of action against any person who under color of state law deprives an individual of any right,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.they alleged that the defendants had refused or failed to implement the medicaid act,its enabling regulations and its policy requirements,by refusing to provide,and not requiring participating hmos to provide,the comprehensive examinations required by a and r and not requiring participating hmos to provide the necessary health care,diagnostic services,and treatment required by r not effectively informing plaintiffs of the existence of the screening and treatment services,as required by a failing to provide plaintiffs the transportation and scheduling help needed to take advantage of the screening and treatment services,as required by a b and and developing a medicaid program which lacks the capacity to deliver to eligible children the care required by a,a a,and b.
defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs and for dismissal of the suit.in,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss as plaintiffs four organizations it dismissed the michigan league for human services and the michigan welfare rights organization on the grounds that they lacked constitutional standing,and it dismissed the michigan chapters of the american academy of pediatrics and of the american academy of pediatric dentists on the grounds that they lacked prudential standing.it allowed the remaining organizations and individuals to continue as plaintiffs.
in march the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss all remaining claims.see westside mothers haveman,d.in a detailed and opinion,the district court held that medicaid was only a contract between a state and the federal government,that programs such as medicaid were not supreme law of the land,that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case because michigan was the real defendant and therefore possess ed sovereign immunity against suit,that in this case ex parte young was unavailable to circumvent the state sovereign immunity,and that even if it were available does not create a cause of action available to plaintiffs to enforce the provisions in question.
this appeal followed.we reverse on all issues presented.
medicaid contracts and the spending power 
much of the district court decision rests on its initial determinations that the medicaid program is only a contract between the state and federal government and that laws passed by congress pursuant to its power under the spending clause are not supreme law of the land.we address these in turn.
whether medicaid is only a district court held that the medicaid program is a contract between michigan and the federal government.westside mothers,d at.the program,it points out,is not mandatory states choose whether to participate.see empowering the secretary to pay funds to states that submit medicaid plans.if a state does choose to participate,congress may then condition receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with federal statutory and administrative directives.westside mothers,d at quoting south dakota dole,d.
to characterize precisely the legal relationship formed between a state and the federal government when such a program is implemented,the district court turned to two supreme court opinions on related subjects.in pennhurst state school and hosp.halderman pennhurst i,the court described the medicaid program as much in the nature of a contract,and spoke of the contract formed between the state and the federal government,d quotation marks in original.the relevant passage reads in full 
unlike legislation enacted under of the fourteenth amendment,however,legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract in return for federal funds,the states agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.the legitimacy of congress power to legislate under the spending power thus rests on whether the state voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of this contract.
pennhurst i at.emphasis added.
justice scalia expanded on this contract analogy in his concurrence in blessing freestone.he maintained that the relationship was in the nature of a contract because 
the state promises to provide certain services to private individuals,in exchange for which the federal government promises to give the state funds.in contract law,when such an arrangement is made a promises to pay b money,in exchange for which b promises to provide services to c,the person who receives the benefit of the exchange of promises between two others c is called a beneficiary.
d scalia,concurring.
drawing on above language,the district judge then concluded that the medicaid program is a contract between michigan and the federal government,westside mothers,d at,further describing it as a contract between sovereigns,and the medicaid contract,id.at.the only significant difference between medicaid and an ordinary contract,he asserted,is the sovereign status of the parties,which limits the available remedies each can seek against the other.id.
contrary to this narrow characterization,the court in pennhurst i makes clear that it is using the term contract metaphorically,to illuminate certain aspects of the relationship formed between a state and the federal government in a program such as medicaid.it does not say that medicaid is only a contract.it describes the program as much in the nature of a contract,and places the term contract in quotation marks when using it alone,at.it did not limit the remedies to common law contract remedies or suggested that normal federal question doctrines do not apply.justice scalia concurrence in blessing does not alter this.
binding precedent has put the issue to rest.the supreme court has held that the conditions imposed by the federal government pursuant to statute upon states participating in medicaid and similar programs are not merely contract provisions they are federal laws.in bennett kentucky department of education,kentucky argued that a grant agreement should be viewed in the same manner as a bilateral contract,d.the court rejected this approach,holding that,u nlike normal contractual undertakings,federal grant programs originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of congress concerning desirable public policy.see also boatman hammons,cir states must follow federal law in managing the medicaid program.the fact that these provisions have the binding force of law means that medicaid and similar federal grant programs are not subject merely to doctrines of contract interpretation.
whether acts passed under the spending power are supreme law of the holding that medicaid is only a contract to pay money enacted under the spending power,the district court then held that programs enacted pursuant to the constitution spending power are not the supreme law of the land and do not give rise to remedies invoked for the violation of federal statutes.see westside mothers,d at relying on its determination that medicaid and similar programs are contracts consensually entered into by the states with the federal government,the district court then reasons that they are not statutory enactments by which states must automatically submit to federal prerogatives,d at.there are two ways to understand this passage.one is that the district court is merely following the logic of its previous finding,and holding that programs are not supreme law because they are only contracts.we have already rejected the line of reasoning that begins with the assumption that medicaid is only a contract.
the district court may also be claiming that acts passed under the spending power are not supreme law because the spending power only gives congress the power to set up these programs,not to force states to participate in them.see id.at.a state can decline to participate in medicaid.see id.at.because congressional enactments pursuant to the spending power that set forth the terms of cooperative agreements depend on the voluntary agreement of participating states,the district court concludes,they are not within the ambit of the supremacy clause and so are not the supreme law of the land.id.it erroneously states that its conclusion is dictated by the supreme court holdings in alden,printz,new york,south dakota,and pennhurst id.alden maine holds that sovereign immunity prevents the federal government from forcing unconsenting states to submit to suit in their own courts.see,d.both printz united states,d,and new york united states,d,hold that congress violates the tenth amendment if it compels a state to enact legislation or implement a specific regulatory scheme.south dakota upholds the power of congress to place conditions on a state receipt of federal funds.at.pennhurst i holds that if congress wishes to impose obligations on states that choose to participate in volitional spending power programs,it must make the obligations explicit.at.
in townsend swank,we do find language by chief justice burger in a concurrence to a unanimous opinion that laws passed under the spending power are in no way mandatory on the states,d burger,concurring in the result.the chief justice appeared merely to be noting that the supremacy clause does not compel states to participate in programs enacted under the spending power.see quern mandley,d citing burger concurrence to support the proposition that while federal eligibility standards are mandatory on states that adopt a program enacted under the spending clause,the law in no way obligates a state to continue that program.this concurrence does not establish that spending power enactments are not supreme law of the land.see massachusetts bay trans,cir noting that individual justices have from time to time suggested that the authority for adhering to federal law when congress employs its spending power is not to be located in the supremacy clause.but these moments have been few and far between and have not debilitated the general conclusion that laws of a jurisdiction that receives federal funds must,when a relevant conflict looms,give way to federal law.
the district court acknowledges that the supreme court has in the past held that cooperative programs enacted under the spending power fall within the ambit of the supremacy clause.westside mothers,d at citing blum bacon,d,carleson remillard,d,townsend,d.it then states that in recent years the supreme court has conducted a more searching analysis of the nature and extent of the supremacy clause,suggesting erroneously that its departure from precedent is dictated by recent supreme court jurisprudence.id.the court has recently held that,when a state agency accepts federal funds appropriated under the spending clause,the supremacy clause requires conflicting local law to yield.see dalton little rock family planning,d stating that a provision of a state constitution is invalid if it conflicts with the medicaid act accord csx,easterwood,d lawrence county sch.dist,d.the principle that acts passed under congress spending power are supreme law has not been abandoned in recent decisions.
our court has followed these decisions.see,planned parenthood affiliates of engler,cir striking down a provision of michigan law as conflicting with the medicaid act.we have found no decision by any other federal circuit court of appeals to the contrary.we reaffirm precedent holding that laws validly passed by congress under its spending powers are supreme law of the land.
whether the suit is barred under sovereign immunity 
the district court next held that the plaintiffs suit is foreclosed by doctrines of sovereign immunity because michigan is the real party at interest in the suit and plaintiffs can not invoke any of the exceptions to sovereign immunity that would allow their suit.westside mothers,d at.
as explained by the supreme court in many cases,sovereign immunity,though partially codified in the eleventh amendment,is a basic feature of our federal system.see,seminole tribe of florida florida,d.there are exceptions.congress may abrogate a state immunity from suit under of the fourteenth amendment or a state may consent to suit.see college savings bank florida prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.none of the exceptions that allow an individual to sue a state directly are at issue here,however.though the record is not entirely clear,it appears that plaintiffs at first sued the named defendants under,and only when the district court expressed skepticism about this avenue of attack did they invoke ex parte young as an alternative mechanism to reach the defendants.see westside mothers,d at.because sovereign immunity limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts,we address it before turning to.
under the doctrine developed in ex parte young and its progeny,a suit that claims that a state official actions violate the constitution or federal law is not deemed a suit against the state,and so barred by sovereign immunity,so long as the state official is the named defendant and the relief sought is only equitable and prospective.see.see also,will michigan of state police,d.since ex parte young it has been settled that the eleventh amendment provides no shield for a state official confronted by a claim that he had deprived another of a federal right under the color of state law.hafer melo,d citation omitted.
of course,ex parte young is a fiction to the extent it sharply distinguishes between a state and an officer acting on behalf of the state,but it is a necessary fiction,required to maintain the balance of power between state and federal governments.the availability of prospective relief of the sort awarded in ex parte young gives life to the supremacy clause.coeur,at.quoting green mansour,d.when a court addresses a claim made under ex parte young it should simply ask whether a complainant alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective.id.at,concurring.on its surface this case fits squarely within ex parte young.plaintiffs allege an ongoing violation of federal law,the medicaid act,and seek prospective equitable relief,an in
