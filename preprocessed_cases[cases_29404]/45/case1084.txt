in this maritime shipping case,we consider whether the district court properly ruled that it lacked personal jurisdiction over viken lakers and viken ship management vsm.these two norwegian companies own and manage a fleet of cargo vessels.in,defendants entered a time charter agreement with fednav international a canadian company.the agreement chartered to fednav a fleet of vessels,including the inviken,for a period of several years to transport cargo on an basis.fednav subchartered the inviken to metallia llc a company to carry a specific cargo of steel coils from szczecin,poland to toledo,ohio.en route seawater entered the cargo hold of the inviken,causing severe rust damage to the coils.fortis corporate insurance,a belgian company,is a surrogate insurance underwriter of metallia.fortis paid to resolve metallia insurance claim.
on february,fortis sued defendants in the district court for the northern district of ohio,which district includes toledo,for damages allegedly caused by negligence and breach of bailment obligations in their answer,defendants maintained that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.however,the court allowed fortis to conduct discovery to demonstrate,if it could,that jurisdiction existed.
on october,defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the suit on the theory that the federal court in toledo lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants.on march,the district court granted this motion.see fortis corporate ins.inviken,et,wl.the court then granted fortis motion for voluntary dismissal of its amended complaint.on may,the district court entered an order of final judgment.on june,fortis filed its timely notice of appeal.
on appeal we review de novo the district court dismissal of the case for lack of personal jurisdiction,see southerland wofford,cir,and we reverse.
the undisputed evidence generates the following undisputed facts 
third party fednav,based in montreal,canada,is a steel commodity carrier in the great lakes region.according to a declaration by donald frost,a marine transportation consultant 
it is a matter of widespread general knowledge within the maritime chartering industry that fednav primary business is the carriage of international cargoes to and from the great lakes,including numerous united states ports,via the lawrence seaway.fednav is also known for calling especially at great lake ports that receive steel cargoes,such as the port of toledo,ohio.in fact,according to the fednav website,a link to which is contained on the website of defendant viken ship management,fednav international is the largest international user of the lawrence seaway system.the lawrence seaway is,of course,the only direct access to the great lakes by ship.
frost decl.ja.defendants did not offer any evidence in rebuttal.
b.the viken defendants 
undisputed facts confirm frost declaration defendants vessels called at ports including toledo frequently 
according to a listing of port calls,defendants vessels called at ports times between january and march,or nearly three times a month.of these calls were at great lake ports,and of these calls were at ohio.see frost decl.ja see also ja listing of all port calls for viken laker vessels,january.
during this same period,the laker vessels spent a total of days at ohio ports.see frost decl.ja.the charter agreement provides that the rate to charter a vessel is per day minimum.see ja charter agreement.as a result,defendants earned a total of at least for the number of days spent in ohio ports during this period.
similarly,defendants vessels spent days in ports.at a rate of at least per day,defendants earned at least for time spent in ports.see frost decl.ja.
the vsm website,in describing its contingency plans for any environmental disasters,states that it makes f requent calls to the usa and canada,including the great lakes.
c.the charter agreement 
the charter agreement between the viken defendants and fednav could fairly be characterized as anticipating issues and problems that would arise during the time of the simply for the shipment at issue in this case.
the agreement contains several references to the united states and toledo specifically,including the following description of the inviken 
the v essel is fully equipped with the necessary gear and equipment required for transitting lawrence seaway,the welland canal and great lakes.ja.the welland canal runs between lake ontario and lake erie.
when the vessel trades within the waters of the great lakes,her fresh water,stores,lubricating oil and constant not to exceed metric tons,and master to endeavour to reduce fresh water whilst trading in the great lakes.id.
owners confirm that the vessel is suitable for toledo.id.
fednav,as the charterers,had the option to crop and replace mast in order to safely trade to toledo.id.at.
in addition 
the charter agreement contains three other references to the great lakes region.see id.at.
fednav is located in montreal.the charter agreement only specifies two ports one in montreal,and the other in toledo.
critically,employees of the defendants concede that the vessels were rigged in order to travel to the great lakes 
ii.specific jurisdiction 
the question of personal jurisdiction in this case is guided by.k,which provides 
if the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states,serving a summons is also effective,with respect to the claims arising under federal law,to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.
to establish personal jurisdiction,a plaintiff must show that the defendant had minimum contacts with the forum state such that defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there,and the exercise of jurisdiction comport s with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.the constitutional touchstone of personal jurisdiction remains whether the defendant purposefully established minimum contacts in the forum state.in the sixth circuit,the emphasis in the purposeful availment inquiry is whether the defendant has engaged in some overt actions connecting the defendant with the forum state.
the minimum contacts prong is satisfied either through specific or general jurisdiction.specific jurisdiction subjects the defendant to suit in the forum state only on claims that arise out of or relate to a defendant contacts with the forum.general jurisdiction is established when a defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with the forum state sufficient to justify the state exercise of judicial power with respect to any and all claims.because specific personal jurisdiction exists in this case based on defendants contacts with ohio,we do not address the requirements for general jurisdiction and the national contacts test.
purposeful availment 
the supreme court in asahi metal indus.superior court of,d analyzed the purposeful availment test in detail.asahi was a japanese company that manufactured tire valves,which it sold to a taiwanese manufacturer of tire tubes.plaintiff was injured when the tire of his motorcycle equipped with an asahi valve burst.he sued asahi in california.the court ruled that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over asahi,although no opinion commanded the support of a majority of the court.
justice plurality opinion held that the placement of a product into the stream of commerce,without more,is not an act of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.additional conduct of the defendant may indicate an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum state,for example,designing the product for the market in the forum state id.at.this formulation came to be known as stream of commerce plus.in concluding that the district court lacked jurisdiction,the plurality opinion concluded that there was no evidence that asahi designed its product in anticipation of sales in california.id.at.citation omitted.
as an example of purposeful design that presumably would meet the stream of commerce plus test,justice opinion cited rockwell int l costruzioni aeronautiche giovanni agusta.see asahi,at.in that case,an augusta helicopter crashed over the ohio river.after plaintiff filed suit,the trial court considered whether it had personal jurisdiction over snfa,a french manufacturer of ball bearings.these ball bearings were exclusively for the helicopter,which was manufactured by augusta,an italian company.snfa knew that augusta marketed its helicopters to the executive corporate transport market in the united states and europe.the district court found specific jurisdiction over snfa,because snfa designed the ball bearings exclusively for the helicopters,knowing that these helicopters would be sold in the united states and other countries.id.at.
finally,in support of its position,the asahi plurality explained that application of the purposeful availment test is appropriate because a corporation then has 
clear notice that it is subject to suit there,and can act to alleviate the risk of burdensome litigation by procuring insurance,passing the expected costs on to customers,or,if the risks are too great,severing its connection with the state.hence if the sale of a product is not simply an isolated occurrence,but arises from the efforts of the manufacturer or distributor to serve,directly or indirectly,the market for its product in other states,it is not unreasonable to subject it to suit in one of those states

the district court opinion 
applying the asahi formulation,the district court acknowledged that defendants rigged their vessels to sail into the great lakes and call at toledo port.however,the court concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants because the charterer was canadian.as explained below,the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling on this basis.
in its holding,the district court offered the following analysis 
plaintiff points to several provisions of the time charter specifying that the ship is suitable for toledo port.designing a product specifically for a certain market suffices for an intent or purpose to serve the market in the forum state.asahi,at.fortis argues that this is exactly what viken lakers did when it promised the inviken would be suitable for the port of toledo.
this contention is mistaken.viken lakers derives their income from providing ships to,none of whom,it appears,are sic american.when viken made this promise,it served to insure the business of a canadian charter company,fednav.an intent to serve the needs of a canadian company is not an intent to serve the market of this forum.these clauses are,therefore,irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes.see carter lagloria shipping,wl at.july.
the district court thus erroneously injected a new requirement into the personal jurisdiction analysis.the relevant question is whether defendants purposefully availed themselves of the benefits of the forum state,ohio.defendants derived the same hence their contacts with the forum state are the of whether they were working with an american or a canadian company indeed,other shipping cases that have found personal jurisdiction over a foreign vessel owner have conspicuously failed to refer to whether the vessel operator was american or foreign.see united states pierre point shipping and inv.mitsubishi shoji kaisha ms galini.but see mutualidad seguros del institutuo nacional de industria luber,amc no jurisdiction over foreign vessel owner.moreover,in the context,we have repeatedly held,as have other courts,that a defendant interposition of an independent middleman between itself and the forum does not by itself place the defendant outside of that forum reach.see tobin astra pharm,cir the defendant can not expect to rely solely on the use of an independent distributor to insulate it from suit.mott schelling,wl,at.lexis,at cir.may,the use of an independent distributor in and of itself,will not insulate a foreign corporation from suit.quoting poyner erma werke gmbh,cir see also,pennzoil prods.colelli,cir observing that jurisdiction may be appropriate although defendant does not come into direct contact with the forum state but does so through intermediaries renner lanard toys,cir it appears from asahi that the absence of direct sales or shipments into the forum is not dispositive.
from the foregoing,we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction because the charterer was not american.the district court did find,however,that defendants rigged its vessels to sail into the great lakes and toledo.in light of this finding,we here analyze the purposeful availment test in greater detail.
sixth circuit caselaw on purposeful availment 
the sixth circuit has adopted justice stream of commerce plus test from asahi.in bridgeport music,still n the water publ g,cir,we ma d e clear our preference for justice stream of commerce plus approach,for the reasons set forth in that opinion as explained below,the facts of this case meet the plus requirement under sixth circuit precedent.
the case of mott schelling,wl.lexis cir.may,is instructive.see also tobin astra pharm,cir favorably discussing mott.mott was injured in michigan while operating an industrial saw manufactured by schelling,an company.mott and members of his family sued,inter alia,schelling,which moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.in outlining the requirements of the purposeful availment test,the mott court held that even a single act can support jurisdiction as long as it creates the required relationship with the forum state.mott,wl,at.lexis,at citing mcgee int l life ins,d.
schelling argued that it was not subject to the specific jurisdiction of the michigan courts because it had no relevant contacts there.the offending saw was sold to schelling agent the proctor corporation in birmingham,alabama,at which point proctor obtained and schelling lost title to the saw.the court of appeals noted that schelling actively cultivated its american market.united states standards were taken into account in the design and manufacture of the saw at issue.id.wl,at.lexis,at emphasis added.schelling employees had come to the united states to market and sell these machines the court did not state that they marketed in michigan specifically.in addition,a schelling technician went to the plant in michigan to install the saw and demonstrate the procedure.
the appellate court concluded that specific personal jurisdiction existed over schelling in michigan.it held that schelling had to know that the saw was destined for michigan because it sent one of its technicians there.moreover,
schelling knew its saws were being sold in the united states.the company actively cultivated its market here,and benefited from numerous sales,including the one in this case,over many years.clearly schelling can not reasonably expect to sell a potentially dangerous product into the united states,exact its price,and then shirk any obligations that arise when its machine goes awry.due process does not require us to allow schelling to exploit this country vast,rich markets and at the same time avoid the jurisdiction of our courts.under any formulation of the test,the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over schelling.
id.wl,at.lexis,at.
the court ruling in mott is noteworthy because it found sufficient contacts with michigan based on sales to its distributor in alabama.schelling undoubtedly knew that its saw could end up in michigan through the stream of commerce.yet the only specific contact with michigan as opposed to the united states that would qualify as a plus factor in the asahi formulation is the technician installation of the saw in michigan and demonstration of the technique.
in this case,defendants outfitted and rigged their ships to sail into the great lakes.defendants confirmed in the charter agreement that the vessel is suitable for toledo.ja.defendants officers testified that the vessels were rigged to travel to the great lakes.they entered into a agreement with a charterer that made its money shipping into the great lakes.not counting travel time,they earned for the number o
