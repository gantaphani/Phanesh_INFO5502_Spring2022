petitioners are oregon public employees who are members of the state public employee retirement system pers.they appeal the district court summary judgment order that held that the title vii consent decree entered was not intended to permanently lock in the refund annuity rates for all pers members.after reviewing the language of the consent decree and the evidence of the parties intent in the context of the litigation as a whole,we conclude that the consent decree was not meant to create a perpetual floor on refund annuity benefits.accordingly,we affirm the district court.
background 
pers and refund annuities 
pers is a statutory retirement plan for state and local government employees in oregon.many retired pers members receive a monthly service retirement allowance composed of two parts a refund annuity and a life pension the amount of the refund annuity depends upon three variables life expectancy rates for persons in the retiree age group assumed interest rates and the size of the retiree account balance at the time of retirement.the first two variables,life expectancy and assumed interest rates,are actuarial equivalency factors aefs used to convert the third variable,the retiree account balance at the time of retirement,into the monthly refund annuity.see.
pers governing statutes mandate that the refund annuity be the actuarial equivalent of accumulated contributions,if any,by the member and interest thereon at the time of retirement.thus,to convert a sum of money to a refund annuity,the pers actuary multiplies that sum of accumulated contributions by the appropriate aef from an annuity table adopted by oregon public employee retirement board board,the governing authority for pers.for example,if a retiree had accumulated in contributions and earnings,and the appropriate aef for that retiree was per,the retiree would receive a monthly refund annuity payment of until death.
ii.henderson i and the consent decree 
in,four female pers members filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of oregon against the state of oregon and the board henderson i.the henderson i plaintiffs alleged that the board practice of using two sets of life expectancy tables,one for men and another for women,in calculating refund annuities for retired pers members constituted sex discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.the challenged practice resulted in lower monthly refund annuities for female pers members,who were actuarially shown to live longer than their male counterparts.
the district court issued an order holding that the use of life expectancy tables violated title vii,but staying any injunctive relief pending appeal.while the henderson i appeal was pending,the united states supreme court ruled in city of los angeles dep t of water and power manhart,d,that title vii prohibitions on discrimination applied to employee benefit plans.
following manhart,the parties agreed to a settlement.thus,the district court vacated its order and judgment and entered a consent decree on september.the consent decree provided 
the judgment of this court dated january,is set aside and this judgment is entered in lieu of it.
title vii of the civil rights act of prohibits the use of life expectancy tables in calculating refund annuity retirement allowances of employee members of the oregon public employee retirement system.
defendant public employee retirement system is permanently enjoined and restrained from the use of life expectancy tables in calculating refund annuity retirement allowance prospectively only for members retiring effective july,and thereafter,shall provide a monthly refund annuity retirement allowance to female members retiring after that date which is identical to the refund annuity retirement allowance males of the same age and amount received prior to that date.defendant shall have no obligation to recalculate refund annuity retirement allowances to female members already retired or retiring before july.
plaintiffs shall have and recover against defendants costs and counsel fees in the total amount of.
the henderson i consent decree remains in effect today.
iii.legislative reforms to pers 
the board has used life expectancy tables ever since the district court entered the consent decree.additionally,from through,despite changing life expectancy and interest rate assumptions,the board did not apply any updated aefs that would have decreased a pers member projected monthly refund annuity.
the use of outdated aefs,however,created unfunded liabilities for pers.as a result,in,oregon governor kulongski signed the pers reform and stabilization act of reform legislation.the reform legislation required that the board adopt updated actuarial equivalency tables every two years.accordingly,on june,the board adopted new annuity tables based on current aefs to calculate refund annuities for pers members retiring after july.
the reform legislation provided that its constitutionality could be challenged directly in the oregon supreme court.on march,the oregon supreme court decided strunk public employees retirement,or,or.strunk rejected several constitutional and contractual challenges to the reform legislation specifically,strunk rejected challenges to the requirement that the board adopt and use current aefs when calculating retirement benefits.id.at.strunk further determined that the board lacks the authority to use outdated aefs.id.at.
iv.henderson ii and iii 
on october,six pers members challenged the board use of updated life expectancy tables by filing a new action in the united states district court for the district of oregon henderson ii.in henderson ii,the pers members moved to reopen henderson i and to hold the board in civil contempt for violating the terms of the consent decree.they argued that the consent decree requires the board to provide all pers members,retiring thereafter,a refund annuity allowance based upon the actuarial life expectancy tables in effect for males on july.at oral argument on june,the district court issued a minute order denying both the motion to reopen and the motion for civil contempt the henderson ii plaintiffs appealed that minute order to this court.
on september,six pers members including two henderson ii plaintiffs filed another action in the united states district court for the district of oregon henderson iii.they sought to reopen henderson i and requested a different remedy,a declaration that the september,injunction requires the board to adopt and use refund annuity tables which grant benefits not less than those benefits which were in effect for male members of pers on july.on october,the district court issued a minute order denying the motion to reopen and denying as moot the motion for declaratory judgment.the henderson iii plaintiffs also appealed that minute order to this court.
henderson ii and iii were consolidated on appeal.on october,we issued a disposition addressing the issues raised in henderson ii and henderson iii.henderson oregon,cir unpublished memorandum disposition we held that the district court had not abused its discretion when it denied the motion for civil contempt filed in henderson ii because viewing the language in the henderson consent decree in favor of the board the consent decree is not sufficiently specific to give notice to the board that it would violate the consent decree by updating the actuarial tables.id.at.we further held that the motions to reopen were properly denied because the motions were not needed to invoke the district court continuing jurisdiction over the henderson i consent decree.id.at.
however,we also held that the district court had improperly denied as moot the motion for declaratory judgment filed in henderson iii because the district court had never actually interpreted the language of the consent decree.id.at.accordingly,the panel remanded the henderson litigation to the district court for a ruling on the meaning of the consent decree.
current appeal 
on remand,the parties filed for summary judgment regarding the correct interpretation of the consent decree.on april,the district court issued an order denying the
