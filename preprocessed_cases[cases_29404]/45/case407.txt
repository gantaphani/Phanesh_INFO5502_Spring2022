because health care fraud drains billions of dollars from public and private payers annually,congress has since sought a tool to combat this problem.see comm.on gov t reform and oversight,health care fraud all public and private payers need federal criminal protections.in congress enacted the latest in a series of health care fraud statutes making any fraud perpetrated against a public or private payer a federal criminal offense.see health insurance portability and accountability act of,a,stat.defendants convictions before us on this appeal were for violations of that statute.their challenge to the statute application to frauds they committed against private payers arises from staged automobile accidents and feigned injuries for which medical providers reimbursed them,and raises issues of first impression.case law interpreting the federal health care fraud statute is,so far as we can discover,virtually.
yves baptiste and policia baptiste unrelated and guerline dormetis defendants or appellants appeal from judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,entered on april,april,and july,respectively,convicting a jury health care fraud in violation of.defendants were sentenced as follows yves baptiste,to days incarceration,which he has served,three years of supervised release,restitution in the amount of and a special assessment of policia baptiste,to five months incarceration,which she has served,three years of supervised release,restitution in the amount of and a special assessment of and guerline dormetis,to months incarceration,which she is presently serving,three years of supervised release,restitution in the amount of and a special assessment of.
defendants challenge their convictions and sentences on a variety of grounds.this opinion considers whether the federal health care fraud statute applies to the conduct of defendants,who participated as passengers in staged automobile accidents designed to exploit new york automobile insurance regime whether the district court fulfilled its statutory duty to inquire into defendant yves baptiste economic circumstances when imposing restitution and whether in dormetis case the district court improperly a calculated the amount of loss attributable to her in determining her base offense level,and b enhanced her base offense level for risk of serious bodily injury.defendants remaining claims are considered and rejected in a summary order filed concurrently with this opinion.
background 
all three defendants participated in staged automobile accidents and fabricated personal injury claims to take advantage of the operation of the new york comprehensive motor vehicle insurance reparations act,see ins.law et.mckinney formerly ins.law et,more commonly known as the new york act.see generally montgomery daniels,providing a comprehensive description of the act and declaring its constitutionality.
the new york act provides compensation for victims of automobile accidents without regard to fault.central to the law is the requirement that every owner of a motor vehicle maintain a liability insurance policy that provides the owner,members of the owner household,operators and occupants of the vehicle and pedestrians with compensation for basic economic loss resulting from injuries occasioned by the use or operation of that vehicle in new york state,regardless of fault.ins.law.basic economic loss is defined under the statute to include costs for medical treatment,lost earnings,and other reasonable expenses not to exceed per day.each person involved in an automobile accident is entitled to reimbursement of up to for basic economic loss.id.a.under the law an injured person may assign his or her right to payment for medical expenses to a medical care provider.if an injured person sustains a serious bodily injury,as defined by the statute,that person may also initiate a civil suit for loss,that is,pain and suffering,against the owner of either car involved in the accident.id.
the government proved at trial that defendants were recruited to participate in the charged health care fraud by binsonn guillaume,jackson clerveaux and frantz mevs.the trial in this case was one of six trials arising from related indictments charging numerous individuals with participating in an overarching scheme of health care fraud based on a series of deliberately staged automobile accidents in several boroughs of new york city.this is the first appeal from these trials to reach this court.guillaume and both testified for the government in the instant mevs recruited and paid individuals to drive or ride as passengers in vehicles that were deliberately crashed into other vehicles.following the accidents,the recruited passengers were referred,in exchange for a fee,to various medical clinics in new york city.the recruited passengers assigned their insurance benefits to the health care clinics medical providers,which billed the insurance companies directly.the recruited passengers subsequently advanced their own civil causes of action for their feigned injuries.to receive reimbursements,the health care clinics generated fictitious treatment records for the passengers in the accidents.the accident participants used these fictitious medical records to support their claims of personal injury and to obtain settlements from insurance companies.
each of the present defendants participated in this health care fraud by riding as a passenger in a vehicle that was intentionally crashed into another vehicle.they were involved in separate accidents on different dates.no one was hurt in any of these collisions,but each defendant sought medical benefits for injuries.the medical providers received payment from insurance companies for imaginary medical expenses allegedly incurred on defendants behalf,under the law,as follows for yves baptiste,for policia baptiste,and for guerline dormetis.in addition to these payments to medical providers,each defendant retained a lawyer and sought damages in a civil suit for feigned personal injuries.each defendant obtained a settlement from an insurance company,as follows yves baptiste,policia baptiste,and guerline dormetis.all three defendants were thereafter charged with and convicted of a separate count of health care fraud arising from his or her participation in an arranged accident.they appeal their convictions and sentences.we affirm.
discussion 
i the health care fraud statute 
on appeal the defendants contest the application of the health care fraud statute,to their conduct.they challenge the scope and applicability of the statute on somewhat different bases,although their arguments are simply variations on the same theme.yves baptiste,whose arguments we now consider,contends the statute applies only to health care professionals,and that the new york state automobile insurance program is not a health care benefit program within the meaning of the statute.policia baptiste and dormetis challenges to the statute on related grounds are addressed in our accompanying summary order.
analysis begins with a review of the two relevant statutory provisions in question,and b.section,that defines the offense of which defendants were convicted,states 
whoever knowingly and willfully executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain,by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,representations,or promises,any of the money or property owned by,or under the custody or control of,any health care benefit program,in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
section b sets out the relevant definition of a health care benefit program.it provides 
as used in this title,the term health care benefit program means any public or private plan or contract,affecting commerce,under which any medical benefit,item,or service is provided to any individual,and includes any individual or entity who is providing a medical benefit,item,or service for which payment may be made under the plan or contract.
with the foregoing definitions in mind,we turn to yves baptiste assertion that the statute applies only to health care professionals and that the new york state automobile insurance program is not a health care benefit program within the meaning of the statute.these arguments raise questions of first impression and involve statutory construction and questions of law that we review de novo.see united states alfonso,cir.
it is axiomatic that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute,and that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative purpose.park n fly dollar park and fly,d.where the text of a statute is unambiguous,judicial inquiry ends,except in rare and exceptional circumstances,and legislative history is instructive only upon the most extraordinary showing of contrary intentions.garcia united states,d.
yves baptiste points to no legal authority in support of his construction of the statute,and the basic principles of statutory construction identified render his position untenable.we can not adopt his view that the statute applies only to health care professionals because such construction is obviously at odds with the language of,which directs that w hoever knowingly and willfully executes,or attempts to execute,a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both emphasis added.the common meaning of the word whoever is whatever person,any person at all,no matter who.webster third new international dictionary.
congress use of this word does not support baptiste suggestion that the legislature aimed for the health care fraud statute to apply only to medical professionals.rather,we read the statute to mean that any that person is a medical professional,a patient,or purposefully endeavors to defraud a health care benefit program may be found guilty of health care fraud,if his or her conduct otherwise conforms to the elements of the offense.the broad language of shows that congress intended for this statute to include within its scope a wide range of conduct so that all forms of health care fraud would be proscribed,regardless of the kind of specific schemes unscrupulous persons may concoct.
beyond the unambiguous language of the statute,our conclusion that the defendants participation in staged automobile accidents was encompassed and proscribed by is further supported by the legislative history of the statute.although resort to legislative history is unnecessary in this case precisely because of the statute unambiguous language,see garcia,at,we note for the sake of completeness that considering the health care fraud information before it characterizing staged automobile accidents and attendant fraudulent injury claims as health care fraud.specifically,house report identifies an fbi initiative targeting staged automobile accidents and related casualty and health insurance fraud in a list of o ther examples of health care fraud cases.see,at.obviously,the kind of conduct underlying the convictions we consider in this appeal was envisioned by congress when it enacted.
baptiste endeavors to bolster his argument that the fraud statute should not apply to him by pointing out that the benefits were paid not to him but to the medical providers and by noting that the passengers in the staged accidents only directly benefitted from the settlement of subsequent civil personal injury claims.this point ignores the fact that the submission of fraudulent claims by the medical providers and the subsequent settlements received by the defendants as passengers were interdependent parts of one integrated fraudulent plan.to advance personal injury claims and to secure settlement payments from insurers,appellants needed the cooperation of participating clinics that generated falsified treatment records.the clinics,conversely,had a financial stake in participating in the scheme because they received payments from insurers.thus,as an intended and necessary consequence of appellants illegal participation in staged automobile collisions,the clinics received payments and appellants obtained civil cash settlements from insurers,both of which were integral parts of appellants fraudulent plan.
in addition to declaring that congress did not intend for the health care fraud statute to apply to persons outside of the medical profession,yves baptiste further maintains that the statute is inapplicable to his conduct because the new york state automobile insurance program is not a health care benefit program within the meaning of the statute.he suggests that the program is distinguishable from true health care benefit programs because the new york program does not operate nationwide,and it does not cover all injuries and those resulting from automobile accidents.this argument is wholly without merit because the distinctions baptiste attempts to make are not relevant to the federal health care fraud statute.the statute provides quite simply that any public or private plan or contract under which any medical benefit,item,or service is provided to any individual qualifies as a health care benefit program.b emphases added.
in the instant case,private by insurance contracts purchased by vehicle owners pursuant to the act requirement that vehicle owners maintain a liability insurance policy that provides coverage for automobile accident injuries regardless of various medical providers for fraudulently billed medical expenses that were incurred on behalf of yves baptiste and the other two defendants.because yves well as policia baptiste and guerline a medical benefit as a result of the vehicle owners insurance contracts,a health care benefit program is,under the statutory definition of b,plainly implicated.
in sum,the federal health care fraud statute applies to defendants participation as passengers in staged automobile accidents designed to profit from new york automobile insurance regime.we recognize that this holding authorizes the application of the federal health care fraud statute to circumstances that are atypical of the health care fraud case law,which to date has concerned itself more exclusively with conduct within the medical community.despite this factual twist,it is clear that defendants conduct falls squarely within the unambiguous terms of the statute and therefore the statute applies in the circumstances presented by this case.
ii yves baptiste restitution order 
as a result of his conviction,yves baptiste was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of.this restitution order was based on the money paid to his medical providers,the monies paid to the medical providers of his fellow passengers,and the monies paid to him and his fellow passengers in civil settlements.on appeal,he insists that restitution of was an error because it was made without the district court conducting a inquiry.he also challenges the scope of the fraud and loss attributed to him by the district court.we review a district court order of restitution for abuse of discretion.see united states jacques,cir.insofar as the review involves an interpretation of law,it is de novo,see united states grant,cir where a district court findings of fact are at issue,we review for clear error,see united states harris,cir per curiam.
statutory factors 
appellant avers that in ordering restitution the trial court did not consider any factor except the loss sustained by the insurance companies that made the medical payments and the payments for civil settlements.he believes the sentencing court erred by failing to consider other statutorily mandated factors,which baptiste identifies as including his financial resources,financial needs,earning ability and dependents.appellant does not specify the authority he relies on for his argument,but the language used in his brief tracks the language of.his apparent reliance upon in this case is misplaced because it is inapplicable to his offense.the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,enacted as title ii,subtitle a of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,states that the mvra is,to the extent constitutionally permissible,effective for sentencing p
