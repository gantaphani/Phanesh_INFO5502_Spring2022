introduction 
an insurer appeals from an order vacating a fire insurance appraisal award because of alleged corruption in a appraiser pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b insurance code section requires appraisers to be disinterested.since an appraisal agreement is subject to the california arbitration act et,we conclude that to be disinterested,a appraiser must make the disclosure that section,subdivision e requires all arbitrators to make.
among other requirements,section,subdivision e requires an appraiser to disclose matters that would cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the appraiser would be able to be impartial.we find that a failure to make this disclosure constitutes corruption in any of the arbitrators and therefore provides a ground for vacating an appraisal award under section,subdivision b.in this case,under section,subdivision e,the facts did not require disclosure by the appraiser.therefore no corruption in the appraiser existed that required vacation of the appraisal award pursuant to section,subdivision b.we therefore reverse the order vacating the appraisal award.
ii.facts and procedural history 
plaintiff mahfouz michael,doing business as mark john medical group michael,conducted a medical practice in a building at south western avenue in los angeles.aetna life casualty insurance company aetna,affiliated with farmington casualty company farmington,issued a policy insuring those premises.during rioting on april,fire destroyed the insured premises.
michael notified aetna of the loss and demanded indemnification for damage to the building and interruption of the business.when aetna failed to compensate him for these losses,michael sued aetna for breach of insurance contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and breach of fiduciary duty.
the fire insurance policy contained a clause providing for an appraisal procedure to resolve disputes about the value of property or the amount of loss aetna exercised its right under the policy and initiated an appraisal.
before august,aetna selected dixon grier,a certified public accountant and a member of the firm of matson,driscoll damico md d as its appraiser.michael selected david fox as his appraiser.grier and fox selected john costello as umpire.after appraisal proceedings on january,the panel award,issued february,determined that mark john medical group sustained in lost business income and incurred necessary expenses.umpire costello and appraiser grier signed the award.appraiser fox did not sign the award.
on may,michael moved to correct or vacate the appraisal panel award pursuant to section.michael requested vacation of the award on the ground that there was corruption in aetna arbitrator,and specifically that aetna appraiser grier failed to inform michael of grier prior and ongoing relationship with aetna.michael alleged that grier worked for aetna on prior occasions,that the relationship of grier and md d with aetna meant grier was not disinterested,and these business relationships and grier failure to disclose them prohibited grier from acting as appraiser.
aetna opposition addressed two of michael allegations of impropriety that grier acted as a arbitrator for aetna in an insurance claim by sea mar international,and that other members of md d did business with aetna.aetna opposition argued that this evidence did not show sufficient bias to justify vacating the award.
michael reply relied on further evidence discovered while the petition to vacate was pending.according to that evidence,aetna made payments to the md d firm during,and,and made payments to md d specifically for grier services in another arbitration,bradford personnel trammell crow.
on february,the trial court ruled that insurance code section required a appraiser to be disinterested.it found that because md d did substantial business with aetna and some income went to grier or to grier professional corporation,the association between aetna and md d had significant potential advantage to grier,which was an impermissible financial interest.the court found that,at a minimum,there existed an impression of possible bias sufficient to disqualify grier,and vacated the appraisal award.
aetna filed a timely notice of appeal on april.
iii.issues 
the main issues in this case are 
whether this appeal was properly taken 
what insurance code section means when it requires a appraiser to be disinterested 
what disclosure a appraiser must make to the parties of an appraisal pursuant to section,subdivision e 
whether the failure to make the disclosure required by section,subdivision e constitutes corruption in any of the arbitrators as provided by section,subdivision b and 
whether substantial evidence supports the vacation of the appraisal award in this case.
iv.appealability 
section,subdivision c states an aggrieved party may appeal from an order vacating an award unless a rehearing in arbitration is ordered.aetna appealed from the trial court february,order vacating the appraisal award and setting a status conference for march.michael claims that because a september,reporter transcript shows that the trial court granted aetna request to compel a new appraisal,the february,order is not appealable.we disagree.
first,the record on appeal contains no order reflecting the september,ruling,which appears only in a reporter transcript.an order is a document which is either entered in the court permanent minutes or signed by the judge and stamped filed.shpiller harry redlands th,d.
second,the notice of appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction.this rule protects the appellate court jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until this court decides the appeal,and prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it.betz pankow th,d.as the trial court lacked jurisdiction,the ruling on september,granting a request to compel a new appraisal provides no basis for the exception to appealability in section,subdivision c.
we conclude that the appeal is properly taken.
v.the standard of review

vi.discussion 
a.the california arbitration act governs the appraisal procedure in insurance code section 
as reflected in the aetna insurance policy,insurance code sections and governing fire insurance policies in california establish an appraisal procedure when the insured and the insurer can not agree on the cash value or the amount of loss.insurance code section requires the standard form of fire insurance policy to state,in relevant part in case the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss,then,on the written demand of either,each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within days of such demand.the appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire and failing for days to agree upon such umpire,then,on request of the insured or this company,such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located.the appraisers shall then appraise the loss,stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item and,failing to agree,shall submit their differences,only,to the umpire.an award in writing,so itemized,of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss.each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him and the expenses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.italics added.
insurance code section does not define its requirement that appraisers be disinterested and provides no means to challenge an award made by appraisers who are not disinterested.however,the california arbitration act et guides our interpretation of insurance code section.that is because an agreement in an insurance policy to conduct an appraisal constitutes an agreement within the meaning of section,subdivision a an agreement providing for an appraisal is therefore considered to be an arbitration agreement subject to statutory contractual arbitration law in the california arbitration act.louise gardens of encino homeowners,truck ins.exchange,th,d coopers lybrand superior court d.
we read the california arbitration act and insurance code section together to define an appraiser duties and to determine how to enforce those duties.section of the california arbitration act provides a way to enforce insurance code section.jefferson ins.superior court cal d,fn.the trial court must vacate an appraisal award if it determines that any grounds in section exist.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d,marsch williams th,d.the issue in this case is whether substantial evidence supports the vacation of the appraisal award because of corruption in any of the appraisers pursuant to section,subdivision b.
b.a appraiser must disclose what section,subdivision e requires all arbitrators to disclose 
section of the california arbitration act imposes disclosure requirements on arbitrators and appraisers.p roposed neutral arbitrators must comply with disclosure requirements in section,subdivisions a through d section,subdivision e,however,uses different language.subdivision e states,in relevant part an arbitrator shall disclose to all parties the existence of any grounds specified in section for disqualification of a judge and,if any such ground exists,shall disqualify himself or herself upon demand of any party made before the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding.italics added.by using the phrase an arbitrator,subdivision e does not limit itself to proposed neutral arbitrators.all arbitrators,and therefore all appraisers,must comply with subdivision e.
c.the disclosure required by section,subdivision e 
the legislature added subdivision e to section by an amendment effective january.subdivision e incorporated a disclosure requirement based on section.see footnote,infra.section,subdivision e now requires arbitrators and appraisers to disclose to parties any grounds in section that would require disqualification of a judge.section,subdivision a contains numerous criteria for disqualification of a judge.those which are relevant here are as follows 
a a judge shall be disqualified if any one or more of the following is true 
the judge served as a lawyer in the proceeding,or in any other proceeding involving the same issues he or she served as a lawyer for any party in the present proceeding or gave advice to any party in the present proceeding upon any matter involved in the action or proceeding.a judge shall be deemed to have served as a lawyer in the proceeding if within the past two years a a party to the proceeding or an officer,director,or trustee of a party was a client of the judge when the judge was in the private practice of law or a client of a lawyer with whom the judge was associated in the private practice of law.
the judge has a financial interest in the subject matter in a proceeding or in a party to the proceeding.
for any reason a the judge believes his or her recusal would further the interests of justice,b the judge believes there is a substantial doubt as to his or her capacity to be impartial,or c a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.
thus a appraiser,whom insurance code section requires to be disinterested,must disclose matters which section,subdivision e requires all arbitrators to disclose.those matters are the ones set forth in section.
section,subdivision a c requires an appraiser to disclose dealings that might cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the appraiser would be able to be impartial 
with regard to the disclosure required of arbitrators,before section,subdivision e became effective,california case law generally applied the rule in commonwealth casualty,d commonwealth to motions to vacate pursuant to section,subdivisions a and b.banwait hernandez d.commonwealth addressed the issue whether a neutral arbitrator failure to disclose a previous business relationship with a party to the arbitration compelled vacation of the arbitration award on the ground that the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means or because there was evident partiality in the arbitrators.commonwealth,supra,at,quoting the united states arbitration act.commonwealth concluded that the arbitrator was required to disclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias.commonwealth,supra,at.italics added.
we view the commonwealth disclosure rule as identical in substance to the section,subdivision a c disclosure requirement.section,subdivision e,by incorporating section,subdivision a c,gives the commonwealth coatings rule a source in california statute.section,subdivision e added a disclosure requirement that previously had not existed this disclosure requirement applies to all arbitrators and appraisers.thus section,subdivision e and section,subdivision a c require appraisers and arbitrators to disclose to parties any reason that might cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the appraiser or arbitrator would be able to be impartial.
like the commonwealth coatings disclosure rule,the standard for disclosure under section,subdivision a c is objective.the facts that must be disclosed are those which might cause a reasonable person to entertain a doubt that the appraiser would be able to be impartial.moreover,the statutory test does not require actual bias.where a reasonable person would entertain doubt whether the appraiser or arbitrator was impartial,the appellate courts are not required to speculate whether bias was actual or merely apparent,or whether impartial consideration of the evidence and dispassionate decision of the matter would have led to the same result.roitz coldwell banker residential brokerage th,d.
e.the failure to disclose facts required by section,subdivision e constitutes a form of corruption and provides a ground to vacate an appraisal award pursuant to section,subdivision b 
michael motion to vacate the appraisal award alleged that grier had business dealings and a business relationship with aetna,which meant he was not disinterested.michael motion therefore claimed that grier failure to disclose his business dealings and business relationship with aetna established the statutory ground of corruption,which required vacation of the award.
a court may vacate an appraisal award only if it finds that a ground in section exists.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d,marsch williams,supra,th at,d.where statutes require disclosure,existing case law does not clearly identify the failure to make that required disclosure as corruption in the arbitrator or appraiser for purposes of vacating an award pursuant to section,subdivision b.see,figi new hampshire ins.supra,d at.johnston security ins.d.betz pankow th,d gebers state farm general ins.th,d banwait hernandez,supra,d at.ray wilson anaheim memorial hospital d,disapproved on other grounds in moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.
we now hold that where an appraiser or arbitrator fails to disclose matters required to be disclosed by section,subdivision e,and a party later discovers disclosure should have been made,that failure to disclose constitutes one form of corruption for purposes of section,subdivision b and thus provides a ground for vacating an award.this is because the failure to disclose such matters,even if no actual bias is present,represents a kind of corruption by creating the appearance that the appraiser or arbitrator is concealing something important and relevant to his or her impartial participation in t
