five former employees of the fine sons manufacturing,the company filed this putative lawsuit against five of the company former officers and directors collectively,the fines,as well as the administrator of the company healthcare plan,preferred health plan,php.the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties imposed by the employment retirement income security act erisa and committed various torts under kentucky law.
specifically,the plaintiffs maintain that the fines and php failed to disclose to the employees that the company was in dire financial straits and was therefore unable to make the payments necessary to support the company healthcare plan,and failed to devise a means of assuring adequate financing for the plan.they also allege that php improperly allocated plan assets to itself after the plan ceased operation and php administration contract had terminated.
in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the erisa claims,the district court concluded that neither the fines nor php were erisa fiduciaries within the meaning of the statute.the district court also initially dismissed the plaintiffs pendent claims with prejudice,but,after a motion for reconsideration,changed the dismissal to one without prejudice.on appeal,the plaintiffs maintain their argument that the fines and php were erisa fiduciaries,and that they breached their duties during the months preceding the company bankruptcy.both the fines and php,on the other hand,the district court decision to dismiss the plaintiffs pendent claims without prejudice,as opposed to with prejudice,arguing that those claims are preempted by erisa.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with the district court that the fines were not erisa fiduciaries,conclude that the district court erred in ruling that php was not an erisa fiduciary with respect to the assets of the company healthcare plan over which php had control,and hold that all but one of the plaintiffs claims are preempted by erisa.we therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the fines affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs claims,but order that all but the one claiming that the fines breached a duty by failing to disclose the overall financial condition of the company be dismissed with prejudice reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of php and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
fine sons manufacturing,was a manufacturer of clothing products,with its principal place of business in louisville,kentucky.during the,the company owned additional facilities in georgia,honduras,indiana,kentucky,and tennessee,although these facilities began to close as the company financial condition deteriorated.faced with decreased demand for its products and with increased operating costs,the company hired gary finkel as its chief operating officer in.finkel was asked to turn the situation around,to increase sales,decrease costs,and therefore increase profitability.despite finkel efforts,the company financial slide continued.it lost million in.
one of the measures implemented by finkel was the change from a fully insured healthcare plan with anthem blue shield to a plan administered by php.the company initiated the new plan by entering into an administrative services agreement agreement with php on august.under the agreement,php was named as both a third party administrator responsible for certain supervisory,administrative and general management services,and as the plan administrator,thereby acquiring certain legal responsibilities as defined by the internal revenue code and erisa.php now maintains that its designation as the plan administrator was an error that was later corrected in what it calls the plan document,a form used by php and customized to establish the benefits that the company sought to provide its employees and the eligibility requirements for the receipt of those benefits.
in contrast to the administrative services agreement,the plan document listed the company as the administrator of the plan and stated that the plan was to be administered through the company human resources office.kim lassiter,the vice president of human resources,was the only company official to sign the initial plan document and the amendments to that document implemented in july of and march of.the plan document also listed the company as the named fiduciary,and described php as the plan supervisor to whom all claims and questions regarding claims should be directed.employees were informed,however,that they could appeal the denial of their claim directly to the company,whose decision as to eligibility and coverage would be final.
as the supervisor of the plan,php performed a variety of tasks,including processing claims,determining coverage and eligibility,and making payments to eligible employees.in a typical case,php would receive a claim from a healthcare provider,process that claim to determine whether it was covered by the company plan,and,if the claim was covered,php would advise the company on a weekly basis of the money that needed to be deposited into the account from which php paid the service providers.that account,which was in the names of both the company and php,was financed from the general assets of the company and had no minimum balance,such that the account was designed to zero out after php dispersed the designated set of payments.in addition to its responsibilities,php was charged with enrolling company employees in the plan,a task that it continued to perform through march of,at which time the company became unable to meet its obligations under the plan.
the role of the company directors in the administration of the plan is less apparent.all of the fines were shareholders and members of the board of directors at some point,although steven fine was removed from the board when gary finkel was hired as ceo in.finkel,in turn,replaced the three fines who had acted as and from until finkel was hired.according to the plaintiffs,the fines became aware in that the company was suffering from problems and was late in making critical payments.four of the fines sought to improve the situation by loaning the company a total of million in capital.
by the spring of,the company fragile financial condition was evident,and the board of directors authorized management to use as capital the cash value some of life insurance policies owned by the company.a new severance plan,which markedly reduced severance benefits to discharged employees,was promulgated a few days later.at around the same time,the company stopped making the payments required to support the healthcare plan,and php was unable to write checks payable from the plan account.retaining for itself an administrative fee of,php cancelled its contract with the company in a letter dated may.php then sent a final letter to the company on june,including in that correspondence checks that remitted the balance on hand of cobra payments made by individuals directly to php and the remaining funds in the plan account.the company filed for bankruptcy later that month.
among those adversely affected by the company decline and eventual bankruptcy were the five plaintiffs,all of whom were either current or former employees at the time the company ceased operations.the plaintiffs became eligible for healthcare benefits in three different ways.lead plaintiff william jack briscoe was an hourly employee whose contributions to the plan were deducted from his wages of per hour.briscoe signed up for the plan when he was asked to do so by php in march of.on the other hand,plaintiffs laura farley,lawrence smith,and michael straka were all salaried employees whose contributions to the plan were paid by the company as partial compensation for their work.finally,harold smith,who had left the company pursuant to a severance agreement prior to the company bankruptcy,made individual cobra payments directly to php through april of.unpaid medical bills for these employees ranged from to,with the total amount of bills left unpaid upon the company demise exceeding.
procedural background 
the plaintiffs filed their complaint in the district court in,naming as defendants the five members of the fine family and php.alleging violations of various fiduciary duties imposed by erisa as well as several torts,the plaintiffs sought to certify a class of company employees and requested both compensatory and punitive damages.after discovery had commenced,the plaintiffs agreed to a voluntary dismissal of most of the torts alleged in their original complaint.they then filed an amended complaint that restated their erisa claims and their claims of fraud,misrepresentation,concealment,and conversion.all of the defendants moved for summary judgment,arguing that they were not erisa fiduciaries and that the plaintiffs claims were preempted by erisa.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.framing the dispositive issue as whether the fines and php qualified as fiduciaries under erisa,the district court concluded that the fines had no responsibility for the administration of the plan and that php,even if it had discretionary authority over certain aspects of the healthcare plan,did not have such authority or responsibility with respect to the actions that allegedly harmed the plaintiffs.as to the plaintiffs claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.it then entered an order dismissing all claims against the defendants with prejudice.
in response to the district court order,the plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the judgment,arguing that only the federal claims should be dismissed with prejudice and that the claims should be permitted to proceed in state court.all of the defendants opposed the motion,insisting that the plaintiffs claims were either preempted by erisa or failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court granted the plaintiffs motion,amending its earlier order and dismissing the plaintiffs claims without prejudice.following the amended order,the plaintiffs refiled these claims in state court.the defendants then removed the refiled case to federal court.proceedings in that case have been stayed pending the outcome of this appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court correctly concluded that the fines were not erisa.standard of review 
the district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.int l union cummins,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.we view the facts,and any inferences drawn therefrom,in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,which in the present case is the plaintiffs.see melson prime ins.syndicate,cir.
statutory framework 
because the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the ground that they were not erisa fiduciaries,we will briefly review the role that fiduciary status plays in the erisa remedial scheme.as defined in the statute,
a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets,ii he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation,direct or indirect,with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan,or has any authority or responsibility to do so,or iii he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.
a.the allegations of the plaintiffs in the present case implicate clauses i and iii of this statutory definition.
this court employs a functional test to determine fiduciary status.see hamilton carell,cir observing that t he supreme court has recognized that erisa defines fiduciary not in terms of formal trusteeship,but in functional terms of control and authority over the plan quoting mertens hewitt,d.in addition,several courts have focused on the phrase to the extent in holding that f iduciary status is not an all or nothing concept,and that they must therefore ask whether a person is a fiduciary with respect to the particular activity in question.moench robertson,cir citations and quotation marks omitted see also hamilton,at explaining the need to examine the conduct at issue when determining whether an individual is an erisa fiduciary am.fed of unions local equitable life assurance soc y,cir a person is a fiduciary only with respect to those portions of a plan over which he exercises discretionary authority or control.
fiduciary status is the key to unlocking erisa scheme because the statute permits a suit by the secretary of labor,or by a participant,beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under.a.section,in turn,makes any person found to be a fiduciary personally liable to the plan for any damages caused by that person breach of fiduciary duties.see also mertens,at.explaining the remedies available against fiduciaries under and the more limited remedies available against nonfiduciaries under a.plaintiffs seeking more than the appropriate equitable relief available under a of which injunctions and restitution are two examples,see mertens,at.must demonstrate that the person violating a duty imposed by erisa is a fiduciary.whether a person or entity qualifies as a fiduciary is either a question of law or a mixed question of law and fact,both of which we review de novo.see hamilton,at explaining that fiduciary status is a pure question of law where the parties do not challenge the district court underlying factual findings.
the fines did not exercise discretionary authority regarding the administration of the plan or any control over the assets of the plan 
citing leigh engle,cir,the plaintiffs argue that the fines were functional fiduciaries because they selected and retained the plan administrators.the district court,relying in part on an interpretative bulletin from the department of labor dol,rejected the plaintiffs contention.according to the dol bulletin,m embers of the board of directors of an employer which maintains an employee benefit plan will be fiduciaries only to the extent that they have responsibility for the functions described in section a of the act.dol interpretative bulletin,at.the bulletin gives as an example directors who choose a named or functional fiduciary of a covered plan,but notes that the directors liability would be limited to claims relating to the selection and retention of those fiduciaries.id.
appellate courts interpreting the dol bulletin have taken different approaches to the situation in which a corporation is the named fiduciary,but has not explicitly delegated administrative authority to its corporate directors.the sixth circuit has not yet squarely faced this issue.see in re cms energy erisa,d,observing that the sixth circuit has yet to address the third circuit ruling that officers are not deemed erisa fiduciaries in the absence of express individual discretionary authority for plan administration.in confer custom engineering,cir,the third circuit held that when an erisa plan names a corporation as a fiduciary,the officers who exercise discretion on behalf of that corporation are not fiduciaries unless it can be shown that these officers have individual discretionary roles as to plan administration.id.at emphasis in original.
two other circuits,however,have purported to disagree with the breadth of the holding in confer and have reiterated that the functions performed by a corporate director determine that person status as a fiduciary.see kayes pacific lumber,cir rejecting the analysis from confer i nsofar as that case holds that a corporate officer or director acting on behalf of a corporation is not acting in a fiduciary capacity if the corporation is the named plan fiduciary musmeci schwegmann giant super,cir confirming that the fifth circuit follows the functional approach adopted in kayes.
although the ninth circuit expressed its disagreement with confer,we do not interpret the approach that it adopted in kayes as substantially different from the one employed by the third circuit.specifically,both courts would permit a finding that the officers of a corporation named as the fiduciary of its healthcare plan are themselves fiduciaries where they exercise discretionary authority over plan assets or plan management.see kayes,at reiterating that corporate officers can be liable as fiduciaries on the basis of their conduct and authority with respect to erisa plans confer,at acknowledging that officers of a corporation may assume a fiduciary status,even absent a designation as the named fiduciary or trustee of the plan,by performing functions that fulfill the statutory definition of fiduciary quotation marks omitted.the primary difference between the two decisions,then,is that the third circuit appears to begin with a rebuttable presumption against director or officer fiduciary liability under erisa,whereas the ninth circuit starts with no initial presumption one way or the other.
because the analyses employed in confer and kayes lead to the same result in the present case,we have no need to take a position on which approach is more faithful to erisa definition of a fiduciary.as the district court correctly found,the plaintiffs have not pointed to any evidence in the record indicating that the individual directors made any decisions with respect to plan management or the collection or distribution of plan assets which were a subset of the company general assets.the only relevant decisions that the directors took part in making are of the type addressed by the dol bulletin and by the seventh circuit in hiring of php as the administrator and the assignment of plan management to the department of human resources.both leigh and the dol bulletin,however,limit the responsibility of directors to the obligations that arise from their specific fiduciary acts.see leigh,at.in the present case,the actions by the fines that the plaintiffs allege constitute a breach of duty are wholly separate from the selection of php as the administrator and the delegation of plan management to the human resources department.that is to say,the only acts by the fines that could give rise to fiduciary liability are ones that the plaintiffs do not allege comprise a breach of duty.
regardless of whether the more lenient functional approach from kayes or the more demanding confer standard applies,the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the fines exercised the type of discretionary authority identified in a of erisa.they have not shown,for example,that the fines conduct and authority with respect to the erisa plan involved discretionary acts,kayes,at,or that the fines undertook individual discretionary roles as to plan administration.confer,at emphasis in original.because the plaintiffs do not argue that the limited discretionary acts of the fines gave rise to a breach of duty and because the fines did not exercise discretionary authority over any other aspects of plan management or plan assets,the district court correctly concluded that the fines were not erisa fiduciaries.and because they were not fiduciaries,the fines did not owe the plaintiffs the significant duties that our cases place upon such persons.see,krohn huron memorial,cir explaining an erisa fiduciary duty of loyalty and duty to disclose pertinent information to plan participants.the district court therefore properly granted summary judgment in favor of the fines.
php exercised sufficient control over plan assets to qualify as a fiduciary 
we can not give the same answer regarding php status as an erisa fiduciary.once again,our inquiry is a functional one,with the task being to determine whether php exercised discretionary authority over plan management,or any authority or control over plan assets.see a see also hamilton,at only discretionary acts of plan management or administration,or those acts designed to carry out the very purposes of the plan,are subject to erisa fiduciary duties.although the functions that php performed as a administrator did not convert it into an erisa fiduciary,we believe that php exercised sufficient control over plan assets to so qualify.
neither its agreement with the company nor its operations made php an erisa fiduciary 
php renews the argument that it made before the district it engaged solely in administrative and ministerial tasks that did not involve the exercise of discretionary authority.relying on the dol bulletin and this court decision in baxter muer,cir per curiam,php maintains that the tasks it performed are directly in line with those that the department of labor and this court have held do not give rise to fiduciary responsibilities.this court in baxter summarized the dol bulletin by explaining that a person without the power to make plan policies or interpretations but who performs purely ministerial functions such as processing claims,applying plan eligibility rules,communicating with employees,and calculating benefits,is not a fiduciary under erisa.id.at.the plaintiff in baxter alleged that the administrator of his employer healthcare plan had breached its fiduciary duties when it denied him benefits after he was involved in a car accident caused by his intoxication.id.at.citing with approval the eleventh circuit decision in baker big star division of the grand union,cir holding that a plan administrator was not a fiduciary where the employer reserved the right to review the denial of claims,this court held that the administrator was merely a claims processor that pays claims in accordance with the terms of the employer plan and therefore did not qualify as an erisa fiduciary.baxter,at.
similarly,php operated pursuant to an administrative services agreement that conferred upon it the responsibility for determining eligibility for benefits,processing claims,and assisting the plan administrator in producing reports required by federal and state law.its tasks appear to be identical to the ones that the baxter court held were insufficient to convert a administrator into an erisa fiduciary.see at see also gelardi pertec computer,cir per curiam holding that a company hired by an employer to administer its plan was not a fiduciary because it preformed only administrative functions,processing claims within a framework of policies,rules,and procedures established by others.also as in baxter,the company as the plaintiffs employer retained the final authority to determine whether a claim should be paid and was the entity to which dissatisfied employees were instructed to direct their appeal of a claim denial.see baxter,at.
the plaintiffs,in response,cite three cases from this circuit where the court did not exclude the possibility that administrators could be fiduciaries.in the first,blue cross blue shield mutual of ohio bcbsm,cir,this court held that bcbsm retained its status as a fiduciary even after switched from a plan to a plan.but the court limited its holding to the situation in which an insurance company administers claims for an employee welfare benefit plan and has authority to grant or deny the claims id.at.in that case bcbsm maintained complete control over the claims decisions,including appeals from the denial of benefits.id.
the seventh circuit in klosterman western general management,cir,emphasized bcbsm role as the final authority in claims decisions when it refused to extend the holding of to a case like here in which the sponsoring company was the ultimate decisionmaker.this reasoning also distinguishes the second precedent on which the plaintiffs rely,hill blue cross blue shield of michigan,cir,where this court simply applied at the stage and allowed a claim against the insurance company to proceed because the plaintiff alleged that blue cross had full authority to grant and deny claims.
six clinics holding,ii cafcomp systems,cir,is the third and final sixth circuit case relied on by the plaintiffs in their claims against php.this court in six clinics held that a administrator that provided services as part of the clinic plan qualified as an erisa fiduciary.in so holding,the court focused on the permissive language of the administrative services agreement which included phrases such as in the judgment of cafcomp and as cafcomp deems necessary,the fact that cafcomp held itself out as a fiduciary in promotional materials,and cafcomp ability to unilaterally amend the plan to bring it into compliance with federal law.id.at.none of these three factors exist in the present case.
php administrative services agreement features only one broad authorization clause,and even that clause limits what php may do to carrying out the terms and purposes of the agreement.as for the second six clinics factor,whatever ambiguity the administrative services agreement might have generated regarding the identity of the plan administrator,the employees learned of php role not through that agreement,but through the plan document.that document lists the company as the plan administrator and named fiduciary,and lists php as the plan supervisor and the entity that will aid in claims processing.finally,nothing in the administrative services agreement or the plan document empowered php to make unilateral modifications to the plan.this court decision in six clinics,therefore,does not control the outcome in the present case.
we therefore agree with php that neither the terms of its agreement with the company nor its operations gave php discretionary authority over plan management.see flacche sun life assurance of,cir the mere payment of claims is insufficient to give sun life discretionary control over the management of plan assets or the administration of the plan.absent such authority,php falls within the safe harbor provided by the dol regulation and does not qualify as an erisa fiduciary on that basis.as we explain below,however,php unilateral disposition of funds held in an account over which it exerted control makes it a fiduciary to the extent that it exercised such control upon the termination of its relationship with the company.
php qualifies as an erisa fiduciary to the extent that it exercised control over plan assets 
the plaintiffs challenge the district court conclusion that php did not control plan assets because its tasks were limited to collecting cobra payments from former employees and paying out claims approved by the company.specifically,the plaintiffs maintain that the manner in which php disposed of the remaining funds in the plan bank keeping some of the money as an administrative fee and returning the rest of the money to the bankrupt inconsistent with the limited discretionary authority found by the d istrict c ourt.we believe that both the parties and the district court misunderstood what must be shown in order to establish that an entity controlling the assets of an plan qualifies as a fiduciary.
under the statutory definition,a person is a fiduciary for purposes of erisa to the extent i he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets a see also seaway food town,medical mut.of ohio,cir explaining that erisa defines a person to include a corporation citation and quotation marks omitted.the plain language of the statute establishes that it imposes fiduciary duties not only on those entities that exercise discretionary control over the disposition of plan assets,but also imposes such duties on entities or companies that exercise any authority or control over the covered assets.see smith provident bank,cir emphasizing the same statutory language in holding that a bank removed as trustee of an account acted as an erisa fiduciary after its removal because it still exercised control over plan assets.
the district court therefore erred in requiring,as a condition of fiduciary responsibility,that the type of authority that php exercised over the plan assets had to be discretionary.this confusion stems from the differing language in two adjacent clauses of erisa definition of fiduciary.under one clause,a person is a fiduciary to the extent that he or she exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control over the management of the erisa plan.a i emphasis added.the second part of the same sentence,however,confers fiduciary status upon a person to the extent that he or she exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of the plan assets.id.emphasis added.we will presume under prevailing canons of statutory construction that congress omission of the word discretionary in the second part of the sentence was intentional,and that the threshold for acquiring fiduciary responsibilities is therefore lower for persons or entities responsible for the handling of plan assets than for those who manage the plan.see,keene united states,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.alteration in original citation and quotation marks omitted.
our interpretation of a i mirrors the one recently adopted by the circuit in chao day.the defendant in chao,an insurance company president named brittian day,was accused of selling fake insurance plans to clients and then depositing their payments into his corporate account.id.at.day filed a motion to dismiss the secretary of labor suit against him,arguing that he was not a fiduciary under erisa because the plain language of a i required the secretary to prove that day exercised discretionary control over the relevant assets.
the circuit rejected day argument,commenting that such a reading does violence to the statutory text.id.at.emphasizing both congress use of the disjunctive term or to separate the two clauses in question and the omission of the word discretionary in the second clause,the circuit held that a person who controls plan assets acquires fiduciary responsibility regardless of whether that control is discretionary.id.because the disposition clause contains no discretion requirement,it is irrelevant whether day exercised discretion in his thievery.a ny authority or control is enough.see also david coldesina,estate of simper,cir holding that the distinction between the two clauses evidences congress intent to treat control over assets differently than control over management or administration firstier bank,zeller,cir holding that erisa imposes fiduciary duties whenever one deals with plan assets.
we believe that the plaintiffs have proffered sufficient evidence to demonstrate that php exercised control over the assets of the company healthcare plan still in php possession when the company became insolvent.this court decision in smith is illustrative.in that case,a participant in pension and plans instructed the defendant bank,which was the trustee for the plans,to purchase shares of stock on his behalf.at.two weeks after the bank was removed as trustee for the plan,the bank corrected its failure to purchase the same amount and type of stock for another client by removing the previously bought shares from the participant account.id.although the value of those shares had increased substantially in the intervening period,the bank credited the participant account only for the original purchase price of the stock,minus dividends that the participant had already received.id.in deciding whether the participant claim for breach of fiduciary duty was preempted,this court held that the bank acted as an erisa fiduciary when it removed the shares from the participant account.id.at.the bank retained its fiduciary status even after being removed as trustee because it still exercised control over plan assets by removing such assets from a participant account and then replacing those assets with a monetary sum of lesser value.id.
similarly,php still controlled plan assets after the formal conclusion of its relationship with the company and with the plan participants.documents in the record demonstrate that php terminated its contract with the company on may,by which time php had already removed from the plan account its administrative free of.php continued to receive cobra payments from plan participants and controlled a small amount of funds previously received from the company.on june,php sent a letter and two checks to the covering the amount of cobra payments that it had received through may,and another representing the funds remaining in the fine sons,claim account.php of course knew by this time that the company was in dire financial straits and was unable to fund the healthcare plan.although php contends that its actions correspond to its obligations under clause of its agreement with the company,these actions nonetheless refute the district court conclusion that php was an erisa fiduciary only with respect to the processing of healthcare claims.the terms of the agreement may have limited php discretion over the remaining funds,but did not affect its control over those funds.because fiduciary status as to plan assets does not turn on the exercise of discretion or the existence of discretionary authority,see chao,at,the agreement does not alter the fact that php acted as a signatory and unilaterally disposed of the remaining funds.
caselaw from other circuits leads to the same conclusion.the ninth circuit decision in it general am.life ins,cir,for example,is factually analogous to the present case and specifically rejects the argument that limiting language in a contract between a company and its administrator overrides the latter functional status as a fiduciary.it had hired general american as the administrator of its erisa plan.the parties signed a contract that assigned to general american the primary responsibility for processing and deciding all claims,instructed general american to direct all doubtful claims to it,and established that it would set up a bank account with sufficient funds to cover the checks that general american would write in paying claims.id.at.outside of these basic terms,the contract also limited general american liability for any erroneous claims decisions and provided specifically that general american was not the named fiduciary of the plan and that its duties were purely ministerial in nature.
it and several plan participants sued general american after it paid a claim to a dependent child of an employee,a person not eligible for benefits under the company plan.id.at.after the district court granted general american motion to dismiss on the ground that general american was not a fiduciary,the ninth circuit reversed.id.at.the court first addressed the issue of statutory construction,observing that erisa treats control over the cash differently from control over administration by making any person or entity that exerts a ny control over the disposition of plan money a fiduciary.id.at.under the statutory definition,the court reasoned,t he right to write checks on plan funds is authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.id.quoting a i.the court then concluded that the contractual which it established and funded a bank account and general american drew funds from that a substantial amount of money under the control of general american,in the form of a bank account which it could deplete by writing checks,it,at.because the power to draft checks on the plan account constituted control over plan assets,general american qualified as an erisa fiduciary.
the contractual arrangement between it and general american is strikingly similar to the one between the company and php in the present case.in both instances,a company hired a administrator to perform ministerial tasks necessary to process claims,and also to pay those claims from a bank account established and funded by the company.like general american,php had a substantial amount of money under its control at any given time,and exercised that control by depositing direct payments from cobra participants,writing checks to cover approved claims,and allotting to itself a monthly administrative fee.php actions evince more than just the power to write checks on plan funds,it,at,and suffice to show that php exercised at least partial control over the assets of the company healthcare plan.
both the second and tenth circuits have also held that parties who possess and use their power to write checks on a plan account exercise control over plan assets.see lopresti terwilliger,cir david coldesina,at.in lopresti,two brothers were the sole shareholders of a company that funded its employees benefit and pension plans by deducting a sum from the paychecks of the employees,placing that sum in its general assets,and then drawing funds from those assets to finance the plans.at.the company used the employees contributions to pay off other creditors after it suffered financial problems,leaving the plans without sufficient funds.analyzing each brother separately,the second circuit held that one of the brothers qualified as an erisa fiduciary because he signed checks on the company account and decided which creditors to pay and when.id.at.as to the other brother,he was not a fiduciary because,although he had power to write checks from the company account,he had not done so.id.at.
more recently,the tenth circuit held that an accountant serving as the administrator of a dental office plan qualified as an erisa fiduciary because of his control over plan assets.david coldesina,at.the accountant took part in making disbursements to plan participants and also deposited funds into his business account before writing checks on behalf of the plan for insurance products and services.id.at.in concluding that he was a fiduciary,the tenth circuit pointed to the accountant total control over the plan money while it was in his account and rejected his argument that he could not have been a fiduciary because he was simply performing a ministerial,service.id.at.a cting as a signatory on behalf of a plan,the court held,can indicate fiduciary control,at least where a party both has the power to issue checks and exercises that power.id.at.
in the present case,php both had the power to write checks on the plan account which was partially in php name and exercised that power before and after its contractual relationship with the company ended.because php exercised control over plan assets,it qualifies as an erisa fiduciary to the extent that it did so.
we recognize that there is some tension between our decision today and the dol regulation upon which php relies.under the dol regulation,a administrator without the power to make plan policies or interpretations but who performs purely ministerial functions such as processing claims,applying plan eligibility rules,communicating with employees,and calculating benefits,is not a fiduciary under erisa.baxter,at quoting.on the other hand,both our decision today and this court earlier decision in smith hold that any person or entity that exercises control over the assets of an plan,including administrators,acquires fiduciary status with regard to the control of those assets.see smith,at.
we believe that these two lines of authority are reconcilable.the decision in smith is faithful to the plain language of a as the vast majority of circuits to address the question have construed that serves to clarify that a administrator performing the tasks described in the dol regulation can nevertheless acquire fiduciary status where,in addition to its other actions,it exercises control over plan assets.like the circuit,however,we wish to emphasize that our holding today is a limited one.our reading of erisa statutory definition will not extend fiduciary status to every person who exercises mere possession,or custody over the plans assets.chao,at see also srein frankford trust,cir recognizing that entities are not erisa fiduciaries when they do no more than receive deposits from a benefit fund on which the fund can draw checks citation and quotation marks omitted.to the contrary,our decision conforms with the statute purpose of assuring that people who have practical control over an erisa plan money have fiduciary responsibility to the plan beneficiaries.it,at.
the plaintiffs in the present case have presented competent evidence establishing that php exercised control over assets in the company plan by allotting to itself an administrative fee and returning the remaining funds after its relationship with the company terminated.on these facts,we hold that php exercised at least partial control over plan assets and,to the extent that it did so,qualifies as a fiduciary.whether php actually breached any duty that it owed is a question that the parties may address on remand and one on which we offer no opinion.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of php and remand this aspect of the case for further proceedings.
all but one of the plaintiffs claims are preempted by erisa and should have been dismissed with prejudice 
jurisdiction 
the plaintiffs initially argue that this court lacks jurisdiction over the by the fines and php.specifically,they maintain that the defendants are attempting to appeal from the denial of summary judgment on the pendent claims,and that the denial of summary judgment is not an appealable final order.although the plaintiffs are correct that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally not a final order susceptible to appellate review,an exception exists where the district court has dismissed pendent claims without prejudice as opposed to with prejudice.wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure ed recognizing that a defendant must be allowed to appeal a dismissal without prejudice in order to argue that the dismissal should have been with prejudice.
the seventh circuit,in two opinions written by judge posner,has applied and explained this exception to the general appellate requirement of finality.in the earlier case of labuhn bulkmatic transport,cir,the employer,in a suit alleging retaliatory discharge,appealed the district court dismissal of the employee suit without prejudice,arguing that the suit should have been dismissed with prejudice because the claim was preempted by the national labor relations act.the seventh circuit held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal,reasoning that the defendant had been aggrieved in a practical sense because it wanted a dismissal with prejudice,and did get it.id.at.
in the later case of disher information resources,cir,corporate officers accused by a former employee of breaching their fiduciary duties appealed the district court dismissal of two pendent claims without prejudice.following labuhn,the seventh circuit in disher agreed that it had jurisdiction over the appeal and held that an order that ends litigation in one system is final and appealable even though it kicks off litigation in another.id.at see also amazon,dirt camp,cir stating that where a dismissal finally disposes of the case so that it is not subject to further proceedings in federal court,the dismissal without prejudice is final and appealable.
the present case is procedurally on all fours with labuhn,disher,and amazon.when it dismissed the plaintiffs pendent claims without prejudice,the district court permitted the plaintiffs to refile in state court,an option they have in fact exercised.litigation in state court has thus already kick ed off.see disher,at.moreover,like the defendants in labuhn,the fines and php have been aggrieved because they sought dismissal with prejudice on preemption grounds,did not get it,and have now been forced to return to state court in order to remove the case back to federal court.see also amazon,at noting that the defendant was sufficiently aggrieved because the dismissal without prejudice had given it only a part of what it sought.because we find persuasive the caselaw permitting prevailing parties to appeal an order dismissing pendent claims without prejudice in order to argue that the dismissal should have been with prejudice,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear the defendants in the present case.
standard of review 
neither the briefs of the parties nor the caselaw that they cite have clarified the proper standard of review governing the defendants.one the one hand,this court will overturn a district court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and its decision to amend a prior judgment only if the lower court has abused its discretion.see soliday miami county,cir applying that standard to the district court decision regarding supplemental jurisdiction sault marie tribe of chippewa indians engler,cir applying that standard to a motion to alter or amend judgment.
characterizing this as a challenge to the district court refusal to exercise supplemental jurisdiction,however,is itself questionable in light of the supreme court cases holding that an defense essentially confers original jurisdiction upon the federal district court.see metro.life ins.taylor,d holding that causes of action falling within the scope of erisa a are completely preempted and removable to federal court see also peters lincoln,cir explaining that the complete preemption doctrine gives federal courts jurisdiction over claims that would otherwise be cognizable only in state court.with respect to the underlying legal issue,this court reviews de novo the question of whether a claim is preempted by erisa.see nester allegiance healthcare,cir b ecause the question of erisa of state law claims is one of law,it also is assessed de novo.
we will assume without deciding that the standard applies in these circumstances because we conclude that the district court decision must be reversed in part under even the more deferential standard of review.under that standard,we will reverse the district court only if we have a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.eagles,am.eagle,cir quotation marks omitted.
all but one of the plaintiffs claims relate to the plan,do not stem from an independent legal duty,and are therefore subject to erisa broad preemption clause 
in addition to their claims against the fines and php,the plaintiffs allege in their amended complaint that the fines and php committed the torts of fraud,misrepresentation,and concealment,and that php committed the additional tort of conversion.these allegations stem from the failure of the fines to notify the plan beneficiaries of the company declining financial condition,their failure to notify the beneficiaries of the company inability to fund the healthcare plan,the failure of php to make the same type of disclosures,and php actions in extracting from the funds on hand its administrative fee and then transferring to the company both cobra payments that php had received from plan participants and the remaining balance of company funds in the plan account.the defendants maintain that all of these causes of action are preempted by erisa.we agree as to all but the first of the four claims set forth above.
both the supreme court and this court have emphasized the broad scope of erisa expansive provision aetna health,davila,d cromwell hca,cir recognizing that virtually all state law claims relating to an employee benefit plan are preempted by erisa.that provision,which is located at,states that the erisa remedial scheme shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan covered by the statute.see shaw delta air lines,d a law relates to an employee benefit plan,in the normal sense of the phrase,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.
because of the amorphous nature of the phrase relate to,courts have struggled to establish generally applicable rules governing which state laws relate to or have a connection with plans.see,miami valley pension,cir hereinafter poni noting that the supreme court has dealt with the opaque language in erisa preemption clause approximately twenty times over the last years.we will not retrace the extensive history of that caselaw,but will instead summarize the most relevant principles and apply those principles to the facts of the present case.
to determine whether claims relate to a covered plan,this court consider s the kind of relief that plaintiffs seek,and its relation to the pension plan.ramsey
