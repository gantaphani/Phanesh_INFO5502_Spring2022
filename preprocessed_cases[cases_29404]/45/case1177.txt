with this appeal,we decide whether the benefits review board of the department of labor the board erred when it upheld an administrative law judge alj decision to award respondent noah hall benefits under the coal mine health and safety act,as amended by the black lung benefits act of,the act.we also decide whether the benefits review board erred when it found petitioner kentland elkhorn coal corporation kentland to be the responsible operator.
petitioner kentland elkhorn appeals the decision of the board granting respondent noah hall,a coal miner,benefits under the black lung benefits act of.kentland alleges that the evidence did not support hall claim to benefits and that the administrative law judge erred in finding kentland the correct responsible operator.the director,office of workers compensation programs,department of labor director joins this action as a respondent party in interest.
because there was substantial evidence to support the alj determination that hall is totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis black lung disease,we affirm the alj decision on that issue.however,because the evidence was insufficient to conclude that kentland was the responsible operator,we reverse and remand to the benefits review board for proceedings in accordance with this decision.
background 
noah hall was born on june.he worked in coal mining for much of his adult life.hall filed unsuccessful claims for benefits under the black lung benefits act in,and,the last of which the director denied on october.by,hall says he experienced shortness of breath,chest pain,and difficulty walking long distances and climbing stairs.that same year,hall suffered disabling injuries in a rock fall while working for desparado fuels,desparado fuels and has not worked since then.at.
on september,hall again filed for benefits under the black lung benefits act.the director initially denied this claim on january.the director denied benefits at that time because hall did not demonstrate that black lung disease totally disabled him.at.hall appealed the decision.at.on july,the director held an informal conference.in a proposed decision and order,the director found that hall did have black lung disease,that coal mine work caused the disease,that hall timely filed his claim,that hall had worked at least fifteen years in coal mines,that kentland was the responsible operator in the claim,and that hall most recent period of cumulative coal mine employment totaling at least one year was with kentland.the director,however,denied hall claim for benefits because he found that hall did not show total disability,and because hall had not shown a material change since the earlier denial of benefits.at.
on august,hall requested a formal hearing.having received hall request,the department of labor transferred hall claim to the office of administrative law judges for a hearing.on may,administrative law judge,thomas phalen,convened a hearing to review hall claim.
in a september,decision,the alj awarded hall black lung benefits.in that decision the alj found that hall worked in coal mines for fifteen years at,that hall has coal workers pneumoconiosis at,that the pneumoconiosis arose out of hall work as a coal miner at,that hall is totally disabled because of the disease at,and that such a finding of total disability is a material change in conditions from a prior denial of benefits under d at.the alj also found that kentland was the responsible operator at.in selecting kentland as the responsible operator,the alj found that hall more recent employers,desparado and coleman coleman mining company,coleman,were not responsible because they employed hall for less than a cumulative year.at.
kentland appealed the alj decision to the benefits review board.the board affirmed the alj decision designating kentland as the responsible operator and finding hall entitled to black lung benefits.at.kentland now appeals to this court.
ii.standard of review 
this court must affirm the board decision if the board has not committed any legal error or exceeded its scope of review of the alj determination.see glen coal seals,cir.the court reviews the alj decision only to decide whether substantial evidence supports it,and whether it is in accordance with the applicable law.see id.we do not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the alj.see gray slc coal,cir.thus,as long as the evidence supports the alj conclusions,the court will not reverse the alj decision,even if the facts permit an alternative conclusion.youghiogheny ohio coal webb,cir.
we review issues of law de novo.see creek coal bates,cir.
petitioner kentland raises two issues on appeal.first,kentland claims that the alj erred in finding hall totally disabled because of black lung disease.second,kentland claims that the alj erred in finding kentland to be the responsible operator.
iii.discussion 
total disability due to black lung disease 
hall filed his present claim in,more than one year after the final denial of an earlier claim in.hall present claim is,therefore,a duplicate of an earlier claim rather than a request for modification.according to d,if the earlier claim has been finally denied,the later claim shall also be denied,on the grounds of the prior denial,unless there has been a material change in conditions to find that a material change in condition has occurred,the alj 
must consider all of the new evidence,favorable and unfavorable,and determine whether the miner has proven at least one of the elements of entitlement previously adjudicated against him.if the miner establishes the existence of that element,he has demonstrated,as a matter of law,a material change.then the alj must consider whether all of the record evidence,including that submitted with the previous claims,supports a finding of entitlement to benefits.
sharondale ross,cir.the alj conclusion that hall is now totally disabled because of black lung disease established a material change in condition.
on appeal,kentland challenges only whether hall is totally disabled.it does not challenge that hall suffers from black lung disease,that his disease arose from mining employment,or that the total disability is the result of black lung disease.we accordingly limit our review to the question of whether substantial evidence supports the alj finding that hall is totally disabled because of black lung disease.
section defines total disability.see b.to show total disability,a miner must show that his disease prevents him from performing his usual coal mine work,and prevents him f rom engaging in gainful employment in the immediate area of his residence requiring the skills or abilities comparable to those of any employment in mine or mines in which he previously engaged with some regularity over a substantial period of time.b i,ii.the regulations then list a series of five medical criteria under b that can establish a miner total disability.
the alj found that hall had shown himself totally disabled under b iv by showing that a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment,based on medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques,concludes that a miner respiratory or pulmonary condition prevents the miner from engaging in employment as described in paragraph b of this section.at.
in making this determination,the alj considered four doctors evaluations of hall.at.in choosing which evaluations were more credible,the alj recognized that by finding a material change in condition,the alj was required to consider all of the evidence of record.in considering such evidence,the alj determined that because black lung is a progressive and irreversible disease,it is appropriate to accord greater weight to the most recent evidence of record,especially where a significant amount of time separates the newer from the older evidence.at.accordingly,the alj focused on the evaluations performed by sibu saha,mann younes,ayesha sikder,and gregory fino.at.
saha conducted a biopsy of hall lung and found a pleural nodule in august.the discharge diagnosis of hall showed anthracosilicosis of the left lung and tobacco abuse.at.
younes examined hall on october.he diagnosed hall with coal workers pneumoconiosis,causally related to occupational dust exposure,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and chronic bronchitis.he traced the second and third ailments primarily to cigarette smoking and secondarily to coal dust exposure.at.on one part of the evaluation form,younes stated that hall had a moderate obstructive impairment which may interfere with last coal mining job.at.but younes also said that hall impairment rendered hall totally disabled from coal mining employment.at.the doctor also noted that hall impairment is primarily caused by smoking tobacco but occupational dust exposure may also be a contributing factor.at.
sikder began treating hall in.in her january examination of hall,sikder concluded that hall had black lung disease based on coal dust exposure and chest x rays that revealed fibrotic lung disease.sikder concluded that silica and coal dust exposure caused the disease and rendered hall totally disabled and thus unable to work at.
kentland argues that the alj should have relied upon fino and should have discounted the opinions of sikder,younes,and saha.fino examined hall on june.he did a chest x ray,a pulmonary function test,and an arterial blood gas study.fino gave the opinion that hall had black lung disease,that the breathing obstruction was related to smoking,but that the degree of obstruction can not be assessed since hall did not give a maximum effort.at.he concluded that t here is no evidence that the obstruction is of significant degree to prevent hall from returning to his last job or a job requiring similar effort.at.
the alj found that the opinions of saha,younes,and sikder outweighed the opinion of fino.the alj found fino evidence to be equivocal and vague.particularly troubling to the alj was that fino could not sufficiently determine the level of obstruction of hall lungs,yet he still concluded that hall could do his previous coal mine work.at.in contrast,the alj noted that younes and sikder had both done a thorough examination of hall and indicated that he was completely unable to do mining work.at.combined with the fact that hall previous work in the coal mines required heavy exertion and exposure to large amounts of dust at,the alj concluded that hall was totally disabled as b defines that term.
beyond proving that he is totally disabled,hall must also show that the black lung disease is a substantially contributing cause of the totally disabling impairment to receive benefits under the black lung benefits act.see c.we have held that black lung disease need not cause the totally disabling impairment solely,but the impairment must be due at least in part to black lung disease.adams director,owcp,cir.
the alj found that the opinions of younes and sikder were sufficient to find that hall impairment was either primarily or secondarily related to his exposure to coal dust.the alj found this despite the fact that hall cigarette smoking may have also been a contributing factor.at.
in this appeal,kentland essentially argues that the alj did not give adequate weight to fino medical opinion.we reject this argument.as stated previously,we are not called upon to reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the alj.see gray,at.we review only whether the alj evaluation was unreasonable or not according to law.the alj found the opinions of saha,younes,and sikder more credible than fino opinion.we find that the alj evaluation of the record evidence was reasonable and in accordance with the law,and that the alj based the evaluation upon substantial evidence in the record.we therefore find that substantial evidence supports hall eligibility for black lung benefits.
responsible operator 
having decided that hall is entitled to benefits,we must now decide who is responsible for paying these benefits.the act puts the burden of payment on employers.see.if no employer is found liable,the payment obligation falls to the black lung disability trust fund.see.
federal regulations create a framework in which to decide the employer responsible for payment of a miner black lung benefits.the responsible operator is the employer with which the miner had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year.a see also cornett benham coal,cir.
section b outlines the method for determining the responsible operator.that section states 
from the evidence presented,the identity of the operator or other employer with which the miner had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year and,to the extent evidence permits,the beginning and ending dates of such periods,shall be ascertained.for purposes of this section,a year of employment means a period of year,or partial periods totaling year,during which the miner was regularly employed in or around a coal mine by the operator or other employer.regular employment may be established on the basis of any evidence presented,including the testimony of the claimant or other witnesses,and shall not be contingent upon a finding of a specific number of days of employment within a given period.however,if an operator or other employer proves that the miner was not employed by it for a period of at least working days,such operator or other employer shall be determined to have established that the miner was not regularly employed for a cumulative year by such operator or employer for the purposes of paragraph a of this section.a working day means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner.
in an attempt to make sense of what is arguably an opaque regulation,the third circuit stated 
as a practical matter,the employment requirement sets a floor for the operator connection with the miner,below which the operator can not be held responsible for the payment of benefits.the limit relates to the minimum amount of time the miner may have been exposed to coal dust while in employment by the operator.
director,office of workers comp.programs gardner,
the parties do not dispute that hall worked at kentland for three years,from to.unless some later operator employed hall for at least one year,kentland is the responsible operator.kentland objects to the alj determination that it was the responsible operator on three grounds.first,it argues that the alj failed accurately to calculate the time that hall worked at another mining company,desparado fuels,because the alj did not include the time that hall was on disability leave after an injury at desparado fuels.second,kentland argues that another mine,coleman,along with its alleged successor grassy creek energies,grassy creek,employed hall for more than one year.finally,kentland argues the alj applied the wrong legal standard regarding who bore the burden of finding all potentially responsible operators.kentland says the alj wrongly placed that burden upon it instead of upon the director.
we review the factual record to decide whether substantial evidence supports the alj decision that kentland is the responsible operator.see gray,at.we review issues of law de novo.see bates,at.
desparado fuels 
hall worked at desparado fuels from march,to july.he was injured on the job in a rock fall,and he drew disability benefits from july,until june.the question with regard to desparado fuels is whether the term of regular employment includes both the time hall received wages from desparado fuels and the time he received disability payments.see b.
kentland relies upon boyd island creek coal,black lung,a benefits review board case.in boyd,a claimant worked for ten and months,was intermittently on leave for a back injury,but accrued an additional fifty days of work from the time he injured his back to the time he finally resigned.the board found that island creek coal was the responsible operator and that island creek coal could not escape liability by failing to count the down time from the claimant injury to his final resignation.
the alj distinguished boyd,stating that in boyd,the miner continued to work for the employer after the work injury and was kept on the payroll during the time he was injured this time culminated in a continuous year of employment.at.hall,on the other hand,quit working for desparado fuels after his injury,and thus did not remain on the payroll for even days,let alone the year required by b.
kentland argues that no evidence shows desparado fuels took hall off the payroll after his injury,only that desparado fuels did not have a time sheet for hall physical presence after his injury.this is wrong.the bookkeeper for desparado fuels submitted evidence showing that hall was not on the payroll for the required period.at.speculation as to whether hall remained on the payroll is not evidence that he was on the payroll.furthermore,even if hall had worked in the mines every day during the period in which he was on the payroll at desparado fuels,from march,to july,those dates would only equal less than the required days under b.
additionally,the regulations require that the miner work for an employer for a period of a year,with the miner receiving pay for at least days of that period for work as a miner.b stating that if the miner was not employed for a period of at least working days,such operator or employer shall be determined to have established that the miner was not regularly employed for a cumulative year,and further stating that a working day means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner.
it strains the plain language of the regulation to assert that the disability benefits desparado fuels paid to hall were pay for work as a miner.see gardner,at the limit relates to the minimum amount of time the miner may have been exposed to coal dust while in employment by that operator.
desparado fuels,therefore,can not be the responsible operator because it did not employ hall for the minimum amount of time the regulations require.
coleman coleman and grassy creek energies 
kentland next argues that hall worked for two companies,coleman and grassy creek,after his employment with kentland.kentland argues that the alj erred in not finding a relationship between the two companies.if such a relationship is found,kentland says the alj should have aggregated the time hall worked for each.
the director and hall concede that hall began working for coleman on september,but neither knew his length of employment.at.the director and hall also concede that hall worked for grassy creek from july or,to july.at.therefore,we decide whether it was rational to conclude that coleman and grassy creek were not in a relationship,but if they were,whether the time hall spent at both companies should be aggregated 
section i of the united states code outlines the liability of subsequent operators.it states that 
during any period in which this section is applicable to the operator of a coal mine who on or after january,acquired such mine or substantially all the assets thereof,from a person hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a prior operator who was an operator of such mine,or owner of such assets on or after january,such operator shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of all benefits which would have been payable by the prior operator under this section with respect to miners previously employed by such prior operator as if the acquisition had not occurred and the prior operator had continued to be an operator of a coal mine.
nothing in this subsection shall relieve any prior operator of any liability under this section.
the act further states that corporate reorganizations and liquidations qualify as such a relationship.it places the burden to pay benefits on the successor operator if such successor operator purchases substantially all of the prior operator assets,or if a prior operator ceases to exist as the result of a merger,consolidation,or division.i a d.
the code of federal regulations discusses the motive of the statute,explaining that 
the stated congressional objective supporting i is to prevent a coal operator from circumventing liability under this part by entering into corporate or other business transactions which make the assessment of liability against that operator a financial or legal impossibility.accordingly,a prior operator which transfers a mine or mines or substantially all the assets thereof,shall remain primarily liable for the payment of benefits under this part and if the prior operator can not meet the requisite financial conditions the successor operator shall,if appropriate,be liable for the payment of such benefits.
the alj found that coleman and grassy creek were not in a relationship,and therefore kentland was the appropriate responsible operator.at.we reverse the alj decision only if substantial evidence does not support the conclusion or the conclusion is not in accordance with the law.see youghiogheny,at.here,substantial evidence does not support the alj conclusion that coleman and grassy creek were not in a relationship.rather,the preponderance of the evidence supports the contrary.
brent coleman,one of the three incorporators of coleman coleman,was also the sole incorporator of grassy creek.at.similarly,brent coleman was a director of coleman coleman and the sole director of grassy creek.at.grassy creek bookkeeper supplied information regarding hall periods of employment with both companies.at.she worked out of the same office for both coleman coleman and grassy creek.at.roger coleman,an incorporator and director of coleman coleman,signed an affidavit in as custodian of grassy creek records.at.hall testified twice that coleman coleman and grassy creek had the same owners but different mine sites.at.hall also testified that when they finished mining one site,the employees would move the equipment to another mine and operate it under a different name at.
the alj dismissed this evidence in one sentence,stating that there was no evidence regarding a mine acquisition or a transfer of assets.at.it seems apparent,however,that moving all of the equipment from one mine to another mine,and operating it under a different name or corporate structure,would qualify as a transfer of assets,even if there were no written purchase agreement or other documentation facilitating the transfer.this and other record evidence shows that the preponderance of the evidence likely establishes that grassy creek was a successor to coleman.
a preponderance of the evidence likely supports a finding that coleman and grassy creek were in a relationship.therefore,if the aggregated time hall worked for each company totaled one year,then grassy creek,and not kentland,would be the proper responsible operator.see,c k coal taylor,cir aggregating the time a miner worked for the predecessor and successor companies to determine whether his employment exceeded the requirement 
hall worked for grassy creek from july or,to july,just under a year.at.hall does not know how long he worked for coleman.his social security statement of earnings shows that he worked for coleman for periods of time in and.in,hall earned from coleman,and in,he earned.his earnings from coleman indicate that if his time with coleman and grassy creek were aggregated,it would total over a year.
because substantial evidence does not support the alj conclusion regarding the relationship of coleman and grassy creek,the evidence also does not support a finding that kentland is the proper responsible operator kentland could only be liable as a responsible operator if no other subsequent operators employed hall for a year or more.the evidence is not substantial enough to support a finding that grassy creek can not be held responsible.instead,the evidence indicates that grassy creek is likely the operator with which hall had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year a.we do not,however,remand this case to name a new responsible operator or for further inquiry as to whether kentland is in fact the proper responsible operator.
the regulations require that the director identify,notify,and develop evidence regarding potential responsible operators.see b.when the director has failed to develop this evidence adequately or has failed to resolve the responsible operator issue at a preliminary stage of the case,courts have refused to remand the case for further proceedings regarding the respo
