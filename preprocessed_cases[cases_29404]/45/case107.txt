the defendants,rafael rivera and isabel hurtado,husband and wife,appeal from i the entry of summary judgment against them,ii the denial of their for summary judgment,and iii the denial of a motion in the final analysis,the appeals turn on the proper handling of for summary judgment.concluding,as we do,that the district court abused its discretion by applying materially different procedural requirements to the two motions,we wipe the slate clean.on unrelated grounds,we vacate the order.the district court must revisit these matters anew.
background 
these appeals arise out of a massive civil action commenced in puerto rico federal district court by nine insurance companies against hundreds of defendants under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.the complaint posited that the defendants had engaged in a scheme to defraud the insurers by submitting false automobile insurance claims in violation of both rico and a puerto rico statute,laws ann.tit.we limit our discussion to the claims against the appellants rivera,hurtado,and their conjugal partnership.the appellees are five of the plaintiffs below,namely,puerto rico american insurance company praico,national insurance company,universal insurance company,caribbean alliance insurance company caico,and cooperativa de seguros múltiples de puerto rico 
the operative pleading for present purposes is the second amended complaint,which added rivera,hurtado,and their conjugal partnership as defendants.the complaint alleged that rivera participated in a number of fraudulent claims,both as an attorney representing claimants and as a claimant himself.the complaint further alleged that hurtado took part in the swindle as a claimant.
the case proceeded through discovery.one ruling is pertinent to these appeals.we sketch the circumstances relevant to this ruling.
during discovery,the appellants requested that the insurers make certain admissions.see.a.receiving no responses within the allotted time,the appellants moved for an order deeming admitted the matters delineated in their requests.the district court denied the motion and extended the time for responding.the insurers served their responses within this extended period.the appellants objected,asserting that the matters set forth in the requests should be deemed admitted because the responses did not comply with rule.
the objection lay fallow for slightly more than three years.at that point the district court,treating the objection as a motion denied it on the ground that the appellants had failed to include the required certification.see b providing that a district court shall not consider any discovery motion that is not accompanied by a certification that the moving party has made a reasonable and effort to reach an agreement with opposing counsel on the matters set forth in the motion.
during the protracted period in which the parties were squabbling over the requests for admission,the summary judgment issues were starting to crystallize.the district court had set a deadline of february,for the filing of dispositive motions.on february,the insurers filed a motion for partial summary judgment they supported their motion with a separate statement of uncontested facts suf and a series of affidavits.the motion sought to impose liability on the appellants under sections c and d of rico.
one day later and within the period prescribed by the district court,the appellants filed a for summary judgment,supported by a separate suf.this sought the dismissal of all claims against them.on march,the insurers filed a timely opposition,but did not respond to the appellants suf.in their opposition,the insurers mentioned that,on february,rivera had pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with conspiring to devise a scheme to defraud insurance companies in violation of.the insurers attached the information and plea agreement to their opposition.
on april,the appellants filed an opposition to the insurers summary judgment motion,supported by a separate response to the insurers suf.
on june,the district court addressed the insurers motion for summary judgment.the court granted that motion in part and denied it in part in its opinion,the court held that the insurers suf was proper in form,appropriately supported by affidavits,and compliant in all other respects with the requirements of the local rules.am.ins.burgos praico i,slip op.at june,unpublished citing.the court also held that the appellants opposition failed to comply with the local rules and,accordingly,deemed admitted the facts set out in the insurers suf.id.at citing e.based on this ruling the court concluded,as a matter of undisputed fact,that rivera had filed fraudulent insurance claims,both as an attorney representing other claimants and to his own behoof,with praico,cooperativa,national,caico,and universal.id.similarly,the court concluded,as a matter of undisputed fact,that rivera and hurtado had jointly filed a false claim with national.id.at.moving to damages,the court concluded,as a matter of undisputed fact,that the insurers had paid these bogus claims,resulting in specific monetary losses.id.at.with these determinations in place,the court held that the summary judgment record satisfied the requirements for liability under rico c,id.at,and proceeded to award treble damages in the insurers favor.id.citing c.the court entered a partial judgment against the appellants in these amounts.
in a separate opinion,issued more than a month later,the district court granted in part and denied in part the appellants for summary judgment.the court noted that the appellants suf complied with the local rules and that the insurers had neglected to file the separate response to the suf required by those rules.am.ins.burgos praico ii,slip op.at july,unpublished.based on this deficiency,the court deemed admitted some of the facts limned in the appellants suf.id.but the court stopped short of deeming all the facts admitted rather,it concluded that,despite the insurers failure to file a,it would not deem admitted any facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier partial judgment rested.id.
this truncated view of the record led the district court to deny the with respect to the claims asserted against the appellants by praico,cooperativa,national,caico,and universal.id.the court exonerated the appellants with respect to other claims.see id.at see also supra note.this included a determination that hurtado had not submitted false claims to praico,universal,or cooperativa.praico ii,slip op.at.the court thereupon entered another partial judgment.
on august,the district court entered a final judgment we have jurisdiction over the ensuing appeals pursuant to.
ii.analysis 
before us,the appellants asseverate that the district court abused its discretion in disregarding their opposition to the suf that accompanied the insurers motion for summary judgment that,in all events,the lower court treated them unfairly by applying materially different standards to the adjudication of the two motions for summary judgment and that the court erred in its final ruling concerning their requests for admission we discuss the first two assignments of error together and then move to the third.
summary judgment practice.
when passing upon a motion for summary judgment,a district court must take the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom to that party behoof.cabán hernández philip morris usa,f d,cir.this standard operates in conjunction with a district court local rule.when the district court,acting in pursuance of an rule,deems admitted facts contained in the movant suf,those facts are considered not properly controverted,but the district court must still apply the standard articulated in federal rule of civil procedure.in such circumstances,we review the district court deeming order for abuse of discretion.cmi capital mkt,llc,cir.this entails a special degree of deference to the court interpretation of its own local rules.crowley bean,cir quoting in re jarvis,cir.apart from any judgment calls concerning the application of the local rule,the ultimate decision to grant summary judgment is reviewed de novo.cabán hernández,at.
local rule of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico is such an rule.it requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit a separate,short,and concise statement of material facts,set forth in numbered paragraphs,as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact.b.each fact must be supported by a citation to a specific paragraph or page of the summary judgment record.e.
a party opposing a motion for summary judgment must submit a,which shall admit,deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement of material facts and unless a fact is admitted,shall support each denial or qualification by a record citation.c.properly supported facts contained in an suf shall be deemed admitted unless controverted in the manner prescribed by the local rule.e.
in this case,the appellants first line of argument is that the district court should not have deemed admitted the facts set forth in the insurers suf.the mainstay of this argument is that their opposition to the suf complied with local rule.in this regard,they stress that their opposing statement addressed all of the suf declared facts in the order in which they appeared.
this argument is disingenuous.even a cursory glance at the opposition reveals that the appellants wholly failed to admit,deny or qualify the facts by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party statement of material facts.c.this is starkly evident from a comparison of the suf and the opposition.although the suf contains numbered paragraphs of facts,the opposition nowhere matches up with,or even references,these numbered paragraphs.rather,it comprises numbered paragraphs,divided into five,separately numbered sections,and repeatedly lumps responses to several separately declared facts into a single sentence.
the appellants counter that any failure of compliance was technical and,therefore,harmless.this ipse dixit overlooks the root purpose of an rule.this type of rule is aimed at enabling a district court to adjudicate a summary judgment motion without endless rummaging through a plethoric record.see cmi capital mkt,at principi,cir dep t of homeland,cir.given this root purpose,we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that parties ignore the strictures of an rule at their peril.see,ruiz rivera riley,cir.
we add,moreover,that it is primarily the role of the district court to determine what departures from a local rule may be tolerated.united states,cir.here,the district court concluded that the appellants failure to comply with local rule was material.this conclusion makes sense had the district court overlooked the appellants noncompliance,it would have had to comb through the opposition in an effort to match the appellants responses to the facts set forth in the insurers suf.only then could the court have determined which facts were genuinely controverted and which were not.this is exactly the sort of archeological dig that rules are designed to prevent.
the appellants have a fallback position.they contend that because they incorporated by reference in their opposition to the insurers motion their own suf which was attached to their for summary judgment,they made clear their version of the facts.they strive to persuade us that this incorporation by reference constituted substantial compliance with local rule.we are not convinced.
as indicated above,local rule serves the important purpose of prevent ing parties from shifting to the district court the burden of sifting through the inevitable mountain of information generated by discovery in search of relevant material,at.the appellants suf did not address,paragraph by paragraph or statement by statement,the insurers suf.even if the district court could have gleaned the parties positions by independent analysis of the two documents,that was not the court job.a party can not circumvent the requirements imposed by an rule simply by filing a for summary judgment and expecting the district court to do the party homework.
nevertheless,the appellants is significant in another respect.the district court determined that the appellants suf,which accompanied the,complied with local rule.praico ii,slip op.at.the court also determined that the insurers had failed to proffer the required by that rule.id.the court acknowledged that,given this noncompliance,it ought to deem admitted the facts contained in the appellants suf.see see also e.but the court nonetheless declined to deem admitted those facts that contradicted the facts on which its earlier summary judgment order rested.praico ii,slip.op.at.that led the court to deny the appellants motion for summary judgment against the five insurers in whose favor the earlier order ran the appellees here.
the appellants argue that the court treated the two sufs differently.this is undeniably so.the appellants add that this approach unfairly gave preference to the facts set forth in the insurers suf merely because the court happened to decide the insurers motion first.this differential treatment,they say,constituted an abuse of discretion.we agree.
to be sure,a district court has broad discretion in the administration and enforcement of its own local rules,at.but this discretion is not unbridled.id.rules must be administered evenhandedly and applied consistently.to deviate from a local rule,the court must have a sound reason for doing so,and must ensure that no party substantial rights are unfairly jeopardized.accord law envtl.consultants,cir.fundamental fairness is the mainstay of this paradigm.see wight bankamerica,cir.
in the case at hand,the district court faced a it was a dilemma of the court own making the court could have considered both motions for summary judgment at the same time.for some unexplained reason,it eschewed that course.thus,at the time it took up the appellants motion,the court realized that following the local rule and deeming admitted all the facts contained in the appellants suf would require it to deem admitted facts that were in open contradiction to the facts upon which the earlier summary judgment rested.that,in turn,would result in the entry of a judgment that directly conflicted with the earlier judgment.
the prospect of this bizarre result sent up a red flag.it counselled in favor of a careful review of the available options and a balancing of the equities.here,however,the court warded off the potential conflict by giving one set of litigants the insurers a largesse that it withheld from the other set of litigants the appellants.to be specific,the court,having strictly enforced local rule against the appellants in connection with the insurers summary judgment motion,excused the insurers from compliance with that rule in connection with the appellants summary judgment motion.
because the inconsistency is court held opposing parties to materially different standards in the application and enforcement of a local inquiry reduces to whether the court had good cause to justify the differential treatment.see,at.in mounting such an inquiry,context is important.here,the district court reasoned that the appellants could not be allowed to cure defects in their opposition to the insurers summary judgment motion by filing their own.praico ii,slip op.at.this reasoning is valid in the abstract,but the court attempt to use it here does not withstand scrutiny.
this is not a situation in which a party tried to rectify its noncompliance with the local rule by filing a for summary judgment after the time had run for opposing a summary judgment motion.by contrast,both sides in this case filed motions for summary judgment within the same time motions were filed a day apart,and both were filed within the period prescribed by the district court for the service of dispositive motions.thus,the timing is a.on these facts,where neither side properly contested the other suf in the manner prescribed by local rule,strictly enforcing the local rule against one party while excusing the other party noncompliance can not be countenanced.
