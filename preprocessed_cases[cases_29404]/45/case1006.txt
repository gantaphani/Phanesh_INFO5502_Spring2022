a corporation elected to self insure under texas workers compensation laws.as part of its from the protections of workers compensation,the company purchased from lloyd,london insurance upon the life of its employees,payable to itself.an employee was fatally injured in the course of work,and her representative obtained a substantial sum in settlement of a claim that the death was caused by the company negligence.lloyd paid the policy proceeds to the corporation.the representative of the deceased employee later learned of the life insurance and filed this suit against lloyd,seeking the policy proceeds.
this is a diversity case and we apply the texas law of insurable interest,ultimately affirming summary judgment in favor of lloyd,london.we conclude that under texas law lloyd was obligated to pay the proceeds of the policy and discharged its obligation by paying the proceeds to the named beneficiary.we also conclude that the named beneficiary,lacking an insurable interest,held the proceeds in trust for the benefit of the estate of the insured employees.
in,national convenience stores,purchased an accidental death insurance policy from certain underwriters at lloyd,london through its broker,ronald seaborg and his company,international accident facilities,the policy provided benefits of for each insured person,defined as the officers and employees of ncs.the proceeds were payable to ncs upon the accidental death of any texas ncs employee that occurred within the scope and course of employment.
melissa morales worked for ncs as a clerk in one of its convenience stores.on april,a robber stabbed morales to death at her store.on july,lloyd paid the policy proceeds to ncs.
alma deleon,the administrator of morales estate,filed suit against ncs in texas state court.within six months ncs settled with deleon,paying to the estate in exchange for a comprehensive release from liability.ncs did not disclose the existence of its policy with lloyd.only after settling with ncs did deleon learn of ncs policy with lloyd.
on september,deleon filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of texas against lloyd and seaborg,seeking to recover the policy benefits.jurisdiction rested on diversity of citizenship.seaborg and lloyd each filed a complaint,claiming over against ncs.the court stayed the action pending resolution of tamez certain underwriters at lloyd,london a case in state court involving virtually the same defendants and similar facts.when the tamez case was decided,the district court lifted the stay.
after various amended complaints,and,deleon decided not to pursue an action against ncs.lloyd,in turn,decided not to pursue its against ncs.in short,lloyd became the only defendant.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lloyd,and deleon appeals that judgment.
deleon contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her breach of contract claim we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law the court must accept the evidence of the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that party in this diversity action,we review de novo the district court interpretation of state law 
deleon first contends that lloyd is collaterally estopped from arguing that ncs was the lawful beneficiary of the policy.she argues that tamez is binding upon this court.a federal court must accord a judgment the preclusive effect it would enjoy under the law of the state in which the judgment was rendered under texas law,the party seeking to invoke collateral estoppel must establish that the facts sought to be tried in the second action were fully and fairly tried in the earlier suit those facts were essential to the judgment in the first suit and the parties were cast as adversaries in the first suit although deleon was not a party in tamez,she may still assert offensive,collateral estoppel.texas recognizes this variant of collateral estoppel,provided that the party against whom collateral estoppel is now asserted was either a party or in privity with a party in the first suit lloyd was a party in the tamez case.
in tamez,the families of two deceased ncs employees sued lloyd,ncs,and seaborg for benefits from the same lloyd coverage at issue here.the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and granted the defendants motions for summary judgment the texas court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part,finding that ncs lacked an insurable interest in the lives of its employees under texas common law and that ncs was not a proper beneficiary under article of the texas insurance code these findings were essential to its partial reversal of the summary judgment order and,according to the record,they were fully and fairly litigated.
the court also implicitly found that the estates of the deceased employees were proper beneficiaries under article.issues decided implicitly in a prior judgment have collateral estoppel effect if they were essential to that judgment the provision of the texas insurance code at issue in tamez and here requires payment to the person insured,his designated beneficiaries,or his estate the tamez court found that ncs employees were the persons insured under the policy,that the deceased employees could not designate beneficiaries,and that ncs was not the proper beneficiary of the policy implicit in the court opinion,therefore,was the conclusion that the estates of the deceased employees were proper beneficiaries,a finding necessary to the judgment of the tamez court.
lloyd argues that tamez lacks preclusive bite for two reasons.first,that the tamez decision was not a final judgment.second,that deleon wait and see attitude ought to bar resort to this equitable doctrine.both arguments lack merit.
the test for finality here is whether the conclusion in question is procedurally definite.courts are to consider whether the parties were fully heard,whether the court supported its decision with a reasoned opinion and whether the decision was subject to appeal or was in fact reviewed on appeal.
the two holdings urged to be transportable are that ncs lacked an insurable interest in the lives of its employees,and that the estates of the deceased employees are proper beneficiaries under the policy.there is no indication that the parties in tamez failed to receive a full hearing on these issues.the court analysis of the merits of these questions was also thorough and reasoned.its judgment has the same conclusive effect on the parties as the final judgment of a lower court the disputed findings were undoubtedly the last word of the tamez court on these matters lloyd first argument fails.
lloyd second argument is that courts are reluctant to apply offensive collateral estoppel where the plaintiff adopts a wait and see attitude,in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment the difficulty here is that the theory has no factual legs.lloyd points to no specific dilatory tactics on the part of deleon.indeed,the district court stayed this case pending resolution of tamez.
we conclude that lloyd is collaterally estopped from trying again whether ncs has an insurable interest in the lives of its employees,and the estates of the deceased employees of ncs are proper beneficiaries of the policy.as deleon is a deceased employee of ncs,she is a proper beneficiary of the policy.
deleon makes one additional argument based on tamez.she notes that the tamez court found in favor of the plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim,that lloyd was obligated to pay them directly,in reversing the trial court summary judgment in favor of lloyd we disagree.as we read it,this essential holding was only a repudiation of the trial court reasoning.the trial court apparently had adopted lloyd argument that plaintiffs stated no claim for breach of contract because the policy was lawful and ncs was the proper beneficiary.a texas court of appeals can not affirm a summary judgment on grounds not argu
