background 
on february,mccord home in holden,massachusetts was destroyed by a fire.mccord sought to recover insurance under the policy issued by horace mann.mccord public adjuster,sadick public insurance adjusters sadick,submitted a statement to horace mann,estimating that the damages caused by the fire were.on november,horace mann sent a letter to mccord,formally denying all coverage or liability under the policy,on the grounds that she,or persons acting at her direction,intentionally set the fire at her home.the letter quoted excerpts from the policy,including the requirement that a disagreement as to the dollar amount of loss be referred to a three member board of referees in accordance with massachusetts law.the letter also referred to a provision of the policy stating that no suit may be brought against horace mann unless all the terms of the policy have been complied with.the letter further stated 
horace mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to the resolution of amount of loss horace mann specifically rejects sadick calculation as being an accurate determination of the amount of loss.accordingly,horace mann specifically reserves all of its rights and defenses with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss as a result of the subject fire.
on december,counsel for mccord sent horace mann a demand letter in accordance with.laws ch.horace mann response,dated december,denied liability and stated 
notwithstanding horace mann denial of coverage to mccord,horace mann specifically reserves all of its rights under the policy and,with regard to resolution of any dispute about the amount of loss caused by the subject fire.horace mann specifically rejects mccord assertion that she sustained in personal property damage and in property damage as a result of the subject fire.
mccord brought an action against horace mann in the massachusetts state court,seeking damages for horace mann refusal to pay her claim under the policy.on february,horace mann,a resident of the state of illinois,removed the case to federal court,pursuant to,alleging diversity jurisdiction under a.in its answer to mccord complaint,horace mann raised mccord fail ure to comply with the condition precedent of reference pursuant to,as one of its affirmative defenses.in its counterclaim against mccord for breach of contract and deceit,horace mann also stated that mccord and horace mann have never reached an agreement as to the amount of loss caused by the subject fire.mccord admitted this statement in her answer to the counterclaim.
on june,horace mann moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to.c.it asserted that the parties had failed to agree on the amount of loss caused by the fire,and that mccord failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding,pursuant to.laws ch,barred her suit.mccord argued in opposition that.laws ch,was inapplicable,because the case was about a complete denial of coverage rather than any disagreement over the amount of loss and horace mann had waived its rights to a reference proceeding.in the alternative,mccord requested a stay of the case pending the outcome of a reference proceeding.
on march,the district court dismissed the case without prejudice,citing mccord failure to have submitted her claim to a reference proceeding prior to commencement of the action.the district court declined to issue a stay,because mccord had not initiated reference proceedings before bringing suit.the court noted it had granted a stay in another case where a reference proceeding had been begun but was not completed by the time the action was filed.see realty travelers cas.sur.of,d.it was not until after the dismissal of her case that mccord requested a reference proceeding with horace mann.we were advised by counsel at oral argument that horace mann refused to participate,citing as a reason the expiration of the statute of limitations set forth in.laws ch.on march,mccord filed a motion to alter or amend judgment under.e,which the district court denied.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review de novo both a district court entry of judgment on the pleadings pursuant to.c and the court allowance of summary judgment pursuant to.rafferty cranston pub.sch,cir.however,the standard governing the allowance of a rule c motion is generally more generous to the nonmovant.judgment on the pleadings under rule c may not be entered unless it appears beyond a doubt that the nonmoving party can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.feliciano state of,cir citations omitted.
on this is such a parties actions during the proceeding will result in converting what begins as a motion under rule c to one for summary judgment under rule.see.c if,on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in rule gulf coast bank trust reder,cir.when this happens,the governing standard becomes that applicable to summary judgment.see id.
here,horace mann rule c motion relied upon evidentiary submissions outside the pleadings,and mccord filed an opposition that appended additional,outside evidentiary materials.there is no indication the district court excluded these materials from its consideration.the motion accordingly converted to one for summary judgment.while a conversion can not take place unless the nonmoving party is given adequate notice of the conversion and a reasonable opportunity to present material made pertinent to such a motion by rule,mccord had constructive notice of the potential conversion and,as noted,responded by attaching outside materials to its opposition.collier city of chicopee,cir 
under rule,the nonmovant has a heavier burden than would be posed by rule c.once the moving party has served a supported motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment,the party opposing the motion must demonstrate,by competent evidence,a genuine issue of a material fact.gulf coast bank,at see garside osco drug,cir.in reviewing a motion for summary judgment,we construe the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and resolve all reasonable inferences in her favor.rosenberg city of everett,cir.
there are two issues on appeal whether mccord failure to submit her claim to a reference proceeding bars her lawsuit pursuant to.laws ch,and whether horace mann waived the reference condition precedent 
both parties rely upon.laws ch,and massachusetts state case law.in so doing,they implicitly agree that massachusetts law governs the policy itself appears to be drafted in accordance with the standard form for massachusetts fire insurance policies as required and set forth in.laws ch.section states in pertinent part 
in case of loss under this policy and a failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of loss,it is mutually agreed that the amount of such loss shall be referred to three disinterested men and such reference,unless waived by the parties,shall be a condition precedent to any right of action in law or equity to recover for such loss 
mccord argues that.laws ch,is not applicable,because there was no dispute as to the amount of loss but only a total denial of coverage by horace mann.according to mccord,horace mann did not state any amount of loss or provide specific criticism of her public adjuster statement.
