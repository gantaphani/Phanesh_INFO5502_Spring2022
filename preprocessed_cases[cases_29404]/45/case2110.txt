in this consolidated appeal,three physicians and four representative organizations appellants appeal the district court order dismissing their complaints against united healthcare and its related entities united.the district court held that the appellants claims were precluded by the judgment in a class action suit based on the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,rico,asserted by physicians against united and other health insurance entities.appellants dispute both the district court subject matter jurisdiction and its substantive decision regarding the claim preclusive effect of the rico class action judgment.we hold that the district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over all of the claims presented,but reverse its order dismissing those claims based on res judicata.
background 
appellants independently brought seven cases against united in various state courts during the years and.appellants,who are healthcare providers or their representative associations,allege that united breached its contracts with them often called provider or subscriber agreements by not paying them the full contracted rate for services rendered to united insureds,in violation of common and statutory law.united removed all of the cases to federal court,asserting the court federal question jurisdiction over matters covered by the employee retirement income security act erisa,a.at the time the cases were filed,another case was pending in the southern district of florida that alleged breaches of contract by various health insurers and a nationwide conspiracy among health insurers,including united,to delay and reduce payment to healthcare providers in violation of various subscriber agreements.see in re managed care,d shane,aff sub nom.shane humana,app x cir unpublished.
the joint judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred each of the cases covered by this consolidated appeal to the southern district of florida after its removal.there,the cases remained on the docket of the court and were stayed until the disposition of the shane litigation,despite appellants efforts to remand the cases to state court.after the court entered judgment in the shane litigation,united moved to dismiss all of the cases underlying this appeal based upon the preclusive effect of shane.appellants opposed the motions and argued that remand would be the proper disposition because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their claims.the court held in favor of united and ordered dismissal of all appellants complaints.
the shane litigation has its own complex procedural history that is exceedingly relevant to the outcome of the present action.in shane,a group of plaintiffs,initially not including the appellants,asserted breach of contract and rico conspiracy claims against a number of health insurers,including united.the plaintiffs in shane included healthcare providers both with and without contracts with the insurers.
an order compelling arbitration of all claims between insurers and providers who had an existing contractual relationship,based on the terms of the subscriber agreements,marked the first major procedural step in the shane litigation.in re managed care,d,modified,d.this order did not apply to the appellants in this case because the plaintiffs in shane had not yet sought class certification.left remaining in the case were the payment claims asserted by providers who had no contractual relationship with the insurers,as well as the rico claims asserted by all of the providers.
the plaintiffs in the shane action next sought class certification for both the remaining payment claims on behalf of the providers and for the rico claims asserted by all of the providers.the district court certified both classes,but this court held that only the rico claims were appropriate for class certification.klay humana,cir.in response,the shane plaintiffs amended their complaint to include only the class action rico claims,on which the district court granted summary judgment in shane,d.there,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of united and held that the class of physicians had failed to produce sufficient evidence that a conspiracy existed amongst the insurers to underpay and otherwise defraud the physicians.id.at.following the disposition in shane,the district court dismissed the underlying cases at issue here,leading to the instant appeal.

iii.discussion 
we confront two primary issues in this appeal whether the claims of the individual and associational appellants are completely preempted by erisa a,a,and thus subject to federal question jurisdiction,and whether the claims pursued by the appellants are sufficiently related to those resolved in the shane litigation so as to preclude their assertion here.we conclude that appellants claims are completely preempted by erisa and thus are subject to federal jurisdiction.those claims are not,however,subject to claim preclusion because they arise from a nucleus of operative fact distinct from those resolved in the shane litigation.
erisa preemption 
section a of erisa creates a civil cause of action for participants and beneficiaries of erisa plans to recover benefits or enforce rights under an erisa plan.a.this section definitively converts an ordinary state common law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the complaint rule.aetna health davila,quoting metro.life ins.taylor.united contends that appellants ostensible state law claims are preempted by erisa because the claims seek enforcement of rights under erisa plans.
the supreme court set out a test for complete preemption under erisa remedies provision in davila.a state law claim is completely preempted by erisa,and therefore removable to federal court,if two conditions are met the claimant must have been able to,at some point in time,bring his claim under erisa a b,and there must be no other independent legal duty that is implicated by a defendant actions.id.at.at.we adopted this framework for erisa preemption analysis in connecticut state dental ass anthem health plans,cir.
whether appellants could have brought their claims under erisa 
the first question posed by davila in assessing complete preemption is whether an individual,at some point in time,could have brought his claim under erisa a b.davila,at.at.under erisa a b,claims pursuant to erisa benefit plans may be brought by a participant or beneficiary.a.in davila,it was clear that the plaintiffs,themselves participants in and beneficiaries under erisa plans,were appropriate parties to enforce rights under the statute.by contrast,h ealthcare providers generally are not considered beneficiaries or participants under erisa and thus lack standing to sue under the statute.hobbs blue cross blue shield of,cir.
healthcare providers may have standing under erisa only when they derivatively assert rights of their patients as beneficiaries of an erisa plan.id.to sue derivatively,the provider must have obtained a written assignment of claims from a patient with standing to sue under erisa.id.in hobbs,we determined that a healthcare provider had no standing to sue when there was no evidence that it received any assignments from its eligible patients.id.at.as a result,we concluded that there was no complete preemption of the provider claims because there was no evidence of derivative standing.id.at.
in connecticut state dental,we addressed the erisa preemption issue in a case related to those on appeal here two dentists and their representative organization sued a health plan administrator for damages relating to the payment contracts between the parties.the dentists claimed that the administrator wrongfully paid them below their contracted rates and refused to make payment on claims for medically necessary services.this court held that the dentists claims were completely preempted by erisa remedies provision,and that the court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims.connecticut state dental,at.
in connecticut state dental,we discussed two types of claims that can be made by providers against insurers those challenging the rate of payment pursuant to the agreement,and those challenging the right to payment under the terms of an erisa beneficiary plan.id.at see also lone star assocs.aetna health,cir pasack valley,local ufcw welfare reimbursement plan,cir.we indicated that a rate of payment challenge does not necessarily implicate an erisa plan,but a challenge to the right to payment under an erisa plan does.connecticut state dental,at.we then examined the dentists complaint and concluded that it challenged both the rate of payment and the right to payment under the erisa plan because it alleged that the administrator both paid them the wrong rate and denied payment altogether for medically necessary services,a coverage determination defined by the beneficiary erisa plan.id.
we next concluded that the complaint presented a hybrid claim,some of which was within erisa and some of which was not.id.at.therefore,to resolve the first prong of the davila test,we evaluated whether the dentists had standing to assert their beneficiaries claims.id.noting that the dentists had in the past submitted claim forms that authorized benefit payments to go to the dentists on the beneficiary behalf,we concluded that these claim forms suffice to show an assignment of benefits by the dentists patients.id.at see also hobbs,at requiring assignment of benefits for complete preemption under erisa.we reasoned that o ur own cases confirm that assignment of the right to payment is enough to create standing.connecticut state dental,at.
in this case,the only remaining question is whether the appellants,at any time,asserted claims on behalf of erisa beneficiaries.united presented evidence of such assignments to the district court.appellants make two principal arguments in an attempt to distinguish their cases from connecticut state dental.first,they contend that their complaints expressly disclaim causes of action under erisa,unlike those in connecticut state dental.second,they contend that the claim forms exhibiting assignments were representative and typical of assignments in connecticut state dental,but the assignment forms presented in this case are anomalous and thus could not confer standing upon them.
both attempted distinctions are unavailing.we emphasize that the first davila prong is satisfied by a showing the plaintiff claim must fall within the scope of erisa and the plaintiff must have standing to sue under erisa.connecticut state dental,at.the appellants first contention attempts to undermine their own standing to sue here.in the midst of disclaiming the assignments of benefits,appellants complaints contend generally that this action does not otherwise seek benefits or other remedies under erisa.but our above analysis indicates that the factual allegations raise precisely the type of erisa determinations that trigger complete preemption and convert the otherwise state law claims into federal claims.
we must then resolve the inherent conflict in a factually pled but simultaneously disclaimed cause of action.appellants attempt to characterize their claims as eluding the scope of erisa itself presents a legal rather than factual conclusion.it is our function,however,to draw legal conclusions from the facts pled.see ashcroft iqbal,t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.
we acknowledge that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint.caterpillar williams.but when the plaintiff chooses to plead a cause of action completely preempted by federal law,the plaintiff is not always master of the forum.in caterpillar,the plaintiffs had at their disposal a set of contracts covered by a collective bargaining agreement and a set of individual employment contracts governed only by state law.the plaintiffs sued only on the individual contracts.the defendant removed their claims to federal court,arguing that the claims were founded on the collective bargaining agreements and were governed exclusively by federal law.id.at.at.
the supreme court held that removal was impermissible.id.at.at.the supreme court recognized that the state law claims were distinct from any potential claims related to the collective bargaining agreements,and reasoned that respondents complaint is not substantially dependent upon interpretation of the agreement.id.at.at.caterpillar demonstrates that plaintiffs may choose to exclusively pursue their state law claims in state court,even against the backdrop of another set of potentially preempted claims.
appellants here have not pursued exclusively state law claims,but instead have cast their pleadings in a way that implicates federal law as well.their claims are substantially dependent upon interpretation of erisa plans.ultimately,we ask whether the physicians and their associations could have brought his claim under erisa a b.davila,at.at emphasis added.our precedent reveals this to be true here.see connecticut state dental,at.
second,nothing in connecticut state dental indicates that the assignment of benefits forms submitted to the court must be typical of those regularly submitted by the providers in order to confer standing.the result in connecticut state dental turned on whether the doctors had standing to pursue any claim asserted against the insurer,not whether the doctors had standing to pursue their average or typical claims against the insurer.here,all of the individual appellants at one time received assignments of benefits from their patients.because their complaints contest the global practices of united and do not identify any specific patient,we must assume that the providers are asserting at least some derivative claims.
whether the conduct implicates a legal duty independent of erisa 
the test in davila is conjunctiveboth conditions must be satisfied for a claim to be completely preempted.after united has demonstrated that appellants claims could have been brought under erisa,it next must show that the claims asserted did not implicate legal duties independent of those imposed by erisa or an erisa plan terms.davila,at.at.because the appellants pled claims based on coverage determinations under erisa plans in addition to claims based on their provider contracts,the legal duty implicated is dependent upon an erisa plan.as both davila factors are met,the coverage claims are completely preempted.this gives a federal court federal question jurisdiction over those claims and supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims.
in connecticut state dental,we concluded that certain claims in the dentists complaints were not predicated on a legal duty independent of erisa.connecticut state dental,at.we reasoned that claims involving only the amount owed based on the rate of payment might not implicate erisa,but the claims that challenged coverage determinations under erisa plans clearly implicated erisa.id.we held that subject matter jurisdiction existed over all of the claims in the complaint because jurisdiction existed over the completely preempted claims and those joined with them.id.
appellants contend that their state law claims,based predominantly on their contracts with united,implicate legal duties independent of erisa because state law,not erisa,defines the contractual obligations of the parties.though this is true in the abstract,the supreme court has indicated that we must evaluate each claim by its actual content.see davila,at.at concluding that texas law imposing standard of care on managed care entities did not impose a duty independent of erisa because interpretation of the terms of erisa benefit plans forms an essential part of the state law claim.here,the content of the claims necessarily requires the court to inquire into aspects of the erisa plans because of the invocation of terms defined under the plans.
consistent with connecticut state dental,at least some of the claims pursued by the appellants implicate legal duties dependent on the interpretation of an erisa plan.these claimsabout wrongfully denied benefits based on determinations of medical necessityrelate directly to the coverage afforded by the erisa plans.many of the other allegations in the complaint,for practices like downcoding and bundling,are based on independent contracts and do not implicate erisa.but,because at least some of the allegations are dependent on erisa,those claims are completely preempted and federal question jurisdiction exists.because appellants claims are completely preempted by erisa,a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over appellants suit.
associational standing 
the representative associations argue that the district court lacked federal jurisdiction over their claims,even if the claims of the individual appellants were completely preempted by erisa.at oral argument,the medical associations argued that under our recent decision in connecticut state dental,they lack standing to pursue their claims in federal court,and their claims therefore can not be completely preempted by erisa in connecticut state dental,we held that the associational plaintiff lacked standing to sue in a representative capacity because it sought damages on behalf of its individual members.connecticut state dental,at.because the associational appellants in this case seek only equitable relief,they have standing to assert claims under erisa.
the supreme court has established a test by which we evaluate associational standing 
a n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.
hunt.state apple adver.comm n.it has long been settled that an organization has standing to sue to redress injuries suffered by its members without a showing of injury to the association itself and without a statute explicitly permitting associational standing.doe stincer,cir.the medical associations admit in their complaints that they seek to vindicate the rights of the associations and their members.they admit that the purposes of the associations encompass ensuring appropriate transactions between providers and insurers.
other circuits have expressly permitted representative entities to sue under erisa through associational standing.see.carpenters welfare fund carpenters welfare fund of,cir.psychiatric soc y green spring health,cir.inst.of,korioth,cir.in connecticut state dental,we held that a medical association lacked standing to sue under erisa because it sought both equitable and legal relief.at.we noted that the adjudication of claims for money damages would require the kinds of individualized proof that run afoul of the third prong for associational standing enunciated in hunt.see also warth seldin.
we hold that the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief made by the medical associations are completely preempted.that the associations members have standing to sue in their own right is unquestioned and is indicated by their individual presence in this consolidated appeal.the allegations within the associations complaints demonstrate the nexus between their organizational purposes and the objects of their claims.the only remaining question is whether their claims would require excessive participation by individual members.it is a question we answered affirmatively in connecticut state dental because of the presence of claims for money damages.at.
in this case,the medical associations seek only declaratory and injunctive relief.in pennsylvania psychiatric society,the third circuit focused its attention on the content of the society challenges in determining whether excessive individual participation would be required,and would thus thwart associational standing.because the society challenged the methods of the managed care organizations,and not specific decisions made by the organizations,its case could be proved by sample testimony.at.the court believed it possible that the society could establish its claims with limited individual participation,and therefore held that associational standing existed,reversing the district court order that dismissed the complaint.id.at.
a review of the medical associations complaints in this case shows that their claims,too,can be litigated with limited individual participation.the medical associations challenge united practicesimproper coding,bundling,downcoding,edits,improper use of guidelines,and poor claims resolution.the relief they seek is an alteration of united methodology,not redress for any specific past decision.because these claims can be proved with the limited participation of organization members,the organization has standing to assert them here and,just as the individual physicians claims implicate erisa plans,the claims of the medical associations are completely preempted by erisa and are properly subject to the jurisdiction of a federal court.
res judicata 
appellants next contest the district court conclusion that their claims are precluded by the judgment in the prior shane litigation.in this circuit,a claim is precluded by the judgment in a prior case when the prior judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction the judgment was final and on the merits both cases involve the same parties or those in privity with them and both cases involve the same causes of action.in re piper aircraft,cir.appellants first contend that the court rendering the shane judgment was not of competent jurisdiction because it could not have heard their arbitrable claims.second,appellants contend that the 
current case is not the same cause of action as the first because it depends on claims and does not depend on the existence of a conspiracy.because we conclude,as discussed below,that the conspiracy and contract claims derive from sufficiently distinct factual sets,we hold that the appellants claims in this case are not barred by claim preclusion.
court of competent jurisdiction 
it is that the general rule against splitting causes of action does not apply when suit is brought in a court that does not have jurisdiction over all of a plaintiff claims.aquatherm.power light,cir.appellants contend that the court in shane lacked jurisdiction over their state law claims because they had to arbitrate those claims pursuant to their contracts with united,and therefore claim preclusion does not apply here.united argues that the arbitrability of a claim does not mean that a federal court lacks jurisdiction over that claim.
most courts considering the issue have concluded that the arbitrability of a claim is not a jurisdictional limitation.see,gabbanelli accordions,gabbanelli,cir noting that an agreement to arbitrate no more deprives the court of jurisdiction than a defense based on any other contractual clause would skirchak dynamics research,cir an agreement to arbitrate does not divest a court of its jurisdiction.in kelly merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,this court considered factual circumstances similar to those presented here and held contrary to the appellants position.cir,abrogated on other grounds by howsam dean witter reynolds.
in kelly,the plaintiff declined to present state law claims to the federal court in the prior action because of the applicability of an arbitration agreement.we held that the plaintiff should have presented them despite the agreement,and that the agreement to arbitrate would not limit the applicability of claim preclusion.id.at.plaintiffs could have asserted the state claims before the district court,which would have had pendent or diversity jurisdiction over the claims.the uncertainty of whether defendant would move to compel arbitration of the state claims did not justify two proceedings.id.
in this case,appellants uncertainty about whether united would move to compel arbitration did not relieve them of the obligation to assert all of their claims in the prior action.the arbitrability of claims is not jurisdictional,and the district court in the shane litigation would have been competent to hear those claims even though i
