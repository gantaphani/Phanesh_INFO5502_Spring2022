the trial judge dismissed this action after sustaining a demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend.william and leslie turner the turners appeal from the judgment,contending the trial court erred in determining a third party libel and slander action did not trigger a potential for coverage or a duty to defend under a rental dwelling insurance policy.we disagree and affirm.
the turners,who are husband and wife,obtained a rental dwelling insurance policy from state farm fire and casualty company state farm for a piece of property they own,located in villa park,california.the turners reside elsewhere.after they were sued for defamation and state farm refused to defend or indemnify,the turners in turn brought suit against state farm under the rental dwelling policy for failure to defend,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and negligence.
the first amended complaint alleged a duty of state farm to defend against the defamation suit based on a series of supposedly connected events that would make even palsgraf recoil the turners,while at home and not at the rental property,had a verbal dispute with each other over new rental terms for tenants of the rental property.the dispute escalated and turner pulled a gun on turner.turner,doubting the gun was loaded,took it away from turner.turner then attempted to slug turner with a stainless steel golf club iron.turner blocked turner so as to sustain blows only to the bottom of his shoe.
a call was placed to the orange county sheriff department.turner told the police turner had a history of mental problems,but never took her medication,and that the police had been called to the home the previous year when the couple was arguing.turner was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon and taken to the orange county women jail.the police report notes that turner was irrational.at the jail turner claimed a male deputy had performed an inappropriate strip search on her before bringing her in.later turner also complained about the search the deputy had performed on his wife.subsequently,the male deputy sheriff filed a lawsuit against both and turner for defamation.
the turners tendered the defense of the deputy action to state farm under the rental dwelling policy,which state farm declined.they then paid to attorneys to defend them in the defamation action.because state farm refused to defend them,the turners paid the deputy to settle his claim.
the court sustained the demurrer to the turners first amended complaint without leave to amend and entered judgment in favor of state farm.the turners then filed their notice of appeal.they contend the trial judge erred in sustaining the demurrer because state farm was under a duty to defend the deputy libel and slander suit against them according to the terms of the rental dwelling policy.
discussionintroduction 
the standard of appellate review where judgment is entered after the sustaining of a demurrer is well established.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blatty new york times cal d.
in ruling on the demurrer,a court must give the operative pleading a reasonable construction,assuming the truth of properly pleaded material facts together with all judicially noticed facts.crowley katleman cal th,d,california alliance for utilities.education city of san diego th,d lacher superior court d.
the turners claim error because the trial court sustained state farm demurrer without leave to amend.while they obviously had amended their pleading at least one time since the demurrer was to the first amended complaint,the turners provide no citation to anything in the record to show they either requested leave to amend again or indicated they could amend again.nor do they provide any indication to this court that they could have pleaded their case more successfully if given an opportunity to do so.thus,we will assume the first amended complaint represents their best pleading.
the insurance policy 
the policy is called a rental dwelling policy.this type of policy is generally similar to,but usually less expensive than,a comprehensive or commercial general liability policy cgl.it is available to landlords who want some but not all of the coverages provided in a standard cgl policy.see cal.liability insurance practice claims and litigation cont.ed.bar,concerning owners,landlords and tenants liability policies.
the language on which the turners rely is contained in two separate sections of the policy.the first,which describes the business liability coverage,provides if a suit is brought against any insured for damages because of personal injury to which this coverage applies,caused by an occurrence,and which arises from the ownership,maintenance,or use of the insured premises,we will.provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice emphasis in original omitted.the second defines personal injury as an injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses libel,slander or defamation of character 
duty to defend 
an insurance company has a duty to defend a lawsuit against its insured if there is a potential for coverage.the insured need only show the underlying claim may fall within the policy coverage.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d.when there is no potential for coverage,there is no duty to defend.buss superior court cal th,d.the turners allegations must be examined to determine if they fall within the coverage of their policy.
the turners imply state farm denied them a defense without ever investigating extrinsic facts to determine whether a disagreement about the rental property instigated their fight.state farm agrees it made no attempt to verify this assertion,but says it made no difference,since it assumed the turners version of the facts to be correct,but found no potential for coverage anyway.we will also assume it is true the turners were arguing about their rental property when the police were called.since there appear to be no other facts the turners claim would have implicated coverage,state farm is correct that it makes no difference that it did not investigate the turners story before it refused to defend.
some case authority must be examined to determine whether the turners are able to show a potential for coverage under their state farm policy.to trigger a duty to defend,there must be a causal connection between the insuring clause of their policy and the slanderous statements.kramer state farm fire casualty th,d.
feurzeig insurance of the west th,d requires consideration here.feurzeig,an officer of a corporation that was insured under a cgl policy,was sued for slander.two men who had previously managed some real estate properties,which were not insured under the policy,alleged that feurzeig slandered them in conversations with lenders,vendors,subcontractors and investors in the properties.coverage under the policy was limited to claims arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of the insured premises.some of the allegedly slanderous remarks were made at the insured premises.the feurzeig court held,since feurzeig remarks were uttered as an officer or director of the insured entity and arose from the use of the insured premises,there was a duty to defend.
in comparing feurzeig with the case before us,we see some glaring differences.we will ignore the different types of policies because the coverage is quite similar.in feurzeig the allegedly slanderous remarks were made at the site of the insured property,and in connection with the insured business.to compare with the turners situation,we see the remarks were not made at the rental property.and while there had been an earlier discussion about the rental property the allegedly slanderous remarks were not a
