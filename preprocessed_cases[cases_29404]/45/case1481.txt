appellants are a collection of related individuals,demolition firms,and environmental remediation firms.appellee,the insurance company of the state of pennsylvania icsp,is a provider of surety bonds.icsp required appellants to enter into two general indemnity agreements in favor of icsp as a condition for icsp to issue a surety bond guaranteeing that one of the appellants,spirco environmental,spirco,would perform a remediation contract.icsp subsequently incurred attorney and expert witness fees defending a claim on the bond.eventually,icsp sought indemnification for these fees from appellants in accordance with the general indemnity agreements.appellants brought the present declaratory judgment action seeking a ruling that they were not liable for icsp fees.in ruling on two separate motions for summary judgment,the district court held that icsp was entitled to receive fees and expenses from appellants and that the amount due was approximately plus pre and interest.we affirm.
background 
in february,spirco,a contractor,entered into a remediation contract with a new jersey property owner to conduct asbestos removal at a new jersey property.spirco was to receive about million under the contract.in order to obtain the contract,the property owner required spirco to post a surety bond,and spirco sought a bond from icsp.as a requirement for issuing the bond,icsp demanded that spirco and the other appellants enter into two separate general indemnity agreements obligating appellants to pay icsp for all loss and expense,including attorney fees,incurred by icsp by reason of having executed any bond.appellants entered into the indemnity agreements,and icsp issued the surety bond at issue in the present case in the amount of million.the remediation contract between spirco and the property owner contained an arbitration clause,and the contract for the bond between icsp and appellants expressly incorporated the remediation contract by reference.
throughout the course of the remediation,a third party inspected and approved spirco work,and the property owner made partial payments based on the third party approval.when spirco believed all work was complete,it demanded payment of the final under the million contract.the property owner had been holding this amount as retainage.the inspector recommended that the property owner pay the final amount.the inspector also reported to the property owner that the site was clean and that spirco had completed asbestos removal according to the scope of work as described in technical project specifications for the contract.
the property owner refused to pay the final,alleging that spirco had not properly performed the remediation.the property owner asserted that spirco failed to remove all asbestos and caused property damage by spreading asbestos to previously uncontaminated areas by using equipment without proper containment.spirco disputed these allegations based on the inspector approval of spirco work.spirco further asserted that any asbestos found by the property owner was not within the scope of spirco work,but rather,was asbestos other workers had dislodged after spirco left the site.spirco asserted specifically that the asbestos came from areas of the building that were not exposed during spirco work.
in july,the property owner submitted a bond claim to icsp demanding that icsp pay for additional remediation services allegedly caused by spirco contamination of the site.icsp refused to pay the claim.
in september,spirco initiated arbitration with the property owner in an attempt to obtain the final contract amount.the property owner asserted a counterclaim against spirco,seeking over million based on lost rental income and additional remediation costs.the property owner sought to add icsp to the arbitration,asserting a claim for over million in compensatory damages.the property owner also sought over million in punitive damages,alleging a bad faith failure to pay the property owner earlier bond claim.
facing a claim that appeared to exceed spirco ability to pay and that,in fact,exceeded the bond limit,icsp eventually elected to participate in the arbitration by hiring outside counsel and retaining a technical expert.initially,icsp resisted participating in the arbitration and argued the bond contained no provision requiring arbitration.the property owner,however,threatened to seek a federal court order compelling arbitration.the property owner noted in a letter to icsp that the bond incorporated the remediation contract by reference and that the arbitration clause,therefore,applied to icsp as held in hoffman deposit of maryland.eventually the property owner agreed to drop the claim for punitive damages and reduce its total demand to million,the amount of the bond limits,plus interest,in exchange for icsp agreement to participate in the arbitration.
icsp counsel and expert attended the arbitration,which entailed days of proceedings spread over a period of months.icsp counsel and expert were present for most of these days,and icsp counsel participated actively on many days,examining and cross examining spirco witnesses and the property owner witnesses.although icsp held several suretyship defenses the primary focus of the arbitration was not on icsp suretyship defenses until after the day of proceedings.
spirco was represented by its own counsel.during the course of arbitration,counsel for spirco sent a letter to icsp questioning icsp motives for participating in the arbitration and complaining about icsp participation.in the same letter,however,counsel for spirco complained that icsp was not mounting a sufficiently vigorous defense,suggested strategies for icsp to employ,and demanded that icsp mount an aggressive defense.icsp responded by letter,offering to let spirco assume sole defense of all claims contingent on appellants posting the million bond limit as collateral to ensure payment of the indemnification obligation in the event appellants,or appellants and icsp,were to lose in the arbitration.appellants did not accept icsp offer to let them assume the entire defense.
the parties eventually submitted the case to the arbitrators who found in favor of spirco and icsp and against the property owner.the arbitrators cited two rationales for finding in favor of icsp.first,the arbitrators held,the finding on the claim against spirco is dispositive against icsp.second,the arbitrators found that the property owner had improperly contracted with a replacement remediation firm and commenced additional work without giving icsp adequate opportunity to respond to the claim,as required under the bond.accordingly,icsp succeeded on its shared defense with spirco as well as on a separate,suretyship defense.in reaching these ultimate conclusions,the arbitrators found that the property owner had permitted contractors working on ductwork,windows,and other items to enter the building after spirco had left.the arbitrators found further that these contractors had exposed and spread previously unexposed asbestos that was not within the scope of work of spirco project.
approximately two years after the arbitrators entered their award,icsp submitted a claim to appellants on the general indemnity agreements seeking reimbursement for approximately in fees that icsp had spent on the retained counsel and expert.appellants refused to pay and eventually brought the present declaratory judgment action after discovery,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the district court interpreted the general indemnity agreements.the district court found that the general indemnity agreements required appellants to pay icsp attorney and expert witness fees.regarding the amount of fees owed to icsp,the district court found that the indemnity agreements required icsp to provide an itemized statement from an officer of icsp swearing to the amount of fees and that the sworn statement would serve as prima facie evidence of the fee amount icsp had not provided such a statement,so the district court denied summary judgment as to the determination of the fee amount.subsequently,icsp provided a statement as required by the indemnity agreements along with other supporting documents beyond what the indemnity agreements required.on a renewed motion for summary judgment,the district court awarded icsp the full amount of its fees plus interest.the district court rejected arguments by appellants that icsp incurred the fees in bad faith,that the fees were unreasonable,and that the delay in submitting the claim for fees caused prejudice and precluded payment.
on appeal,appellants argue they should not be held liable for any of icsp attorney or expert witness fees.appellants argue in the alternative that icsp attorney and expert witness fees were not reasonable,and therefore,even if we affirm the district court judgment as to liability,a remittur or a remand for reconsideration of the fee award is necessary.appellants no longer argue that icsp incurred the attorney and expert witness fees in bad faith or that icsp delay in asserting the claim for indemnification resulted in prejudice that should preclude appellants duty to pay under the general indemnity agreements.
ii.discussion 
regarding the question of liability,appellants argue that the remediation contract,as incorporated within the surety bond,required express consent from all appellants before icsp could join the arbitration or before the property owner could add icsp and claims against icsp to the arbitration.based on this argument,appellants assert that icsp was not a proper party to the arbitration and that we should not view icsp as having incurred attorney and expert witness fees by reason of having executed any bond.appellants also argue that icsp voluntarily participated in the arbitration and that this voluntary act broke the chain of causation connecting the fees to the execution of the bond.
the arguments surrounding appellants consent to icsp participation and the voluntariness of icsp participation in the arbitration are red herrings.as an initial matter,it is not entirely clear that icsp failed to obtain adequate consent because counsel for spirco represented to icsp that there was consent for icsp participation.regardless,the questions before us are not whether we should enforce an arbitration award or whether there was some infirmity with the underlying arbitral process.if those were the questions we faced,it might be necessary to address in detail the issue of appellants consent for including icsp and claims against icsp in the arbitration.the questions we face are whether icsp incurred its attorney and expert witness fees by reason of having executed any bond and whether,based on the methods of proof set forth in the indemnity agreements and the federal rules of civil procedure,summary judgment was appropriate as to the amount of those fees.
we hold that the contract language by reason of having executed any bond is unambiguous and sets forth a simple or causation test.see,pacific ins.eaton vance,cir w e consider the language unambiguous by reason of means because of,black law dictionary ed,and thus necessitates an analysis at least approximating a causation test.appellants cite pacific for the proposition that this causation test is strictly limiting and permits a finding of causation only if execution of the bond was the proximate cause or immediately preceding cause of the liability.pacific,however,does not support appellants position.in fact,we find no authority interpreting the straightforward,causation test in the limited or proximate cause manner appellants advocate.
rather,we agree with the district court that the causation test is sufficiently broad to demonstrate that icsp participation in the arbitration would not have occurred had icsp not executed the bond.appellants presented no evidence tending to suggest any other reason or explanation for icsp participation in the arbitration.further,the potential liability icsp faced could not have existed without icsp execution of the bond with the property owner as obligee.
to the extent appellants argue icsp voluntary participation somehow broke the chain of causation,we disagree.the voluntary or compulsory manner in which icsp joined the arbitration,like the strategies icsp employed during the arbitration and icsp choice of attorney and expert,may bear upon the reasonableness of icsp fees.none of the circumstances surrounding these issues,however,change the fact that icsp would not have been involved in the arbitration but for the execution of the surety bond with the property owner as obligee.
further,icsp entered the arbitration only after the obligee under the bond,the property owner,made a claim on the bond,raised claims for compensatory and punitive damages against icsp,and threatened to seek a federal order compelling arbitration.icsp relied on hoffman fidelity deposit of maryland,in determining that the property owner could compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause of the remediation contract as incorporated into the bond.appellants now argue that a subsequent case debunks this legal theory and demonstrates that icsp could not have been required to arbitrate.see gloucester city bd.of educ.am.arb.ass n.gloucester is of no consequence in the present case,however,because icsp was entitled to rely upon hoffman,which,at the time,appeared to be a correct statement of law.further,even if we were to assume icsp had not been entitled to rely upon hoffman,it still is by no means clear that it would be appropriate to characterize icsp participation in the arbitration as voluntary.at a minimum,icsp faced the potential expense of having to defend a motion to compel.if icsp had succeeded in that effort,icsp faced the risk of having to defend a substantive battle in the courts rather than in the arbitral forum.at any rate,it matters not whether the bond and contract required appellants consent for icsp participation,whether the property owner successfully could have compelled icsp to arbitrate,or whether some of icsp and appellants positions were aligned in the arbitration.under the causation test at issue today,it is clear that icsp would not have participated in the arbitration but for the execution of the bond.
reasonableness of fees 
in the alternative,appellants argue icsp fees were unreasonable because appellants and icsp positions were largely aligned throughout the arbitration such that icsp attorney and expert were redundant or even harmful to the arbitration process.appellants also argue that even if it had been proper for icsp to participate in the arbitration,icsp attorney and expert witness simply spent an excessive amount of time on the case,making their fees unreasonable.
in assessing reasonableness,we first note that the indemnity agreement itself does not contain any language limiting the appellants obligation to pay icsp fees to only those fees that were reasonable.our court and missouri courts,however,generally will infer a reasonableness requirement in all contractual fee provisions as a matter of public policy.see,farmland indus.commodities,cir applying missouri law and affirming a district court grant of attorney fees under a contractual provision where the cited contractual provision did not contain a reasonableness limitation and where the district court had granted attorneys fees that fell within a range that it considered reasonable and equitable kaminsky kaminsky.accordingly,appellants are correct to argue that icsp fees must be limited to those that are reasonable.
appellants argue that questions of fact abound as to the reasonableness and propriety of icsp attorney and expert witness fees and that summary judgment was,therefore,inappropriate.we have repeatedly stated,however,that district courts rather than juries are the authorities as to the reasonableness of attorney fees.as such,fee award determinations generally do not involve jury questions,and we review district courts fee awards under the abuse of discretion standard.see fish cloud state,cir the district court was in the best position to assess the work done by counsel.webner titan distribution,cir state ex rel.chase resorts campbell,granting a writ of prohibition to preclude trial court from holding jury trial on issue of reasonableness of attorney fees as it was for
