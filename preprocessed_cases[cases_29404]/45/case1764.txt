congressmen may write the law,but they are not above the law.former arizona congressman richard renzi learned this lesson the hard way when he was convicted by jury on charges of conspiracy,fraud,extortion,money laundering,making false statements to insurance regulators,and racketeering.now renzi and codefendant james sandlin appeal their convictions and sentences,asserting that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict.renzi further argues that his convictions were predicated on serial violations of his constitutional rights,including violations of his congressional speech or debate clause privilege.we reject their arguments and affirm both convictions and sentences.
the united states brought insurance fraud charges against renzi,public corruption charges against renzi and sandlin,and a racketeering charge against renzi.the evidence showed that renzi,who owned and operated an insurance agency,misappropriated clients insurance premiums to fund his congressional campaign,and lied to insurance regulators and clients to cover his tracks the public corruption charges were based on renzi and sandlin involvement in a conspiracy to extort private businesses to purchase land owned by sandlin in exchange for renzi promise to support favorable federal land exchange legislation.finally,the evidence established that renzi used his insurance business as an enterprise to conduct a pattern of racketeering activity by diverting clients insurance premiums for his personal use,facilitating an extortionate land transfer,and laundering its proceeds.
in the early,renzi owned and operated renzi company r c an insurance agency specializing in obtaining insurance coverage for organizations and crisis pregnancy centers r c obtained group insurance coverage for its clients through brokers who worked on behalf of insurance carriers.r c used two primary brokers north island facilities,which secured insurance coverage through safeco insurance company,and jimcor agency,which secured insurance coverage through both united states liability insurance company and royal surplus lines insurance company.r c collected yearly premiums from its clients and,after keeping a small percentage as a profit,remitted those premiums to the broker.after taking their commission,the broker either north island or jimcor remitted the remainder of the premium to the insurer either safeco,united states liability,or royal surplus.
on december,renzi publicly announced his candidacy for a seat in the united states house of representatives serving arizona first congressional district.the very next day,renzi began diverting cash from r c to fund his congressional campaign.between december and march,renzi transferred over from r c to his rick renzi for congress account.to avoid campaign disclosure regulations,renzi claimed the money as a personal loan to the renzi campaign.but most of the diverted funds were directly traceable to insurance premiums r c had collected from clients 
in april,north island sent r c an invoice for to bind annual safeco coverage for r c clients.r c had already collected the insurance premiums from its clients.but it had funneled those premiums to renzi congressional campaign.because r c no longer had the money,renzi did not allow aly gamble,r c senior underwriter,to pay north island two months later,safeco warned r c that it planned to cancel r c policies for nonpayment.another month passed with no response from r 
in july,safeco began sending cancellation notices to r c clients.with cancellation notices in hand,worried clients began calling r gamble fielded these calls.to respond to client concerns,renzi dictated a letter to gamble,which she sent to clients later that month.the letter stated that,because spiritual counseling was no longer covered under safeco policy,r c had replaced safeco with the jimcor insurance company.the letter promised that clients would experience no lapse in coverage.attached to each letter was a new certificate of liability insurance ostensibly from jimcor insurance company.the certificate listed a policy number,policy limits,and effective policy dates.
none of this was true jimcor was not an insurance company and the new certificates were entirely fabricated.gamble testified that at renzi request,she inserted random policy numbers,cut and pasted safeco policy limits,and chose safeco august cancellation date as the effective date of the new fake policy.then,at renzi direction,gamble sent out at least of these letters and phony insurance certificates,but only to clients who had called r c to voice concern.
north island continued to formally demand payment of premiums from r c.in october,with no payments in hand and no response from r c,north island notified state insurance regulators in virginia and florida of r c nonpayment.clients began receiving calls from these state insurance regulators.
in early november,r c sent another letter to its clients,signed by gamble on behalf of r c interim president andrew beardall the letter again reassured clients that they were properly insured with no lapses in coverage.these statements were also false at that time clients had no insurance coverage at all.instead,between august and november,r c adjusted all insurance claims internally,paying clients directly for any outstanding claims.
on november,renzi was elected to the united states house of representatives.a few weeks later,renzi received a gift from his father.that same day,r c paid the full amount due to north island.after receiving full payment,safeco decided to retroactively reinstate all of r c policies.
but r c troubles were just beginning.in early,r c received a letter from the virginia state corporate commission bureau of insurance.in the letter,the bureau of insurance asked r c to explain why it had collected client premiums but failed to remit them to north island,and why it had issued certificates of insurance showing that coverage had been placed through jimcor,which is not an insurance company.in march,renzi responded by letter on behalf of r renzi letter attributed the withheld payments to an ongoing coverage dispute with safeco,and claimed that a member of the office staff had mistakenly typed jimcor when generating the certificates.the letter characterized the mistake as an inadvertent computer slip.
in early spring,r c received another letter this time,from the florida department of insurance inquiring as to why premiums collected by r c had not been remitted to safeco.r c responded in a letter signed by beardall.again,r c blamed the faulty certificates on a computer error by a member of the office staff.r c stated that the safeco insurance policies were in force for the whole year without any lapses.at trial,gamble testified that there was no inadvertent computer slip.she confirmed that renzi himself had instructed her to create the fake certificates,insert the false coverage information,and send the certificates to complaining clients.
in may,r c surrendered its virginia insurance license to avert penalties.r c chose not to renew its florida license.as a result,the florida department of insurance took no further action against r 
the public corruption counts arose out of renzi and sandlin friendship and business relationship from to,renzi and sandlin were partners in a real estate development company,fountain realty and development,based in kingman,arizona.in february,shortly after his election to congress,renzi sold sandlin his share of the company.sandlin paid renzi in part with an promissory note,payable in annual installments through september at five percent interest.
during this time,sandlin also owned a acre parcel the sandlin tract in southeastern arizona,near the san pedro river and within the watershed of the united states army fort huachuca the fort.sandlin had been leasing the tract to an alfalfa farmer,who was using an excessive amount of water acre feet per year in a region that was facing chronic water shortages.water conservation was a high priority for fort huachuca because the fort conducted important training and was facing local controversy over its water usage.at the same time,the fort was being reviewed by the base realignment and closure commission bracc and was under a federal court order to reduce its water consumption.
in,the resolution copper company rcc acquired land and mineral rights to a large copper deposit located near superior,arizona.rcc was planning to extract the copper,but first wanted to secure ownership of an adjacent parcel of land owned by the united states forest service.rcc began talking with congressman james kolbe about sponsoring a federal land exchange bill but kevin messner,renzi chief of staff,told renzi that he should be the one to introduce rcc exchange,as messner believed that the exchange could help renzi gain political support during renzi upcoming reelection campaign.the rcc land exchange proceeded no further that year,but rcc and renzi agreed to touch base again after the election.
by the time renzi was reelected to congress in early,he had secured a seat on the house natural resources committee,which was responsible for land exchanges requiring legislative approval at a private meeting in january,rcc executive bruno hegner asked renzi which lands rcc should consider purchasing to exchange with the government for the forest service parcel.renzi nonchalant ly mentioned the sandlin tract,but he did not disclose his relationship with sandlin,nor did he disclose the fact that sandlin owed him in principal on the note.hegner testified that,although rcc would not have been interested in the sandlin property absent renzi suggestion,rcc began negotiating with sandlin.
renzi and hegner met again in february.hegner testified that in this meeting,renzi was insistent about the importance of rcc acquiring the sandlin property and including it in the land exchange.renzi stressed that acquiring the sandlin property would benefit national security,because decreasing water usage on the sandlin property was critical to fort huachuca sustainability.tom glass,an rcc consultant who also attended the meeting,asked renzi if he had a business relationship with sandlin.hegner testified that renzi became visibly aggravated and insisted that,although he had sold a piece of property to sandlin many years ago,there was no business relationship.
ultimately,rcc negotiations with sandlin were not fruitful.in march,hegner advised renzi that rcc was unable to reach an agreement with sandlin because sandlin was insisting upon unreasonable terms.later that day,sandlin sent hegner a fax stating,i just received a phone call from congressman renzi office.they have the impression i have been cooperative concerning this water issue.i feel i have been very cooperative i still want to cooperate.
negotiations continued,albeit unsuccessfully.when hegner told renzi that he was continuing to have trouble with sandlin,renzi responded with the key ultimatum no sandlin property,no bill.hegner immediately understood this to mean that renzi would not sponsor rcc legislative land swap proposal unless rcc included the sandlin property in the land exchange.hegner asked,what if i ca get this done renzi replied,that would be a topic for another conversation,and hung up.in shock,hegner mailed himself a sealed note memorializing the conversation.that same day,hegner learned that renzi and sandlin had been joint shareholders in an arizona business.as a result,rcc decided not to pursue the sandlin tract.
in may,renzi introduced a federal land exchange bill featuring rcc that did not include the sandlin property.no action was ever taken on the bill.
in april,philip aries of the aries group approached joanne keene,renzi district director,to discuss the possibility of renzi sponsoring a federal land exchange bill.keene put aries in contact with sandlin,and aries and sandlin spoke on the phone on april for about minutes.that same day,sandlin exchanged nine phone calls with renzi.
the next day,aries proposed to trade petrified forest parcels in renzi district for federal land near florence,arizona.renzi did not seem interested in the forest parcels,but emphasized that the sandlin tract was of critical importance in resolving fort huachuca water issues.renzi told aries that each congressional term,he could prioritize a single land exchange to pass directly through the natural resources committee.he promised aries if you include the sandlin piece in your exchange,i will give you my free pass.once again,renzi did not mention his preexisting relationship with sandlin.
during the negotiation period,aries emphasized to keene that he was going way out on a limb at the request of congressman renzi,and that he was putting his complete faith in congressman renzi and keene that this is the correct decision.at trial,aries testified that the aries group had no interest in owning the sandlin tract,and would not have bought the tract absent renzi promise.but within a few weeks,aries and sandlin had reached a deal.aries agreed to purchase acres of sandlin property for million.aries sent a million deposit in two installments on may and may.on may,sandlin immediately wrote a check payable to renzi vino,an arizona wine company owned by renzi.renzi then deposited the check into a bank account of patriot insurance renzi public financial disclosure statement did not report sandlin payment.
in early september,renzi sent a letter to sandlin stating that the promissory note for the prior sale of renzi stake in their joint business was due and payable for because sandlin had recently sold some kingman property sandlin immediately took out a loan from two close friends.he then wrote a check for to patriot insurance with the notation insurance payment.renzi deposited the check.again,renzi did not report this payment on his financial disclosure form.
the aries group closed escrow on the sandlin tract on october.aries paid sandlin million in principal,plus about in interest a federal land exchange bill with aries was never introduced.
in october,aries received a message from a phoenix new times reporter asking about aries dealings with renzi and sandlin.sandlin instructed aries to call the reporter back,deny that rick was the one pushing this land,and instead state that it was the nature conservancy that was pushing the land deal.sandlin falsely assured aries that renzi did not receive proceeds from the closing with the aries group,and insisted that rick was involved in that land in no way,shape,or fashion.
after an extensive investigation,two federal grand juries returned indictments against renzi.the second superseding indictment against renzi and his codefendants was returned on september.in june,following a day jury trial with witnesses,renzi was convicted on of counts of public corruption,insurance fraud,and racketeering,and sandlin was convicted on of counts of public corruption granting a substantial downward variance,the district court sentenced renzi to months of imprisonment the district court sentenced sandlin to months of imprisonment.we have jurisdiction over their appeals under.
renzi first challenges his extortion and fraud convictions.renzi contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his convictions because the government failed to prove that he or sandlin solicited or received something of value in exchange for his promise to support land exchange legislation.renzi points to the fact that the aries group paid sandlin a fair market price for the property,and sandlin then used the proceeds to repay renzi on a legitimate debt.according to renzi,the extortion and fraud convictions can not be sustained because the parties engaged in an equal value exchange.we disagree.
we review the district court interpretation of the statute de novo.united states mcfall,cir.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,we consider whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states nevils,cir quoting jackson virginia.
the hobbs act criminalizes extortion,defined in relevant part as the obtaining of property from another,with his consent,under color of official right.b.the hobbs act defines property as something of value that can be exercised,transferred,or sold.scheidler org.for women,mcfall,at.at common law and still today,the prototypical example of something of value has been money.see sekhar united states,extortion require s the obtaining of items of value,typically cash,from the victim.citing cases.
the evidence at trial established the following aries testified that the aries group had no interest in owning the sandlin property,but purchased it because renzi promised a free pass through the natural resources committee if the sandlin property was included in aries land exchange.immediately after aries sent sandlin a million deposit,sandlin wrote renzi a check to renzi vino,which renzi deposited into a patriot insurance bank account.renzi required public financial disclosures never reported this payment.this evidence is sufficient for a rational juror to find that renzi received money from the aries group,through sandlin,knowing that the payment was made in exchange for renzi improper promise to pass federal land exchange legislation in the aries group favor.see evans united states.under the hobbs act,nothing more is required.
renzi contends that because he was entitled to receive money from sandlin under the terms of the promissory note,the payment from sandlin can not constitute something of value.not only does renzi argument downplay the role his public position played in helping him collect a private debt earlier than would otherwise have been the case,renzi argument is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the hobbs act.first,it is not necessary to prove that the extortioner himself,directly or indirectly,received the fruits of his extortion or any benefit therefrom.united states panaro,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the extortion was complete once the proceeds reached sandlin.see mcfall,at recognizing that the public official himself or a third party acting in concert with the public official must obtain the property of which the victim is deprived.
second,the existence of a prior debt between renzi and sandlin is immaterial to the fact that,together,renzi and sandlin obtained property,money from the aries group that they were not otherwise entitled to receive through renzi official position.even if renzi was owed money from sandlin,he was in no way entitled to obtain that money from the aries group using the threat of withholding action on a public bill.under renzi narrow reading of the statute,an official could always insulate himself from hobbs act liability by directing the extortion victim payments to any third party who owed the official money.such an interpretation defies the plain language of the statute and fails to comport with the statute purpose to guard against the misuse of public office for personal gain.evans,at.
renzi next argues that an equal value exchange can not constitute something of value because there was no net loss to the victim.here,renzi notes,the parties engaged in an equal value exchange because the aries group paid sandlin a fair market price for the property.according to renzi,because the sandlin property was not sold at an inflated price,there can be no extortion.we find no support for renzi argument in the statute or in the case law.the hobbs act requires the government to prove only that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled,knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.evans,at.we conclude that renzi obtained a payment from aries that he was not otherwise entitled to receive.the government met its burden under the statute.thus,we affirm renzi convictions on this count 
a similar analysis governs renzi fraud conviction.under,an official is guilty of fraud if he accepts something of value in exchange for an official act.skilling united states,noting that draws content from b,which prohibits corruptly accepting anything of value.the phrase anything of value has been interpreted broadly to carry out the congressional purpose of punishing the abuse of public office.united states williams,cir.thus,thing of value is defined broadly to include the value which the defendant subjectively attaches to the items received.united states gorman,cir.
the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that renzi received a thing of value money in exchange for his promise to perform an official act utilizing his influence to move the bill through congress.we reject renzi argument that he merely entered into an economic exchange.id.at.the money had subjective value to renzi,not only because it was a payment,but because it was the early repayment of a large private debt.the purpose of section g is to reach all situations in which a government agent judgment concerning his official duties may be clouded by the receipt of an item of value given to him by reason of his position.id.here,renzi received money from the aries group that he was not otherwise entitled to receive.this money clouded his judgment in performing his official duties and deprived his constituents of the honest services of their elected representative.we affirm his conviction on this count 
renzi also faults the jury instructions for failing to identify the specific thing of value at issue.he asserts that this omission makes it impossible to know whether the jury verdict rests on proper grounds.because renzi failed to object to the jury instruction at trial,we review for plain error.see united states treadwell,cir.b.
the ninth circuit pattern jury instruction for bribery recommend s that the district court specifically describe the thing of value just as it is described in the indictment to avoid a variance.jury instr,cmt.however,the recommendation is just that a recommendation.neither the pattern jury instruction nor any controlling precedent requires the district court to identify the thing of value,especially where variance from the indictment is not at issue.
renzi notes that fatal variance could be at issue,pointing to united states choy,cir.in choy,although the indictment alleged that the thing of value was,the government at trial urged an uncharged and legally invalid theory that the thing of value was the purchase of computer equipment that enabled a public official to receive a bribe.id.at.finding that t he theory on which he was convicted constituted a fatal variance from the offense alleged in the indictment,we reversed.id.at.
but renzi case is notably different from choy.here,the government theory of conviction has remained consistent since the beginning the thing of value has always been money to sandlin,part of which goes to renzi.the indictment alleged that sandlin paid renzi from the proceeds of the sale of the sandlin property.because the evidence at trial did not prove facts materially different from those alleged in the indictment,no variance is at issue.von stoll,at.accordingly,we find no error,let alone plain error,in the uncontested jury instructions 
renzi argues that the district court erred by allowing testimony from his former district director,joanne keene,in violation of his speech or debate clause privilege.he also asserts that the district court prevented renzi from presenting a complete defense by erroneously protecting congressman jim kolbe speech or debate privilege at renzi expense,and by improperly excluding evidence under the classified information procedures act cipa,app.as a result,renzi contends,he is entitled to a new trial.
we review de novo whether evidence at trial caused a member of congress to be questioned about his legislative acts.united states swindall,cir.
renzi first argues that his former district director,joanne keene,presented testimony to the jury in violation of the speech or debate clause.specifically,renzi challenges two pieces of testimony keene testimony that renzi did not seem very excited and interested in the resolution copper exchange when sandlin tract was no longer a part of it and keene testimony that renzi told her in fall that he wanted to put the brakes on aries land exchange because congressman duke cunningham had been indicted for public corruption renzi claims that this testimony inquired into his legislative acts in violation of the speech or debate clause and,as a result,he is entitled to a new trial.
in determining whether keene testimony concerned renzi protected legislative acts,we must revisit the contours of the speech or debate clause.in renzi i,we concluded that renzi negotiations with private parties did not constitute protected legislative acts.united states renzi renzi i,cir.we made clear that promises or actions associated with future legislation are not covered by the clause.id.completed legislative acts are protected by the clause promises of future acts are not.here,we consider whether,when renzi himself introduced evidence of his own legislative acts through the of government witnesses,the government was then entitled to rebut that evidence.
the speech or debate clause provides that,for any speech or debate in either house,a member of congress shall not be questioned in any other place.constitution,art.i,cl.emphasis added.evident from its plain language,the focus is on the improper questioning of a congressman.as such,the clause is violated when the government reveals legislative act information to a jury because this would subject a member to being questioned in a place other than the house or the senate.united states helstoski.
in line with helstoski holding,our sister circuits have recognized that a member is not questioned when he or she chooses to offer rebuttal evidence of legislative acts.united states mcdade,cir see also united states myers,cir.the rationale makes sense a congressman can not claim the protections of the privilege when he himself introduces the violative evidence.however,mcdade recognized that this is a sword.although a congressman may introduce evidence of his own legislative acts,he thereby subjects himself to on those points.mcdade,at see also united states rostenkowski.
in mcdade,a member of congress sought dismissal of his indictment on the grounds that the indictment would force him to introduce evidence of legislative acts in order to refute the charges against him.mcdade,at.the court was not sympathetic to mcdade concerns.there are times,the court recognized,that a member of congress may find it advantageous to introduce evidence of his own legislative acts.for instance,a member who is charged with accepting a bribe in exchange for supporting certain legislation may find it tactically beneficial to introduce evidence of his or her assertedly legitimate reasons for ultimately supporting the legislation.id.this is permissible under the clause,the court reasoned,because the member himself chose to introduce such evidence.but in doing so,the member subjects himself to on these points.id.at.
we agree with the second,third,and circuits.we hold that,if a member of congress offers evidence of his own legislative acts at trial,the government is entitled to introduce rebuttal evidence narrowly confined to the same legislative acts,and such rebuttal evidence does not constitute questioning the member of congress in violation of the clause 
renzi and the bipartisan legal advisory group blag of the united states house of representatives,appearing as amicus curiae,contend that our conclusion amounts to a contention that renzi,by introducing evidence of his own legislative acts,waived his speech or debate privilege.this,renzi and blag contend,can not be because the supreme court has held that waiver,if even possible,can be found only after explicit and unequivocal renunciation of the speech or debate clause protection.helstoski,at.we understand helstoski admonition.but we find the limited rebuttal evidence at issue here distinct from a waiver of the speech or debate privilege based on a willingness to testify before a grand jury.
in helstoski,a congressman charged with conspiracy volunteered legislative act evidence to the grand jury in response to the prosecutor questioning on multiple occasions.id.at.at trial,the government contended that helstoski had waived the protections of the clause by testifying before the grand jury and voluntarily producing documentary evidence of legislative acts.id.at.the court disagreed.it concluded that helstoski words and conduct can not be seen as an explicit and unequivocal waiver of his immunity from prosecution for legislative acts.id.at.but there,the court was concerned about whether helstoski introduction of legislative acts in response to questioning by a prosecutor in front of a grand jury triggered a waiver of helstoski evidentiary privilege at trial.the court had no occasion to decide whether a member is questioned in violation of the clause where,as here,he has the opportunity to introduce testimony in his own defense and decides to open the door at trial by introducing evidence of his legislative acts.
we now turn to the specific evidence at issue.
we first address the challenged piece of testimony concerning renzi support for the aries group legislation.on of aries,renzi elicited that he had cooled his support for aries land exchange legislation in the summer of,after rcc complained that aries exchange seemed to be moving more quickly than theirs.in keene testimony the next day,the government elicited an alternative explanation as to why renzi ardor had cooled.when keene and renzi became aware that congressman cunningham was being prosecuted for public corruption,renzi told keene that he wanted to put the brakes on the aries exchange because he had learned that duke cunningham was being indicted for public corruption.this testimony directly rebutted the legislative act testimony elicited by renzi himself regarding renzi true reasons for backing off of his support.we conclude that renzi introduction of this evidence opened the door for the government to introduce rebuttal evidence on this point 
we recognize,as we must,that the speech or debate clause must be read broadly to effectuate its purpose of protecting the independence of the legislative branch.united states brewster.but the clause has its limits.n o more than the statutes we apply,was its purpose to make members of congress,immune from criminal responsibility.id.
importantly,it was renzi himself who injected into his trial whether and to what extent he supported the aries exchange within congress.now,renzi seeks the protections of the speech or debate clause,claiming the government was not allowed to rebut aries testimony and offer the jury another possible reason renzi cooled his support for the land exchange duke cunningham had been indicted and renzi did not want to be next.taking our guidance from mcdade,we conclude that renzi opened the door to the limited rebuttal testimony adduced from keene at trial by aries on the same issue.in response,the prosecution properly confined its rebuttal to the one material point at issue that the real reason renzi cooled his support for the land exchange was not because rcc had complained,but because cunningham had been indicted for corruption.in light of the foregoing,we conclude that renzi was not impermissibly questioned about his legislative acts in violation of the clause.
the second piece of challenged testimony concerned renzi handling of the rcc land exchange after renzi learned that hegner would not purchase the sandlin property.during of hegner,renzi elicited that he had signed on to sponsor the rcc bill even though the bill no longer included the sandlin property.renzi further elicited testimony that he did,in fact,introduce the bill in late may,although the bill did not move forward.renzi purpose in introducing this legislative act testimony was to show that he continued to support the rcc exchange even after hegner refused to purchase the sandlin property.
two days later,keene testified.when asked whether she recalled any conversations with renzi around april concerning his views about the rcc land exchange,keene stated that renzi did not seem very excited and interested in the resolution copper exchange.keene testimony was directly responsive to hegner testimony that renzi spearheaded the introduction of the rcc bill.because renzi himself elicited this legislative act testimony through of hegner,we conclude that the government was permitted to provide rebuttal evidence on this narrow point whether renzi truly supported rcc bill within congress without the quid pro quo involving acquisition of the sandlin property.because renzi was not impermissibly questioned in violation of the clause,we find no speech or debate clause violation 
kevin messner was renzi chief of staff from may to november,before then serving as congressman kolbe chief of staff.because congressman kolbe invoked his legislative privilege,the district court precluded renzi from questioning messner about kolbe legislative acts.renzi now argues that the district court inconsistently applied the speech or debate clause by allowing keene to testify extensively about her work in renzi office but prohibiting messner from testifying about his interactions with renzi while messner was serving as kolbe chief of staff.renzi argues that the district court failure to balance kolbe speech or debate privilege against renzi right to present a defense violated renzi fifth and sixth amendment rights.
as a general principle,under the fifth and sixth amendments,a criminal defendant is guaranteed a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.united states stever,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,while renzi may waive his own speech or debate privilege,he can not waive the privilege of another congressman.see football league football league,cir t he testimonial privilege that members of congress enjoy under the speech or debate clause of the constitution,art.i,can not be waived by another member.this is so because,i f the clause applies,it applies absolutely,and there is no balancing of interests.renzi i,at citing eastland servicemen fund,recognizing the absolute nature of the speech or debate protection.we conclude that renzi right to present a defense can not override the speech or debate privilege of another congressman.
messner proposed testimony concerned conversations between kolbe and renzi regarding the proposed aries bill.these conversations took place while messner was working in kolbe office.because this testimony directly implicated kolbe legislative activities,the district court correctly refused to allow messner testimony.the district court was not permitted to weigh kolbe privilege against renzi right to present a defense.
moreover,any additional testimony about the benefits of including sandlin property in a land exchange would have been largely cumulative and of limited relevance.for weeks,renzi elicited from government and defense witnesses that fort huachuca played a vital role in national security,that the fort water usage was a concern,and that retiring water usage on sandlin tract would aid the fort.the parties stipulated to those facts at renzi request,the court even admitted an april email from messner to keene,in which messner expressed support for the aries bill because the land exchange would greatly help the fort.any additional testimony on these points would have been largely cumulative.
we hold that the district court properly declined to balance congressman kolbe speech or debate privilege against renzi right to present a defense 
renzi also maintains he was unable to present a complete defense because the district court excluded certain classified materials regarding renzi personal connection to fort huachuca and his knowledge of its strategic value.according to renzi,the excluded evidence would have shown that his insistence on including the sandlin property in the land exchange was motivated by his desire to protect the fort and its important activities.
under the classified information procedures act cipa,the government may request the court to conduct a hearing to make all determinations concerning the use,relevance,or admissibility of classified information that would otherwise be made during the trial,a.the district court reviewed the classified material in camera and held a hearing on the defense request.cipa does not alter the substantive rules of evidence,including the test for relevance thus,it also permits the district court to exclude irrelevant,cumulative,or corroborative classified evidence.united states passaro,cir.if the court authorizes disclosure of the classified information,the government may move to substitute for such classified evidence a statement admitting relevant facts,so long as the statement will provide the defendant with substantially the same ability to make his defense,c.we review the district court exclusion of classified information for abuse of discretion.united states miller,cir.
we have carefully reviewed the classified materials filed with this case and conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding them.although these materials may have some limited relevance,they are cumulative of the evidence renzi actually presented at trial.see.indeed,the evidence introduced at trial provided a detailed narrative of how renzi came to learn of the fort activities and their importance to national security.the defense successfully introduced evidence including the information contained in a detailed powerpoint presentation regarding the fort activities that had been shown to renzi at a february briefing in washington,matt walsh testimony regarding renzi visit to the fort in january and a copy of renzi itinerary from that visit.the parties also entered the detailed stipulation regarding the training programs and activities that take place at the fort.the evidence cumulatively provided renzi with substantially the same ability to make his defense as he would have had if the court had allowed the introduction of the classified information itself,c united states sedaghaty,cir noting discovery substitution need not be of precise,concrete,equivalence,so long as it placed defendant as nearly as possible,in the position he would be in if the classified information were available to him internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the actual classified information.renzi introduced ample similar evidence supporting his theory of the case,the district court handled the issue appropriately in conformance with the statute,and there was no constitutional violation.
renzi contends that the government knowingly elicited false testimony during its direct examinations of philip aries and joanne keene in violation of napue illinois.on direct examination,aries testified that he did not know about the sandlin property prior to meeting with renzi on april.on,the defense confronted aries with sandlin phone records,which revealed that aries and sandlin had spoken the day before for minutes.aries acknowledged that he had made a mistake by one day.a few days later,keene testified that renzi brought up the sandlin tract to aries at the april meeting and that there was a discussion about getting sandlin contact information for aries.once again,the defense confronted keene with sandlin phone records.in response,keene conceded her lack of certainty,and acknowledged that she was not sure how the contact information was exchanged.
a defendant due process rights are violated when a conviction is obtained through the knowing use of false testimony.to establish a napue violation,a defendant must show that the testimony was actually false,that the government knew or should have known that it was false,and that the testimony was material,meaning there is a reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.united states houston,cir.the district court found that aries and keene were,at worst,honestly mistaken and did not perjure themselves.
we consider renzi napue claim de novo,but we review factual determinations underlying the ruling for clear error.see,united states inzunza,cir.
we conclude that renzi has failed to prove the third prong of napue because there is not a reasonable likelihood that aries or keene statements affected the jury judgment.see houston,at.first,defense counsel effectively attacked the credibility of aries and keene on.id.finding no reasonable likelihood that false testimony affected the jury where d efense counsel effectively attacked the witness credibility.second,whether or not sandlin spoke to aries on april or april was of marginal relevance when compared to renzi promises a free pass through the natural resources committee at the april meeting.the primary dispute at trial was not whether renzi pushed sandlin tract on aries,but why.the jury could reasonably conclude that renzi,not aries,pushed the tract at the meeting,even though aries had heard about the tract from sandlin the day prior.because the statements were not material,we conclude that no napue violation occurred 
we also question whether renzi met the first two prongs of the napue test.mere inconsistencies or honestly mistaken witness recollections generally do not satisfy the falsehood requirement.see united states bagley.renzi has provided no evidence that keene or aries knew their testimony was inaccurate.moreover,although the existence of the phone records allow for the possibility that the prosecutors knew,or should have known,that keene and aries might testify falsely,there is no evidence that the prosecutors actually knew they would.this distinguishes the situation from that present in hayes brown,cir en banc,where the prosecutor deliberately withheld relevant information from his witness.accordingly,we doubt that renzi has met the first two prongs of the napue test but do not decide the issue as he has not met the third prong of the test.
we next address whether renzi is entitled to a judgment of acquittal or a new trial on the insurance fraud counts.renzi was convicted of conspiring to violate and violating a by lying to virginia and florida insurance regulators.the statute prohibits a person engaged in the business of insurance from knowingly,with the intent to deceive,mak ing any false material statement in connection with any financial reports or documents presented to any insurance regulatory official.a a.renzi contends that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his insurance fraud convictions because the government failed to prove that r c was engaged in the business of insurance or that the two letters sent to virginia and florida insurance regulators qualify as financial documents.renzi also argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court misinstructed the jury on the meaning of the term financial reports or documents.for the reasons that follow,we deny renzi the relief he seeks.
we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo to determine whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states chung,cir citing jackson,at.
for over ten years,renzi served as the owner and operator of r c,an insurance agency that marketed and sold insurance policies,approved applicants for insurance,issued certificates of insurance,and collected premiums on behalf of insurance carriers.now,renzi contends that his insurance fraud conviction under a can not stand because r c was not engaged in the business of insurance as required by the statute.we conclude otherwise.a rational juror could have found that r c,an insurance agency,was engaged in the business of insurance.
the statute defines the term business of insurance broadly to mean the writing of insurance or reinsuring of risks by an insurer,including all acts necessary or incidental to such writing or reinsuring and the activities of persons who act as,or are,officers,directors,agents,or employees of insurers or who are other persons authorized to act on behalf of such persons.u.f.an insurer is any entity the business activity of which is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks,and includes any person who acts as,or is,an officer,director,agent,or employee of that business.id.f.
the statute is not a model of clarity.nonetheless,we read the statute to require that,to be engaged in the business of insurance,r c must either write insurance or reinsure risks,and meet the definition of an insurer under f conduct acts necessary or incidental to writing or reinsuring or conduct any activity,as long as the person is,acts as,or is authorized to act on behalf of,an officer,director,agent,or employee of an insurer.see united states segal,cir concluding that defendant,an independent insurance broker,was engaged in the business of insurance as that term is broadly defined in the statute to include all acts necessary or incidental to such writing or reinsuring beamer netco,d,recognizing that the business of insurance includes all acts necessary or incidental to such writing or re insuring.
we conclude that the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient for a rational juror to find that r c was engaged in the business of insurance because aly gamble,r c senior underwriter,testified that r c was authorized to act on behalf of insurer royal surplus lines insurance company.gamble explained that royal surplus had one policy for r c numerous clients,an aggregate or master policy.she testified that r c would inquire as to whether its new clients were qualified for coverage under that policy.if so,r c would accept their funds and issue a binding certificate of insurance almost immediately.after r c took these steps,the new clients actually had insurance and were bound.a binder gives an insured temporary coverage while the application for an insurance policy is being processed or while the formal policy is being prepared.black law dictionary ed.thus,gamble testimony established that royal surplus was bound to provide insurance coverage for the new client.viewing this testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution,nevils,at,a reasonable juror could conclude r c acted on behalf of royal surplus by binding it to insuring new clients,and therefore r c was engaged in the business of insurance.accordingly,even giving business of insurance the most narrow definition possible,we have no doubt that r c falls under the realm of the statute.
alternatively,we conclude that r c conducted acts necessary or incidental to the writing of insurance or reinsuring of risks.r c marketed,developed,and sold safeco insurance policies,issued certificates of insurance to clients,underwrote insurance applications,collected insurance premiums from clients and passed those premiums on to safeco,and reported pending claims to safeco.all of these actions are necessary or incidental to the writing of insurance.r c even went so far as to issue fake insurance certificates to clients,which listed renzi as jimcor insurance company authorized representative.and during the period of time when clients were not covered by any policy,r c paid clients directly after purportedly adjusting any outstanding claims.
while renzi asks us to interpret the term business of insurance narrowly,we find that such an interpretation is contrary to the definition itself,which is considerably broader than just insurers who issue policies and take on risk.indeed,the statute covers insurers,agents of insurers,and even those who act as agents of insurers.see f.moreover,such a narrow definition is contrary to the statute broad purpose,which was to make it a federal crime to defraud,loot,or plunder an insurance company.see cong.rec,statement of dingell.
if it looks like an insurance agency and acts like an insurance agency,it probably engaged in the business of insurance.a rational juror could have found that r c,which went so far as to issue fraudulent insurance policies to dupe unwitting clients into believing they were fully insured,was engaged in the business of insurance as the term is broadly defined in f.
after receiving inquiries from virginia and florida insurance regulators,r c responded in two letters,which stated that the fake jimcor certificates were the result of an accidental computer error by a member of the office staff,that the nonpayment of premiums was due to a coverage dispute with safeco,and that clients suffered no lapses in coverage during this time.renzi contends that these letters do not qualify as financial documents within the meaning of a a.we disagree.
the statute does not define the phrase financial documents,and case law provides only sparse guidance on how to interpret this phrase.after considering the plain language of the terms,we conclude that a financial document includes documents relating to the management of money.black law dictionary ed.this covers more than just a balance sheet or an income statement.it includes any document that relates to the financial health of a company.
the letters r c sent to insurance regulators qualify as financial documents because they relate to the management of money and r c financial health.the letters were an attempt to conceal renzi failure to forward insurance premiums to the insurance carriers because they had been diverted to his congressional campaign.the letters were also designed to conceal that renzi insureds had no legitimate insurance coverage for a portion of the year after safeco issued cancellation notices.these letters concealed r c financial problems and sought to mislead insurance regulators as to whether renzi should maintain his licensed insurance agent status.
moreover,false statements within the letters namely,that t here was a delay in payment due to a dispute,but a ll the while,the clients had insurance that was active and available to them had important financial implications.had the letters been composed truthfully,they would have revealed that renzi had redirected clients insurance premiums into his congressional campaign,and that clients insurance coverage with safeco had lapsed for a few months based on nonpayment.this attempt to conceal r c financial issues directly related to r c management of money.our decision comports with the purpose of a,which was to punish knowing falsehoods that obstruct the investigations of insurance regulators.see cong.rec.statement of dingell states apparently are not collecting adequate information,investigating wrongdoing,or taking legal action against the perpetrators of insurance insolvency.
we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that the letters r c sent to virginia and florida insurance regulators were financial documents.
renzi argues that,over his objection,the district court misinstructed the jury by stating that t he terms financial reports or financial documents include any documents concerning the management of money or the potential financial health and viability of a business or that relate to the financial position of a business.renzi contends that this unbounded definition left the jury free to conclude that virtually any document satisfied this element and that,therefore,he is entitled to a new trial.
district courts have wide discretion in crafting jury instructions.united states humphries,cir.we review de novo whether a jury instruction correctly states the law.united states berry,cir.renzi is entitled to a new trial if the instruction actually given was misleading or inadequate to guide the jury deliberation.united states garcia rivera,cir.
the district court definition of financial documents was a correct statement of the law.financial documents do,in fact,include the documents mentioned by the court.humphries,at.the district court was not required to explicitly state which documents were included or excluded from the statute scope.because the term financial documents is undefined in the statute,the district court was permitted to rely on the plain language of the terms along with supporting case law.thus,the district court did not err in instructing the jury that the definition of financial reports or documents included documents concerning the management of money or the potential financial health and viability of a business or that relate to the financial position of a business.
next,renzi challenges his conviction for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of c rico.this count was predicated on three alleged acts of racketeering racketeering act one use of insurance premiums held in trust to fund first congressional campaign racketeering act two scheme to deprive the united states of honest services,and to extort constituents and racketeering act three misappropriations from spirit mountain insurance company.the jury acquitted renzi of racketeering act three,but found that renzi committed many of the predicate acts alleged in racketeering acts one and two.
racketeering act one charged renzi with executing a scheme and artifice to defraud through the use of interstate wires,in violation of wire fraud,and through the use of interstate mailings,in violation of mail fraud.in describing the scheme,the indictment stated that renzi misappropriat ed insurance premium funds held in trust by r c and divert ed those funds to his own benefit.this charge was based on renzi transfer of over from r c,some of which came from client insurance premiums,to renzi personal accounts to fund his congressional campaign.
renzi contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the government did not,and could not,prove that renzi misappropriated funds held in trust by another.renzi relies on united states lequire,where we held that dwayne lequire,r c accountant,was not guilty of embezzlement under b because patriot insurance did not hold funds in trust for the insurer,but instead was subject to a relationship.at.referencing lequire,renzi contends that r c did not hold funds in trust for north island instead,the funds belonged to r c,subject to a relationship.renzi also argues that lequire makes clear that misappropriation,like embezzlement,requires that funds be held in trust.
renzi overstates the holding of lequire.while lequire specifically dealt with embezzlement under b,it did not discuss misappropriation.and here,renzi was not charged with misappropriation or embezzlement.he was charged with mail and wire fraud.neither mail nor wire fraud requires any express relationship,either fiduciary or trust,between the victim and the defendant.see.instead,the fraud statutes require proof of a scheme to obtain money by means of false representations.id.renzi does not dispute that a rational juror could have found the evidence adduced at trial satisfied those elements.
we have repeatedly held that language that describes elements beyond what is required under statute is surplusage and need not be proved at trial.see bargas burns,cir.here,we conclude that the indictment use of the phrases misappropriation and in trust were surplusage.those terms were used only in describing the overall scheme to defraud,and were not mentioned in the description of any of the predicate acts.because the government was not required to show that r c misappropriated funds held in trust for another in order to prove mail or wire fraud,this additional language in the indictment was surplusage and could be disregarded.id.
we also conclude that the district court did not constructively amend the indictment by omitting the in trust language from the jury instructions.because the in trust language was surplusage,removal of this language from the jury instructions was not error.see united states garcia paz,cir.
in bribery,extortion,and fraud cases,of the united states sentencing guidelines instructs a sentencing court to enhance a defendant offense level based on the greatest of the value of the payment,the benefit received or to be received in return for the payment,the value of anything obtained or to be obtained by a public official or others acting with a public official,or the loss to the government from the offense.b.the district court found the enhancement applicable under prong one that is,the value of the payment on the counts of conviction that renzi received in exchange for the influence exerted to the sale of the property.
renzi and sandlin challenge the district court calculation of value under b.they contend that the district court erred by concluding that the value of the payment was the amount of the debt to renzi that sandlin paid off,rather than zero the net value to renzi.we review a district court method of calculating loss under the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states del toro barboza,cir.we review the district court determination of the amount of loss for clear error.id.
renzi and sandlin base their argument on the application notes to b,which state that t he value of the benefit received or to be received means the net value of such benefit,app.emphasis added.they also rely on united states white eagle,where we found that the district court erred in equating the value of a loan modification to a cash payment of the same size,cir.in white eagle,we concluded that the district court should have considered the value of the benefit received by the defendant,not just the face amount of the transaction.id.at.
renzi and sandlin arguments ignore both the plain language of the guideline itself and the district court colloquy.the guideline instructs the district court to consider the greatest of four calculation methods.and here,the district court stated that it was basing its conclusion on prong one,the value of the payment.according to the jury,the value of the payment from aries to sandlin to renzi was.application note three does not aid the court in interpreting prong one,since the note only discusses the proper interpretation of the phrase the benefit received,which appears in prong two of the guideline.white eagle does not compel a contrary decision because it focuses exclusively on prong two.
renzi and sandlin argue that the value of the payment prong must also be understood to incorporate the net value principle since t here is no basis for treating it differently and any other interpretation would produce anomalous results.but the application note is clear in its scope by its terms,it applies only to the benefit received prong.thus,we hold that the district court did not err in imposing a enhancement under b to both renzi and sandlin.
james sandlin,renzi codefendant,challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions for conspiracy to engage in wire fraud,hobbs act extortion,and engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived funds.primarily,he asserts that there is no evidence that he agreed with renzi to conceal their prior business relationship.sandlin contends that the evidence shows that he was an innocent businessman engaging in financial transactions.we review de novo whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.nevils,at jackson,at.
sandlin claims that he was always forthright in his dealings with hegner and aries.he points to the fact that he explicitly told hegner that he and renzi continued to have business dealings.and when he and aries began discussing the land exchange,he volunteered that he and renzi had a very,very close working relationship and personal relationship because his wife had attended high school with renzi.according to sandlin,this free sharing of information was consistent with his role as an innocent businessman.
based on our own de novo review of the evidence before the jury,it is impossible to conclude that no reasonable juror would have voted to convict sandlin.most importantly,the government was not required to prove the existence of an explicit agreement to prove conspiracy.iannelli united states,u.instead,the existence of an agreement to commit an unlawful act can be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case.id.at.
here,while the jury was presented with evidence that sandlin volunteered information about his relationship with renzi,the jury also heard that sandlin never told rcc or aries that he owed renzi plus interest on a personal note or that he planned to repay his debt to renzi with some of the proceeds sandlin repaid renzi with a check made payable to renzi vino,even though the debt was payable to renzi personally sandlin paid renzi immediately upon receiving the earnest money from aries sandlin spoke to renzi seven times on the day of the first payment sandlin made a second repayment to renzi with a check made payable to patriot insurance with the notation insurance payment,even though the debt was payable to renzi personally and sandlin insisted in a phone call with aries that rick was involved in that land in no way,shape,or fashion.finally,when sandlin began receiving phone calls from investigative reporters looking into the sale of his property,he immediately called aries to provide instructions on how to respond to media inquiries.the attempt to lay off the deal on the nature conservancy could easily be viewed by a reasonable jury as proof of consciousness of guilt over how the transaction had been structured.
that conduct was powerful proof of criminal intent.the jury rejected sandlin defense that the money he received from the aries group was the result of a legitimate,innocent property sale.we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support sandlin convictions.
the constitution and our citizenry entrust congressmen with immense power.former congressman renzi abused the trust of this nation,and for doing so,he was convicted by a jury of his peers.after careful consideration of the evidence and legal arguments,we affirm the convictions and sentences of both renzi and his friend and business partner,sandlin.
if it looks like an insurance agency and acts like an insurance agency,op.at,it might be a brokerage company whose activities are not covered by.
section is drafted narrowly.it criminalizes conduct by persons who are engaged in the business of insurance.a.the definition of business of insurance is,on its face,limited to activities by insurers.the statute defines the term to mean either the writing of insurance,or the reinsuring of risks,in both cases,by an insurer.f.it defines insurer to mean any entity the business activity of which is the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of risks.id.f.the business of insurance includes activities by employees and agents of an insurer,as well as activities incidental to writing insurance or reinsuring risks that may be undertaken by an insurer.id.f.nothing in the statute suggests that someone who is not an insurer or authorized to act on an insurer behalf is in the business of insurance.
while a broker is involved in the insurance industry,its business does not generally meet the definition of business of insurance for purposes of f.in general,the legal distinction between an agent and a broker is that an agent transacts insurance as the agent of the insurer and a broker transacts insurance as the agent of the insured with regard to a particular insurance transaction.jeffrey thomas new appleman on insurance law library edition a lexisnexis emphasis in original black law dictionary ed insurance broker defined as a person who,for compensation,brings about or negotiates contracts of insurance as an agent for someone else,but not as an officer,salaried employee,or licensed agent of an insurance company.
to be sure,a broker could also be an agent for an insurance company.whether an entity is a broker or an insurance agent or both depends on the particular facts of the case.curran indus.comm of,see also sparks republic nat.life ins.courts apply agency principles of the applicable state to determine whether a broker is also serving as an agent of an insurance company.see united states segal,cir rejecting defendants claim that they were brokers and therefore not engaged in the business of insurance under b,in light of illinois law that a broker could become an agent of the insured under some factual circumstances citing capitol indem.stewart smith intermediaries,see also united states lequire,cir looking to arizona law to determine that an insurance broker did not hold property in trust for an insurer for purposes of.under the arizona law applicable here,see,a broker does not become the agent of an insurer simply because the insurer contemplates receiving insurance business from brokers.curran,at.nor does a broker become an insurance agent if the broker merely solicits applications for the insurer and secures from the insurer agent the policy which was issued.id.
but the majority here does not determine whether r c is writing insurance or reinsuring risks,or whether r c is an agent of safeco or royal surplus under principles of arizona agency law.instead,the majority relies on a
