background 
relevant documents and relationship of parties 
bcc leases commercial equipment and provides commercial equipment lease financing services to business lessee customers throughout the united states.under its standard equipment lease,bcc requires its lessees to obtain property and liability insurance coverage on the leased equipment and designate bcc as the loss payee and additional insured.when a lessee fails to obtain or maintain insurance,bcc protects its property interests as owner and lessor of the equipment by procuring insurance for the equipment in bcc own name and naming bcc as policy owner and sole insured.it then bills the lessee for the insurance cost,including premiums and a service fee.
ali is a licensed insurance agency that provides equipment lease insurance programs to equipment lease financing companies such as bcc.on october,ali and bcc entered into an initial lease insurance agreement original program agreement which would cover existing leases and any new leases begun after october.under the agreement,ali was appointed to serve as bcc insurance manager,with duties including monitoring insurance coverage on leases,communicating with lessees,processing evidence of lessees who had obtained alternative coverage,and issuing coverage on leases when lessees failed to obtain their own coverage.ali also was required in certain situations to cancel lease insurance,such as when a lessee failed to pay its insurance charges or when a lessee obtained other insurance that satisfied certain criteria.
in setting up the original program agreement,ali acted as agent for balboa insurance,a subsidiary of balboa life.balboa insurance was the actual issuer of the insurance policy insurance policy to bcc.bcc agreed to renew its agreement with ali in april.this agreement program agreement,effective on april,is one of the central documents in this dispute.
in order to avoid the risk and expense of financing this insurance itself,bcc also entered into a agreement original finance agreement on october,to finance the insurance policy through aiccdc.under this agreement,aiccdc would advance the insurance premiums owed to balboa insurance and insurance manager fees owed to ali.these funds were gradually recouped from the insurance charges bcc billed to its individual lessees and then sent to aiccdc.aiccdc also received a finance charge finco charge as compensation.bcc,thus,did not have to dedicate any capital to maintaining this insurance.in fact,bcc earned money on the deal it is designated as subcontractor in the program agreement,with duties to transfer data on lessees and bill and collect insurance charges on the covered leases,and it is compensated for these services.in april,bcc renewed its agreement with aiccdc.this agreement finance agreement,effective on april,as well,is also at issue in this case.
both the finance agreement and the program agreement were set to renew automatically at intervals.but either side could terminate without cause by providing written notice at least ten days prior to the next renewal date in the event of such termination,however,b of the program agreement provides that 
the insured lessor bcc agrees that all coverage effective prior to termination shall remain in effect with the insurance company balboa insurance.the insurance manager ali shall not thereafter cancel coverage with respect to any lease of equipment that is subject to coverage at the time of termination of this agreement,except as provided in this agreement or the insurance policy.
similarly,of the finance agreement provides that following termination without cause,this agreement shall continue in full force and effect with respect to leases which remain subject to coverage at the time of termination of this agreement.
section v of the insurance policy,which is referred to in b,sets forth basic provisions for termination and is entitled how coverage may be voided or canceled.section covers how you bcc may cancel this policy,and covers how we balboa insurance may cancel this policy.both sections contain language first,the cancelling party must,at least ninety days in advance,send written notice of when the cancellation will be effective.following cancellation,coverage on covered equipment issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation of this policy will remain in effect until individually canceled as provided in section v,paragraph above or until termination of each lease agreement of covered equipment.
sections and,respectively,refer to the individual cancellations that are provided by,entitled what happens if your bcc lessee has other coverage.because of the timeframe of this dispute,the relevant paragraph is b,which covers time before a damage to,or theft of,leased equipment,and six months or more after the date coverage commences under this policy.b provides that if our agent ali is notified timely 
that there is other specific insurance on the individual covered equipment that meets all the requirements in your bcc lease agreement,as determined by you bcc,our balboa insurance coverage will be canceled as of one of two date calculations and in either case all related unearned premiums as of such cancellation date will be refunded to you bcc.
approximately half of bcc lessees opted to use the default insurance system provided by the agreements.
b.the instant dispute 
the instant dispute was set in motion because bcc eventually found another insurance company willing to handle the entire insurance operation itself at a lower cost.on october,bcc sent termination notices the notice required by the insurance policy to ali,aiccdc,and balboa insurance,terminating their respective agreements effective january.apparently realizing that only ten days notice was required under the program and finance agreements,bcc then notified ali on november and aiccdc on november by letter that it wished to terminate those agreements without cause.thereafter,bcc sent ali separate cancellation notices for each of the leases then being managed by ali covered under the insurance policy.
ali rejected these notices and filed suit in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts in late november.it later filed an amended complaint on december,asking for a declaratory judgment that the program agreement remain in force.bcc filed a action against aiccdc,which joined the litigation and filed counterclaims in may.by informal agreement,bcc continued the program and finance agreements until april,when it ceased performing any obligations under those agreements.without bcc subcontractor services,ali claims that it was unable to continue managing insurance and canceled insurance on the remaining covered leases.
all three parties sought declaratory relief and claimed breach of contract and unjust enrichment.both sides filed summary judgment motions and stipulated to an undisputed set of material facts.the district court denied the summary judgment motions of ali and aiccdc as to all claims,and granted summary judgment in favor of bcc,declaring that bcc had a right to cancel its existing insurance coverage and that it was entitled to damages ali and aiccdc appeal,claiming that the district court erred in its interpretation of the contractual language at issue here and that
