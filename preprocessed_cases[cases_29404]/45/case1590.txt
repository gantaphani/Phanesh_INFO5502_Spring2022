continental casualty company continental and compucom systems,compucom appeal the august,and march,orders of the district court as discussed below,neither of these orders was a final,appealable order.therefore,we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
appellee william dieser,a former employee of compucom,brought an action under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,et,against continental and compucom to recover benefits under a disability benefits plan funded by compucom and a disability policy provided by continental.on august,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and entered a separate order partially granting dieser motion for summary judgment and denying continental and compucom for summary judgment august order.the august order also awarded dieser disability benefits in the amount of from compucom disability benefits in the amount of from continental statutory penalties against compucom under c in the amount of per day for days totaling and an unspecified amount of interest.finally,in that order the district court set a bench trial to resolve the remaining issues of additional statutory penalties for failure to provide plan documents after may,the precise amount of interest and attorney fees and costs under g.
after an evidentiary hearing was held on november,and the parties filed briefs,the district court issued a second memorandum opinion and entered a separate order on march,march order.in the march order,the district court awarded dieser additional statutory penalties against compucom pursuant to c in the amount of,representing an award of per day from may,until may,attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of.in the march order,the district court also ordered that dieser shall show cause on or before march,if any,as to the precise dollar amount of interest that he is requesting by providing that total amount in addition to providing the mathematical computations upon which the total requested amount is based.additionally,the district court provided that continental and compucom could respond to dieser request for interest by april.
accordingly,on march,dieser filed a request for interest,explaining his position on how the interest should be determined,including setting forth the applicable statute governing interest,the applicable interest rate various beginning and ending dates and the specific calculations.on april,continental and compucom filed a response to dieser request,disputing the applicable dates and arguing that dieser calculations and resulting numbers were flawed and that dieser failed to respond appropriately to the district court march order.
continental and compucom filed a notice of appeal on april,thirty days after the march order.continental and compucom appealed from the memorandum opinion and the order entered on august,and the memorandum opinion and the order entered on march.continental and compucom notice of appeal also indicated that the district court has not yet ruled on motion for interest however,intend to include in their appeal any award of interest.the district court did not certify either order for appeal under b or expressly direct entry of a final judgment as to fewer than all claims or parties under.b.
the district court then entered a third order on june,june order,granting dieser in interest on disability benefits from compucom and in interest on disability benefits from continental.with the june order,all issues of liability and all amounts of monetary awards had been specified by the district court,and nothing was left for the district court to do but execute the judgment.see borntrager cent.states,southeast southwest areas pension fund,cir.continental and compucom did not file another notice of appeal subsequent to the entry of this final,appealable order.
j urisdiction issues will be raised sua sponte by a federal court when there is an indication that jurisdiction is lacking,even if the parties concede the issue.thomas basham,cir.generally,a party in a civil case must file a notice of appeal within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.arnold wood,cir.dieser argues that the august order was a final judgment,making continental and compucom notice of appeal untimely as to the august order but timely as to the march order.therefore,dieser contends that we have jurisdiction to review only the amount of additional statutory penalties and the amount of attorney fees awarded in the march order.continental and compucom contend that their appeal was timely as to the entire adjudication of the case by the district court because there was not a final judgment from which an appeal could be taken until at the earliest march.
the notice of appeal filed on april,was premature because the august order and the march order were not final,appealable orders.see the courts of appeal shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.a final decision within the meaning of ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.borntrager,at quoting cunningham hamilton county,d.a judgment awarding damages but not deciding the amount of the damages or finding liability but not fixing the extent of the liability is not a final decision within the meaning of.maristuen states ins,cir see also parke first reliance standard life ins,cir holding that an order explicitly reserving the determination of the amount of attorney fees and interest did not become final until the district court later issued an order fixing the amounts lee sales,cir holding that an order awarding sanctions but reserving determination of the amount of sanctions was not appealable until the subsequent entry of an order fixing the amount of sanctions.the august and march orders did not purport to dispose of all issues in the case.on its face,the august order indicated that the amounts of additional statutory penalties,interest and attorney fees and costs remained unresolved.similarly,the march order indicated that the amount of interest was yet to be determined thus,the april,notice of appeal was not taken from a final,appealable order and was ineffective to confer appellate jurisdiction upon this court.
we next address whether the prematurely filed notice of appeal can be saved by fed.a,which provides that a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or before the entry of the judgment or treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.we conclude that this rule does not save the notice of appeal in this case.
the supreme court explained in firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins,d,that rule a permits a notice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to serve as an effective notice from a subsequently entered final judgment.however,the supreme court held that rule a applies only when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.id.at.by contrast,rule a does not save a premature appeal from a clearly interlocutory as a discovery ruling or a sanction under rule,because a belief that such a decision is a final judgment would not be reasonable.id.in firstier,the supreme court found that rule a saved a premature notice of appeal filed after the district court announced from the bench that it was granting summary judgment to the defendant on all claims.id.at.the belief in the finality of the oral ruling was reasonable because the bench ruling disposed of all claims and was a decision that would have been final under and,therefore,appealable,had the judge immediately set forth the judgment and the clerk entered the judgment on the docket.id.at.
as construed by firstier,rule a is inapplicable to the present situation.neither the august order nor the march order was one that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.id.at.because the august order expressly left unresolved the amounts of additional statutory penalties,interest and attorney fees and costs,and the march order called for further
