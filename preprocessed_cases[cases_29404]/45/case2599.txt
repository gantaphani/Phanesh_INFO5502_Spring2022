c.the insurance policy 
essex had issued a commercial general liability cgl insurance policy,covering occurrences during the special event of fright night fundraising.the cgl policy was for a term of days.the named insured was.the city police department was an additional insured.the policy specifically excluded coverage for employer liability,a uto,practices,pollution,asbestos,lead or silica dust,punitive or exemplary damages,discrimination,c ontractor,b uilder,or d eveloper,and professional liability,malpractice.
the form insurance policy used by essex provided,under.exclusions aircraft,auto or watercraft,that the cgl policy would not cover the following

d.the coverage lawsuit 
on or about march,the city requested that essex provide it with a defense and indemnity of the navarro lawsuit.on may,essex denied this request based upon the auto exclusion and the special liability endorsement in the insurance policy.on july,the city once again demanded a defense and indemnity from essex.on august,essex reaffirmed its prior denial.
on august,essex filed a complaint against the city seeking declaratory relief that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify the city in the navarro lawsuit.
on march,essex filed a motion for summary judgment.in its motion,essex contended that it was entitled to declaratory relief because of the auto exclusions in the insurance policy.according to essex,it is undisputed that the bodily injuries arose from an automobile accident on sr.because the auto exclusions provide that the insurance policy does not cover liability for bodily injuries arising out of the use of automobiles,essex asserted that i n light of these policy exclusions,the insured could not have any reasonable expectation of coverage for automobile accidents.moreover,even if the city negligence contributed to the accident,that negligence was not separate and apart from the use of an automobile to trigger coverage under the policy.
on june,the city filed its opposition to the summary judgment motion.the city argued that the auto exclusions only limit coverage of third party claims that arise out of the use,maintenance,entrustment to others of autos by the city agent or employees.moreover,the navarros alleged that the bodily injuries were caused by the city creation of a dangerous condition,not by the city use of an auto.the city also asserted that it reasonably expected coverage for the navarro lawsuit.the city,by and through its employee karen bennett,had purchased the insurance policy via a broker.when bennett purchased the policy,she believed that it extended coverage for the creation of a dangerous condition as alleged in the navarro lawsuit complaint.citation.bennett was surprised when essex insurance company denied the city defendants coverage,because she believed that anything pertaining to the cornfield maze would be covered.
on june,essex filed its reply brief.in its reply,essex contended that w hile it is rare to find a case where a defendant is sued for an automobile accident when they had no connection with any of the vehicles involved,nevertheless,essex was correct in denying coverage under the applicable insurance policy the policy does not state or even imply that the automobile exclusion is limited to claims arising out of the insured conduct.essex contended that the modifications to the auto addition of the term,and the removal of the language owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured supported its interpretation of the auto exclusions.essex also argued that the city was put on notice by a facsimile from the insurance broker to karen bennett and the insurance policy itself that bodily injury and property damage involving automobiles was strictly excluded from the policy.
on june,the trial court heard essex motion for summary judgment.on july,the trial court granted the motion in its entirety.the trial court concluded that essex did not owe any duty or obligation to defend or indemnify the city under the insurance policy in connection with the navarro litigation.the trial court based its decision on its finding that the damages in the navarro lawsuit were the proximate result of an automobile accident that occurred on october,and that the essex insurance policy did not provide coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of,caused by or contributed to by the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any automobile.
on august,the city timely appealed.

discussion 
insurer duty to defend 
the city contends that essex had a duty to defend the city in the underlying navarro lawsuit.under california law,an insurer has a duty to defend an insured if it becomes aware of,or if the third party lawsuit pleads,facts giving rise to the potential for coverage under the insuring agreement.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,waller italics added.the nature and kinds of risks covered by the insurance policy establish the scope of the duty to defend.ibid.i f,as a matter of law,neither the complaint nor the known extrinsic facts indicate any basis for potential coverage,the duty to defend does not arise in the first instance.scottsdale ins.mv transportation cal th,d.an insurer is also obligated to provide a defense even when an exclusion applies but may be reasonably interpreted to be inapplicable to the alleged facts.smith kandal real estate continental casualty th,d.thus,essex has a duty to defend the city in the underlying navarro lawsuit only if the insurance policy covers the claims alleged in that lawsuit.essex argues that the auto exclusion provisions in the insurance policy exclude coverage for the navarro lawsuit,and thus there was no duty to defend.we disagree with essex interpretation of those provisions.
interpretation of insurance policy 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d,palmer.accordingly,in interpreting an insurance policy,we seek to discern the mutual intention of the parties and,where possible,to infer this intent from the terms of the policy.haynes farmers ins.exchange cal th,d,haynes.when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.citation.we must also interpret these terms in context citation,and give effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the other.palmer,supra,cal th at,d.
in the insurance context,we begin with the fundamental principle that an insurer can not escape its basic duty to insure by means of an exclusionary clause that is unclear.haynes,supra,cal th at,d,internal quotations omitted.a ny exception to the performance of the basic underlying obligation must be so stated as clearly to apprise the insured of its effect.citation.coverage may be limited by a valid endorsement and,if a conflict exists between the main body of the policy and an endorsement,the endorsement prevails.citation.but to be enforceable,any provision that takes away or limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured must be conspicuous,plain and clear.citation.thus,any such limitation must be placed and printed so that it will attract the reader attention.such a provision also must be stated precisely and understandably,in words that are part of the working vocabulary of the average layperson.citations.the burden of making coverage exceptions and limitations conspicuous,plain and clear rests with the insurer.citations.ibid.
essex insurance policya.coverage provisions 
essex issued a cgl insurance policy to the city that provided third party coverage.third party coverage protects the insured against liability to another based on the insured act s.garvey state farm fire casualty cal d,fn,croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,hereafter croskey.the essex insurance policy was a modified cgl form,no.cg,which indicates an insurance services office iso insurance coverage form with an occurrence trigger cg and an edition date of july.see croskey.
under the policy insuring clause,essex promised to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.essex also promised to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,the coverage provisions also provided that essex will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance does not apply.the coverage provisions also limited coverage for bodily injury and property damages to those caused by occurrence s that take place in the coverage territory.
the automobile accident in the underlying navarro lawsuit is covered under the insuring clause in the essex policy.the navarro lawsuit alleged bodily injury proximately caused by a dangerous condition created by the fright night event.these allegations are sufficient to create a potential for coverage un
