background and procedural history 
the relevant facts in this appeal are undisputed,with one exception,which we note below.
holmes tendered eight packages containing jewelry to fedex between june and december.seven of the packages never reached their destination one arrived empty.each of the packages was sent under fedex master powership agreements,which note that fedex limits its liability in a manner described in its service guide.the service guide,in turn,explains that liability with regard to any package is limited to the sum of unless a higher value is declared on the airbill for the package at the time of tender,and a greater charge paid as provided below.for most types of goods,fedex allows shippers to declare a value up to.however,for items of extraordinary value,including jewelry,the maximum declared value is limited to.moreover,the shipping agreement provides that any effort to declare a value in excess of the maximums allowed in this service guide is null and void,and disclaims any liability in excess of the declared value of a shipment.no value was declared for any of the shipments in question.
kemper,acting in its capacity as subrogee to holmes,brought claims against fedex sounding in tort and contract.fedex moved to dismiss the tort claims as preempted by the airline deregulation act ada.although the district court held that the savings clause of the ada preserved federal common law remedies in tort for lost shipments,id.at,it concluded that the airbill limited fedex liability to per shipment,that kemper could not avoid this limitation by recasting its claims as tort action,id.at,and therefore granted the motion to dismiss.
with respect to the claims sounding in contract,the district court determined that under applicable federal common law,specifically the released value doctrine,the fedex limitation of liability provision was valid because it allowed the shipper to increase fedex exposure to by declaring a higher value and paying a correspondingly higher shipping fee.id.at.moreover,the district court noted that limitations of liability are viewed in a particularly generous light when the shipper chooses to take out private insurance,as did holmes in this case.id.at.the court therefore dismissed kemper claim seeking to void the limitation on liability as contrary to public policy,and granted fedex partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claim based on the limitation of liability,id.
kemper also sought to amend its complaint in two ways which,it contended,would provide legal support for invalidation of the limitation clause without reliance on the released value doctrine.first,kemper claimed that because four of the eight packages traveled entirely by truck instead of by air the carmack amendment allegedly stricter standard made the limitation on liability invalid with respect to those four packages.the district court did not determine whether the carmack amendment applied,instead concluding that because the contours of the carmack amendment mirrored those of the released value doctrine,kemper desired amendment was futile.id.at.second,kemper sought to amend its complaint to include claims of willful and wanton misconduct on the part of fedex.kemper alleged that fedex had been aware of,and ignored,the repeated theft of valuable shipped goods by employees.kemper argued that fedex knowledge of rampant employee theft and lack of meaningful effort to prevent future thefts from occurring constituted willful and wanton misconduct,and that the conversion exception to the released value doctrine should apply the district court held that even if the exception included a level of willful and intentional conduct so egregious as to rise to the level of conversion for a carrier own use,kemper had not alleged sufficient facts to reach such a level.accordingly,the court refused to allow the amendment to the complaint because it would have been futile to do so.id.at.

federal common law and the released value doctrine 
when a shipper or,as here,a subrogee standing in place of a shipper contests the validity of a contractual clause that limits an air carrier liability we apply federal common law.see hill constr.am.airlines,cir citing cases applying federal law deiro am.airlines,cir first.bank,airlines,cir.although traditional common law forbade a carrier from disclaiming liability for its own negligence,first.bank,at,the released value doctrine allows an air carrier to limit its liability for injury,loss,or destruction of baggage on a released valuation basis.deiro,at citing klicker northwest airlines,cir.in exchange for a lower shipping rate,the shipper is deemed to have released the carrier from liability beyond a stated amount.id.however,the shipper is bound by this agreement only if i he has reasonable notice of the rate structure and ii he is given a fair opportunity to pay a higher rate in order to obtain greater protection.see also new york,hartford rail nothnagle.establishing doctrine for common carriers hill,at first.bank,at.
kemper concedes that the shipper,its insured,had reasonable notice of the limitation of liability.however,it contends that the fedex rate structure is not one that gives the shipper a fair opportunity to pay a higher rate in order to obtain greater protection.deiro,at.kemper argues that the contractually allowed increase to of coverage is an insufficient difference to provide a fair opportunity,especially when the limit applies only to goods of extraordinary value such as jewelry,which are by definition worth significantly more than that limit.
this court has noted that w here air carriage offer s the shipper a choice of paying a higher rate for greater protection,federal courts have normally found those limitations lawful.hill,at citing numerous cases.although we have not had the opportunity to determine when an alternative liability limit is sufficiently high so as to provide a fair opportunity to the shipper,other courts have upheld contractual limitations of a similar magnitude to the one at issue here.first.bank,at choice between and see also united states gold fed.express,choice between and universal computer,allegheny airlines.choice between and klicker,at choice between and.notably,kemper has not cited,nor have we discovered,any case in which a court invalidated a contract providing two discrete levels of coverage we are loath to police this line when other courts have chosen not to do so.
kemper seeks to distinguish the above precedent by pointing out,correctly,that the relevant contractual provisions in these cases provided that the carrier would not accept goods with a declared value above the higher limitation.see first.bank,at shipments with a declared value in excess of are not acceptable for transportation under this tariff.klicker,at no participating carrier will accept property,the declared value of which exceeds.universal computer.at shipments with a declared value in excess of are not acceptable for transportation under this tariff.by contrast,not only did the fedex contract in question not contain such a provision,but the record shows that fedex actively solicited the carriage of jewelry clearly worth more than.
we are not convinced that this distinction makes a difference.first,the cases upholding limitations on lia
