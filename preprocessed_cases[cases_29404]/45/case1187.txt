nearly fifty years after conducting an experiment in which over eight hundred pregnant women ingested a liquid substance to the radioactive iron isotopes,vanderbilt university and the vanderbilt university medical center vanderbilt were sued in a class action lawsuit.vanderbilt settled the lawsuit and then sought indemnity from its insurers,paul fire marine insurance company and paul mercury insurance company and united states fire insurance company.paul entered into a settlement agreement with vanderbilt.fire,on the other hand,refused to indemnify vanderbilt and sought a court judgment to determine the extent of its liability under the terms of the appropriate policies.the district court ruled in favor of fire on the basis that vanderbilt did not give fire timely notice of an occurrence under the terms of the policies.vanderbilt now appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm.
between and,faculty and staff at vanderbilt conducted an experiment in which more than eight hundred pregnant women were fed radioactive iron isotopes in order to facilitate the scientific tracking of iron absorption in pregnant women the experiment or the study.see craft vanderbilt,d.the experiment was conducted as part of the nutrition project.participants in the project later claimed that they were not informed of the radioactive nature of the iron solution they ingested.the participants later stated that they were told the solution was a cocktail or vitamin drink.see ibid.
during the,vanderbilt conducted a survey of the women treated in the experiment,as well as their children the survey or the study.see ibid.the survey involved some interviews and answering questionnaires.no physical touching or medical procedures were involved.the participants in the survey were not informed of the fact that they had been exposed to radiation,nor were they informed of the results of the survey.see ibid.in,vanderbilt published the findings from the survey in the american journal of epidemiology.ruth hagstrom et,long term effects of radioactive iron administered during human pregnancy,am.epidemiology.the survey identified a small,but statistically significant increase in the incidence of cancer in the exposed children compared to an unexposed control group of children.id.at.the survey found that four children who were exposed in utero during the experiment had died of cancer during the,compared to none of the control group.id.at.in one case,the researchers concluded that the incidence of cancer was probably not related to the radiation since other children in the family unexposed to radiation had also died of the same form of cancer.ibid.
in december,the united states department of energy doe requested information regarding the experiment from vanderbilt for use in a congressional hearing at which some of the experiment participants would testify.vanderbilt informed its attorneys of the request.
on february,over women and their children filed a class action lawsuit against vanderbilt the craft litigation.the craft plaintiffs asserted numerous claims against vanderbilt and other defendants related to vanderbilt study and its study.vanderbilt points out that the initial and amended complaints asserted distinct liability based on the study.the craft plaintiffs alleged that in undertaking the study and failing to disclose the nature of the original study,vanderbilt violated the plaintiffs civil rights,acted negligently,and failed to disclose material information.
in,vanderbilt settled the craft litigation for million the craft settlement.this included a payment,leaving vanderbilt portion of the craft settlement at million.the craft settlement specifically mentioned both the study and the study,stating that 
settled claims means any and all claims,causes of action in law or in equity,against the settling defendants arising out of,related to,or as a result of,settling defendants funding participation of any kind or nature in the study and in the study,and all of the facts,omissions events alleged in the complaint or first or second amended complaints or in pretrial order.
the district court approved the craft settlement and dismissed all claims against vanderbilt with prejudice.the court found that any subsequent orders distributing the craft settlement would not affect the final judgment.vanderbilt did not participate in the hearings to distribute the settlement proceeds.the craft settlement was distributed in the following major portions by the district court approximately million in plaintiffs attorneys fees and costs million to the battery claims arising out of the experiment and million to the wrongful death claims arising out of the children deaths in the.
vanderbilt had obtained extensive primary insurance with paul,including hospital professional liability coverage,dating from at least the to the present.vanderbilt supplemented this coverage with excess liability insurance from fire.the relevant excess policies cover the periods july,and july.the policies included provisions requiring exhaustion of primary and other insurance before their coverage could be invoked and required that a covered event must cause injury during the policy period.the policies listed paul as the underlying insurer.
after the craft settlement,paul initially disputed coverage of the claims,in part because vanderbilt had not met its burden of proving the terms and conditions of the coverage provided by paul.fire notes and paul admits that neither paul nor vanderbilt has ever found copies of any alleged policies,although paul stresses that vanderbilt did locate documentary evidence of liability insurance coverage provided by paul in the.paul and vanderbilt entered into a settlement agreement the paul settlement.under the terms of the paul settlement,paul identified five separate and policy years,from and,during which part of the survey was conducted.paul paid vanderbilt a little more than million in defense costs and million as indemnity.vanderbilt in turn released paul for any claims which have been or may in the future be brought arising out of any studies involving the use of radioactive isotopes which were completed prior to july.this specifically included the craft litigation and other litigation involving an experiment conducted by vanderbilt on nearly elementary school children in nashville,tennessee,who were given lemonade that was laced with radioactive iron.see hughes vanderbilt,cir.
the paul settlement stated that nothing in this agreement is intended as or may be construed to be an admission of coverage,fault,liability or wrongdoing of any party.in addition,the paul settlement stated that vanderbilt would not seek any further indemnity payments from paul in the settlement of the craft litigation in the event that any court of competent jurisdiction determines that the payment made by paul did not exhaust any coverage which was or may have been provided by paul to vanderbilt.
after the craft litigation was filed,vanderbilt notified fire.fire accepted notice and acknowledged receipt of the lawsuit.fire refused to defend vanderbilt,however,on the basis that its policies were excess policies.fire took no role in defending the craft litigation.vanderbilt provided fire with status reports and continually requested that fire provide a defense.vanderbilt notified fire of the craft settlement prior to its execution and court approval.
after the craft settlement,vanderbilt sought indemnity from fire at the same time it sought indemnity from paul.vanderbilt sought indemnity pursuant to a provision in fire policies,stating 
it is agreed that the insurance coverage afforded by this policy for hospital professional liability shall,in no event,be less than the coverage provided by underlying insurance listed in schedule 
fire informed vanderbilt that it was working with paul and awaiting its coverage position.upon request,vanderbilt provided fire with all documents from the craft litigation.
after paul and vanderbilt settled claims,fire sued vanderbilt.on january,fire filed a declaratory judgment action against vanderbilt and paul regarding its rights and duties under the policies that fire issued to vanderbilt in the and early.on april,paul filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.fire filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint to add claims for indemnity and contribution,breach of the duty of good faith,and tortious interference.
on july,fire moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether vanderbilt gave fire notice of an occurrence under the terms of its policies.on july,vanderbilt moved for summary judgment on the issue of coverage,fire contractual obligation to indemnify vanderbilt for the amounts vanderbilt paid toward the craft settlement.on august,vanderbilt for summary judgment on the issue of notice.on january,the district court granted fire summary judgment motion,denied vanderbilt motions,granted paul motion to dismiss,and denied fire motion for leave to amend its complaint.on february,vanderbilt filed a notice of appeal.on march,fire filed a notice of conditional appeal related to the district court decision granting paul motion to dismiss.
vanderbilt and fire filed for summary judgment on the issue of notice.fire contends that it is not required to indemnify vanderbilt because vanderbilt did not inform fire of the events upon which the craft litigation was study and the the craft litigation was initiated.vanderbilt contends that the notice it gave to fire in was proper and that,even if the notice was untimely,fire was not prejudiced by the delay.vanderbilt argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to fire on the issue of notice and in denying vanderbilt for summary judgment on this issue.vanderbilt contends that,at the least,the case should proceed to trial on this issue.
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same standard employed by the district court.see national,smith,cir.summary judgment is not necessarily appropriate solely because the parties filed for summary judgment.see goodrich filter,cir.a court may conclude,after reviewing the undisputed material facts agreed upon by the parties and drawing all inferences,in turn,for each party,that a genuine issue exists,in which case the court is not permitted to resolve the matter,but rather,must allow the case to proceed to trial.see ibid.or the court may determine that one party has demonstrated that no genuine issue exists and,therefore,that party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see ibid.
the parties do not dispute that tennessee law governs our interpretation of the insurance policies at issue in this case.therefore,in analyzing the parties for summary judgment on the issue of notice,we are guided by the tennessee supreme court recent decision in alcazar hayes.according to alcazar,under tennessee law,once it is determined that the insured has failed to provide timely notice in accordance with the insurance policy,it is presumed that the insurer has been prejudiced by the breach.ibid.although the insurer is presumed to be prejudiced,the court in alcazar adopted a rebuttable presumption rule,according to which the insured has the burden to proffer competent evidence that the insurer was not prejudiced by the insured delay.ibid.the court rejected the state previous approach,which recognized that notice was a condition precedent to recovery under a policy and which required automatic forfeiture of the a showing of timely notice was not given.see talley state farm fire casualty,cir.therefore,in reviewing the parties for summary judgment on the issue of notice,we must engage in a inquiry.first,we must determine if vanderbilt gave timely notice to fire in accordance with the terms of vanderbilt insurance policies with fire.second,if we determine that vanderbilt did not give timely notice,we must decide if vanderbilt has rebutted the presumption of prejudice to fire.
vanderbilt asserts that the district court erred when it concluded that vanderbilt notice to fire was not timely.
according to the terms of its policies with fire,vanderbilt was to give fire notice of an occurrence as soon as practicable.in full,the provision states 
upon the happening of an occurrence reasonably likely to involve the company hereunder,written notice shall be given as soon as practicable to the company or any of its authorized agents.such notice shall contain particulars sufficient to identify the insured and the fullest information obtainable at the time.
the policies define an occurrence as 
either an accident or happening during the policy period or a continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which unexpectedly and unintentionally cause injury to persons during the policy period.all damages arising out of such exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.
in addition to the provision regarding notice of an occurrence,the policies also included the following provision regarding notice of claims 
the insured shall give like notice of any claim made on account of such occurrence.if legal proceedings are begun the insured,when requested by the company,shall forward to it each paper thereon,or a copy thereof,received by the insured or the insured representatives,together with copies of reports of investigations made by the insured with respect to such claim proceedings.
according to the terms of the policies,vanderbilt had an obligation to notify fire as soon as practicable of an occurrence under the policy and then had an obligation to notify fire as to claims made on account of an occurrence.
the tennessee supreme court has stated that when an insured is required to give notice of an occurrence as soon as practicable,the insured has a duty to give notice when he becomes,or should become,aware of facts which would suggest to a reasonably prudent person that the event for which coverage is sought might reasonably be expected to produce a claim against the insurer.reliance ins.athena cablevision.the court stated that as soon as practicable are not words of precise and definite import.they are roomy words.they provide for more or less free play.they are in their nature ambulatory and subject under the guiding rule,to the impact of particular facts on particular cases.ibid.quoting transamerica ins.parrott.the court stated that the words must be construed as requiring the notice within a reasonable time under all the circumstances,to effectuate the objects and purposes of the notice clause.reliance,at quoting transamerica,at.
vanderbilt notice of an occurrence to fire came in,immediately upon service of the craft complaint.vanderbilt offers several arguments to support its contention that the notice was given as soon as practicable.vanderbilt relies heavily on its assertion that it sought coverage from fire solely for the claims arising out of the study,not those arising out of the study,since vanderbilt had policies with fire during the time of the study and not during the time of the study.vanderbilt claims that prior to,it neither knew,nor could have known,that it faced liability for the study.in the alternative,vanderbilt argues that even if the notice provision were to extend to the study,it neither knew,nor could have known,that it could be held liable for that study as well.vanderbilt relies on testimony of the authors of the study that they were unaware of any potential liability to vanderbilt as a result of either study.they testified that the study did not demonstrate a relationship and that the findings were not considered dramatic.
vanderbilt argues that the district court improperly weighed the evidence,reached its own factual conclusions,and created a heightened standard of notice for a sophisticated insured.specifically,vanderbilt points to the following statement in the district court opinion 
w hile the authors of the article relating to the study may have testified years after the fact in the midst of litigation that these findings were not dramatic,the potential for liability arising out of the experiments seems obvious and should have been obvious,especially to a sophisticated institution like vanderbilt.
vanderbilt contends that by establishing a sophisticated insured test,the district court misapplied the reasonably prudent person test from reliance insurance.at the least,vanderbilt argues,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the issue of notice.
vanderbilt also argues that,as an excess insurer,fire was entitled to notice only if vanderbilt was aware that a claim was likely to exceed the limits of paul primary hospital professional liability coverage.see evanston ins.stonewall surplus lines ins,cir transamerica,at.vanderbilt claims this is consistent with fire policies,which state that notice is required u pon the happening of an occurrence reasonably likely to involve the company hereunder.vanderbilt asserts that notice would be required of a claim likely to exceed,since this was the aggregate policy limit of the coverage provided by paul.vanderbilt points out that actual claims against vanderbilt between,even for wrongful death,never exceeded.vanderbilt contends that the district court erred in considering other tennessee wrongful death cases from the that had involved awards of over,and then concluding that it was possible that the four wrongful deaths alleged as a result of the study could collectively have exceeded.
vanderbilt arguments do not persuade us either that vanderbilt notice to fire was timely or that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether vanderbilt notice was timely.vanderbilt arguments are focused on whether vanderbilt gave timely notice of a claim under the policy,rather than whether vanderbilt gave timely notice of an occurrence under the policy.it is undisputed that vanderbilt gave fire timely notice of a claim under the policy since it informed fire of the craft litigation soon after the case was filed.what is disputed is whether vanderbilt gave timely notice of an occurrence.
under tennessee law,notice of an occurrence is required when an insured,becomes,or should become,aware of facts which would suggest to a reasonably prudent person that the event for which coverage is sought might reasonably be expected to produce a claim against the insured.reliance,at.vanderbilt contends that the event for which it seeks coverage is the study,since the craft plaintiffs asserted claims of negligence,violation of civil rights,and failure to disclose material information based on the study,in addition to the causes of action the plaintiffs asserted based on the study.vanderbilt also points out that the study occurred during fire policy coverage years.we hold that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether,prior to,vanderbilt was aware or should have been aware of facts that would suggest to a reasonably prudent person that the study might reasonably be expected to produce a claim against it.furthermore,we hold that there is no genuine issue of material fact that,since vanderbilt was aware of an occurrence as early as,vanderbilt year delay in not giving fire notice of an occurrence constituted untimely notice.
vanderbilt was aware of,or should have been aware of,a number of facts that would suggest to a reasonably prudent person that the study might reasonably be expected to produce a claim against it.the study was inextricably related to the study.this is demonstrated by the premise of the study,which was to investigate and report the consequences arising from the study,not to conduct a new experiment.furthermore,the craft litigation was based on both the study and the study.by the time the study was conducted,vanderbilt was already over twenty the experiment it had conducted in the and the fact that it had not informed the participants in the at the time or they ingested radioactive isotopes.then,by the time the results of the study were published in,vanderbilt was aware that it had not informed the participants in the study of the purpose of the survey that was sent to them it had not informed the participants in the study that they had ingested radiation over twenty years ago and it had not informed the participants in the study of the results of the study.moreover,vanderbilt was aware of the findings of the study,which revealed a heightened incidence of cancer in the children involved in the experiment and the knowledge that four children of the pregnant mothers who had ingested radiation as part of the experiment had died of cancer in the.
even if it could be argued that,with all of this knowledge,vanderbilt could not have been aware of a claim based on the study,fire has presented undisputed evidence of a united states department of energy request for information from vanderbilt regarding the experiment for use in a congressional hearing at which some of the experiment participants would testify.vanderbilt immediately informed its attorneys of the inquiry.if vanderbilt had not been aware of an occurrence under the policy in,the doe investigation should have made vanderbilt aware of an occurrence by,yet vanderbilt still waited to give notice to fire until the craft lawsuit was filed against vanderbilt in.
vanderbilt relies on testimony of the researchers who conducted the study who stated that they did not anticipate liability from either study and that the study did not demonstrate a relationship.however,the researchers testimony as to a relationship is belied by their own published results of the study,which stated that 
for exposed children,one case of leukemia and two cases of sarcoma were discovered.no malignancies occurred in the children in the comparison group.this represents a small,but statistically significantly,increase,and is consistent with radiobiologic experience 
hagstrom et,supra page,at.although this does not constitute overwhelming proof of a link between the experiment and increased malignancy,it does demonstrate that there was some link and that the researchers involved in the study were aware of it at the time they published their results in.
the fact that the vanderbilt researchers testified that they did not expect a claim to be produced from either study is not,by itself,sufficient to prevent summary judgment in favor of fire.an insured can not rely solely on its subjective beliefs as to whether it expected a claim to arise out of an accident.that would divest the insurer of the opportunity to make that determination for itself.
the trouble with the contention of the insured that they reasonably believed that neither a claim nor a lawsuit would arise out of an accident,is that they assumed to become the judges of the prospect for claim and suit,whereas one of the purposes of the notice of accident is to afford opportunity to the insurer,the responsible party in case the policy is to continue in effect,to decide that very question and to act in accordance with its own judgment.
nationwide mut.ins.shannon,quoting malloy head.although the beliefs of vanderbilt lawyers regarding whether they reasonably believed a claim would arise might be given some weight,the opinions of scientific researchers not trained in the law must be given little weight.the testimony relied upon by vanderbilt is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether vanderbilt had knowledge of an occurrence prior to.
the remaining question is whether vanderbilt had knowledge of an occurrence that was reasonably likely to involve fire.in other words,we must determine if there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether vanderbilt had knowledge of an occurrence that was reasonably likely to produce a claim over,and therefore trigger fire excess policy.the district court did not err in relying on other tennessee wrongful death cases with damages over to conclude that,in the aggregate,wrongful death claims based on the deaths of four children born of pregnant mothers who had participated in the experiment could exceed in damages.moreover,vanderbilt was not only aware of the four deaths,but it was aware that hundreds of pregnant women and their children had participated in the study.a reasonably prudent person could conclude that it might reasonably be expected that these hundreds of individuals could assert claims,as the craft plaintiffs did in,based on battery,negligence,failure to disclose material information,violation of civil rights,and other causes
