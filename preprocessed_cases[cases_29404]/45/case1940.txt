a package of paintings by prominent ukrainian artists,en route from odessa to california via united parcel service,arrived at a kentucky warehouse,then vanished like the ark of the covenant the shipper,mark kesel,contends that the paintings were worth far more than the declared value listed on the waybill,and seeks to hold united parcel service and ups custom brokerages,collectively,ups liable for the full value of the paintings.
we must decide whether ups violated the released valuation doctrine,which requires carriers to give interstate shippers reasonable notice of limited liability and a fair opportunity to buy more insurance.ups provided notice of its limited liability per shipment in the documents that constituted its shipping contract.although kesel,through his agent,was able to purchase insurance in excess of the limitation,ups rebuffed the agent attempt to insure the paintings for more than their value as stated on a ukrainian customs form.the district court,on summary judgment,concluded that ups complied with the released valuation doctrine,and limited its liability to.we agree and affirm.
background 
kesel is a corporate executive in the high technology arena and a sponsor of a foundation that distributes fine art from russia and the ukraine.during a trip to the ukraine,kesel and an artist,sergei belik,visited studios and selected seven paintings for an exhibition that the foundation planned to hold in san francisco.
before leaving odessa,kesel asked belik to ship the paintings to california through ups.he told belik to declare the paintings at for customs purposes and to insure them for,a figure based on kesel belief that the paintings could be sold in the united states for to apiece.
as required by ukrainian law,belik took the paintings to the customs commission in odessa.according to belik,if the commission decides that a work of art is not an antique,it does not estimate its artistic worth,but instead assigns a value based on the cost of materials.belik paid the customs duties and the commission gave him a permit form that listed the value of the paintings as.
belik took the customs form and the paintings to the ups office in odessa.he told the ups clerk that he wanted to insure the paintings for.after consulting by phone with a central office,the ups clerk categorically refused to insure the paintings for more than.belik,without contacting kesel,went ahead and shipped all seven paintings in a single package.on the waybill,the value appears in the box entitled declared value for insurance.belik filled in the addresses on the waybill and signed it.
when the paintings did not arrive in california,kesel called ups,which traced the package to its international warehouse in kentucky.further efforts to locate the paintings failed,however,and they are presumed to be lost.
kesel sued ups in california court,alleging numerous federal and state claims,and seeking in damages for the loss of the paintings.after ups removed the case to federal court,kesel amended his complaint to allege claims for negligence and breach of contract under federal common law,which governs contractual clauses limiting the liability of interstate carriers for damage to goods shipped by air.see king jewelry,fed.express,cir.
the district court granted summary judgment for ups,limiting its liability to.the court concluded that ups had satisfied the released valuation doctrine.ups shipping contract provided reasonable notice of limited liability,the court reasoned,because the waybill and other documents informed the shipper that ups would not be liable for more than the per package released value unless the shipper declared a higher value on the waybill.although these shipping documents imposed an upper limit of on this additional insurance,the court concluded that ups had given kesel a fair opportunity to purchase greater liability because belik insured the paintings for than the released value that otherwise would have applied.
discussion 
i.the belik declaration 
as a preliminary matter,kesel argues that the district court erroneously excluded belik declaration.the district court concluded that kesel had failed to lay a proper foundation for the declaration because he provided no explanation about how the document was translated,who that translator was,or the expertise of the translator.we review this evidentiary decision for an abuse of discretion and may not reverse absent some prejudice.wendt host,cir citation omitted.here,we need not consider whether the district court abused its discretion because kesel does not point to any prejudice from the purported error and acknowledges that the district court permitted the admission of belik deposition transcript in lieu of the declaration.the transcript contains all of the pertinent testimony and information that appears in the declaration and,as the district court noted,the declaration would not have changed its decision.thus,we consider the evidence offered in belik deposition in evaluating this summary judgment case on appeal.
ii.the released valuation doctrine 
whether kesel can recover more than the declared value for the lost paintings is an issue of federal common law that we review de novo.see king jewelry,at milne truck lines makita,cir holding that the construction of a tariff presents a question of law for the court to resolve.citations omitted.the essential facts regarding the shipment are not in dispute.the released valuation doctrine,a federal common law creation,delineates what a carrier must do to limit its liability.id under this doctrine,in exchange for a low rate,the shipper is deemed to have released the carrier from liability beyond a stated amount.deiro american airlines,cir.
ups can limit its liability to only if it provided kesel with reasonable notice of limited liability,and a fair opportunity to purchase higher liability.burlington air express,cir citation omitted see also deiro,at t he shipper is bound only if he has reasonable notice of the rate structure and is given a fair opportunity to pay a higher rate in order to obtain greater protection.citations omitted.
ups shipping agreement with kesel comprised the air waybill that belik signed,the guide to ups services the service guide,and ups general tariff containing classifications,rules and practices for the transportation of property the tariff.see king jewelry,at noting that the airbill and service guide formed the contract between the shipper and fedex.as we discuss below,because these documents gave kesel reasonable notice of limited liability,and ups gave kesel a fair opportunity to purchase greater liability coverage,the district court properly limited ups liability to the amount stated on the waybill 
notice of limited liability 
ups waybill,service guide,and tariff each contain prominent notices of the liability limitation in plain language.king jewelry,at.for example,the front of the waybill instructs the reader in bold type to see instructions on back.the reverse side of the waybill explains that any liability of ups shall be limited to proven damages up to a maximum per shipment of the local currency equivalent of usd per shipment,unless a higher value has been declared ups service guide and tariff both contain similar language 
kesel does not dispute the presence of the limited liability language on the shipping documents.rather,he argues that he lacked notice of ups liability limitation because the waybill and other materials are written in belik can not the back of the waybill was smudged.also,according to kesel,he and belik misunderstood the purpose of the insurance they sought to buy from ups,mistakenly believing that it would provide them with additional protection above and beyond ups liability for the full value of the paintings.
despite an effort to suggest he was duped,kesel can not escape the broad reach of our precedent regarding notice of limited liability f ederal common law has never required actual notice of a carrier liability limitation.deiro,at citation omitted.nor is actual possession of the bill of lading with the liability limit required before a party with an economic interest in the shipped goods can be held to the limitation,at quoting royal ins.service,cir internal quotation marks omitted alteration in the original.kesel,who is fluent in english and had previously shipped expensive items through as electronic equipment insured for up to a million how to find out the extent of ups liability.deiro,at noting that an experienced commercial air traveler had ample opportunity to become familiar with the carrier liability limitation.whatever their alleged naivete in matters of international shipping,it would be unfair to place the loss on ups merely because belik or kesel now claim to have misunderstood the effect of the liability limitation commonly used by interstate carriers.norton jim phillips horse,cir.such a result would effectively spell the death knell for liability limitations in interstate shipping and dramatically alter the fairly settled landscape that defines the relationship between the shipper and the carrier.
fair opportunity to purchase additional liability coverage 
the heart of kesel case is that ups denied him a fair opportunity to purchase greater liability coverage because it refused to let belik insure the paintings for more than fraction of the maximum listed in ups waybill,service guide,and tariff although this argument seemingly has appeal,it is inconsistent with king jewelry,in which we held that the released valuation doctrine only requires a fair opportunity to purchase a higher liability,not necessarily up to the full value of the item.at citations omitted.ups in fact did allow belik to buy insurance for more than the standard per package limit that otherwise would have applied.
in king jewelry,the plaintiff shipped marble candelabra through fedex and attempted to insure them for their full value.id.when the candelabra were damaged during shipment,fedex sought to limit its liability to,which the waybill stated was the maximum liability for items of extraordinary value.id.at.we held that fedex was liable only for,and that it had complied with the released valuation doctrine by insuring the candelabra for that than their actual value,but higher than the released value.id.at.
kesel likens his situation to a case in which the carrier altogether refused to give shippers the opportunity to buy additional insurance.see klicker northwest airlines,cir.in klicker,the shippers informed the northwest airlines ticket agent that their dog was worth,but the agent would not permit them to declare any value for the dog or buy any additional coverage.id.the dog died during the flight.we held that the airline was liable for the entire value of the dog,and that the airline could not rely on its tariff provision that limited recovery to in the absence of a declared value.id.at.kesel case,however,presents a different scenario.in contrast to the airline in klicker,ups permitted belik to declare a value for the paintings and to insure them for the declared value.
ups does not have carte blanche to impose arbitrary limits,irrespective of its tariff and waybill,on the insurance it offers to shippers.nonetheless,in the context of its dual role as customs agent and carrier,ups complied with its tariff and shipping agreement in limiting available insurance to the value listed on the customs documents.the service guide explains that,for international shipments,the shipper must provide required documentation for customs clearance by providing required documentation,the shipper certifies that all statements and information relating to exportation and importation are true and correct.according to the guide,ups requires the shipper to submit an invoice listing,among other things,the total value of each item,and the shipper appoints ups as the agent for performance of customs clearance,where allowed by law.
given these shipment guidelines and the circumstances of kesel shipment,ups complied with the released valuation doctrine in limiting the insurance to the value listed on the form presented with the paintings.this procedure did not deprive kesel of proper notice.belik admits that the ups agent clearly told him that it would not insure the paintings for more than the customs value,and belik,without consulting kesel,chose to ship through ups fully aware of the limited liability.nothing here supports a claim of coercion or misinformation.
the opportunity to purchase additional liability coverage from ups was fair and it did not leave belik in the lurch.belik could have bought separate insurance elsewhere or shipped with a different carrier instead,belik shipped the paintings through ups,aware that he had only purchased worth of liability,but hoping in this particular case everything would be as normal.through his agent,kesel took the gamble that the paintings would not vanish.when they did,he was stuck with the bargain he liability is limited to the declared value stated on the waybill 
i respectfully dissent.the majority misconstrues our decision in king jewelry,fed.express,cir,effectively permitting common carriers to manipulate their rate structures by adding unpublished terms to their tariffs at the time of shipment.even more troubling,the majority holds that a shipper has presumptively been afforded a fair opportunity to purchase additional coverage anytime she could have bought separate insurance elsewhere or shipped with a different carrier.op.at.in other words,after this decision,a carrier may comply with the requirements of the released valuation doctrine by posting a sign listing some but not all of their terms and doing business in a location where there are other carriers or insurance providers.this evisceration of the protection afforded by the released valuation doctrine is unwarranted and unwise.because i believe that,construing the facts in the light most favorable to kesel,ups did not provide a fair opportunity to purchase greater liability coverage,i must dissent.
as the majority recognizes,under the released valuation doctrine,
a common carrier can lawfully limit recovery to an amount less than the actual loss sustained only if it grants its customers a fair opportunity to choose between higher or lower liability by paying a correspondingly greater or lesser charge t he shipper is bound only if he has reasonable notice of the rate structure and a fair opportunity to pay the higher rate in order to obtain greater protection.
deiro am.airlines,cir internal citations omitted.the purpose of the released valuation doctrine is to ensure that the shipper has an opportunity to make an informed choice between shipping at a lower cost with limited liability,and,on the other,separately purchasing insurance or shipping at a higher cost without limited liability.burlington air express,cir.limited liability provisions are prima facie valid if the face of the air waybill recites the liability limitation and the means to avoid it.id.citing royal ins.serv,cir.thus,the notice provisions and the fair opportunity requirement are inextricably linked,as a shipper must have a fair opportunity to insure shipments pursuant to the terms of which she was given notice.
in the instant case,kesel was provided notice of ups general limited liability provisions through its waybill,service guide,and tariff however,not one of these publications stated or even implied that kesel was prohibited from insuring his package for a value greater than what appeared on the ukrainian customs form,or that a shipper is in any way restricted from submitting a speculative declared value for the purposes of acquiring additional insurance.before kesel passed on the responsibility of shipping to his agent,belik,he reasonably believed that,in order to insure the paintings,he had only to declare their value on the ups waybill.nevertheless,as the majority concedes,the ups clerk categorically refused to insure the paintings under the terms as set out in ups waybill,tariff,or service guide.in contrast to the majority assertion,see op.at,belik was not allowed to insure his shipment for the declared value that he provided to ups.the ups clerk would only allow belik to ship the paintings with ups if he agreed to declare them for the value that the ups clerk had determined should
