on june,rohm and haas promoted billy allred to be the production manager of its louisville,kentucky facility.in his new position,allred became eligible for rohm and haas health and welfare plan for salaried employees,which provided a basic life insurance benefit of plus three times the employee annual salary.the plan also gave employees the option of purchasing supplemental life insurance in increments up to three times their base salary.allred purchased supplemental insurance of of his base salary.
in the fall of,rohm and haas announced a change to the plan life insurance benefits.it mailed a booklet entitled time to enroll for your benefits to all salaried employees,which noted that t here are a number of changes to your health care and group insurance benefits for,ja,and explained the material modifications to the plan life insurance coverage.for,the company decreased the basic life insurance benefit to two times an employee salary and increased the maximum supplemental coverage that employees could purchase to six times their salary in increments.it also eliminated the basic life insurance benefit for all active employees.the booklet also noted that employees did not need to enroll in the new plan if they want ed to keep the same supplemental employee life insurance coverage they had last year,as long as it was in increments.ja.
included with the booklet was an enrollment worksheet that listed information about an employee and his dependents,the coverage he would automatically receive if he did not call to enroll,as well as the plans,and their monthly costs,for which the employee was eligible in.ja.the booklet advised each employee be sure to check your enrollment worksheet to confirm the life insurance you receive in if you do call the benefits center by december to enroll.ja.it also urged each employee to review the worksheet for accuracy and to call the benefits center right away and speak to a representative if any errors or omissions were found.ja.
the benefits listed in allred attached worksheet differed from the benefits to which he was entitled under the new plan.as allred default coverage,for example,it listed the features of his prior coverage plus three times his base salary as his basic coverage and of his base salary as his supplemental one benefit of which was accurate under the new plan.allred total coverage thus was listed as and required allred to contribute each month.because allred never called to enroll in the new plan,rohm and haas confirmed by letter on december,that he would receive the default coverage.
on february,rohm and haas confirmed allred coverage for the period starting march but recalculated his total benefit to be allred had received a raise in the interim and his monthly contribution to be.the company calculated allred anticipated benefit using the same mistaken formula it had used before.
on april,rohm and haas sent a letter to allred confirming his coverage for the period starting may.this letter no longer used the old formula for calculating benefits but instead followed the formula described in the booklet a primary life insurance benefit equal to twice his base salary and a supplemental insurance benefit of of his base salary.correspondingly,allred monthly contribution decreased to.the letter,however,still listed the flat coverage as a basic benefit,so allred anticipated total life insurance coverage was listed as.a separate letter from rohm and haas,dated july,confirmed these calculations.
allred died on december.rohm and haas sent amanda crosby,the administratrix of his estate,in life insurance proceeds based on allred coverage as described in the booklet.on august,noting the discrepancy between the amount paid and the amount listed on allred enrollment worksheet,crosby sent a letter to the rohm and haas benefits center requesting plan documents related to allred life insurance coverage.after receiving no response,crosby again wrote the benefits center,making the same request,on october.because the benefits center was not the administrator and was not operated by rohm and haas,rohm and haas did not receive either letter until november.on january,rohm and haas responded to crosby requests by letter explaining the changes made to the plan in the fall of and by attaching the booklet along with relevant portions of the former summary plan description.on january,crosby acknowledged receipt of rohm and haas january letter and requested a copy of the entire spd and any other information concerning survivor pension benefits.ja.on february,rohm and haas sent crosby the summary plan description from the fall of.
crosby filed a claim for additional insurance benefits with the plan administrator,who denied her claim.crosby then filed a complaint in federal district court seeking to recover benefits due to her under the terms of the plan,a b,and claiming that rohm and haas had failed to furnish requested information to her in violation of c.on for summary judgment,the district court held that rohm and haas had validly amended the plan and that the terms described in the booklet trumped those in allred individualized worksheets.the court also declined to assess penalties against rohm and haas under c because rohm and haas made a attempt to comply with crosby request and its failure to comply with all of her requests did not prejudice her in any meaningful way.ja.crosby appeals both decisions.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.eeoc of detroit,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,show s that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.because the rohm and haas health and welfare plan invested the administrator with discretion to construe its terms,we review the administrator decision under the deferential arbitrary and capricious standard.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d.and because a district court has discretion in deciding whether to assess penalties under c,we review such decisions for an abuse of discretion.bartling fruehauf,cir.
