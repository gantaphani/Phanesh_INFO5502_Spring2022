this case presents a recurring problem under illinois insurance law governing an insurer duty to defend under a commercial general liability policy.suppose a buyer sues a manufacturer for supplying defective products,but the buyer does not specify the elements of its claims for damages in the complaint.a commercial general liability policy is in tended to cover,among other risks,the insured liability for accidental bodily injury and property damage caused by its defective products.the policy is not intended,however,to cover the costs of replacing or repairing the defective products themselves.the parties agree here that if the unhappy buyer alleges that the defective products have caused bodily injury or damage to property other than the defective products themselves,a commercial general liability policy will require the insurer to defend its insured.they also agree that if the unhappy buyer alleges only a claim for repair or replacement of the defective products,the policy will not require the insurer to defend what amounts to only a breach of contract claim against its insured.
the problem presented here is whether the insurer has a duty to defend the insured when the unhappy buyer makes only general allegations for costs incurred as a result of the defective products,without explicitly disavowing any claim for damage to property other than the defective products themselves.the unhappy buyer claim in this case has all the earmarks of a pure breach of contract claim for costs of repair,replacement,or similar economic losses not covered by the insurance policy.there is no indication that the insured manufacturer products caused damage to any property other than the defective products themselves.although the insured manufacturer offers speculative hypotheses about scenarios that are not literally inconsistent with the unhappy buyer allegations,those speculative hypotheses are not sufficient to trigger the insurer duty to defend under the commercial general liability policies.we affirm the district court decision to that effect.
i.the dispute between microplastics and valeo 
the district court granted summary judgment for the insurer,amerisure mutual insurance company.the relevant facts are undisputed,consisting primarily of the terms of the relevant insurance policies and the contents of various pleadings in the underlying lawsuit between the unhappy buyer and defendantappellant microplastics.microplastics manufactures insert molding components,which are plastic pieces used to manufacture various mechanical devices.the unhappy buyer in this case was valeo security systems.in,valeo began buying microplastics components and used them to manufacture automobile door latch assemblies that it sold to automobile manufacturers referred to in industry jargon as original equipment manufacturers or oems.the supply relationship between microplastics and valeo was governed by purchase orders that included quality specifications and prices 
the relationship soured quickly.by october,one unidentified oem began complaining to valeo about problems with the door latch assemblies.it became clear to all involved that microplastics was selling valeo defective parts.microplastics has forwarded some creative hypotheses for how these defects manifested themselves,but the only details with any factual support in the record are found in a february email from valeo to microplastics president mike roberts identifying the following defects 
the issue is that when we launched with production parts from microplastics we had no idea your process was allowing some parts which 
the potting material did not fill the voids under the terminals.
the potting was not adequately cured to prevent water intrusion.
the potting material did not bond to the upper housing.
in addition the bus bar was not as it should have been,limiting protection,and elevating the effect of every issue above.each of these is the direct result of your process which you must test and qualify to assure compliance,not valeo.
ex.a.an internal email from roberts to microplastics managers a few months earlier seemed to acknowledge both the problem and microplastics responsibility for it 
w e have to get rid of valeo i am convinced that this piece of crap is a major recall in the making.it will take a while to make it go away but it needs to go away i apologize for being greedy and wishful thinking that valeo would turn out okay.nothing comes from being greedy and stupid.i was both.saw the train wreck coming two years ago but kept it going because we needed the work.next time i do that somebody,or all of you,slap me.
these problems remained unresolved by august,when valeo sent a demand letter to microplastics formally asserting that microplastics had breached the quality and engineering specifications of the purchase orders.the letter stated that valeo had chosen to terminate and cancel the purchase orders for cause and said that valeo would apply a debit of about to offset the damages incurred by valeo due to microplastics breaches.
ii.litigation and valeo counterclaim 
settlement negotiations fell through,and in october microplastics filed suit for breach of contract against valeo.microplastics alleged that valeo had failed to pay invoices for parts delivered,totaling more than.in november,valeo filed a counterclaim.see microplastics,valeo security systems.count i,the only count pertinent here,reiterated the allegations of the demand letter,seeking setoff and damages for economic losses incurred as a result of microplastics breaches of the purchase orders by failing to comply with engineering and quality specifications.
iii.the insurance dispute 
appellee amerisure insured microplastics from july to july under a series of commercial general liability policies the cgl policies.the cgl policies required amerisure to pay microplastics if it should ever be legally obligated to pay damages to any third party as a result of property damage or personal injury caused by an occurrence.the cgl policies also required amerisure to defend microplastics against any lawsuit seeking such covered damages.the cgl policies defined property damage as 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
amerisure was first notified of the valeo counterclaim on march,by microplastics insurance broker.on april,amerisure sent a letter to microplastics with the heading reservation of rights.amerisure acknowledged receipt of the valeo counterclaim and advised that it was unable to provide microplastics with a defense until we have completed our investigation.the letter cited the relevant coverage provisions and stated that there appears to be a question as to whether or not this incident is a covered claim under the general liability policies issued to microplastics.it does not appear that there has been any property damage caused by an occurrence.in a june,letter,amerisure informed microplastics that it was declining coverage and would not defend microplastics against the valeo counterclaim.amerisure then filed this action on july,seeking a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify microplastics with respect to the valeo counterclaim.
without the aid of amerisure defense,microplastics sought to settle the pending claims.on september,microplastics and valeo entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims between them.no cash changed hands under the agreement,but microplastics issued a credit memo for the amount that microplastics had billed valeo for its supply of the allegedly defective supply parts,more than.the record does not reveal that microplastics or amerisure gained any new knowledge of the nature of the customer costs referenced in valeo counterclaim.
meanwhile,the present action between amerisure and microplastics proceeded.the parties filed for partial summary judgment on whether amerisure had a duty to defend.the district court granted summary judgment for amerisure,finding that the valeo counterclaim did not trigger a duty to defend because it did not allege property damage or bodily injury under the cgl policies.microplastics appealed 
iv.the duty to defend 
microplastics contends that the valeo counterclaim allegations potentially fell within the cgl policies property damage provision,and therefore triggered amerisure duty to defend under illinois law.microplastics argument relies entirely on hypothetical situations rather than on any facts actually alleged in the valeo counterclaim.under illinois law,an insurer has no duty to defend unless the underlying claim contains explicit factual allegations that potentially fall within policy coverage.because the valeo counterclaim contained no such factual allegations,and because the allegations were fully consistent with a simple claim for breach of warranty,amerisure had no duty to defend.
under illinois law,a liability insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify,but it is not unlimited.see national casualty mcfatridge,cir american family mutual ins.mcnaughton builders.to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured,we compare the factual allegations of the underlying complaint or in this case,counterclaim to the language of the insurance policy.lyerla amco ins,cir general agents ins.of america,midwest sporting goods.if the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall within,or potentially within,the policy coverage,the insurer duty to defend arises.santa best craft,llc paul fire and marine ins,cir quotations omitted crum and forster managers resolution trust.both the policy terms and the allegations in the underlying complaint are liberally construed in favor of the insured,and any doubts and ambiguities are resolved against the insurer.state farm fire and casualty perez,citing pekin ins.beu.however,the general rules that favor the insured must yield to the paramount rule of reasonable construction which guides all contract interpretations.western states ins.bobo,quoting travelers ins.quote,quotation marks omitted.
an allegation of defective or faulty workmanship in the insured own products does not,by itself,allege property damage under a standard cgl policy like these amerisure policies.such policies are intended to protect the insured from liability for injury or damage to the persons or property of others they are not intended to pay the costs associated with repairing or replacing the insured defective work and products,which are purely economic losses.west bend mutual ins.people of illinois,quoting travelers ins.eljer manufacturing,quotation marks omitted.
the parties do not dispute the legal background we have provided thus far.the dispute here lies in the application of these rules to the vague allegations in valeo counterclaim against microplastics.valeo counterclaim had all the earmarks of a buyer breach of contract claim for products that failed to meet the agreed specifications,resulting in costs for repair or replacement,and perhaps additional consequential damages in the form of customer for related costs.see generally article,chapter of the uniform commercial code as adopted by illinois,ilcs et.valeo counterclaim included no indication that it was asserting a claim for damage to property other than the defective products themselves.
microplastics bases its asserted right to a defense from amerisure on the allegations of paragraphs and of the valeo counterclaim.those paragraphs alleged 
valeo customer with respect to the component parts charged valeo for its costs associated with the defects.
microplastics is liable to valeo for the costs charged to valeo associated with the defects.
the counterclaim concluded by requesting relief in the form of an order declaring that valeo is entitled to setoff or recoupment of all damages it has incurred on account of microplastics breaches of the purchase orders against any amount that may be due to microplastics by valeo,and an award of damages that might be otherwise due microplastics from valeo under the purchase orders prior to application of valeo setoff,attorney fees,and litigation costs.so valeo customer charged it for unspecified costs associated with the defective parts originally supplied by.
microplastics points out correctly that these general allegations do not logically foreclose the theoretical possibility that valeo customer charged back costs resulting from potentially covered damage to property beyond the defective products.is that theoretical possibility enough to trigger the duty to defend under a cgl policy 
microplastics argues that the answer is yes,relying on the generous illinois rule that,if the facts alleged in the underlying complaint fall within,or potentially within,the policy coverage,the insurer duty to defend arises.santa best craft,at crum and forster,at.if these allegations by valeo of unspecified costs charged back by its customer are enough to trigger the duty to defend,then we would expect that cgl insurers would quickly find themselves responsible for defending routine breach of warranty disputes between commercial manufacturers and their buyers.
microplastics attempts to fill in details in the vague allegations by hypothesizing situations which,if alleged or true,would bring the costs charged back to valeo within the scope of property damage covered by the cgl policies.for example,microplastics speculates,the costs might refer to damage to the personal property of consumers who bought cars.microplastics hypothesizes that its defective parts might have caused trunk lids to open spontaneously,causing the buyers property in trunks to spill onto the roadways.or perhaps the defective parts allowed water to leak into the passenger or trunk areas,causing damage to property stored in the vehicles.microplastics contends that because the language of the counterclaim does not specifically foreclose these hypothetical situations,the allegations potentially implicate property damage under the cgl policies and therefore trigger amerisure duty to defend under illinois law.see santa best craft,at.
this interpretation goes too far.while an insurer duty to defend in illinois is broad,it is not without limits.the duty to defend applies only to facts that are explicitly alleged it is the actual complaint,not some hypothetical version,that must be considered.del monte fresh produce,transportation ins,cir finding no duty to defend,quoting connecticut indemnity der travel service,cir finding no duty to defend because the policy excluded willful misconduct and the underlying complaint alleged only willful misconduct the fact that federal law also permitted the underlying plaintiff to recover for insured simple negligence was irrelevant because the underlying complaint alleged no facts to support a negligence claim quotation marks omitted see also allianz ins.guidant,rejecting insured view that the underlying claim alleged bodily injury because that interpretation relied on an application of the policy provision to hypothetical situations,rather than to the facts actually alleged hypothetical factual situations are simply irrelevant.when an insurer determines whether it has a duty to defend,implied claims that are not specifically alleged can be ignored.del monte,at although insured reading of the allegations may be true in the abstract,the specific language of the allegations placed them within a policy exclusion.
applying these principles here,we conclude that the valeo counterclaim did not trigger amerisure duty to defend because it did not allege any facts that could potentially fall within the scope of covered property damage.the valeo counterclaim made no specific allegation of property damage.the pertinent portion of the counterclaim simply alleged that the automobile manufacturer oem who purchased the door latch assemblies charged valeo for its costs associated with the defects.it did not allege,or even suggest,that these costs have any relation to property damage.further,there is no support in the counterclaim or elsewhere in the record for microplastics theory that these costs are
