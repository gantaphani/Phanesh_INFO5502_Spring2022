this case contains a new twist on the seemingly endless litigation over the scope of workers compensation exclusivity.unlike the typical case where an employee wishes to sue his or her employer or workers compensation insurance carrier,this case involves a group of medical providers that wish to sue a group of workers compensation insurers.in their novel complaint,the medical providers allege the insurers conspired to put them out of business by intentionally mishandling their lien claims before the workers compensation appeals board wcab and seek only to recover the damage to their businesses.we now consider whether the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation act wca preempt the statutory and tort claims asserted by these medical providers and conclude that these provisions bar some claims but not others.
factual and procedural background 
because t his case comes to us after the sustaining of a general demurrer,we accept as true all the material allegations of the complaint.shoemaker myers cal d,shoemaker.the following facts appear from the allegations of the complaint 
plaintiffs are licensed medical groups that provided services to employees with workers compensation claims,and medical management companies under contract to the medical groups to provide these services,plaintiffs employed or contracted with physicians to treat and evaluate employees injured in the workplace.after promptly paying these physicians,plaintiffs would seek compensation from the workers compensation insurance carrier of the employee employer.
defendants are workers compensation insurance carriers at a meeting in,defendants decided to put plaintiffs out of business by delaying payment or refusing to pay for services rendered by plaintiffs to injured workers.as part of their scheme,defendants agreed to keep the meeting secret and to deny the existence of their plan to eliminate plaintiffs.
in subsequent meetings,defendants discussed strategies and distributed hit lists of targeted medical providers,including plaintiffs.reminiscent of the methods used by great benefit insurance company,the villain in the john grisham thriller,the rainmaker doubleday,defendants developed procedures for delaying or avoiding payment to plaintiffs using false,fraudulent and frivolous objections.defendants incorporated these procedures into their claims manuals and training protocols.defendants also misled plaintiffs into believing they would promptly pay all valid lien claims.meanwhile,they publicly accused plaintiffs of being fraud mills and advised other insurance carriers not to pay plaintiffs claims.
due to the no pay or slow pay tactics of defendants,plaintiffs suffered heavy business losses.because plaintiffs promptly paid the treating physician even if they failed to receive timely compensation,plaintiffs were especially susceptible to a disruption in cash flow.not surprisingly,defendants tactics were quite effective,as the average time from billing to payment rose dramatically and the percentage collected by plaintiffs of the amount billed steadily declined.these tactics eventually forced plaintiffs out of business,and plaintiffs now exist only to collect outstanding accounts receivable.
plaintiffs filed suit against defendants,alleging abuse of process fraud violations of the cartwright act bus,et violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico c conspiracy to violate rico,d intentional and negligent interference with ongoing businesses intentional and negligent interference with contractual and prospective economic relations and violations of the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.plaintiffs based their claims on defendants alleged scheme to wrongfully delay or avoid payment on plaintiffs lien claims and sought to recover the damage to their businesses.in doing so,plaintiffs declined to seek recovery of any amount owed on their individual lien claims against defendants.
defendants filed a demurrer to plaintiffs first amended complaint,alleging,among other things,that the exclusive remedy provisions of the wca bar plaintiffs claims.the first trial court judge overruled the demurrer on exclusivity grounds,but dismissed with leave to amend on other grounds.after plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,defendants filed another demurrer,again alleging that workers compensation exclusivity bars plaintiffs claims.the same judge overruled the demurrer again and held that t his is not an action to adjudicate medical liens in worker compensation cases and plaintiffs use of the liens does not impinge on the exclusive jurisdiction of the worker compensation appeals board.
after the first judge retired,a new judge took over.two defendants subsequently added to the complaint filed a demurrer,contending once again that plaintiffs could only recover the remedies provided by the workers compensation system.after plaintiffs amended their complaint a third time,the second judge sustained the demurrer solely on exclusivity grounds.concluding that the gravamen of the complaints is delay or refusal to pay medical liens,the judge held that exclusive jurisdiction is with the wcab.
plaintiffs appealed.the court of appeal affirmed for the reasons cited in its unpublished opinion in fwhc medical group cna casualty of california june,a companion case with identical allegations and issues specifically,the court concluded that section of the labor code establishes that the wcab has exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims defendants did not act outside their proper roles as insurers as understood in unruh truck insurance exchange cal d,unruh and plaintiffs claims do not fall within the public policy exception to workers compensation exclusivity stated in gantt sentry ins.cal th,d,gantt,overruled on other grounds by green ralee engineering cal th,footnote,d.
we granted review to determine whether the claims asserted by these medical providers,alleging that various workers compensation insurers conspired to intentionally mishandle plaintiffs lien claims in order to drive them out of business,are barred by workers compensation exclusivity.
ii.discussion 
article xiv,section of the california constitution gives the legislature plenary power to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation.pursuant to this authority,the legislature enacted the comprehensive statutory scheme governing compensation given to california employees for injuries incurred in the course and scope of their employment.et.
under this statutory scheme,an employee injured in the workplace may request workers compensation benefits by delivering a claim form to the employer within days of the injury.see.benefits include compensation for medical treatment and other services reasonably required to cure or relieve the employee from the effects of the injury.see also.the employee may also obtain compensation for evaluations necessary to establish his or her entitlement to benefits.if the employer workers compensation insurer accepts coverage,then the insurer substitutes for the employer and assumes liability for benefits owed to the employee under the wca.
ordinarily,the insurer must pay all medical or bills of an injured employee within days of receiving the bill,subd.b,subd.a.if the insurer,however,contests the bill,then the insurer has to pay the contested portion of the bill only after the wcab orders payment.see,subd.b,subd.a.
medical providers that treat employee injuries covered by the wca may file a lien claim for the costs of their services directly with the wcab.any such provider is a party in interest to the wcab proceeding independence indem.indus.acc.com.cal d,independence indemnity,and receives full due process rights,including an opportunity to be heard see beverly hills multispecialty group,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
the underlying premise behind this statutorily created system of workers compensation is the compensation bargain.shoemaker,supra,cal d at.pursuant to this presumed bargain,the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.ibid.
to effectuate this theoretical bargain,the legislature enacted several provisions limiting the remedies available for injuries covered by the wca the exclusive remedy provisions.see shoemaker,supra,cal d at.although the appears straightforward,this court and the courts of appeal have struggled with the problem of defining the scope of the compensation bargain.id.at.indeed,the unabated flow of published decisions clarifying the scope of workers compensation exclusivity suggests considerable confusion as well as innovative lawyering.
nonetheless,we glean several guiding principles from the case law.in determining whether exclusivity bars a cause of action against an employer or insurer,courts initially determine whether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.where the alleged injury is collateral to or derivative of an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the wca,a cause of action predicated on that injury may be subject to the exclusivity bar.snyder michael stores,cal th,d,snyder.otherwise,the cause of action is not barred.
if the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions,then courts consider whether the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain.i n some exceptional circumstances the employer is not free from liability at law for his intentional acts even if the resulting injuries to his employees are compensable under workers compensation.products superior court cal d.where the acts are a normal part of the employment relationship fermino fedco,cal th,d,fermino,or workers compensation claims process see marsh mclennan,superior court cal d,marsh,or where the motive behind these acts does not violate a fundamental policy of this state gantt,supra,cal th at,d,then the cause of action is barred.if not,then it may go forward.
with these principles in mind,we conclude that,while the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions,some of the alleged acts and motives do not.thus,we bar plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims on exclusivity grounds,but not their cartwright act and rico claims.we also bar in part and allow in part plaintiffs tortious interference and ucl claims.
a.the alleged injury 
the starting point of our analysis is the alleged injury underlying plaintiffs claims.this injury is collateral to or derivative of a personal injury sustained and arising out of the course of employment a compensable injury.cole fair oaks fire protection dist.cal d,cole.therefore,it falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.
because workers compensation exclusivity is statutory in nature,we begin with the pertinent statutory provisions.see american psychometric consultants,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d american psychometric consultants.subdivision a of section provides in relevant part liability for the compensation provided by this division,in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person shall,without regard to negligence,exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment and for the death of any employee if the injury proximately causes death,in those cases where the conditions of compensation concur italics added.the conditions of compensation applicable to this case include where,at the time of the injury,both the employer and the employee are subject to the compensation provisions of this division.where,at the time of the injury,the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment.where the injury is proximately caused by the employment,either with or without negligence.ibid.subdivision a of section then provides that where the conditions of compensation set forth in section concur,the right to recover such compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee against the employer italics added.finally,section,subdivision a states that proceedings f or the recovery of compensation,or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto shall be instituted before the wcab and not elsewhere,except as otherwise provided in division italics added.
the legislature has extended the protection of these exclusive remedy provisions to workers compensation insurance carriers by defining the term employer to include insurer,subd.b.thus,these insurers retain immunity from lawsuit as the alter ego of the employer.unruh,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.employees may,however,bring suit against any person other than their employer or their employer workers compensation insurer who proximately caused their injury.marsh,supra,cal d at,italics omitted see also.
together,these provisions establish that the liability of employers and insurers for industrial injury which results in occupational disability or death is limited to workers compensation remedies.livitsanos superior court cal th,d,italics omitted livitsanos.where the essence of the wrong is personal physical injury or death,the action is barred by the exclusiveness clause no matter what its name or technical form if the usual conditions of coverage are satisfied.cole,supra,cal d at.in other words,the exclusivity provisions encompass all injuries collateral to or derivative of an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the wca.snyder,supra,cal th at,d.
thus,the trigger for workers compensation exclusivity is a compensable injury.an injury is compensable for exclusivity purposes if two conditions exist.first,the statutory conditions of compensation must concur.see,subd.a.for example,if the injury arises out of and in the course of the employment,the exclusive remedy provisions apply notwithstanding that the injury resulted from intentional conduct even though the conduct might be characterized as egregious.shoemaker,supra,cal d at.
second,the injury must cause a disability or the need for medical treatment.gomez acquistapace th,d gomez.injury includes any injury or disease.therefore,the exclusive remedy provisions apply only in cases of such industrial personal injury or death,and the workers compensation system subsumes all statutory and tort remedies otherwise available for such injuries.shoemaker,supra,cal d at.
where the alleged injury is neither collateral to nor derivative of an injury that satisfies both of these conditions,then it is not subject to exclusivity.see snyder,supra,cal th at,d.thus,a cause of action predicated on an injury where the basic conditions of compensation are absent is not preempted.livitsanos,supra,cal th at,d.for example,courts have allowed tort claims in cases where the alleged aggravation of an existing workplace not occur in the course of an employment relationship.see,weinstein mary medical center th,d allowing a medical malpractice claim against the employer because the resulting aggravation of the workplace injury did not arise out of the employment relationship.
causes of action seeking to recover e conomic or contract damages incurred independent of any workplace injury are also exempt from workers compensation exclusivity.pichon pacific gas electric d,italics added pichon.indeed,only injuries to the worker person,as opposed to his property,are compensable.bottling of los angeles superior court d.thus,courts have refused to bar spoliation of evidence or fraud claims where the alleged loss of a prospective lawsuit against a third not collateral to or derivative of an injury to the worker person.see gomez,supra,th at,d spoliation of evidence,supra,d at.same ramey general petroleum d,fraud but see continental casualty superior court d.courts have also allowed an employee to recover economic damages on a wrongful termination claim because the damages arose out of the act of not out of an injury to the employee person.see pichon,supra,d at.finally,courts have exempted defamation claims from exclusivity because an injury to reputation does not depend on a personal injury.see howland balma d.
on the other hand,courts have regularly barred claims where the alleged injury is collateral to or derivative of a compensable workplace injury.for example,courts have barred employees from suing for psychic injuries caused by their termination see semore eric pool d,or their employer abusive conduct during the termination process see gates trans video d.
courts have also consistently held that injuries arising out of and in the course of the workers compensation claims process fall within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions because this process is tethered to a compensable injury.indeed,every employee who suffers a workplace injury must go through the claims process in order to recover compensation.thus,we have barred all claims based on disputes over the delay or discontinuance of workers compensation benefits marsh,supra,cal d at,including those claims seeking to recover economic or contractual damages caused by the mishandling of a workers compensation claim see stoddard western employers ins.d.stoddard barring claims where the employee alleged economic damages due to delays in benefit payments mottola kautz d.mottola barring a breach of contract claim based on the refusal to pay benefits.likewise,claims seeking compensation for services rendered to an employee in connection with his or her workers compensation claim fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the wcab.see bell samaritan medical clinic,d.physician may not sue to recover fees for services rendered to an injured employee workmen comp.appeals bd.small claims court d.physician may not sue to recover fees for testimony at a wcab hearing.
in this case,plaintiffs seek to recover the economic damage to their businesses resulting from the failure to receive full and timely payment on their lien claims before the wcab.these damages arise out of the alleged mishandling of plaintiffs lien claims.plaintiffs concede that their underlying lien claims sought to recover compensation for medical services provided to workers injured in the course of their employment.thus,the alleged injury underlying all of plaintiffs causes of action is collateral to or derivative of a compensable workplace injury and falls within the scope of the exclusivity provisions.see marsh,supra,cal d at,stoddard,supra,d at.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject plaintiffs narrow interpretation of the exclusive remedy provisions.the mere fact that plaintiffs are medical providers,and not employees,does not preclude the application of these provisions.the rights of lien claimants derive from the rights of injured employees.fox workers compensation appeals bd.th,d.therefore,plaintiffs stand in the place of the employees with respect to claims for workers compensation benefits,and plaintiffs rights can not exceed employees rights.because employees are limited to wca remedies for all injuries caused by wrongful delays or refusals to pay see,marsh,supra,cal d at,stoddard,supra,d at.mottola,supra,d at,plaintiffs are limited to the same.indeed,we established long ago that the wcab has exclusive jurisdiction over all claims for compensation against an employer or insurance carrier involving medical,surgical and hospital treatment to injured employees independence indemnity,supra,cal d at,italics added.
plaintiffs decision to forgo recovery on their individual lien claims and to seek only economic damages also does not insulate their claims from the exclusivity provisions.unlike the economic damages alleged in,supra,d at pages,and pichon,supra,d at pages,the damage to plaintiffs businesses was proximately caused by the alleged mishandling of lien claims before the wcab.therefore,plaintiffs alleged injury was not independent of a compensable injury.pichon,supra,d at.in any event,plaintiffs proposed distinction is meaningless.every time an insurer fails to timely pay a valid lien claim,the aggrieved medical provider suffers economic damages.accordingly,plaintiffs causes of action do not fall outside the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions by virtue of the remedy they seek.see marsh,supra,cal d at.
a contrary result would create a huge loophole in the workers compensation system and eviscerate the compensation bargain.employees often suffer economic damages when they suffer workplace injuries or fail to receive prompt payment of their medical bills.under plaintiffs logic,these employees could circumvent the workers compensation system by asserting claims for economic damages even though their claims derive from their workplace injuries.this circumvention of the system,if allowed,would destroy the careful balancing of rights created by the wca and effectively breach the compensation bargain.
finally,our recent decision in city of moorpark superior court cal th,d,city of moorpark is inapposite.in city of moorpark,an employee alleged that her employer terminated her because of her physical disability and asserted,among other things,violations of the california fair employment and housing act feha,et,and wrongful termination in violation of public policy tameny atlantic richfield cal d,tameny claim.the employer demurred,contending that section was the employee exclusive remedy.the trial court overruled the demurrer.the court of appeal denied the employer petition for writ of mandate,and we affirmed.city of moorpark,supra,cal th at,d.
in concluding that feha and tameny claims fall outside the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions,we observed that the existence of a workers compensation remedy does not by itself establish that the remedy is exclusive.city of moorpark,supra,cal th at,d.only remedies found in division of the labor code are exclusive.because section is located in division,we concluded it does not provide the exclusive remedy for disability discrimination.city of moorpark,at,d.we also held that section only makes the wcab the exclusive forum for pursuing a section claim and does not establish that the section claim is the employee exclusive remedy.city of moorpark,at,d.
here,unlike section,the provisions that create the remedies for the mishandling of workers compensation,and located in division.these remedies are therefore exclusive.see city of moorpark,supra,cal th at,d.sections and give medical providers their sole remedy for delayed payment and impose a percent penalty plus interest if the employer fails to pay their medical bills within days under certain conditions see american psychometric consultants,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted the legislature enacted sections and in order to ensure that the bills of medical providers were promptly paid,and that protests or objections to the bills were promptly raised and adjudicated.section then provides the exclusive remedy for employees w hen the payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused and states that the full amount of the wcab order,decision or award shall be increased by percent italics added.section further states that the wcab is the exclusive forum for resolving disputes relating to the remedies provided in division.consequently,the workers compensation system encompasses all disputes over coverage and payment.marsh,supra,cal d at,italics added see also schlick comco management,d.schlick where compensation is available under division of the act for the alleged misconduct,the wcab has exclusive jurisdiction.
the existence of a penalty provision covering defendants alleged misconduct does not alter our analysis.section,found in division,does not create a remedy against workers compensation insurers.instead,it gives the administrative director of the division of workers compensation dwc the power to impose an administrative or civil penalty on insurers who unreasonably delay or refuse payment of compensation.ibid.potential penalties include a civil penalty,not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars,subd.d,and revocation of an insurer certificate of authority,subd.d.the director may impose these penalties in addition to any other remedy available under the wca,including the penalties provided by sections,and.thus,section does not affect the exclusivity of remedies in division.indeed,the legislature enactment of a penalty opposed to a remedy suggests an intent to have the dwc,rather than private litigants,address the type of insurer misconduct alleged here.accordingly,the alleged injury underlying plaintiffs claims falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.
b.the alleged acts and motives 
even if the exclusivity provisions cover the alleged injury,plaintiffs may still pursue their causes of action if they fit within the narrow exception to the wcab jurisdiction established in unruh,supra,cal d at pages.marsh,supra,cal d at.this exception focuses on the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action and considers whether these acts or motives constitute a risk reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.shoemaker,supra,cal d at.if they do,then the exclusive remedy provisions govern and bar the cause of action.if they do not,then the exclusive remedy provisions are inapplicable because the malfeasor is no longer acting as an employer,as understood in these provisions.here,plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims do not fall within this exception,but their cartwright act and rico claims do.in addition,plaintiffs tortious interference and ucl claims escape preemption to the extent they are predicated on the conspiratorial acts of not on the individual misdeeds of each defendant.
since unruh,courts have struggled to define the contours of this exception to workers compensation exclusivity.throughout the years,we have identified various circumstances where the exception precludes application of the exclusive remedy provisions.for example,we have held that conduct having a questionable relationship to the employment is not protected by the exclusivity rule.cole,supra,cal d at,see also magliulo superior court d.magliulo.we have also stated that conduct going beyond the normal role of an insurer in a compensation scheme intended to protect the worker is exempt from exclusivity.unruh,supra,cal d at,see also marsh,supra,cal d at,only conduct so extreme and outrageous that the defendant in effect stepped out of its role as an insurer precludes the application of workers compensation exclusivity.
despite these vague pronouncements,several guiding principles are clear.when determining whether the exception applies to a cause of action,courts first determine whether the alleged acts that give rise to that cause of action are of the kind that are within the compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at,d.in making this determination,courts may consider only those acts that relate to an element of the cause of action.where these acts are a normal part of the employment relationship cole,supra,cal d at,or the workers compensation claims process see mitchell scott wetzel services,d.mitchell,the cause of action is subject to exclusivity.otherwise,it is not.
for this initial determination,courts consider only the acts not the motive behind the acts.see fermino,supra,cal th at,d.in the exclusivity context,motive refers to the purpose or reason behind the acts and not the intentional or negligent nature of these acts.see ibid.thus,courts should disregard any alleged intent beyond the intent to do the acts that establish the elements of the cause of action when determining whether these acts are encompassed within the compensation bargain.such a focus is necessary in order to preserve the compensation bargain.indeed,permitting civil claims based on conduct that appeared on its face to be a normal part of the employment relationship or claims process merely because the mental state rendered the conduct intentionally or knowingly tortious undermines the premise behind the workers compensation system.id.at,d.
thus,typical employer actions such as demotions,promotions,criticism of work practices,and frictions in negotiations as to grievances do not,by themselves,exempt a cause of action from exclusivity.cole,supra,cal d at.similarly,termination,a known risk of any employment relationship,does not,by itself,insulate a cause of action from the exclusive remedy provisions.see shoemaker,supra,cal d at.r easonable attempts to investigate employee theft,including employee interrogation,are also a normal part of the employment relationship and can not give rise to a court action against the employer.fermino,supra,cal th at,d.
insurer activity intrinsic to the workers compensation claims process is also a risk contemplated by the compensation bargain.thus,insurer actions closely connected to the payment of benefits fall within the scope of the exclusive remedy provisions.mitchell,supra,d at.for example,a claims investigation,by itself,does not exempt a cause of action from exclusivity.see unruh,supra,cal d at,teague home ins.d.teague.because denying or objecting to claims for benefits is also a normal part of the claims process,misconduct stemming from the delay or discontinuance of payments is properly addressed by the wcab.marsh,supra,cal d at.indeed,california courts have invariably barred statutory and tort claims alleging that an insurer unreasonably avoided or delayed payment of benefits even though the insurer committed fraud and other misdeeds in the course of doing so 
of course,an employer or insurer may not use the exclusive remedy provisions as a get out of jail free card by characterizing its acts as a normal employer or insurer activity.what matters is not the label that might be affixed to the conduct fermino,supra,cal th at,d.rather,the critical issue is whether the alleged acts,bereft of their motivation,can ever be viewed as a normal aspect of the employer relationship or claims process.ibid.where the tortious act is not closely connected to a normal employer or insurer action,it is not subject to exclusivity.see marsh,supra,cal d at,only when the entity commits tortious acts independent of its role as a provider of workers compensation benefits may an employee maintain a private cause of action under unruh.
thus,courts have permitted fraud claims against an employer when the employer conceals the existence of an employee workplace injury because such concealments can not be linked to a normal employer action.see,supra,cal d at.involuntary confinement is not closely connected to a typical employment action even when committed in the course of an investigation of employee theft.therefore,a claim of false imprisonment,by definition,falls outside the scope of the compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,violent and coercive criminal conduct committed against an employee person is always illegal regardless of the employer state of mind and is never subject to the exclusive remedy provisions.id.at,fn,d,see also iverson atlas pacific engineering d.physical assault and false imprisonment meyer graphic arts international union d.assault and battery,false imprisonment,and rape magliulo,supra,d at.assault and battery.
with respect to insurers,courts have permitted fraud claims when the insurer denies the existence of a workers compensation insurance policy,because such denials are not a normal part of the claims process.see jablonski royal globe ins.d.trespassing is also an atypical insurer activity even when committed in the course of a claims investigation.therefore,it falls outside the compensation bargain.see teague,supra,d at.finally,assault and the formation of a romantic relationship with an injured employee are not closely connected to the claims process and are exempt from exclusivity.see unruh,supra,cal d at.
in addition to the acts themselves,the motive element of a cause of action may insulate that cause of action from the purview of the exclusive remedy provisions.this exception to exclusivity,however,is quite limited.a ny inquiry into an employer motivation is undertaken not to determine whether the employer intentionally or knowingly injured the employee,but rather to ascertain whether the employer conduct violated public policy and therefore fell outside the compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,the motive element of a cause of action excepts that cause of action from exclusivity only if it violates a fundamental public policy of this state.see gantt,supra,cal th at,d.thus,we have refused to bar both statutory and tort claims where their motive element violates such a policy.see,city of moorpark,supra,cal th at,d,feha claim gantt,at,d,tameny claim shoemaker,supra,cal d at,whistleblower claim under,former.
we now apply these principles to plaintiffs specific claims and allegations.
abuse of process and fraud claims 
after reviewing the acts and motives that give rise to plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims,we conclude these claims do not fit within the unruh exception to workers compensation exclusivity.thus,they are barred.
plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims,in essence,allege that each defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of delaying or denying payments in bad faith.for example,the abuse of process claims allege that defendants misused the claims process by making frivolous objections,filing sham petitions and documents with the wcab,issuing unnecessary subpoenas,and improperly threatening to depose plaintiffs physicians.similarly,the fraud claim states that each individual defendant made false statements about and during its processing of plaintiffs lien claims.all of these alleged acts are closely connected to a normal insurer processing and payment of medical lien claims.therefore,plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims are encompassed within the compensation bargain.see marsh,supra,cal d at.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject plaintiffs attempt to shield these claims from preemption by including superfluous allegations unrelated to the elements of the cause of action.for example,plaintiffs claim defendants committed abuse of process by advising other insurers not to pay plaintiffs claims,distributing hit lists of medical providers and conducting training sessions on how to delay or avoid payments on plaintiffs claims.these acts do not,however,support an abuse of process claim because they do not involve the use of a procedure incident to litigation.barquis merchants collection cal d,fn,barquis.consequently,they can not shield plaintiffs abuse of process claims from the reach of the exclusive remedy provisions.
plaintiffs characterization of defendants acts of fraud as a scheme suffers from the same defect.fraud does not require a scheme,and a scheme does not establish an element of a fraud claim.see.thus,the existence of a scheme can not insulate plaintiffs fraud claim from preemption.in any event,the mere allegation of a conspiracy is not enough where,as here,the alleged acts in furtherance of the,the fraudulent closely connected to claims processing,a normal insurer activity.see hazelwerdt industrial indem.exchange d,hazelwerdt.
the fact that the misdeeds alleged in the abuse of process and fraud claims may constitute crimes under insurance code sections and does not alter our conclusion.unlike those classes of intentional crimes against the employee person by means of violence and coercion,such as those crimes numerated in part,title of the penal code,regulatory crimes like the ones cited by plaintiffs do not violate the employee reasonable expectations and transgress the limits of the compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also,van erickson th,d criminal violations of child labor laws do not support an exception to exclusivity.
finally,neither abuse of process nor fraud contains a motive element that violates a fundamental public policy.abuse of process claims merely require malice,which may be inferred from the wilful abuse of the process.tranchina arcinas d.this malice element does not violate a fundamental public policy.meanwhile,fraud requires only an intent to induce another to alter his position to his injury or risk and not an intent that violates a public policy rooted in a constitutional,statutory,or regulatory provision.because the acts and motives underlying plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims fall within the risks contemplated by the compensation bargain,these claims are barred.see shoemaker,supra,cal d at.
cartwright act claim 
although we find plaintiffs abuse of process and fraud claims barred on exclusivity grounds,we reach a contrary conclusion as to their cartwright act claim.because the wrongful acts and motives that give rise to plaintiffs cartwright act claim fall outside the compensation bargain,it is not subject to workers compensation exclusivity.
we begin with the alleged acts that give rise to plaintiffs cartwright act claim.the cartwright act makes unlawful any trust.jones ahmanson cal d,jones bus.to establish that defendants comprised a trust,plaintiffs allege that defendants combined their capital,skill and acts in order to drive them out of business.as part of this combination,each defendant not only mishandled lien claims filed against it,but also encouraged other insurers to deny plaintiffs claims distributed hit lists of medical providers and exchanged strategies for delaying or avoiding payments to plaintiffs.this concerted effort by insurers to interject themselves into lien claims they did not insure is not a normal part of the claims process.indeed,only the insurer that has insured a claimant no other typically involved in that claimant workers compensation claim.by conspiring to influence the processing of claims it did not insure,each defendant stepped outside its proper role as an insurer and became a person other than the employer.unruh,supra,cal d at.in doing so,each defendant stripped itself of the protection afforded by the exclusive remedy provisions of the wca.
the motive element of a cartwright act claim also makes the exclusivity bar inapplicable.a cause of action for restraint of trade under the cartwright act must allege a purpose to restrain trade.jones,supra,cal d at,see also bus.by imposing such a requirement,t he cartwright act merely articulates in greater detail a public policy against restraint of trade that has long been recognized at common law.speegle board of fire underwriters cal d,speegle.because a cartwright act claim requires a motive that violates a fundamental public policy rooted in a statutory provision,it is not reasonably encompassed within the compensation bargain.
hazelwerdt does not compel a contrary result.in hazelwerdt,the plaintiff alleged that an insurer and a physician employed by that insurer to treat the plaintiff conspired to mishandle the plaintiff medical treatment.the court of appeal barred plaintiff civil conspiracy claim because the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were closely connected to a normal insurer provision of medical treatment for a workplace injury.see hazelwerdt,supra,d at.unlike the conspiracy claim in hazelwerdt,plaintiffs cartwright act claim alleges that each defendant conspired with parties that had no role in the handling of that defendant claims and sought to influence lien claims filed against other unrelated insurers.thus,defendants conspiratorial acts can not be linked to a normal insurer action during the claims process.see fermino,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,a cartwright act claim,unlike a civil conspiracy claim,requires a motive that violates a fundamental public policy.compare speegle,supra,cal d at,with lyons security pacific nat.bank th,d.accordingly,hazelwerdt is inapposite,and we decline to bar plaintiffs cartwright act claim on exclusivity grounds.
rico claims 
we reach a similar conclusion with respect to plaintiffs rico claims.the pattern of racketeering activity necessary to establish a rico enterprise always falls outside the scope of the compensation bargain.thus,plaintiffs rico claims are exempt from the exclusivity bar.
in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants violated and conspired to violate united states code section c.a violation of united states code section c requires conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.sedima,imrex,d,fn.omitted.to establish a pattern of racketeering activity,plaintiffs must allege at least two predicate acts that are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics northwestern bell telephone com
