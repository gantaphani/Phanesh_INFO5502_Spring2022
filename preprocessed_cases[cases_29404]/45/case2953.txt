this case requires us to determine the rights of a judgment creditor of an insured,in an action against an insurer seeking insurance policy proceeds under insurance code section,subdivision b,to recover under the liability insurance policy supplementary payments provision spp.in this type of action,the judgment creditor is entitled to recover against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,pursuant to a judgment the creditor had earlier obtained against the insured.we will conclude that the spp dealing with costs and interest,referring to all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company and all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein,should be construed as creating defense rights for the insured that are not enforceable by the judgment creditor of the insured,based on contract principles of third party beneficiary law as applied in the section,subdivision b context.murphy allstate ins.cal d,murphy.
this is the second appeal arising from the dispute between plaintiffs and respondents san diego housing commission and san diego housing authority collectively,housing respectively,the commission and the authority and the insurer of the general contractor who built a housing project for housing,industrial indemnity company iic.in through,john reed construction jbr or the insured was the general contractor for a low income housing project,calle primera the project,built for the commission on land owned by the authority.the current dispute concerns financial responsibility for an underlying default judgment for damages for construction defects that housing obtained against jbr,whom iic insured under a liability policy.housing authority of the city of san diego san diego housing commission john reed construction super.san diego county,the underlying action.
this lawsuit was originally tried in,on housing claims of entitlement to insurance coverage by iic of all or a portion of the default judgment in the underlying action.housing obtained judgment against iic of over million damages on several theories.iic appealed,and this court filed its opinion december,reversing the trial court judgment and remanding for retrial on the claims under section,subdivision b housing as a third party beneficiary of the jbr insurance policy.san diego housing commission industrial indemnity company th,d sdhc,a partially published opinion referred to here as the prior opinion,regarding both published and nonpublished portions.upon remand,jury trial was held in october and resulted in special verdicts and judgment in housing favor in the amount of damages,as well as an award of costs of suit.
iic now appeals the judgment after retrial,chiefly contending the damages award is unsupported on the section,subdivision b theory regarding a particular portion of the policy,the spp.further,iic contends the trial judge erroneously allowed certain evidence to be admitted with respect to housing claim that iic had a duty to defend its insured,jbr,objecting that such evidence was actually impermissible evidence of bad faith practices contrary to the holding of our prior opinion.
in addition,housing has the judgment on the basis that the trial court erroneously ruled there was no liability coverage for any occurrence of property damage within the policy period,arising out of plumbing defects corrosion at the project.we find the has no merit.however,our interpretation of the spp requires us to affirm the judgment as modified to reduce the damages awarded only to the indemnity portion,while also deleting that part of the costs award to housing that is based on code of civil procedure section.as so modified,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the background facts of the construction of the project are set forth in our prior opinion.sdhc,supra,th at,d.during construction,jbr and its subcontractors created numerous problems,including sloping floors that had to be corrected,concrete that had to be redone,and drainage problems that needed further work.copper plumbing pipes were installed in backfilled rocky trenches in areas with mildly corrosive soil.the pipes passed pressure tests before project completion.later,however,was another story.
at the outset of construction,jbr was insured by iic under a comprehensive general liability insurance cgl policy that had a term beginning june,and due to end june.a certificate of coverage was issued for this project on march.the policy provided broad form property damage coverage and required an occurrence within the policy period for coverage to attach.completed operations coverage was provided,and there was an exclusion for property damage to the project occurring during the course of construction.a separate limit plan was supplied to provide different policy limits for different types of coverage,although the general policy limit for property damage was per occurrence.the spp dealt with costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company,and interest on an underlying judgment against an insured,as will be more fully described later.
the project was completed and inspected by officials of the city of san diego city in march and april tenants began moving in beginning april.beginning in and,tenants made complaints to housing concerning defects at the project.according to the underlying construction defect complaint against jbr filed in,defects at the site included plumbing and drainage problems,door and light fixture problems,uneven floors,cracked stucco,and other problems.housing technical services supervisor and maintenance coordinator received complaints and did repairs.housing notified jbr of the defects in february and then filed its complaint for damages for construction defects on april.
from february to may,jbr attempted to obtain a defense of the construction defect action from iic.iic resisted providing coverage on several grounds.it took the position that the policy had effectively been canceled in march or april by jbr principal reed,and the original expiration date of the policy,june,should not apply.one of the issues sent back for this retrial was the effective date of cancellation of the policy.however,no defense was provided,and housing obtained a default judgment against jbr for,which included repair costs,relocation costs,and attorney fees and costs the prior default judgment.
based on the prior default judgment,housing brought this action against iic and related entities.housing pled a cause of action as a judgment creditor to recover on the policy,subject to its terms and limitations,subd.b.as outlined above,the first jury trial against iic resulted in a large judgment for housing,which combined recovery for bad faith theories and the section,subdivision b claim.upon our reversal of that judgment,retrial began in october.the trial court made various rulings designed to implement the policy interpretations set forth in our prior opinion,which we will summarize as follows.
specifically,our prior opinion upheld the first trial court interpretation of the separate limit plan,as allowing liability for separate occurrences in separate policy years to be aggregated.that trial court correctly concluded there were two separate annual policy years involved,as a reasonable construction of the policy and the evidence.however,there were also two potential separate coverages for property damage,one for the course of operations performed for the insured jbr by independent contractors,and one for property damage included within the completed operations hazard.thus,we determined previously that it was a reasonable construction of the policy for the trial court to conclude that two separate limits applied,and for two separate years each,assuming that it can be shown that occurrences of property damage took place within the policy period.this interpretation of the separate limit plan may remain established in any retrial on remand emphasis added.
further,the trial court in this retrial applied our prior opinion interpretation of the spp.the text of that provision states that the insurer will pay,in addition to the applicable limit of liability a all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company and all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company liability thereon.italics added.we said,at any further proceedings,the trial court should specify whether such awards properly fall within the scope of the supplementary payments provision,since the underlying action was not in fact defended by the company 
at the retrial,the parties extensively disputed how to handle the fact that iic had not in fact defended the underlying action against jbr,for purposes of the section,subdivision b claim.the trial court took the approach of presenting to the jury an advisory issue of whether there was a duty to defend,based on the facts known at the time,and then the court decided the applicability of the spp as a matter of law.the trial court directed the parties to stay away from any bad faith aspect of the case.
accordingly,at the retrial,housing presented extensive evidence about the nature of the construction defects at the project,and when they occurred or were manifested.this was directed toward proving to the jury that there was a duty to defend jbr on iic part,due to the potential of coverage under the policy,within the iic policy period.housing called as witnesses on the issue iic former claims adjusters robert blake and joe jenny,as well as jbr principal,michael reed.reed testified about the efforts of jbr to inform iic of the facts with respect to obtaining coverage.blake did not recall anything of the coverage dispute,while jenny described what was in the claims files.in addition,housing called an expert witness on insurance issues,thomas carter,on the issue based on factual disputes.iic these witnesses and argued its interpretation of their testimony 
the jury was instructed on the elements of the section,subdivision b case,and told this was not a bad faith insurance case.it then rendered special verdicts on property damages,tenant relocation,and litigation expenses,as well as an advisory verdict on the issue as it applied to jbr,the insured.judgment was entered in which the trial court set forth its findings.first,the court stated,two juries have found that defendant industrial indemnity company had a duty to defend the insured reed construction company in the underlying lawsuit filed by plaintiffs against reed construction company,decisions with which this court agrees.it then noted that the prior default judgment against jbr included costs and attorney fees awards in favor of housing.next,the court stated,had industrial indemnity company iic not breached its contractual duty to defend,it would have been unquestionably responsible for both the costs and fees awarded against its insured,and additionally for interest on the entire judgment accruing after entry of the judgment and until iic paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment that does not exceed the limits of iic liability thereon,but no payment had been made.the court then made this key finding 
iic may not benefit by its breach of duty to defend reed to the detriment of its insured against whom a judgment has been rendered.sanchez truck insurance exchange th,d.
continuing,the trial court concluded that housing,as a third party beneficiary of the policy,was entitled to recover under it.thus,since the jury had determined that jbr liability to housing arose out of events covered by the policy in question and within the policy period,housing was entitled to benefits of the policy under both the separate limit plan and the spp of the policy.the damages award was made as follows damages in the aggregate amount of,plus costs of suit,as taxed,in the amount of,plus postverdict interest this damages award is comprised of the following amounts

discussion 
section requires that a liability insurance policy issued in california shall contain certain specified provisions,including this one set forth in subdivision b w henever judgment is secured against the insured in an action based upon bodily injury,death,or property damage,then an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment.
the threshold issue presented in a case brought under section,subdivision b is whether the judgment,upon which plaintiff seeks to recover,represents damages of a type for which the insurer agreed to indemnify the insured.the plaintiff is in court as a beneficiary of the contract between the insured and the insurer,and must bring her the terms of that contract.citations.rafeiro american employers ins.d.rafeiro.only legal questions are presented as to the scope of the risks covered by the insurance,the risks excluded by the terms of the policy,and the nature of the damages awarded by the judgment.ibid.
we discuss iic specific challenges to the judgment,which deal with the proper interpretation of the spp and the evidentiary issues raised.we then turn to the housing,which contends the trial court erroneously set the amount of covered property damage under the jbr policy periods.
issuesaintroduction 
de novo review of the text of policy provisions applies.parsons bristol development cal d.the text of the spp states that the insurer will pay,in addition to the applicable limit of liability a all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company and all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company liability thereon.italics added.in our prior opinion,we specified,at any further proceedings,the trial court should specify whether such awards properly fall within the scope of the supplementary payments provision,since the underlying action was not in fact defended by the company we did not discuss any issues regarding the award of interest under the spp,although the underlying original judgment on review included an interest award on the prior default judgment.sdhc,supra,th,d.the prior opinion reversing that judgment thus left all the spp issues open for further factual and legal development,consistent with the analysis of the prior opinion,which is in fact what occurred at this retrial.
specifically,the trial court judgment here confirmed the jury advisory finding that iic had a duty to defend its insured jbr in the underlying housing lawsuit.the court ruled,iic may not benefit by its breach of duty to defend reed to the detriment of its insured against whom a judgment has been rendered.this ruling essentially held iic liable under the spp to housing,due to the iic inaction toward its insured,jbr.
at this point,we wish to clarify that although the underlying judgment in this case was taken by default against the insured jbr,the analysis we make under section,subdivision b does not depend on the default status of the underlying proceedings.here,it is not disputed that the hearing on default was procedurally sufficient under the action against company clause of the policy to establish that some damage was suffered by housing within the meaning of the policy.our issue is whether the judgment creditor bringing a section,subdivision b action is entitled to recover under the spp,on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations ibid,in place of the insured against whom the underlying action was successful.
contentions on appeal 
to support its contention that interest on the prior default judgment and costs of and attorneys fees of in the nature of costs awarded against defendants insured were improperly awarded against it pursuant to the supplementary payments coverage of the cgl policy,iic makes several arguments.first,it contends the plain meaning of the spp language is that it can not apply absent an insurer conducting of a defense in an underlying suit.it argues the purpose of the spp is to call to account those insurers who defend cases brought against their insureds,but who nevertheless delay such case resolution to the insureds detriment.it argues the spp was not designed to apply to this type of situation,and if it applies here,the policy language in any suit defended by the company has no meaning.
further,iic contends that the spp must be read in the context of the basic insuring clause,which would not ordinarily cover such costs and fees derived from an underlying lawsuit.it contends the spp should be read strictly according to its literal language.additionally,in its view,this was a very close case regarding coverage under the policy for property damage,which should militate against application of the spp.
finally,since iic does not believe that there may be any contractual basis for an award of spp costs and interest under these peculiar facts,it argues that the award must be one of extracontractual damages,or bad faith,which would be improper in the context of an action under section,subdivision b.see amato mercury casualty company th,d amato.further,since a code of civil procedure section offer of was made by housing but rejected by iic,iic claims certain costs were improperly awarded against it,since if the spp award was improper,only indemnity damages remains and thus the code of civil procedure section offer was not bettered at trial.
housing responds to these arguments in a number of ways.it first claims that the insurance policy as so construed was merely an illusory bargain,because its recovery as a judgment creditor would be so severely limited if only indemnity payments,not recovery of costs and interests,were allowed.it argues other insurance doctrines indicate the fallacy of the iic position,the no action clause.for example,in sanchez truck insurance exchange,supra,th,d sanchez,the court held that an insurer which refuses to defend its insured can not rely on the no action clause in its policy to preclude an action under section.sanchez,supra,th at,d.there,a stipulated judgment was entered in the plaintiff favor after a pretrial settlement of an action by the plaintiff against her employer,but the trial court found the judgment was unenforceable against the employer insurer.the court of appeal reversed,on the grounds that the plaintiff and her employer had settled the case in good faith after the insurer failed to provide the insured with a defense against the complaint,which sought potentially covered damages.id.at,d.
as part of its analysis,the court in sanchez cited malmgren southwestern auto.ins.cal,which held that a policy could not require as a condition precedent to an injured person right of action that additional requirements beyond the statutory terms be met,because such imposition of additional requirements was in derogation of or in conflict with the purpose of the statute.sanchez,supra,th at,d.housing is arguing here that a duty to defend was owed to the insured and the provisions of section,subdivision b,indicate there should be consequences to the failure to perform that duty,in the form of statutory recovery by a judgment creditor of the insured.
housing also argues iic is in error in claiming these are extracontractual rights not to be allowed to a third party beneficiary of an insurance contract.it contends housing should recover these costs and interest awards under the written policy terms,because the action against company clause in the policy provides rights to the judgment creditor to recover to the extent of the insurance afforded by the policy,and insurance amounts to a whole bundle of different types of rights to recovery.
most convincingly,housing contends this is a fairly simple example of the excuse of a condition precedent,due to the actions of the contracting party in preventing or making impossible the performance or happening of a condition precedent.rains arnett d.exchequer acceptance alexander d.although iic responds that this basic doctrine should not be applied in the insurance context,since few appellate authorities have done so,it does not explain why ordinary rules of contractual interpretation may not apply in this context.aiu ins.superior court cal d.
the trial court ruled in favor of housing,concluding on the spp issue,iic may not benefit by its breach of duty to defend reed to the detriment of its insured against whom a judgment has been rendered.citation.
after the appeal was briefed and oral argument was held,this court requested further briefing from the parties on the difficult issues surrounding the applicability of the spp in this action by a judgment creditor of an underlying judgment against the insured.under section,subdivision b,the judgment creditor of an insured is a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract between the insurer and the insured.murphy,supra,cal d.in light of the rule stated in murphy that a third party beneficiary right to performance is based upon the contracting parties intent to benefit it,and the third party beneficiary should not be permitted to enforce covenants made not for his benefit,but rather for others id.at,we asked whether the spp in this case was such a contract term or covenant that was made solely for the benefit of the contracting parties insurer and insured,such that a third party beneficiary should not be allowed to enforce it.we also inquired whether the record showed that this prior default judgment against jbr,the insured,was obtained through a fully litigated proceeding,such that sufficient evidence supports the underlying judgment,and whether the policy provided coverage according to the indemnity relief awarded in the judgment.
finally,in our letter to counsel,we noted that in prichard liberty mutual ins.th,d prichard,the analysis is made that an spp entitlement is a function of the insurer defense obligation,not its indemnity obligation.the court there states that spp payments are independent of coverage.the parties duly filed their supplemental briefs responding to these issues.
to analyze these issues,we first reiterate that the prior opinion in this case left open for retrial the entire question of any entitlement of housing to enforce the spp.such an entitlement under the spp must stem from the coverage afforded jbr on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,subd.b.housing rights are those of a third party beneficiary of the insurance contract.we should examine the context in which the spp clause is found in the policy,to determine its scope of relief and the identity of the parties who may seek redress to obtain such relief.determining these rights is a legal question dealing with the scope of the coverage of the policy,and the nature of the damages and costs and interest awarded by the prior default judgment.rafeiro,supra,d.we should focus not upon general public policy considerations,but on the language of the particular policy.knippen glens falls ins.to address these issues,we outline the terms of the policy and then the applicable rules for interpreting it,as they have arisen in varying factual contexts.
policy terms 
the text of the spp that gave rise to the award of costs and interest to housing states that the insurer will pay,in addition to the applicable limit of liability a all costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company and all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company liability thereon.italics added.as suggested by the italics above,there are several particularly significant portions of the spp,including costs,interest,and the limit of liability under the policy.
we read the spp together with other controlling portions of the policy.as relevant here,the insuring clause reads 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of coverage damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence,and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage emphasis added.
the general intent of section,subdivision b is implemented in this policy by the action against company clause no action shall lie against the company unless,as a condition precedent thereto,there shall have been full compliance with all of the terms of this policy,nor until the amount of the insured obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured,the claimant and the company.any person who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this policy bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured shall not relieve the company of any of its obligations hereunder.
applicable doctrines in contract and insurance law 
in order to decide housing entitlement to the spp award of costs and interest,we are required to take into account several doctrines in interpreting these policy provisions.insurance is a means of distributing risks of loss.an insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and an insured citations,the insurer making promises,and the insured paying premiums,the one in consideration for the other,against the risk of loss.citations.to yield their meaning,the provisions of a policy must be considered in their full context.citations.buss superior court cal th,d.
in the liability context,such loss exposure can take one of two forms.it may be the possibility of legal liability imposed on the defendant,or alternatively,there is an exposure based on the necessity of mounting a defense against a claim or lawsuit which seeks the imposition of liability.the latter type of loss is addressed by the duty to defend expressed in the coverage clause and the supplementary payments provision.cal.insurance law and practice matthew bender.
the duty to defend runs directly to the insured,and is discharged when the action against the insured is concluded 
standard comprehensive or commercial general liability insurance policies provide,in pertinent part,that the insurer has a duty to indemnify the insured for those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages for any covered claim.they also provide that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any action brought against the insured seeking damages for any covered claim the insurer duty to indemnify runs to claims that are actually covered,in light of the facts proved.citations.by definition,it entails the payment of money in order to resolve liability.citations.by contrast,the insurer duty to defend runs to claims that are merely potentially covered,in light of facts alleged or otherwise disclosed.citations.it entails the rendering of a service,the mounting and funding of a defense citations in order to avoid or at least minimize liability citation.it is discharged when the action is concluded.citation.buss superior court,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
special contractual rules apply in the third party beneficiary context created by section,subdivision b,to limit the rights of a third party claimant against an insured 
as a general rule,absent an assignment of rights or a final judgment,a third party claimant may not bring a direct action against an insurance company on the contract because the insurer duties flow to the insured.citations.there are several exceptions to the general rule which prohibits a third party claimant from suing an insurer.for example,once a party has a final judgment against the insured,the claimant becomes a third party beneficiary of the insurance policy and may enforce the terms which flow to its benefit pursuant to insurance code section.citations.harper wausau ins.th,d,fn.omitted harper.
accordingly,a claimant may sue the insurer as a third party beneficiary utilizing traditional contract principles,when the duties under the policy flow directly in favor of the third party,medical payment provisions in a liability policy.harper,supra,th at,d.these rights are grounded in civil code section,which provides a contract,made expressly for the benefit of a third person,may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.harper,supra,th at,d.such third party beneficiary principles do not require that the person to be benefited be named in the contract,but rather allow the third party to qualify as a contract beneficiary if the contracting parties must have intended to benefit that individual and such intent appears on the terms of the agreement.id.at,d.further 
it is well settled,however,that civil code section excludes enforcement of a contract by persons who are only incidentally or remotely benefited by the agreement.citations.the supreme court has held a third party should not be permitted to enforce covenants made not for his benefit,but rather for others.he is not a contracting party his right to performance is predicated on the contracting parties intent to benefit him.citations.citations.harper,supra,th at,d.
when the judgment creditor of an insured proceeds against the insurer under section,subdivision b,many problems can arise concerning for example the nature and extent of the injured party interests in the insurance policy,to what extent the insurer is bound by the judgment or to what extent it can be challenged in the third party claimant action,and what is the meaning of the language in the statute,subject to its terms and limitations.cal.insurance law and practice,supra,to.additionally,the statute allows that the insurer may assert against that creditor the injured party any defenses the insurer would have had against the insured.these usually include lack of cooperation with or notice to the insurer,to.these concerns are addressed by the policy provision commonly entitled action against company,or the no action clause,such as we have here.ibid.
for example,in murphy,supra,cal d at pages,it is stated that the duty to settle found in the insurance policy does not flow to the third party claimant,and an assignment is needed for a claimant to enforce it.similarly,there are other limits on a judgment party claimant ability to sue the insurer of the tortfeasor.the question plaintiff contention raises is whether a third party judgment creditor of the insured may bring suit against the insurer for breach of the duty to defend.absent an assignment,the answer is no a third party claimant can not bring an action upon a duty owed to the insured.jane ordinary mutual th,d jane.
to examine whether the spp should be considered to be a provision not flowing to the benefit of a third party judgment creditor,either directly or indirectly,we look to case law under section.
related case law analysis 
in sanchez,supra,th,d,as relied on by the trial court here,the court of appeal held that where an insurer has refused to defend its insured,the injured claimant may settle the action as he or she sees fit,as long as there is no fraud or collusion.the court stated no authority had been presented giving effect to a no action clause where the insurer had wrongfully failed to provide a defense to its insured.accordingly,the no action clause in the policy was no bar to an action by the third party claimant to recover benefits from the insurer under section.sanchez,supra,th at,d.as explained by a commentator,this case represents the principle that a stipulated judgment may be enforceable in a direct action against the insurer under section,subdivision b where the insurer has cast the insured adrift by refusing to provide a defense where the insurer refuses to defend,to indemnify or to participate in any way in the underlying lawsuit,the insured may settle the lawsuit to his or her best advantage,so long as there is no fraud or collusion.citation.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.
this scenario in sanchez,supra,th,d,is different from the case between housing and iic,because the policy proceeds sought by the injured claimant were evidently indemnity monies,not costs and interest under an spp.more importantly,iic is not relying on the action against company clause to say the underlying case was inadequately litigated,but instead is saying that there is no contractual right for housing to recover defense costs,because housing itself was not owed a defense duty,and these are not the types of policy proceeds recoverable by a person or entity who is not itself the insured.
another related case is hand farmers insurance th,d in which the court distinguished between the established rule not allowing a judgment creditor of the insured a right to sue the insurer for bad faith refusal to settle,and a newly announced rule that the judgment creditor may directly sue the insurer for bad faith refusal to pay a final judgment against the insured.see cal.insurance law and practice,supra,e.the rutter group commentators point out that although the usual rule is that in an action under section,subdivision b,the judgment is enforceable against the insurer only up to its policy limits,the result is different where the insurer committed bad faith after the judgment became final.as stated above,the judgment creditor is a third party beneficiary of the policy including its covenant of good faith and fair dealing.thus,the insurer owes a duty to exercise good faith in not withholding adjudicated damages owing to the judgment creditor.see,hand farmers ins,supra,th at,d at continued to unreasonably deny coverage and refused payment of judgment rendered against its insured.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,italics omitted.the commentators then say,it has been suggested that allowing a judgment creditor to sue for bad faith may be inconsistent with california insurance code section b,which limits the creditor to an action to recover on the judgment and subjects that judgment to the policy terms and limitations.one case states,t he analysis in hand might be viewed as improperly extending the law of tortious bad faith.citations.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,italics omitted.moreover,since there is no bad faith theory or implied covenant analysis legitimately involved in the case before us,the authority of hand,supra,th,d,is not helpful.
another related case is amato,supra,th,d,in which the insured was allowed to recover damages for his insurer tortious breach of the duty to defend,which caused him to suffer a default judgment.even though there was no coverage on the underlying case,the insured in amato was still allowed to recover because of the judicially expanded duty to defend that was breached,as to questionable claims where there had been a potential of coverage.since housing is not the insured who is clearly owed the duty to defend,this case does not advance the analysis here.
more relevant is jane,supra,th,d,in which the plaintiff had obtained a default judgment for damages against a priest for sexual misconduct.she then sought declaratory relief establishing coverage for the judgment under a liability insurance policy issued to the priest employer,in part by asserting the insurer had failed to defend the priest.however,she had not been able to obtain an assignment of the priest cause of action against the insurer for failure to provide a defense.accordingly,she,as his judgment creditor,could not assert such a duty against the insurer to support her claim under the policy.id.at,d,citing penney casualty ins.cal d.
in insurance company of north america national american ins.th,d ina,an action between successive insurers to determine allocation of liability,this court discussed whether an amount awarded for attorney fees and costs against the insured in the underlying litigation should be applied to reduce the amount due from one insurer under the policy limits,or should be characterized as a cost taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the company under the supplementary payments section of the policy.id.at,d.this court concluded as between the two insurers that the fees and costs award was an amount falling under the supplementary payments section of the policy,because there was an underlying contractual fee agreement in an indemnity agreement between the insured a subcontractor and the general contractor.this court noted 
that contract included a prevailing party clause entitling the prevailing party to its attorney fees.attorney fees under such a contractual clause are allowable as costs.citation.in the underlying construction defect suit,the court award against the insured included costs,among which were attorney fees.this evidence supports the conclusion the fees and costs award was a cost assessed against the insured under the prevailing party clause,which would fall within the supplementary payments provision.id.at,d.
in prichard,supra,th,d,a liability insurance bad faith action,the court states that an spp providing for costs is a function of the insurer defense obligation,not its indemnity obligation in a word,the insurance contract obligates the insurer to pay costs whenever it must defend the suit,independent of whether those costs would otherwise be covered by way of the insurer indemnity obligation.citation.id.at,d,italics omitted.there it was the insured who was seeking from his insurer an award of costs assessed against him in the underlying litigation,which he lost even though he received a partial defense under a reservation of rights.id.at,d.
a commentator in the area has explained the basis for these latter two holdings as follows 
attorney fee awards not damages attorney fee awards are not damages under a cgl policy.fee awards do not compensate claimants for the injury that brought them to court and therefore do not fit the concept of damages in its ordinary and popular sense.citations.as costs taxed against insured however,a cgl policy also obligates a liability insurer to pay with respect to any claim or suit we defend.all costs taxed against the insured in the suit.attorney fee awards authorized by contract,statute or law are recoverable as costs of suit.citation.therefore,fee awards against the insured fall within the insurer defense obligation.prichard liberty mut.ins,supra,th at d insurance of north america national american ins.of th,d.comment insurers complain that forcing them to pay attorney fee awards against an insured is unfair because the amount awarded often bears no relation to the damages involved,because of lodestar multipliers.however,if insurers want to exclude coverage for fee awards,they should revise the cgl form.see prichard liberty mutual ins,supra,th at,fn.d.croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,emphasis added and emphasis omitted.
while this analysis is illuminating,we do not believe it applies to the facts before us,where there is no insured who is seeking recovery due to the duty to defend,nor is there any issue regarding reimbursement between insurers of such applicable costs provisions.in ina,supra,th,d,the insurer naicc was apparently involved in defending the underlying construction defect action,and paid that claimant over on the underlying judgment.id.at,d.as between successive insurers,it was properly held liable under it
