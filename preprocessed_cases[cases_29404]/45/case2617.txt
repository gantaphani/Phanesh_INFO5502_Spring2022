in this insurance coverage dispute,appellants stonelight tile,stonelight and david anson anson,stonelight controlling shareholder,hereafter jointly plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred when it granted respondent california insurance guarantee association ciga motion for summary judgment.in its summary judgment motion,ciga had argued that it was prohibited from contributing toward the payment of a judgment plaintiffs had obtained against diversified recycling services,diversified in an action for damages due to repeated exposure to dust generated by diversified recycling operations,on the grounds that there was other insurance available to cover the judgment,subd.c.
plaintiffs contend there was no other insurance available to them because ciga scope of coverage was different from that of the other insurers whose policies were triggered in this continuous loss case.plaintiffs also contend that the continuous trigger of coverage that obligates the other insurers to pay the judgment in the underlying action in full,subject to a right of contribution,does not apply to plaintiffs claims for nuisance and trespass.we find no error and affirm the summary judgment.
underlying 
stonelight had operated a tile manufacturing business in san jose since.at the time of the events giving rise to the underlying lawsuit,anson was stonelight president and controlling shareholder.in,stonelight relocated to pomona avenue in san jose.the following year,diversified began recycling operations at an adjacent property at pomona avenue.
a.the dust problem 
diversified recycling activities sent dust flying into the surrounding neighborhood.some of the offending dust came from diversified tub grinder,a large machine that reduced recyclable wood products to splinters and fine particles.tub grinding generated a significant amount of light brown dust that blew and settled onto neighboring properties,including stonelight property.the tub grinder occasionally spewed out metal fragments as well.concern over diversified tub grinding operations prompted the city of san jose the city to intervene in.as a result of the city legal action,a temporary restraining order issued,forcing diversified to cease tub grinding as of july.
the termination of diversified tub grinding operations put an end to the light brown grinder dust,but did nothing to relieve the dark brown dust created by diversified other activities.dust on materials accepted for recycling at the site was released into the air when the imported materials were unloaded,piled up,moved around,bulldozed,or loaded into trucks for transport.a watering and monitoring program proved ineffective in controlling the dust.at times,dust plumes rose to feet in the air.at other times,the blowing dust looked like a blizzard.sometimes,the dust layer was so heavy that footprints could be seen in it.
anson and others complained about the dust to the bay area air quality management district air quality.written reports documenting more than two dozen complaints over a period were admitted into evidence at trial.in at least six instances,air quality inspectors confirmed that diversified operations generated dust that violated air quality standards.
plaintiffs and their neighbors also complained to the city.city code inspectors concluded that diversified generation of dust created a nuisance that affected the neighbors and should be abated.the city efforts to shut down diversified operations resulted in a stipulated permanent injunction requiring defendant to obtain permits or cease operating by march.despite the injunction and the lack of permits,defendant did not cease operations on pomona avenue until june.
b.the impact on stonelight 
stonelight made custom,high quality art tiles for an international market.stonelight product was vulnerable to contamination by dust particles at each step of the manufacturing process,from initial clay preparation through drying,glazing and firing.
during clay preparation,clay was transported on open conveyor belts from a mixer to partially exposed storage silos,to a pug mill,where water was added.the clay was chunked out of the pug mill in sections and conveyed to a tile extruder.the extruded clay was cut into tiles of varying shapes and sizes.decorative tiles might be pressed with a plate.next,the tiles were dried,first in the open air and then in a large gas dryer.stonelight product was vulnerable to dust contamination whenever it was exposed during the manufacturing process.
dried tiles were susceptible to dust intrusion during the glazing process.special custom art tiles were glazed by hand in a partially exposed art room.other tiles were exposed to dust contamination while traveling along the glazing line.dust particles that settled on the tiles during glazing showed up as pock marks or pits on the tile.
the glaze itself was subject to contamination.foreign substances dropping into the open glaze barrels could result in discoloration,a defect that would not be apparent until after firing.contamination in the glaze barrels fouled the glaze nozzles,causing them to clog or spray the glaze unevenly,which affected the finish of the tile.dust also created problems during firing,the last step in the production process.
dust from diversified operations permeated the factory,covering tools and equipment,burning out motors,and creating physical problems for stonelight workers.as a result,stonelight was compelled to clean its facility more often than usual.in addition,the company had to manufacture twice as many tiles to ensure sufficient quantities of undamaged tiles.more of stonelight finished product went into its boneyard,where it was offered for sale at reduced prices.stonelight lost customers because of manufacturing problems caused by the dust contamination.gross sales declined dramatically between and,and stonelight suffered financial losses.stonelight attempted to stage a recovery in june,after diversified ceased operations.however,that attempt was unsuccessful and stonelight filed for bankruptcy protection in.
c.the impact on anson 
stonelight failure was an enormous blow for anson,both financially and emotionally.as stonelight manager,anson was present at the pomona avenue property on a basis.he even lived there for a time.while living there,anson was directly and personally affected by the dust.although he disavowed any claim of physical or psychological impairment,anson testified that he went to the hospital,as did his workers who were experiencing physical problems as a result of the dust.anson lost both his initial personal investment in the company and the accumulated salary he had deferred during the company slide toward bankruptcy.
procedural history of underlying action 
stonelight,anson,and andrew bonett bonett,the owner of a neighboring business that also claimed damages as a result of diversified recycling operations,sought compensation for their losses by suing diversified.their first amended complaint stated causes of action for public and private nuisance,negligence,battery,trespass to land,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
prior to the trial of the underlying action,diversified brought a successful in limine motion that restricted the plaintiffs to proof of events within the applicable statutes of limitations.as a result,plaintiffs were not allowed to offer evidence of nuisance or trespass damages or claims arising before july,or evidence of personal injury tort claims or damages incurred prior to july.
in december,a jury returned general verdicts in favor of all three plaintiffs,with special findings that diversified had not acted with malice or oppression toward any plaintiff.the jury awarded to stonelight,to anson,and to bonett.
diversified appealed,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdicts.it also argued that stonelight had failed to mitigate its damages and that anson was not entitled to emotional distress damages.in may,we affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion stonelight title,et diversified recycling,et,supra.
ii.the instant coverage dispute 
in october,plaintiffs filed a complaint pursuant to section to recover the amount of the judgments from the insurance companies that had provided liability coverage to diversified between july,and june.the named defendants included three insurance companies transamerica insurance company,cigna property and casualty company,and continental insurance company,hereafter the solvent insurers and the california insurance guarantee association ciga.the operative pleading,the first amended complaint,alleges that the solvent insurers and superior national insurance company superior national provided liability coverage to diversified during the period of time at issue in the underlying action,that after the issuance of its policy,superior national became insolvent,and that ciga administered the claims of the insolvent superior national.
ciga demurrer to the first amended complaint based on the statute of limitations was overruled.
settlement with solvent insurers 
plaintiffs settled with the solvent insurers in december of.although the amounts and terms of the settlements are not reflected in the record,the parties have stipulated that the amount of each settlement neither exhausted each individual insurer policy limits nor fully satisfied the underlying judgment of and.
ciga motion for summary judgment 
in february,ciga filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that under section,subdivision c,ciga has no statutory duty to pay the judgment because plaintiffs had not exhausted the other insurance that was available to them.it argued that plaintiffs claim was not a covered claim within the meaning of section because other insurance was available to plaintiffs and that ciga can not violate statutory restrictions by paying claims that are not covered claims.ciga argued that each of the solvent insurers was liable for the entire amount of the judgment,because it was a continuous loss and under the policy language and the rule stated in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,montrose,each of the solvent insurers was responsible to pay the entire loss as long as some of the damage occurred during their policy periods.ciga asserted that since the solvent insurers had policy limits that were sufficient to pay the entire judgment,plaintiffs could not recover from ciga.ciga contended that plaintiffs had settled too cheaply when they accepted amounts that were less than the solvent insurers policy limits and did not cover the entire judgment and that plaintiffs could not rely on ciga to make up the difference.
the motion for summary judgment was based in part on stipulated facts,including the following insurance coverage information for diversified 
plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that there were triable issues whether the events that caused damages between july,and june,were separate,intermittent events that caused separate damages or whether the damages were progressive and continuous through each policy period.plaintiffs argued that the trespasses of dust occurred daily and ended each night,when diversified operations shut down.they argued that different tiles were damaged each day.plaintiffs argued it was undisputed that the damages caused by the tub grinder occurred only during superior national policy period,since the tub grinder ceased operation on july.plaintiffs asserted that under the personal injury coverage provisions of the policy,which covered the trespass and nuisance causes of action,each insurer was only responsible for the offenses committed during its policy period.
in reply,ciga argued that this was a continuous loss case and the fact that diversified did not operate hours per day,seven days per week does not create separate losses or events.ciga argued that the underlying losses did not fall within the insurance policies personal injury coverage and that even if they did,the trespass and nuisance offenses were continuous.ciga also observed that the underlying judgment did not allocate to or determine whether any damages were due solely to tub grinding.it contended that plaintiffs damages were due to continuous or repeated exposure to diversified normal operations that generated dust and that the continuous and repeated exposure to substantially the same condition is a single occurrence under the policy.
the court granted ciga motion for summary judgment.the court concluded that plaintiffs suffered from continuously triggered injury and that e ach insurer could have been held liable for the entire loss.accordingly,other insurance was available to plaintiffs.since other insurance was available,plaintiffs could not recover from ciga.plaintiffs appeal.
discussion 
contentions on appeal 
plaintiffs contend there was no other insurance available to them to cover losses incurred during superior national policy period because the solvent insurers did not have the same scope of coverage as superior national.plaintiffs contention is based on the undisputed fact that tub grinding,which was responsible for creating some of the dust,only occurred during superior national policy period.plaintiffs argue that the damages due to tub grinding,which created a light brown dust and metal projectiles,were different from the damages caused by diversified other operations and thus were not covered by the solvent insurers.plaintiffs also argue there are triable issues whether the solvent insurers had the same scope of coverage as superior national.
plaintiffs contend the court erred in granting summary judgment because there is no other insurance for their trespass and nuisance claims because the continuous injury trigger of coverage,which provides that each policy triggered by a continuing or progressive loss claim has an independent obligation to respond to the loss in full,does not apply to their nuisance and trespass claims.

iii.scope of coverage 
history and purpose of ciga 
ciga was created by the legislature in to protect policyholders of insolvent insurers and third parties claiming under policies issued by insurers that become insolvent.california ins.guarantee liemsakul d.liemsakul isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d,isaacson.ciga is a compulsory association requiring most state regulated insurance companies to be members,and provides insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its policies.liemsakul,supra,d at,fn,citing central national ins.california ins.guarantee d.ciga assesses its members when another member becomes insolvent,thereby establishing a fund from which insureds whose insurers become insolvent can obtain financial and legal assistance.citation.member insurers then recoup assessments paid to ciga by means of a surcharge on premiums to their policy holders,subd.a.in this way the insolvency of one insurer does not impact a small segment of insurance consumers,but is spread throughout the insurance consuming public,which in effect subsidizes ciga continued operation.reynolds california ins.guarantee d,d.ciga role is similar to that of the federal deposit insurance corporation in banking and serves to enhance public confidence in the insurance industry.liemsakul,supra,at.
while ciga general purpose is to pay the obligations of an insolvent insurer,it is not itself an insurer and does not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.reynolds,supra,d at,d.ciga is not,and was not created to act as,an ordinary insurance company.citation.it is a statutory entity that depends on the guarantee act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers,duties,and protections.isaacson,supra,cal d.ciga issues no policies,collects no premiums,makes no profits,and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.id.at.ciga duties are not with the duties owed by the insolvent insurer under its policy.citation.instead,ciga authority and liability in discharging its statutorily circumscribed duties are limited to paying the amount of covered claims.industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.th,d industrial indemnity.
ciga pays covered claims 
ciga is authorized by statute to pay only covered claims of an insolvent insurer,those determined by the legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public.citation.citation.ciga has the statutory authority to deny a noncovered claim,subd.b.industrial indemnity,supra,th,d.thus,ciga first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a covered claim.moreover,the scope of ciga rights and duties turns on the definition of covered claim.id.at,d.
section,subdivision c,defines c overed claims in relevant part as the obligations of an insolvent insurer imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full.
in section,subdivisions c through c,the statutory scheme lists categories of claims or obligations that are not covered claims.subdivision c of section,the subdivision at issue in this case,provides covered claims does not include i any claim to the extent it is covered by any other insurance of a class covered by this article available to the claimant or insured cases interpreting section,subdivision c have established that where an insured has overlapping insurance polices and one insurer becomes insolvent,the other insurer,even if only a secondary or excess insurer,is responsible for paying the claim.in other words,ciga is an insurer of last resort and does not assume responsibility for claims where there is any other insurance available.reynolds,supra,d at,d.the legislative intent was to create a protection for the public against insolvent insurers when no secondary insurer is available.citation.the secondary insurer has received a premium for the risk and thus the secondary insurer,and not ciga,should be responsible for the coverage of the loss.id.at,d.
ciga statutory duty is to provide insolvency insurance to pay some but not all claims arising out of an insurance policy of an insolvent insurer.citation.further,in creating ciga,the legislature chose to provide a limited form of protection for the public,not a fund for the protection of other insurance companies from the insolvencies of fellow members.citations.accordingly,as noted by one appellate court,various subdivisions of section express the statutory intent not to use ciga funds to pay the insolvent obligations to other insurers industrial indemnity,supra,th,d.
in applying the pertinent statutes,we must decide whether plaintiffs are claimant s asserting covered claims that do not fall within any of the excluded categories.cd investment california ins.guarantee th,d.there is no dispute that plaintiffs are claimant s for the purposes of section,subdivision h.claimant means any insured making a first party claim or any person instituting a liability claim,subd.h.plaintiffs,who obtained a judgment in the underlying action,clearly meet the latter definition.there is also no dispute that the judgment in the underlying action falls within the definition of a covered claim in section,subdivision c.the issue here is whether plaintiffs claims are excluded by section,subdivision c on the grounds that there was other insurance available to plaintiffs.
nature of the loss continuous exposure to same harmful condition 
plaintiffs argue there was no other insurance that precluded ciga from participating in the case because superior national scope of coverage was different from that of the solvent insurers because the damages that occurred during superior national policy period were different from the damages that occurred during the other policy periods.
we begin by reviewing the undisputed facts that bear on this issue.although the record suggests plaintiffs began experiencing problems due to the dust from diversified recycling operations prior to,plaintiff claims for property damage,nuisance and trespass were limited by the statute of limitations to damages occurring after july,and anson personal injury claims were limited to events occurring after july.diversified ceased tub grinding activities on july,and ceased operations altogether on june.thus,tub grinding took place only during the first days of the approximately year month period at issue in the underlying action.
plaintiffs contend superior national scope of coverage was different from that of the other insurers because it included damages from tub grinding and that the damages from tub grinding differed from the damages due to diversified other operations,which included the transfer of wood debris the tub grinder generated a fine,light brown wood dust and ejected metal projectiles.diversified transfer operations,which included the bulldozing,trampling and crunching of wood debris,generated a dark brown dust.the dust from the transfer operations was present both during and after the time the tub grinder was in operation.
the record contains copies of inspections reports by air quality in,and.eight of those reports involve conditions on dates before tub grinding stopped.the remaining reports involve conditions on dates after tub grinding stopped.on july,before tub grinding ceased,anson complained to air quality that very large amounts of dust had floated onto his property that were not due to tub grinding.on july and july,a few days after tub grinding ceased,anson complained that diversified was generating as much wood dust as ever even though it had removed the tub grinder.on july,anson complained to air quality that even though the tub grinding had ceased,the dust problem still existed due to diversified transfer operations.anson continued to complain to air quality for two years and eight months after the tub grinding ceased.both diversified tub grinding and transfer operations created dust that permeated plaintiffs property.there was no evidence of damages to plaintiffs tile operations that were distinct because of the metal projectiles related to tub grinding.nothing in the record suggests the damage to the tiles,the glaze,or the equipment was different from one type of dust than from the other.although the dust may have been different in color and source,the offending substance was still dust.
we note also that all five of the insurance policies at issue in this case used the standard insurance services offices iso commercial general liability coverage form iso form no.cg.each of those policies defined an occurrence as an accident,including continuous exposure or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.given the facts set forth above,we conclude that plaintiffs exposure to dust from diversified operations met the policy definition of an occurrence because they involved a continuous exposure or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.for these reasons,we are not persuaded that superior national scope of coverage was different from that of the other insurers based on the color and source of the dust or on the language of the insurance policies at issue.
continuous injury trigger of coverage 
a key inquiry under an policy is what fact or event triggers an insurer duty to defend indemnify its insured.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.the word trigger is not found in the insurance policy or defined in the insurance code.ibid.it describes what must happen during the policy period to activate the insurer duties to defend and indemnify,citing montrose,supra,cal th,d.the trigger of coverage usually determines which insurance policy or policies may provide coverage.croskey et,supra,at.
t he proper resolution of a trigger of coverage issue in any given case may turn on whether the court is addressing underlying facts involving a single event resulting in immediate injury,an explosion causing instantaneous bodily injuries and destruction of property,a single event resulting in delayed or progressively deteriorating injury,a chemical spill,or a continuing event referred to in comprehensive general liability cgl policies as continuous or repeated exposure to conditions resulting in single or multiple injuries,exposure to toxic wastes or asbestos over time.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.based on the facts set forth above,we conclude the trial court did not err when it held that plaintiffs suffered from continuously triggered injury.
where successive cgl policy periods are implicated,bodily injury and property damage which is continuous or progressively deteriorating throughout several policy periods is potentially covered by all policies in effect during those periods.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.the timing of the accident,event,or conditions causing the bodily injury or property damage,an insured negligent act,is largely immaterial to establishing coverage it can occur before or during the policy period.neither is the date of discovery of the damage or injury controlling it might or might not be contemporaneous with the causal event.it is only the occurrence of bodily injury or property damage during the policy period,resulting from a sudden accidental event or the continuous or repeated exposure to conditions that triggers potential liability coverage.id.at,d.
where damages continue throughout successive policy periods,as was the case here,all insurance policies in effect during those periods are triggered.coverage is not limited to the policy in effect at the time of the precipitating event or condition and is not cut off once the injury or damage begins or becomes manifest.montrose,supra,cal th at,fn,d.moreover,once a policy is triggered,the policy obligates the insurer to pay all sums which the insured shall become liable to pay as damages for bodily injury or property damage.the insurer is responsible for the full extent of the insured liability not just for the part of the injury or damage that occurred during the policy period.armstrong world industries,aetna casualty surety th,d armstrong.the continuous injury trigger has been applied in cases such as this where the policy obligates insurers to pay those sums that the insured shall become legally obligated to pay.century indemnity hearrean th,d.w here successive policies have been purchased,bodily injury and property damage that is continuing or progressively deteriorating throughout more than one policy period is potentially covered by all policies in effect during those periods.citation.the successive insurers are not jointly and severally liable.citation.rather,a llocation of the cost of indemnification among such insurers requires application of principles of contract law to the express terms and limitations of the various policies and,in their absence,equitable considerations transport indemnity cal th,fn,d,citing montrose,supra,at,fn,d.
when a continuous loss is covered by multiple policies,the insured may elect to seek indemnity under a single policy with adequate policy limits.if that policy covers all sums for which the insured is liable,as most cgl policies do,that insurer may be held liable for the entire loss.montrose,supra,cal th at,d,armstrong,supra,th at,d.the insurer called upon to pay the loss may seek contribution from the other insurers on the risk.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
however,a claim for contribution would not lie against ciga,since such claims are statutorily barred under section,subdivision c,which provides covered claims does not include any obligations to insurers,insurance pools,or underwriting associations,nor their claims for contribution,indemnity,or subrogation,equitable or otherwise,except as otherwise provided in this chapter.in creating ciga,it was the legislature intent to protect the public,not to confer a benefit upon an insurance company.liemsakul,supra,d.
applying these rules,each of the solvent insurers was responsible for the full amount of the loss,up to its policy limits.plaintiffs entered into separate settlement agreements with each of the solvent insurers.the record does not disclose the amounts the solvent insurers paid to settle the case.nor do we know the total amount of the settlements with the three solvent insurers or the amount of the insurance policy limits that remain after settlement.however,the parties stipulated facts in support of the motion for summary judgment included stipulations that each of the settlements neither exhausted each solvent insurer policy limits nor fully satisfied the underlying judgment of and.since each of the solvent insurers was potentially liable for the full amount of its policy limits and that potential coverage was not exhausted in the settlements,we conclude there was other insurance available to plaintiffs.since there was other insurance available to cover this loss,it was not a covered claim within the meaning of the guarantee act,subd.c.we therefore conclude that the trial court did not err when it granted ciga summary judgment on this basis.
months before plaintiffs settled with the solvent insurers,ciga sent plaintiffs a letter advising them that claims covered by other insurance are excluded and that they should exhaust the solvent insurers policy limits before seeking payment from ciga.plaintiffs settled with the solvent insurers for less than policy limits with full knowledge of ciga position.plaintiffs can not bootstrap their claim against ciga by releasing their right to recover under an available policy and claiming that as a result there is no other coverage.parkwoods community california ins.guarantee th,d.plaintiffs chose to accept the risk of pursuing the claim against ciga as part of their settlement with the solvent insurers.their tactical choice can not be used to increase the extent of ciga statutory liability.ibid.
iv.ciga liability for trespass nuisance claims 
plaintiffs argue the court erred in granting summary judgment because there is no other insurance for their trespass and nuisance claims.they contend the continuous injury trigger of coverage,which provides that each policy triggered by a continuing or progressive loss claim has
