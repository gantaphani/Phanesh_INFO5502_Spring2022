american electric power company,aep implemented a life insurance coli plan in that caused it to purchase policies on the lives of over of its employees.in,aep deducted from its federal income tax approximately million in interest due on loans made against the policies.the irs disallowed the deduction and assessed aep with an additional million in taxes for the year in question.aep paid the additional tax under protest and then sued for a refund in federal district court.after a bench trial,the district court granted judgment in favor of the government.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
aep purchased a coli plan offered by mutual benefit life insurance company mbl in.by virtue of a reinsurance transaction,hartford life insurance company replaced mbl as the primary insurer in.for simplicity,both companies will hereafter be referred to as mbl.the plan consisted of life insurance policies on over aep employees.aep was the named beneficiary on all of these policies.each policy had a fixed annual premium of,the significance of which is explained in part.below.
the plan utilized an intricate funding mechanism.on the first day of each of the first three policy years,two financial transfers took place simultaneously.the first was the total premium paid by aep an amount in excess of million,which mbl credited to the policy value.policy value is a term of art utilized by the parties to denote the cumulative gross value of all the insurance policies within the coli plan.the other was a loan extended to aep by mbl,with the policy value used as collateral,in an amount equal to more than percent of the gross premium.in the first year,for example,this netting transaction resulted in aep actually paying mbl the greatly reduced sum of million.
a different netting transaction occurred on the first day of each of the next four policy years.aep paid the full premium,but mbl applied only about percent of the premium to increase the policy value.it took the remainder as an expense charge.mbl then returned to aep approximately percent of the amount taken as an expense charge as a loading dividend.aep also paid the accrued loan interest,but withdrew from the policy value nearly the same amount.thus,as in years one through three,the cash actually paid by aep to mbl in years four through seven was only a small percentage of the stated cost of the premiums.
the net equity of aep coli plan was based upon the policy value,minus policy loans and accrued interest.aep plan operated so that whatever cash was paid in at the beginning of the year was used up by the year end.at the end of each year,therefore,the coli plan had a net equity of zero.
the plan was also designed to ensure mortality neutrality.this meant that neither aep nor mbl reasonably expected to profit over the life of the plan because of the death of aep employees.to achieve this equilibrium,charges increased if more employees died than were expected,and,if experience proved the opposite,the insurance company paid aep mortality dividends.
the coli plan afforded aep the opportunity to annually select from a menu of options the interest rate that it would pay mbl on the policy loans.aep always picked one of the highest choices,never the lowest.for example,the interest rate chosen for the first year was percent,even though aep could have selected a rate as low as percent.aep had two incentives to choose the higher rates the higher rates increased its tax deduction for interest paid,and the coli plan provided that the true cost to aep was only the differential between what aep paid mbl as interest on the policy loans and what mbl credited back to aep in the form of interest on the policy value.
the component of aep coli plan was only one of many provisions designed to exploit certain aspects of the internal revenue code irc then in effect,which are discussed in part.below.aep fully understood that the plan would generate positive cash flow in every policy year only if it could deduct from its income taxes the interest on the policy loans.it decided to implement the coli plan based upon this expectation.in,however,the irs refused to allow the claimed deduction.aep therefore paid the additional tax under protest and then instituted this action to recover its alleged overpayment.
procedural background 
a bench trial commenced in october of and concluded two months later.both sides filed proposed findings of fact and memoranda.in february of,the district court granted judgment in favor of the united states.the court determined that the coli plan was an economic sham.it also held that the dividends in the fourth through seventh years of the plan,among other aspects,were shams in fact.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
whether the coli plan was an economic sham 
generally,a taxpayer may deduct all interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on indebtedness.irc a.but special rules apply to life insurance.in,irc a provided that,with certain exceptions,no deduction was permitted for any amount paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry life insurance pursuant to a plan of purchase which contemplates the systematic direct or indirect borrowing of part or all of the increases in the cash value of such contract section c delineated the exception relevant to aep coli plan a deduction was allowed if no part of of the annual premiums due during the period beginning with the date the first premium on the contract to which such plan relates was paid is paid under such plan by means of indebtedness.in any case,a capped the interest that could be deducted on indebtedness incurred to purchase life insurance at of indebtedness per insured life.
aep coli plan on its face fits neatly within the safe harbor rule.only in the first three years of the plan were premiums financed through policy loans.and because the premiums were fixed at,the policy loans through the first three years were precisely matched to the of indebtedness per insured life on which the interest was deductible x years.
but when it is patent that there is nothing of substance to be realized by the taxpayer from a transaction beyond a tax deduction,the deduction is not allowed despite the transaction formal compliance with code provisions.knetsch united states,d holding that the purchase of several annuity bonds was substantively a sham,and should therefore be disregarded in determining the validity of claimed income tax deductions,where the premiums were paid by loans secured by the bonds and additional borrowing reduced the annuity each bond would pay from tens of thousands to a pittance.this is known as the economic sham,or,doctrine.in this circuit,
t he proper standard in determining if a transaction is a sham is whether the transaction has any practicable economic effects other than the creation of income tax losses.a taxpayer subjective business purpose and the transaction objective economic substance may be relevant to this inquiry.

the district court decided that aep coli plan was an economic sham.its findings of fact on this issue are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.rink comm r,cir.but the standard of review for the ultimate or no not as clear.the government asserts that the ultimate conclusion is also subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review,citing ratliff commissioner,cir stating that t here is one issue presented in this case whether the tax court erred in concluding that the straddle transactions engaged in by the taxpayers were shams in substance,and then asserting that the determination of the tax court is binding on the appellate court unless clearly erroneous.
this court,however,has subsequently read ratliff as meaning that the legal standard applied by the tax court and its legal conclusions based upon its findings of fact are reviewed de novo.smith comm r,cir citing ratliff,at.relying on smith,aep contends that de novo review of the district court ultimate determination is appropriate.beyond their arguments and the above citations,the parties do not provide any additional
