liberty life assurance of boston liberty appeals from the district court grant of judgment on the pleadings for dillard,dillard in an employee retirement income security act erisa claim brought by dillard on behalf of itself and as assignee of janet bolton.bolton from the district court judgment awarding liberty reimbursement of overpayments resulting from her receipt of social security disability benefits.we affirm on bolton,reverse on dillard erisa claim,and remand the case to the district court with directions that the erisa complaint be dismissed.
from to,bolton worked at dillard as vice president of corporate advertising.she was responsible for making all managerial decisions for the corporate advertising department,including decisions regarding catalog advertisement,television advertisement,and the corporate advertising catalog.she also acted as the corporate director of all divisional and corporate catalogs,direct mail,statement enclosures,magazine advertisements,corporate gift wrap,logos,and special events.bolton maintained this position until august,when her primary care physician,charles barg,recommended that she terminate her employment because of her severe fatigue and uncontrolled hypertension high blood pressure.barg stated that this hypertensive crisis exacerbated bolton fibromuscular dysplasia fmd symptoms and that he was attempting to bring her blood pressure under control and deal with her fatigue,which was unchanged.
bolton had suffered from symptoms related to hypertension and fmd since.fmd is a disease of the blood vessels that causes stenoses and aneurysms.it most often affects the kidney arteries,and its cause is unknown.fmd can lead to high blood pressure and stroke,and shrinkage of the kidney is also often present in fmd patients.hypertension is a condition in which there is a rise in systemic blood pressure as a result of stenosis of one or more arteries or their branches.it may be caused,at least in part,by fmd.a patient may have high blood pressure and fmd,however,even if the high blood pressure is not caused by fmd.an angioplasty is the preferred and usual treatment for fmd patients.hypertension may be treated,in part,by stress reduction.between and,bolton underwent four angioplasties to treat her hypertension and fmd.she is not a candidate for further angioplasty,as such a procedure would be dangerous to her health.
bolton was covered under an disability plan issued by liberty.the plan provides that a claimant is eligible for disability benefits if she proves that she is unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of her occupation on an active employment basis because of an injury or sickness.at.when applicable,the proof must cover the date,cause,and degree of disability or partial disability.further,the plan provides that liberty is entitled to periodically require proof of continued disability,and liberty,at its own expense,has the right and opportunity to have the claimant examined by a physician or vocational expert of its choice.
on december,bolton filed a claim for disability benefits.in support of her claim,bolton provided liberty with a statement from her nephrologist,gregory bienvenu,who diagnosed her as suffering from hypertension and fmd.he classified her physical impairment as class,indicating that bolton had a slight limitation of functional capacity and that she was capable of light work.he also classified her impairment as class,indicating that bolton was capable of engaging in only limited stressful situations and limited interpersonal relations.
marianne wicker,a nurse in liberty managed disability services department,initially reviewed bolton claim.on february,nurse wicker noted that bolton had been diagnosed as having fmd for eight years,that bolton stated that her blood pressure was unstable,and that only since august,alleged date of bolton symptoms allegedly become so severe that she was unable to work.nurse wicker also noted that the medical information with which bolton provided her supported her status,but that no medical documentation indicated that this status was appropriate.for example,bolton physicians had not filled out restrictions or physical capacities forms to support her claim,and there was no current treatment plan for bolton.according to nurse wicker notes,bolton status was also difficult to support because it was unclear what had caused bolton to suddenly become unable to continue in her position at dillard.
in response to nurse wicker inquiry regarding the cause of bolton sudden inability to work,bolton stated that there was no one precipitating event but that she had reached a point at which she was constantly fatigued,and her blood pressure had become more difficult to control.at this point,nurse wicker advised edaleen luther,liberty certified case manager,that bolton file contained enough medical evidence and subjective information to support bolton status.she also stated that,for completeness,she would like to contact bolton primary care physicians to verify what bolton had relayed to her.
on march,nurse wicker noted that the objective information in bolton file supported her status at that time.on that same day,barg nurse confirmed what bolton had previously told nurse wicker.on march,barg sent a letter to liberty stating that as of august,bolton was taken out of work because of severe fatigue and uncontrolled hypertension.nurse wicker then concluded that bolton condition was chronic and had the potential to be very dangerous if left untreated.she stated that taking bolton out of work helped to control bolton hypertension and fatigue and would allow bolton to avoid having an emergency angiogram.further,she noted that it was becoming dangerous to continue performing these procedures on bolton.
based on all of this information,liberty disability case manager,dawn ratliff,recommended that liberty approve bolton claim for one year and recommended a review in eight months to examine new medical documentation to determine whether further benefits were warranted.ratliff supervisor agreed,and on march,liberty notified bolton that her claim had been approved.
a little over eight months later,ratliff contacted barg office to request bolton updated medical records.after receiving the requested records,ratliff referred bolton file to liberty managed care department for insight into bolton treatment and to assess whether a peer review of bolton file would be appropriate.on february,nurse wicker noted that the objective medical documentation continued to show that bolton did better when she did not have stress in her life and when her blood pressure remained under control.she further stated that the barrier to bolton return to work continued to be the fact that bolton had much better control of her blood pressure and stress when she was not working.on february,nurse wicker recorded bolton statement that her doctor had told her that he was primarily concerned about the diastolic number of her blood pressure and that it should remain below ninety.
liberty determined that a peer review was appropriate and requested that elizabeth gallup,review bolton file and issue a report.gallup concluded that there was no documented medical evidence that supported a degree of impairment precluding bolton from continuing as vice president of corporate advertising at dillard.although gallup did not question whether bolton had fmd and recognized that bolton had undergone several angioplasties and was not a candidate for further angioplasty,she stated that she could find no medical documentation indicating that bolton was in fact disabled by hypertension at the time of her alleged date of disability or during the year prior to or following that date.she also stated that bolton renal functions were stable and that her underlying renal disease had been stable for the past eight years.
liberty then opted to obtain an independent physician review of bolton claim by sorin vainer,assistant clinical professor of medicine at the medical college of georgia.vainer determined that bolton records demonstrated that bolton renal functions had been stable for the past eight years and that her bl
