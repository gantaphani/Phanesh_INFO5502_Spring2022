this case arises out of the lockheed mass tort litigation in which employees of lockheed sought recovery for bodily injuries caused by exposure to toxic chemical products during the course of their employment hereafter,the lockheed litigation.joined as defendants in this litigation were a number of companies which had supplied such chemical products to lockheed.in the matter before us,a successor corporation which had been sued for such bodily injuries allegedly arising from the predecessor corporation chemical products business,seeks defense and indemnity benefits under the predecessor liability insurance policies.under circumstances where the predecessor effectively ceased to exist,the successor corporation had acquired all of the assets of the predecessor and had expressly assumed all of its liabilities however,the predecessor insurance policies had not been assigned to the successor 
we are presented with the question as to whether the successor corporation is nonetheless entitled to the policy benefits of defense and indemnity as to those claims arising from bodily injuries that allegedly occurred prior to the transfer of the business to the successor.as we explain,under those circumstances,the successor is entitled,by operation of law,to claim such policy benefits.to hold otherwise would provide an unfair windfall to the insurers that had expressly underwritten these particular risks and had received premiums therefore permitting the successor to receive the promised policy benefits would not increase the risk to any insurer and would be consistent with the objectively reasonable expectations of all parties.
the plaintiff and appellant,henkel corporation henkel,is the successor described above and it has appealed from a summary judgment on its complaint for declaratory relief granted in favor of the defendants and respondents,hartford accident and indemnity company hartford and century indemnity company century collectively,the insurers.the insurers had provided,through issuance of multiple policies,liability insurance to henkel predecessor during the period to when the claimants in the lockheed litigation claimed to have suffered bodily injury from exposure to the predecessor chemical products.by its action,henkel sought to recoup some portion of the sums it had expended to defend and settle the lockheed litigation.the insurers had denied coverage and refused a defense on the ground that henkel was not an insured under any of the policies and that,in fact,a different corporation had succeeded to the assets of the predecessor not acquired by henkel and that corporation was the only party entitled to assert a claim for policy benefits.that other corporation was the defendant and respondent,rhone,which had also been named in henkel declaratory relief complaint.the trial court agreed with the claim that rhone was the party that had succeeded to the ownership of the insurers policies therefore,rhone motion for summary judgment on henkel complaint was also granted and is before us in this appeal.
because we conclude that ownership of the policies is not relevant to henkel right to receive policy benefits for claims arising,and as to which a basis for coverage under the insurers policies had existed,prior to the transfer of the predecessor business,we will reverse the summary judgments granted in favor of the insurers and rhone.that does not mean,however,that henkel is thereby entitled to succeed on its recoupment claim.contrary to the views of the parties and the trial court,we perceive a number of triable issues of material fact remaining to be resolved.all that we decide now is the predicate legal issue that,under the circumstances presented in this case,coverage must follow liability.the right to call upon policies of insurance covering claims which have accrued prior to the transfer of the predecessor business will devolve,absent an express agreement to the contrary,by operation of law upon the successor which has assumed the liabilities of the predecessor.in reaching this result,we distinguish or reject the two california appellate decisions upon which the insurers and rhone rely.
factual and procedural 
for a number of years prior to,amchem products,a pennsylvania corporation amchem was engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products.it engaged in two separate distinct lines of business metal working chemical products and agricultural chemical products.during a substantial portion of the period through,amchem carried liability insurance with the insurers 
in,amchem was merged into ucar corporation,a wholly owned subsidiary of union carbide corporation which had purchased all of the stock of amchem.ucar corporation then changed its name to amchem products,and remained a pennsylvania corporation.for convenience,we continue to refer to this corporate entity as amchem as,for our purposes,it is still the same corporation.
this all changed,effective april,when amchem decided to reorganize its business and caused a new corporation to be formed under delaware law,also known as amchem products.this corporation was a wholly owned subsidiary of amchem and is hereafter referred to as amchem amchem caused all of the assets,liabilities and goodwill utilized in its metal working chemical products business to be transferred to amchem,while amchem retained all of the assets and liabilities which existed with respect to the agricultural chemical products business.while amchem assumed all of the liabilities relating to the metal working chemical products business which existed as of april,the several policies of insurance which had theretofore been issued to amchem by the insurers were not assigned to amchem the reason for this,according to the declaration of counsel for amchem,who handled this corporate reorganization,was that the insurance policies had been issued to amchem and were not assets related to the chemicals business.
although counsel for the insurers and rhone assert that amchem expressly assumed all liabilities of amchem utilized in its metal working chemical activities,the only evidence of such assumption cited to us is the resolution of amchem board of directors,dated march.that resolution provided the transfer,conveyance and assignment effective april,from amchem to amchem of all of the right title and interest of amchem in and to the domestic assets,liabilities and goodwill utilized in its metalworking chemical activities be and the same is hereby accepted the generality of such language causes the transaction documentation to be ambiguous as to whether claims for bodily injury or property damage,arising from amchem metal working chemical products business,which existed as of april,but had not then been asserted,could be considered claims for which insurance coverage existed and thus part of the assets transferred to amchem or were they simply liabilities for which amchem had accepted sole responsibility and for which it had implicitly waived any claim to coverage under the policies issued by the insurers such general language does not expressly preclude coverage for unknown and unasserted claims which existed as of the date of transfer.if there is additional undisputed evidence of the parties intent on this issue it is not disclosed by this record.
ultimately,through various corporate mergers and transfers,amchem became a wholly owned subsidiary of henkel and,in december of,it was merged into henkel.similarly,amchem was ultimately sold to rhone and,effective december,was merged into it.thus,this record presents an undisputed factual picture of henkel succeeding to all of the rights and obligations of amchem and rhone to all of the rights and obligations of amchem 
in approximately,the first of the civil actions for wrongful death and personal injury constituting the lockheed litigation was filed.henkel and amchem products,were ultimately named as defendants in this litigation.these actions were filed on behalf of more than current or former employees of the lockheed corporation lockheed,or one of its subsidiaries or divisions.in these complaints,it was alleged that the plaintiffs or their decedents suffered injury or death as the result of working with toxic chemical substances in the course of their employment by lockheed.these several civil actions constituting the lockheed litigation were ultimately coordinated in the los angeles superior court as judicial council coordination proceeding jccp.
the plaintiffs in the lockheed litigation alleged claims asserting manufacturing and design defects,failure to warn and negligence and claimed that their exposure to such hazardous chemicals for which they received neither warning nor protection took place over a period of years commencing in the and continuously thereafter.among the toxic chemicals to which the plaintiffs claimed they were exposed were products manufactured by amchem prior to april,in connection with its metal working chemical product business and by amchem after that date.after its acquisition of the stock of amchem,henkel continued in this business 
following service upon it of the complaints in the lockheed litigation,henkel tendered them to the insurers and they each denied coverage and refused a defense the insurers took the position that henkel was not entitled to coverage as it was not an insured party nor was it entitled,by virtue of its acquisition of amchem,to claim such coverage.henkel therefore undertook at its own expense the defense of the litigation.in the summer of,it commenced settlement discussions with the lockheed plaintiffs.a demand was made by those plaintiffs for million.henkel notified the insurers of the negotiations and of this offer it requested that the insurers contribute their policy limits in order to effect a settlement.they refused to make any contribution to a settlement.after several months of further negotiation with the lockheed plaintiffs,henkel agreed to settle with them for the sum of which it paid in exchange for a release and a dismissal of all of the actions with prejudice.agreement on the settlement terms was reached on november,and a dismissal of the entire action with prejudice was filed and entered on july,as to defendants henkel corporation and amchem products.
henkel then sought to recoup from the insurers their allocable portion of the settlement and defense costs.the insurers refused to negotiate any resolution of henkel recoupment claims.as a result,henkel filed this action for declaratory relief on august.as already noted,the insurers took the position that henkel was not an insured party nor an assignee or successor to one and therefore they owed no obligation to provide either defense or indemnity for any claims asserted against henkel or an entity identified as amchem products,it was and is the insurers position that the only party entitled to claim coverage under the liability policies issued by them in the name of amchem products,during the period is rhone.it is that corporation,they contend,which is the proper successor to amchem and is thus the actual insured party.in order to fully litigate that contention,the insurers caused rhone to be added as a necessary party to this action on october.
thereafter,rhone filed a against henkel for declaratory relief claiming it was the corporate successor of amchem and that henkel was not entitled to coverage under any of the insurers policies.it was and is rhone position that those policies were not among the assets relating to the metal working chemical products business which had been assigned to amchem on april.such policies instead were retained by amchem and thus it was the only proper insured who could assert a claim thereunder.rhone argues that,since it is the corporate successor of amchem,it is entitled to a judgment declaring that henkel has no viable claim for coverage under the policies issued by the insurers during the time period.
in light of such argument,it is necessary at this point to digress to a critical procedural event which took place during the underlying lockheed litigation.in early,the plaintiffs in that litigation had served on rhone a summons and complaint which named amchem products,as a defendant.rhone promptly moved to quash such service on several grounds.one of those grounds was that the named defendant,amchem products,was in no way a part of rhone or any rhone entity.rhone argued that since neither rhone nor any rhone entity had been listed on the summons,service on rhone should be quashed.
in support of this motion,an counsel employed by rhone,barbara moore,submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury in which she stated that she acted as litigation counsel for rhone and all of that companies subsidiaries.she further stated that she had personal knowledge of all of the facts set out in her declaration.moore then stated to the best of my information and belief,amchem products,no longer exists.if it does exist,it certainly is not in any way a part of rhone or any rhone entity.it may be a part of a completely unrelated corporation named henkel corporation which is already a defendant in this litigation.italics added.
before its motion to quash could be ruled upon,rhone negotiated directly with the lockheed plaintiffs for a stipulation that its motion could be granted.that stipulation,to which rhone was a party,provided in part plaintiffs have conducted further investigation,since april,of rhone potential involvement in the lockheed consolidated cases,and have been presented with documents establishing that henkel corporation is answerable for the liabilities of amchem products,alleged in the lockheed consolidated cases.accordingly,plaintiffs have no interest in asserting their claims against rhone.in sum,it would appear that rhone was dropped from the lockheed litigation on the ground that the entity responsible for the production and sale of the alleged toxic chemicals no longer existed as it had been merged into henkel.this fact is relevant to our later discussion of henkel claim that it is entitled to coverage under the insurers policies for the claims arising from the pretransfer injuries to the lockheed plaintiffs and that rhone is now judicially estopped to contest that proposition.
in september,henkel filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that as the corporate successor of the entity that had manufactured the toxic chemicals that were the subject of the lockheed litigation,it was entitled to the benefit of the liability policies that had been purchased to provide liability coverage for such manufacturing activity.since henkel had defended and settled all of those claims,it asserted that it was entitled to obtain recoupment from the insurers.in october,the insurers and rhone filed for summary judgment.
on january,these competing motions came before the trial court.it concluded that there were no disputed issues of material fact and held that the insurers and rhone were entitled to judgment.it rejected henkel arguments that,as the successor to the product business attacked in the lockheed litigation,it was entitled to the benefit of liability insurance issued to cover such business the court also rejected henkel defacto merger contention.it did so,as stated by the trial court,because that doctrine did not apply in this case since amchem,the company that had sold off the offending business,continued to exist and,in any event,a claimant is free to pursue the successor company,amchem no.in the trial court view,the continued existence of amchem and the lockheed plaintiffs naming of henkel and amchem products,as defendants was sufficient to avoid application of the defacto merger doctrine.finally,the court also rejected henkel fall back position that if no insurance coverage was available then rhone was liable to equally share henkel settlement and defense costs in the lockheed litigation.
judgment was entered against henkel on july,and this timely appeal followed.
issue presented 
the fundamental question before us is whether henkel,under the facts presented in this case,has standing to claim the benefit of coverage under the liability policies issued by the insurers to amchem during the time period so as to recoup the settlement and defense costs which it incurred to dispose of the claims that arose from the business activities of amchem during that period.to resolve that question we must examine the proper application of the principle that coverage should follow liability.

the trigger of coverage under an occurrence liability policy 
critical to our analysis is an understanding of the basic principles of insurance law governing a determination of whether a particular third party claim may be covered by a particular liability policy.what is necessary to trigger coverage under a specific policy 
the term trigger of coverage is not found in a general liability policy.rather,it is a term of convenience which is used to describe what operative event must happen during the policy period to activate the insurer defense and indemnity obligations.as the supreme court has put it,t he issue is largely one of must take place within the policy effective dates for the potential of coverage to be triggered montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,fn,d,emphasis in original montrose.
in an liability policy,such as those issued by the insurers in this matter,coverage is established at the time the complaining party was actually damaged.id.at,d.to put it another way,coverage under a liability policy,promising to indemnify the insured for all sums it may become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage,is triggered when the bodily injury or property damage occurs,irrespective of when the insured allegedly wrongful conduct may have taken place.if that injury or damage occurs during the policy period,then coverage under the policy is triggered provided the accident or condition is at least a potentially covered risk.id.at,d.
thus,if the insured wrongful this case,the manufacture and sale of toxic chemicals without proper during the policy period,but injury or damage to a claimant does not occur until after the policy has expired,there can be no coverage because the operative event necessary to trigger that coverage did not occur during the policy period.state farm mut.auto.ins.longden d.the insured allegedly negligent failure to maintain the brakes on an automobile caused a brake failure and resulting accident after the policy expired no coverage available as required coverage trigger,the injuries caused by the accident did not occur during policy period schrillo hartford accident indemnity d.a product liability policy in effect when defective product was manufactured did not cover claim for injuries suffered several years later maples aetna cas.surety d.a gas boiler installed by contractor caused fire damage to home six years later the owner claim for damages was not covered under contractor liability policy in effect at time of allegedly negligent installation.
in continuous injury cases,such as we appear to have here,where the insured actions result in claims of continuing or progressively deteriorating bodily injury or property damage,a similar rule is applied.such cases usually implicate,as they do here,multiple and successive policies and policy periods.in such cases,bodily injury and property damage which is continuous or progressively deteriorating throughout several policy periods is potentially covered by all policies in effect during those periods.montrose,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,if specified harm is caused by an included occurrence and results,at least in part,within the policy period,it perdures to all points of time at which some such harm results thereafter.transport indemnity cal th,d,fn.omitted,aerojet.
thus,where damages continue throughout successive policy periods,all insurance policies in effect during those periods,are triggered.coverage is not limited to the policy in effect at the time of the precipitating event or condition.nor is coverage cut off once the injury or damage begins or becomes manifest.montrose,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,although the trigger of the duty to defend and indemnify is limited to the policy period,the extent of that duty is not.as a result,any triggered policy is liable up to the policy limit,for all injuries or damages caused by a covered occurrence,not just the injury or damage which took place during the specific policy period.aerojet,supra,cal th at,d.
when we apply these settled legal principles to this case,it would appear that a basis for coverage under the several policies issued by the insurers during the time period,for claims arising from injuries to the lockheed plaintiffs occurring during such policy periods,is established by the occurrence of such injuries.as a result,the insurers owe a duty of defense and indemnification under those policies to somebody upon the assertion of such claims this is a fundamental point which is critical to the proper resolution of this case.according to the allegations of the lockheed plaintiffs,they sustained bodily injuries during the period due to exposure to the chemical products of amchem.whether or not asserted during the policy periods,the claims of the lockheed plaintiffs constituted claims for which the insurers had been paid an agreed premium to defend and indemnify.henkel,therefore,is seeking nothing more than the enforcement of an obligation already undertaken by the insurers.nothing henkel seeks to do will increase any risk to the insurers which they have not already agreed to assume and for which they were paid a premium.
the only question before us then is whether henkel is entitled to assert that claim.we now turn to that issue.
henkel is entitled to coverage under the insurers policies for claims existing as of april,whether or not asserted 
a.there was no expressed intent to deny coverage under the policies for unasserted claims 
on april,amchem succeeded to all of the assets and liabilities of amchem which related to the metal working chemical products business.did this include,in the absence of a contrary agreement,the right to coverage under existing applicable policies for those claims for injuries which existed as of that date,even though such claims had not yet been asserted we believe the answer to that question is yes.it is settled that the right to recover under a policy after a loss has occurred is an asset assignable separate from the policy itself.greco oregon mut.fire ins.d.thus,it can be assigned without insurer consent,the no assignment clause notwithstanding.ibid.such an assignment in no way interferes with the insurer right to chose its own indemnitee but only involves the payment of a claim founded upon a loss which has already occurred and against which the policy indemnifies if it was the intent of amchem to retain the exclusive right to seek coverage under the insurers policies for any claims arising from the conduct of its metal working chemical products business prior to april,it is not directly or expressly reflected in the record presented to us.
moreover,if amchem had any such intent on april,it is not only unsupported by any of the documentation of its divestiture of the metal working chemical products business to amchem,it is also strongly contradicted by the position rhone took when it was served with a summons and complaint in the lockheed litigation.the documents that it filed to quash that service,as well as the stipulation it entered into with the lockheed plaintiffs,makes it clear that as far as any business activity of amchem upon which the lockheed plaintiffs might be basing their injury claims was concerned,the only surviving responsible entity was amchem.if it was amchem position that it was not a proper party to the lockheed litigation,then that assertion is very probative of its intent and understanding of the terms of its divestiture of the business to amchem in.obviously,if it is the case that after april,amchem was to have no responsibility for any claims arising from the metal working chemical products business,and could not properly be sued thereon,then it had no need for reliance on the insurance coverage available for such claims.further,if the insurers,having been paid a premium to cover the very claims asserted against henkel,owe coverage of those claims to somebody,then does it not follow that henkel is the only party rightfully entitled to claim such coverage 
henkel,as the successor corporation liable on the claims of the lockheed plaintiffs,is entitled to coverage under the insurer policies by operation of law 
under the facts of this case,where amchem acquired all of the assets and liabilities of amchem as to the metal working chemical products business which is the source of the lockheed litigation,the benefits due under the insurers policies,including the right to a defense of the claims asserted by the lockheed plaintiffs,passed to amchem by operation of law.
this is so because as of april,amchem expressly agreed to accept all of the assets,liabilities and goodwill utilized by amchem in its metal working chemical business and,based on the record before us,we can not conclude that its right to call upon insurance available to cover those liabilities was excluded from the purchase and sale transaction.it appears to us that,absent a contrary agreement as to the availability of such liability insurance,the principles articulated in northern ins.of new york allied mut.ins.cir northern apply.
in northern,the court held,in a factual context very similar to that before us,that the benefits due under the policy transferred by operation of law.in that case,brown forman bought out california cooler under an agreement where the predecessor company would indemnify the successor company for any liabilities arising from presale activities a child born before the sale filed suit after the sale alleging fetal alcohol syndrome attributable to the california coolers his mother consumed during her pregnancy.this suit ended in a voluntary dismissal,but the issue remained as to whether the predecessor insurer had any liability to contribute to defense costs.as in our case,the insurer policy had not been assigned to the successor corporation indeed,it had been expressly excluded from the list of assets transferred to.
nonetheless,the northern court concluded that was entitled to the coverage benefits due under the policy.it held that neither the sales agreement between the predecessor and successor corporations,nor the intent of these parties,nor the terms of the predecessor corporation contract with its insurance company ultimately controlled instead,the benefits due under the policy passed to by operation of law.since the doctrine of successor liability transferred the liability from the predecessor to the successor corporation,the right to indemnity followed as well.t he right to indemnity arising from the predecessor corporation insurance policy transferred together with the potential liability.this right to indemnity followed the liability rather than the policy itself.as a result,even though the parties did not assign the predecessor corporation insurer policy in the agreement,the right to indemnity under the policy transferred to the successor corporation by operation of law.id.at italics added.
the court also concluded that these policy benefits extended to a defense.the rationale for both conclusions rested upon the obvious fact that the insurer is not prejudiced by such a result when the loss occurred before sale or transfer to the successor.in that circumstance,the characteristics of the successor are of little importance regardless of any transfer the insurer still covers only the risk it evaluated when it wrote the policy the nature of the risk,rather than the particular characteristics of the defendant,will have the greater effect on defense costs.the extent and character of the defense will turn on the nature of the product itself and the attributes of the firm that manufactured the product.aspects of the successor firm could affect the defense,but the shape of the defense will be determined largely by the characteristics of the risk originally insured.admittedly,defense costs could balloon if the successor firm failed to cooperate in the defense.inasmuch as the successor firm was not a party to the original policy,the risk of noncooperation arguably increases.yet,the insurer is protected against this risk because it is freed of its defense obligation if the successor firm does not fulfill its duty to aid in the defense.id.at.
we believe that northern articulates the correct analysis in those successor corporation cases where the loss has already occurred but a claim is not asserted until after the transfer to the successor.its reasoning has been followed by a number of courts.for example,in diversified.american motorists ins,the court followed northern and concluded that coverage followed liability by operation of law.in a case much like the one before us,the successor corporation in had assumed the predecessor assets and liabilities by contract.the court held that the underlying principle that insurance follows liability is equally valid even though the successor liability burden was imposed by contract rather than under successor product liability rules.id.at.this is so because an insurer risks are not increased when its duty to defend and indemnity relates to events occurring prior to the transfer.ibid.coverage will depend on the terms of each policy,but the damage to the property is the same regardless.see also total waste management commercial union ins,an insurer risk does not increase where the loss or liability arose prior to the transfer.
the only two california cases which have considered this issue,however,appear at first glance to reach a different conclusion than northern.unsurprisingly,these two cases are the ones which the insurers and rhone urge upon us.neither are persuasive.
in quemetco pacific automobile ins.th,d quemetco,the successor corporation purchased all of the assets of the predecessor in.the predecessor had in,and again in,shipped sulfuric acid waste and battery electrolytes to the stringfellow acid pits in riverside county.no deposits were ever made by the successor.the predecessor insurance policies were not assigned to the successor the predecessor distributed all of its assets and wound up and dissolved in january.the successor was then sued in in both federal and state court actions.the federal case was filed under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla and sought damages for environmental exposure as well as cleanup costs.the state case was an action by individual plaintiffs for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the hazardous waste material deposited at the stringfellow site 
relying on the northern case,the successor filed an action for declaratory relief to determine its entitlement to coverage under the predecessor insurance policies.the quemetco court,however,refused to follow northern on the ground that the cercla case before it did not present similar circumstances.unlike the facts in northern,and those in the case before us,quemetco involved a claim which arose long after the sale when federal environmental laws were enacted requiring the clean up of toxic waste sites.thus,unlike the situation in northern,no liability passed as a matter of law to the successor at the time of the asset sale as no such liability existed at that time.quemetco,supra,th,d italics added.the court also rejected,for the same reason,the proposition that there could have been any assignment of the proceeds of the policies as there was no loss or injury or accrued right to collect the proceeds in existence.the cleanup damages were not assessed until,long after the sale.id.at,d.finally,the quemetco court also noted that the predecessor corporation,although dissolved,could still be sued and was entitled to a defense from its insurers.id.at,d.thus,any recognition of policy benefits in favor of the successor would have placed an increased risk and burden on the insurers requiring them to provide a defense for two parties,only one of which they had agreed to insure.id.this,of course,is not a problem in this case,as rhone actions to end its participation in the lockheed litigation clearly demonstrated.it obtained a dismissal from that action upon the representation and ultimately by a stipulation that it had no liability whatsoever for the claims asserted against henkel.thus,the quemetco decision is factually distinguishable and can not justify our rejection of the analysis and reasoning of northern 
the other case relied by the insurers and rhone is general accident ins.superior court,supra,th,d general accident.in that case,the successor took over the predecessor in about under circumstances which resulted in a later judicial determination,under the successor liability doctrine ray alad cal d,that the successor corporation was liable for the tortious claims arising from the predecessor business which involved the manufacture and sale of asbestos products.general accident,supra,th at,d.the successor sued the predecessor insurers for a declaratory judgment that the predecessor insurance policies had been transferred to the successor by operation of law.id.at,d.the successor relied upon the northern decision.id.at,d.
the general accident court rejected the reasoning of northern and refused to follow it.general accident,supra,th at,d.specifically,it refused to conclude that insurance coverage would transfer by operation of law simply based on the finding of successor liability for product liability torts.an relationship is a matter of contract.successor liability is a matter of tort duty and liability.it is one thing to deem the successor corporation liable for the predecessor torts it is quite another to deem the successor corporation a party to insurance contracts it never signed,and for which it never paid a premium,and to deem the insurer to be in a contractual relationship with a stranger.id.at,d.the court concluded that any transfer of a policy by operation of law was a violation of the basic principles of contract and is also bad public policy.id.at,d.with all due respect to our colleagues in the first district,we must question just what conclusion we are to draw from the general accident decision.if it stands for the proposition that the imposition of successor tort liability can not by itself justify the transfer of an interest in a policy of insurance by,in effect,adding or substituting a new insured to which the insurer has not consented,and thereby creating additional unbargained for and uncompensated risks,then we have no problem with it.such a conclusion would clearly violate fundamental contract law.if,however,as the insurers and rhone argue,general accident stands for the proposition that the right to obtain policy benefits for the defense and indemnification of claimed losses which had occurred during the policy period prior to the sale or transfer to a successor corporation,then we must reject it.northern did not purport to sanction what general accident found so improper.it did not sanction the transfer of an insurance contract so as to create new unbargained for burdens or to impose upon an unwilling insurer a new insured whose activities it had not agreed to underwrite.rather,northern simply affirmed a successor right to call upon the policy benefits already due to the predecessor for unasserted claims which arose as the result of the occurrence of injury or damage during the policy period.in short,and in legal effect,it simply held that the right to claim such benefits was a right of the predecessor corporation to which the successor corporation succeeded by operation of law.thus,the general accident decision provides no relevant reason for rejecting the analysis made by the northern court.
c.the no assignment clause in the insurers policies does not defeat henkel coverage claim 
as we have already emphasized,the transfer of policy benefits which have effectively accrued impose no new or additional burden on an insurer.there is no increase in risk when an insurer duty to defend and indemnify relates to injury or damage which was suffered by the claimant prior to the sale or transfer to the successor corporation.thus,there is no reason to be concerned with the no assignment clause when the claims for which coverage is demanded arose prior to the sale or transfer.
as the northern court put it,insurers take account of the nature of the insured when issuing a policy.risk characteristics of the insured determine whether the insurer will provide coverage,and at what rate.an assignment could alter drastically the insurer exposure depending on the nature of the new insured.no assignment clauses protect against any such unforeseen increase in risk.when the loss occurs before the transfer,however,the characteristics of the successor are of little importance regardless of any transfer the insurer still covers only the risk it evaluated when it wrote the policy.northern,supra,at see also,ocean accident guar.southwestern bell.cir,cert.denied.
other than the overly broad and misdirected characterization in general accident,we have found no california authority suggesting otherwise.however,a number of other courts have endorsed the basic principle articulated by northern.see,imperial enterprises,fireman fund ins.cir,the clause should not be applied ritualistically and mechanically to forfeit coverage in these circumstances national american insurance jamison agency,cir,the purpose of a no assignment clause is to prevent an increase of risk and hazard of loss by change of ownership without the knowledge of the insurer.citation.brunswick paul fire marine ins,the reason for refusing to apply a clause to avoid an involuntary assignment is pragmatic such transfers do not entail any increase in the risk or hazard assumed by an insurer.paxton vierling steel great american insurance,same gopher oil american hardware mut.ins,the purpose of a clause is to protect the insurer from an increase to the risk it has agreed to insure.citations.but when events giving rise to an insurer liability have already occurred,the insurer risk is not increased by a change in the insured identity.citation.
that such claim was unasserted as of the date of the sale or transfer to the successor corporation is not determinative.coverage liability under a particular policy is determined as the date of the claimant loss or injury irrespective of when the claim is asserted.in this case,amchem would clearly have been entitled to the policy benefits prior to april,when it transferred all of the relevant assets to amchem.such benefits obviously related solely to the chemical products business which was the object of the transfer.therefore,why should henkel as the successor to amchem not now be entitled to receive such benefits as we discuss below,rhone as successor to the original named insured is estopped to assert any claim to such benefits.
there is no reason to rely on the no assignment clause to defeat henkel claim of coverage.no new contractual burden is imposed on the insurers they need only defend a single party as to the very same claims which would have been asserted against the original named insured but for the circumstances of this case.the insurers collected premiums to cover these very risks.if they are successful in defeating henkel claim to such policy benefits,the insurers will realize an undeserved windfall as they would now owe no coverage to any party for a risk they promised to insure and for which they were paid an agreed premium.
rhone is judicially estopped to assert that extension of coverage to henkel will increase any burden on insurers or diminish its own coverage for claims arising from presale injuries,the liability for which was assumed by amchem 
as we have already discussed,rhone was able to obtain a stipulated dismissal from the underlying lockheed action on the representation which it formally asserted that there was no corporate responsibility for the claims made by the lockheed plaintiffs other than that assumed by amchem and henkel.rhone made it clear that no predecessor existed with respect to the liabilities assumed by amchem.based on that representation,rhone successfully extricated itself from the lockheed litigation.it thus follows that it will have no occasion to call upon the insurers to provide coverage for any of the claims relevant to this proceeding.if the insurers are going to provide coverage to anyone for these claims for which they were paid the requested premiums they will have to provide it to henkel.rhone should not,in this action,be heard to argue otherwise.
judicial estoppel is a doctrine.thomas gordon th,d.it will be applied when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position,the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.citations.jackson county of los angeles th,d.all of these elements are clearly satisfied here.
judicial estoppel prevents a party from asserting a position in a legal proceeding that is contrary to a position previously taken in the same or some earlier proceeding.the doctrine serves a clear purpose to protect the integrity of the judicial process.citation.jackson county of los angeles,supra,th at,d.it is a doctrine that is invoked to prevent a party from changing its position over the course of judicial proceedings when such positional changes will have an adverse impact on the judicial process.a litigant should not be permitted to play fast and loose with the courts.ibid.we believe the doctrine should be applied here to foreclose rhone from asserting any argument premised on the fiction that any party other than henkel would have any legitimate claim on coverage from the insurers arising from the presale activities of amchem in the conduct of the chemical business sold to amchem on april.
conclusion 
for all of these reasons,we conclude that henkel is entitled to assert a claim for the policy benefits under the policies issued by the insurers.in reaching this conclusion,however,we emphasize that it does not follow that the insurers will necessarily have any obligation to reimburse henkel for the defense and settlement costs which it expended to obtain a dismissal from the lockheed litigation.we simply reverse the summary judgment granted on the competing claims to declaratory relief.it is our intent only to resolve in henkel favor the predicate legal question that henkel is entitled to pursue the policy benefits due under the insurers policies for coverage of claims arising from bodily injuries suffered during the period which were allegedly caused by exposure to the metal working chemical products manufactured and sold by amchem during said period.absent an express agreement to the contrary which is not established by the record before us,henkel has standing to assert a claim to such policy benefits by operation of law,even though the policies themselves were never assigned or the insurers consent obtained.
it will still be henkel burden at trial,however,to produce evidence establishing a basis for potential coverage duty to defend or actual coverage duty to indemnify under the policies.there are also open questions as to the proper allocation of henkel defense costs and settlement expenses to claims arising under the insurers policy coverage and under other time periods for which different insurers may have some responsibility.finally,as we have already suggested,we do not foreclose the possibility of a factual dispute as to the terms of the contract between amchem and amchem regarding the right to claim policy benefits under the insurers policies and whether amchem waived any of its rights with respect thereto.rhone has made assertions regarding the nature and scope of such agreement that are not supported by the documents cited.however,other evidence may exist.these and any other relevant unresolved issues will have to be settled upon remand 
disposition 
the summary judgment entered on july,in favor of rhone and the insurers is reversed.the matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed herein.henkel shall recover its costs on appeal.
the policies contained no assignment clauses which precluded their assignment by the named insured without the consent of the insurer.
the relevant facts as opposed to their competing characterizations by the parties are not in dispute and are clearly established by the record on appeal.
amchem started life in as a delaware corporation and through an acquisition and merger became a pennsylvania corporation in.such corporate history,however,is irrelevant to the issues before us.
during this period,amchem carried liability insurance with a number of insurers.according to the appellate record before us,however,coverage by the insurers was as follows hartford september century september hartford october.
contemporaneously,amchem changed its name to union carbide agricultural products company,ucapco.however,in the interests of clarity and simplicity,we will,continue to refer to this company as amchem.
such policies contained a clause which precluded any assignment of the policies themselves without the consent of the insurers.it was expressly understood,however,that with respect to any claims covered under any of the policies which had been asserted against amchem prior to april,and which related to the metal working chemical products business,were deemed covered under such policies in other words,such existing and asserted claims constituted a basis for coverage under the insurers policies and were thus considered assets relating to the metal working chemical products business.
this statement,however,is a post transaction conclusion asserted in this litigation.the record presented to us does not reflect that amchem agreed to any such characterization of the policies issued by the insurers.
we have found nothing in the record before us reflecting a specific agreement between amchem and amchem regarding the latter right to call upon liability insurance covering claims existing but not asserted as of april.
we have greatly simplified our summary of these very complex corporate histories,but the relevant background facts are stated sufficiently to provide an accurate context for our consideration of the validity of henkel claims for recovery of defense and indemnification,settlement expenses incurred in connection with the lockheed litigation arising out of amchem metal working chemical product business during the time period.
the chemical products identified by the plaintiffs in the lockheed litigation as being the responsibility of henkel were products identified as alodine,alodine and alodine.these products all had been produced and marketed by amchem prior to its april,divestiture of its metal working chemical products business to amchem.
henkel also tendered the litigation to its own insurers which had issued policies directly to henkel.we are not concerned with the coverage claims or disputes,if any which may have arisen out of those tenders.we have before us only the claims against the insurers which had provided liability coverage to amchem during the period.
while not directly relevant to the issues before us,some allocation
