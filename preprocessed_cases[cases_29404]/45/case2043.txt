this case involves various age and gender discrimination claims brought by judith bryant bryant against her former employer,farmers insurance exchange farmers.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of farmers.on appeal,bryant raises two issues whether the district court abused its discretion in excluding portions of her summary judgment affidavit as inadmissable and whether there existed a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the pretextual nature of farmers proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating bryant.as to bryant affidavit,we hold,inter alia,that so long as the other prerequisites of.e are met,it is permissible to submit simple statistical calculations such as averages without first being designated as an expert witness.regarding pretext,we conclude that bryant evidence calling into question the veracity of farmers nondiscriminatory reasons for firing her are sufficient to establish pretext for summary judgment purposes.thus,taking jurisdiction under,we reverse.
background 
i.the parties 
bryant is a white female who worked for farmers in various capacities from march until her termination in march farmers is a large,national insurance exchange based in california that sells a variety of policies,including coverage for recreational products,the division in which bryant worked when she was terminated.
at the time of her termination,bryant was a claims director within the specialty claims unit of the western division of farmers.specifically,specialty claims handled claims from five types of insurance products recreational products insurance rpi marine insurance loss reporting antique auto and national recovery.each insurance product had its own individual director of claims.
rpi dealt primarily with recreational vehicles and motorcycles.within rpi,there existed two groups of claims adjusters liability and adjusted property of physical damage apd.the liability section handled claims where farmers insureds were accused of causing injury to others.apd,on the other hand,handled claims for property damage to vehicles covered by rpi policies.
in march,bryant began working for farmers as a regional marketing manager in denver,colorado.over the next few years,bryant earned a number of promotions and moved throughout the company.by,bryant was director of claims for rpi.
along with the directors of claims for the other four insurance products in specialty claims,bryant answered to jack honore,the division claims manager since.one of bryant subordinate managers was steve nagle,who headed the liability section of rpi.nagle,a male,eventually replaced bryant after honore terminated her in march.
farmers internal auditing procedure 
on january,farmers instituted a new quality control program that included the balanced scorecard,an attempt objectively to measure an office performance in four categories customer satisfaction financial perspective internal perspective and organizational.
as part of the balanced scorecard evaluation,executives conducted a quality assurance review,which was basically an audit of claims for each individual insurance product.under the company procedure,auditors would review a statistical sample of claims files and measure two factors compliance and leakage.
the compliance score measured the thoroughness of the files reviewed.in other words,the auditors would make sure that each file had the necessary documentation,claimant contacts,and paperwork.after reviewing the files for completeness,the auditors assigned a percentage score based on how much of the required information was missing or improperly recorded.
the leakage score measured the percentage of overpayments.there were two components to this score hard leakage and soft leakage.hard leakage referred to objective overpayment.these were amounts that absolutely should not have been paid because,for example,the policy did not cover the injury or because the claim exceeded the policy limit.soft leakage was a more subjective determination.it was the amount of overpayment on a claim based on the auditor evaluation of the claim worth.thus,if the adjuster paid out on a claim that the auditor felt was worth only,this would represent in soft leakage.the hard and soft leakage amounts were totaled up and measured against the total payments of all files reviewed in order to determine the overall percentage of leakage for the reviewed files.
events leading up to bryant termination 
from the time farmers implemented the quality assurance review in to the time honore terminated bryant in,rpi was audited five times by the home office and twice by honore three of these audits took place in the twelve months preceding bryant termination 
january audit 
rpi first audit was intended to serve as a baseline reading for the department compliance with new protocols and standards implemented by the company.rpi compliance score was it had no hard leakage,but soft leakage came in at.for this audit,rpi goal was compliance and total leakage.
september audit 
farmers once again audited rpi after it had been given a few months to get oriented to the new quality control standards.rpi scored compliance and in overall leakage.as before,rpi goal was compliance and total leakage.one month after this audit,farmers hired jack honore to supervise bryant.in her declaration before the district court,bryant claims that honore was immediately hostile to her,and that he suggested bryant move to another position or quit her job.
at about the same time,a director from the farmers home office ordered bryant to hire steve nagle to run the liability department of rpi.according to other employees in rpi,however,the understanding was that nagle was brought in to replace bryant.nagle allegedly admitted to another employee that he had been picked to come to kansas city to replace bryant.in fact,nagle eventually replaced bryant as director of claims for rpi after bryant termination.
honore gave bryant a negative performance evaluation for,citing her failure to meet required balanced scorecard standards.
june audit 
despite bryant negative performance evaluation,rpi numbers did not increase significantly.during the june audit,rpi scored for compliance and in total leakage.both parties agree that the target for compliance under the june audit was percent.however,the record is not clear as to what the target leakage score was.thus,we can not say for certain whether rpi failed the june audit,but what is certain is that it did not meet the compliance goals for the audit.
after the audit,honore informed bryant in a formal written warning that if her department numbers did not improve,he would take corrective action including the possibility of termination.honore also told bryant that he would personally conduct an audit of rpi files over the next days.
september audit 
honore september audit was really a combination of two.rpi achieved a compliance score of and an overall leakage score of.honore also broke down the score in terms of the two component departments of rpi liability and apd.apd had a compliance score and a leakage score.liability,on the other hand,had a compliance score and a leakage score.for this audit,rpi target appears to be a compliance score,a apd leakage,and a liability leakage.
these numbers indicate that rpi apd division was performing up to standards but that its liability division,headed by steve nagle bryant eventual replacement,was causing rpi to fail the audits.in january,honore again gave bryant a negative performance evaluation,stating 
bryant has not demonstrated imagination in identifying problems or developing solutions to solve the problems.the lack of leadership and her apparent management style of complete delegation have led to morale problems particularly with other members of the management team.bryant is reactive rather than proactive.it was very apparent after the september audit that much had not been done to improve the results since the audit.again in june of most of the same problems were still there.while there has been some improvement since june,the results are still unacceptable.
honore placed bryant on probation and stated that he would return to the office in thirty days to conduct a final audit.he warned bryant that if rpi results were not up to standards,she would be terminated.
march audit 
as promised,honore conducted another audit in march.rpi scored in overall compliance and in overall leakage.as for the specific divisions,apd scored compliance and leakage.liability scored compliance and leakage.like the september audit,rpi needed an overall compliance score of or more,a liability leakage of less than,and an apd leakage of less than to pass the audit.
although the myriad facts and figures described above can be somewhat confusing,what is clear is that in the five audits prior to bryant termination,rpi failed to meet the stated expectations for either compliance or leakage each time.
two days after the completion of the final march audit,farmers terminated bryant for poor performance.
procedural history 
on march,bryant filed suit in the district court alleging federal age and gender discrimination claims under the age discrimination in employment act adea,et,and title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,et.in addition,bryant brought age and gender discrimination claims under kansas state law.after extensive discovery,farmers moved for summary judgment on all claims.
in response,bryant provided an affidavit stating that she had personally reviewed audit reports from several other farmers claims offices throughout the country.these audits,conducted in and,listed each office compliance and leakage scores.bryant compiled this data into a spreadsheet and calculated the average compliance and leakage scores.both the spreadsheet and the audit data were attached to bryant affidavit.bryant analysis revealed the following compliance scores for the offices ranged from to,with an average score of leakage scores for the offices ranged from to,with an average score of.
bryant then calculated the average audit score for rpi from june to march and came up with compliance and leakage bryant noted that rpi had a compliance score and that offices scored lower than rpi in compliance.as for leakage,bryant stated that most of her department leakage scores were attributable to the poor performance of the liability department,headed by nagle bryant eventual replacement.removing those scores,rpi would have had a leakage score,and other offices would have scored lower than rpi in leakage.
in addition to the analysis of other offices audit scores,bryant submitted several other pieces of evidence for the court consideration.for example,jeff salsbury,a former rpi employee,testified in an affidavit that nagle and honore conspired to manipulate the audit data by artificially inflating the liability department compliance and leakage figures.this was done by removing files which would pass the audit,thus leaving a skewed sample for the auditor.
in resolving the summary judgment motion,the district court applied the framework of mcdonnell douglas green,d.the court first ruled that bryant had established a prima facie case of age and gender discrimination.it then concluded that farmers had proffered a legitimate,reason for bryant termination failure to meet established performance criteria.finally,the court concluded that bryant had not established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this legitimate reason was merely a pretext for discrimination.in discussing pretext,the court excluded large portions of bryant affidavit as inadmissable under the federal rules of civil procedure and the federal rules of evidence.judgment was entered against bryant,and the instant appeal followed.
discussion 
issue whether the district court properly excluded portions of bryant affidavit when considering farmers motion for summary judgment.
in its order granting summary judgment,the district court,acting sua sponte,excluded as inadmissable the portions of bryant affidavit alleging that certain audit results were attributable to nagle performance alleging that the audit performance standards were not intended to be mandatory and containing the statistical analysis of the audit reports from other claims offices.the court concluded that these portions of bryant affidavit were not based upon her personal knowledge and constituted improper opinion testimony.
standard of review 
we review a district court ruling on the admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion.wilson merrell dow,cir.under this standard,a trial court decision will not be reversed unless the appellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.moothart bell,cir quoting mcewen city of norman,cir.
legal standards for admissibility 
at the summary judgment stage,the parties need not submit evidence in a form admissible at trial however,the content or the substance of the evidence must be admissible.hardy phosphates,cir.for instance,a witness to a car accident could not submit his testimony at trial via affidavit because that statement would be hearsay.however,at the summary judgment stage,the affidavit is proper because its eyewitness account of the admissible.
e further governs the admissibility of affidavits at the summary judgment stage 
supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.sworn or certified copies of all papers referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto or served therewith.
thus,it is clear that the content of summary judgment evidence must be generally admissible and if that evidence is presented in the form of an affidavit,the rules of civil procedure specifically require a certain type of admissibility,the evidence must be based on personal knowledge.
a summary judgment affidavit may not contain expert testimony unless the affiant has first been designated an expert witness under.a.parker cent.med,d,aff,cir.otherwise,any testimony in the form of opinions or inferences must be a rationally based on the perception of the witness,b helpful to a clear understanding of the witness testimony or the determination of the fact in issue,and c not based on scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge.
based on the foregoing,there are two potential evidentiary problems with bryant declaration it might not be based upon personal knowledge and it might be improper opinion testimony.an individual analysis of each objection to the instant facts is warranted.
lack of personal knowledge 
in holding bryant declaration inadmissible,the district court stated,p laintiff has not shown that she has personal knowledge of the matters she alleges that certain audit results should be attributed to nagle,that the standards set forth by defendant were not intended to be mandatory,or of the data upon which her statistics are based.
as to the allegations about nagle and the mandatory standards,the district court is incorrect.although bryant does not give the source for her allegations,as supervisor of the rpi department,bryant would have had personal knowledge of the fact that the audits were never intended to be used to dismiss employees and the fact that the poor audit results should be attributed to nagle performance.
similarly,the audit data should not have been excluded on the basis of lack of personal knowledge by bryant.bryant states in her declaration that she reviewed all of the records of audits performed in and,and she also states that the audits were prepared in a format familiar to her.thus,insofar as her declaration repeats the reported results of those audits as she reviewed them,it can not be said that she lacked personal knowledge of those reports.
in exploring this point,it is helpful to look at,which requires a witness testimony to be based upon personal knowledge.the advisory committee notes to that rule state this rule does not govern the situation of a witness who testifies to a hearsay statement as such,if he has personal knowledge of the making of the statement this rule,would,however,prevent him from testifying to the
