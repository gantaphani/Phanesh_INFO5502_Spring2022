opinion of the court 
the primary issue presented by this appeal,stemming from a tortured procedural mess,is whether an insurance company must turn over to its terminated agent in accrued commissions and interest,plus additional commissions that continue to be earned.the answer hinges on the interpretation of new jersey agency termination statute found at stat.ann.a west,a matter of first impression in this court specifically,the parties call upon us to resolve the question of whether the ohio casualty group of insurance companies ohio casualty terminated its agent,professional insurance management pim,essentially at will or,instead,for gross and willful misconduct or failure to pay over to ohio casualty moneys due after receipt of a written demand therefor.see stat.ann.a d,e.the bankruptcy court ruled,and the district court affirmed,that the termination was at will.the consequence of this ruling is that new jersey agency termination statute requires ohio casualty to pay pim commissions on all policies for one year following termination,and on automobile insurance policy renewals so long as pim services the accounts.see stat.ann.a d,l.under a contrary ruling,pim would have no right to these commissions.
the remaining issues on appeal arise from the ruling that the termination was at will,namely,whether ohio casualty can successfully interpose the equitable remedy of recoupment against moneys pim owed prior to its petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and whether pim is entitled to interest on the commissions.
for the reasons that follow,we vacate the order of the district court requiring ohio casualty to turn over to pim commissions due and accruing,plus interest.we remand to the bankruptcy court to apply to the facts of this case the legal determination that the initial termination can become a termination for cause between the notice of termination and the effective termination date.we also vacate the orders denying the equitable remedy of recoupment and awarding pim interest,pending the resolution of this question by the bankruptcy court on remand 
factual and procedural background 
the facts of this case are set out at length in previous opinions of this court and the district court and the letter opinions of the bankruptcy court dated july,and october.the following discussion recounts the factual history bearing on the matters in this appeal.despite our shortened recounting of the facts,they nonetheless remain complex.
pim is a new insurance broker and agent.in,pim entered into an agency agreement with ohio casualty that permitted pim to market ohio casualty personal and commercial insurance policies.this agreement permitted ohio casualty to cancel the contract on days notice and also reads in relevant part 
the company ohio casualty,in the exercise of the right reserved to it above,may,at its option,retain all commissions which are payable or which may become payable under contracts of insurance represented by such expirations,or renewals thereof,and apply same against the amount of the agent pim indebtedness to the company,or may sell,assign,transfer or otherwise dispose of such expirations to any other agent or broker.if,in either event,the company does not realize sufficient return to satisfy agent indebtedness to the company in full,the agent shall remain liable for the unpaid balance.amounts realized by the company in excess of such indebtedness,less expenses incurred by the company in handling or other disposition of such expirations,shall be paid to the agent.
this agreement may be suspended or canceled for of balances due.during suspension,commissions due and payable to the agent for automatic renewal type policies will be applied against balances due,to the extent of the indebtedness.
in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.july.
pim located customers,ascertained their insurance needs,and sold them ohio casualty policies.for personal automobile insurance policies,ohio casualty collected premiums directly from the policyholders and sent pim its sales commissions.for other types of insurance,namely commercial lines,pim collected the premiums,deducted its commissions,and then forwarded the balance to ohio casualty.
each month,a reconciliation process occurred whereby ohio casualty provided pim an account statement detailing each insurance account,the type of insurance,the gross premium,the commission rate,and details of the amounts currently due,past due and due in the future.pim would customarily receive ohio casualty monthly statement at the beginning of each month.pim would then compare its own records to the statement,and would reconcile the items contained in the currently due column.if pim disagreed with an entry,it would line off the entry and provide an explanation and documentation in support.ohio casualty would then carry forward the item into the past due column where it would remain until ohio casualty researched the item and the parties resolved the issue.pim reconciliation and payments were due by the of the month.if an item that ohio casualty determined was due was not paid after a please remit notice,an ohio casualty account technician would issue an open item letter demanding payment and,at times,threatening suspension unless payment was received by a certain deadline.the relevant point is that in the reconciliation process the parties mixed the policy types and took credits against all policies in one monthly transaction,as per the agency agreement.in addition,in the case of agent indebtedness,the agency agreement specifically called for the application of commissions due against balances due regardless of the policy type.
in order to make its product more attractive in a highly competitive market,ohio casualty formed its own premium finance company,ocasco.ocasco offered to finance large premiums,particularly those in the commercial market,at no interest for premiums over and at a nominal interest rate for premiums under.the vast majority of premiums on commercial policies sold by pim,of its premiums in and,were financed.in those cases,an agreement was prepared by the,signed by the insured,and sent to ocasco.ocasco would process the agreement and send a voucher back to pim.pim then forwarded the voucher in lieu of cash to ohio casualty when it made its monthly payments.because pim could not deduct its commissions from the vouchers directly,it was using the small percentage of cash receipts to pay its commissions.the volume of premiums pim financed through ocasco and the length of voucher processing time created accounting difficulties for pim.as a result,pim would credit vouchers prematurely and use to credit premiums in the pipeline.the latter practice was permitted by an agreement between ocasco and pim.
ohio casualty complained of pim accounting procedures as early as.pim typically had or more of its amount due in the past due column,and pim accounting practices with respect to past due balances and credits were the subject of at least nine letters from ohio casualty.after much discussion between the parties,ocasco agreed to send its vouchers directly to ohio casualty.despite this improvement and pim clarifications of its past due balances,accounting problems continued into.pim was twice threatened with suspension that year.
finally,on november,ohio casualty sent the following letter of termination to pim 
we have had a lot of conversations about continued existing problems with your agency regarding clearing accounting differences in a timely fashion resulting in a continued high over days debt and continued problems with your agency reimbursing ocasco budget promptly on accounts that have been canceled.on many,the accounting department had to reimburse ocasco and now since we have requested your agency not to use ocasco on new accounts,we are beginning to get similar problems and requests from other premium finance companies.
along with the above problems you are heading for the third consecutive unprofitable year twelve months thru october,and a six year loss ratio of.
at this time it is necessary that i advise you that we are terminating your agency agreement effective march,and that you will no longer have the authority to write new business or bind coverage effective november.we will honor all prior binding commitments,subject to our underwriting rules,made prior to that date.
in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.july.this initial termination letter was followed by an official form letter dated november,establishing the procedures for termination and renewals.attached to this form letter were copies of the agency termination notice and offer letters that ohio casualty intended to send to pim insureds.id.at.the forms submitted to the new jersey department of insurance noted that the reasons for pim termination were poor loss ratio,continued accounting differences,and continued payment problems with premium finance companies and canceled accounts.id.at.the termination was effective on march.thereafter,pim was to continue to receive commissions on commercial renewals for one year following termination and on automobile policy renewals so long as pim serviced the accounts,in accordance with the notice of termination and the new jersey agency termination statute 
at the time ohio casualty sent the notice of termination,it claimed that pim owed over.in november and december of,ohio casualty continued to send pim monthly statements and reconciliations and pim continued to make payments.correspondence between ohio casualty and pim confirmed ohio casualty intent to renew commercial policies through pim for one year.in january of,however,pim filed suit against ohio casualty and shortly thereafter the statements and accounting practices between them broke down completely.id.at.also in january of,pim began to take improper credits against moneys owed to ohio casualty,a fact not subject to dispute on appeal.the essence of the impropriety was that pim applied credit for commissions it earned on personal automobile policy lines against the commercial premiums it collected on behalf of ohio casualty,claiming that ohio casualty had wrongly withheld these same personal automobile policy lines commissions beginning in october of.
in a letter dated may,nearly three months after pim was effectively terminated,ohio casualty demanded that pim surrender to it the agency records,declared that pim was indebted to it for,and demanded payment.also in may,pim attempted to sell its book of business book of business to anderson jackson metts ajm.in anticipation of the sale,pim brokered certain contracts to ajm.after ohio casualty successfully obtained injunctive relief to have the proceeds of the sale,if any,placed in escrow,the sale fell through.
on august,pim filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code,et pim indebtedness to ohio casualty as of the time of the petition was later fixed at on august,ohio casualty sent letters to pim customers informing them of the termination of the agency relationship and of their options.pursuant to a bankruptcy court order under which the status quo was maintained,ohio casualty took over pim book of business in september of,and employed ajm as the servicing agent.this order was appealed to the district court.on june,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling that ohio casualty owned the book of business,but reversed and remanded as to whether it could be sold or transferred.
on march,the bankruptcy court reversed itself and held that ohio casualty had an unperfected security interest in pim book of business,and directed the book of business to be returned to pim effective april.on april,the bankruptcy court ordered ohio casualty to rescind notices of to of auto policy holders under new jersey for requirement tolled the month statutory period giving pim a right to renewals on commercial policies from april,to june,subtracting several months for pim delay in seeking relief from an earlier ruling and granted pim the right to collect on commissions post april,
on july,the district court rodriguez,affirmed the april,decision as to the tolling period and to ohio casualty having an unperfected security interest in the book of business,but reversed the decision and the rescission of the cancellation letters,and found ohio casualty had no perfected security interest in commissions owed to pim.in re professional ins.management,slip op.at,july.the district court further remanded to the bankruptcy court the issue of whether pim termination was covered under subsection d or e of the agency termination statute.id.at.this court upheld the district court reversal with respect to the ruling and the holding that the bankruptcy court could not order ohio casualty to pay commissions to pim until the d or e determination was made.in re professional ins.management,cir.
in july of,the bankruptcy court held seven days of hearings on the d versus e issue.in the midst of these hearings,ohio casualty issued a notice of discontinuance informing pim that effective september,ohio casualty would stop accepting renewals and service requests from pim for automobile policies under subsection l and would not pay pim commissions.the bankruptcy court enjoined this notice of discontinuance.
throughout the hearings,the bankruptcy court limited its inquiry into the record to the period prior to november,notice of termination date.the bankruptcy court found that,as of the prior to the termination notice,only of the listed as due to ohio casualty prior to reconciliation was actually in the past due column,and of that amount only was marked due and payable such a small amount of arrears,the bankruptcy court ruled,did not substantiate ohio casualty claim that pim was terminated for gross and willful misconduct or for failure to pay over premiums due under subsection e of the agency termination statute.in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.july.the bankruptcy court concluded that pim termination therefore fell under subsection d of the agency termination statute,essentially the at will provision.this meant that pim was entitled to renewal commissions for one year on all policies,subject to the tolling period instituted by the bankruptcy court,and for renewal commissions on automobile policies under subsection l of the statute for as long as pim serviced those accounts.
in a supplemental decision on september,the bankruptcy court rejected ohio casualty claims of recoupment and constructive trust,and on october,the bankruptcy court ordered that all commissions after april,be turned over to pim.ohio casualty appealed and requested a stay.after ohio casualty failed to turn over the commissions,the bankruptcy court found ohio casualty in contempt in a letter opinion dated november.the bankruptcy court issued its final decision in the matter before us on january,in a letter opinion wherein it ruled that ohio casualty owes pim commissions plus interest from april,forward,in the amount of.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that pim termination fell under subsection d of the agency termination statute and ruled that the bankruptcy court failure to consider evidence of pim conduct between the time of notice and the time of termination was error,though harmless in the context of the district court analysis.professional ins.management v.the ohio cas.group of ins.it affirmed the denial of recoupment and constructive trust and the award of prejudgment interest.id.at.however,the district court reversed the finding that ohio casualty was in contempt for failure to turn over commissions to pim on the ground that ohio casualty filed a timely appeal after the automatic stay.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
as a threshold matter,we must be satisfied that we have appellate jurisdiction.metro transp.north star reinsurance,cir.at oral argument,we posed the question of the statutory basis for exercising jurisdiction in this case.to resolve this question,we sought supplemental briefing from the parties.specifically,we asked whether we could exercise jurisdiction over an appeal based on the traditional jurisdiction provisions in,the bankruptcy jurisdiction provision in d,or whether we should otherwise exercise jurisdiction in light of the factors set forth in in re blatstein,cir.after reviewing the submissions of the parties,we conclude that jurisdiction is proper in this case under d and shall entertain the appeal.
in the context of an appeal from the district court reviewing a bankruptcy court decision,our own jurisdiction is prescribed by d.consequently,our review is limited to final orders and judgments of the bankruptcy courts and district courts the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered under subsections a and b of this section.d.although district courts may grant leave to appeal from interlocutory orders,no such power is granted to courts of appeals.in re white beauty view,cir.
the finality of the orders must be resolved with respect to the decisions of both the bankruptcy judge and the district court.id.at citing in re meyertech,cir.ordinarily in civil litigation only those orders that dispose of all issues as to all parties to the case are considered final.in re meyertech,at.however,considerations unique to bankruptcy appeals have led us consistently in those cases to construe finality in a more pragmatic,functional sense than with the typical appeal.in re amatex,cir.with this understanding,
w e interpret finality pragmatically in bankruptcy cases because these proceedings often are protracted and involve numerous parties with different claims.to delay resolution of discrete claims until after final approval of a reorganization plan,for example,would waste time and resources,particularly if the appeal resulted in reversal of a bankruptcy court order necessitating of the entire plan.
in re white beauty view,at.
this relaxed sense of practical finality is not without limitation.it must be balanced against our traditional antipathy toward piecemeal appeals in re meyertech,at.for example,although an order of the bankruptcy court expunging a creditor claim is final,walsh trucking,insurance of north america,cir,an order of the bankruptcy court finding the debtor attorneys subject to sanctions but not determining the amount or form of the penalty is not final,in re jeannette,cir.similarly,in in re brown,cir,we ruled that a district court order remanding to the bankruptcy court for a determination of damages was not a final order.
in this case,the district court was satisfied that jurisdiction was proper either as an appeal of a final order of the bankruptcy court under a or as an appeal of an interlocutory order granting an injunction under a professional ins.management,at.with respect to a,the district court noted that 
the bankruptcy court specifically declined to characterize the nature of the october,order,except to note that it was a final resolution of the debtors motion for turnover of commissions from april,which motion was made in adversary proceeding,and to recognize that additional issues remain to be heard in that proceeding 
id.at citing in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.the bankruptcy court also denied ohio casualty request for a stay of the october,order pending resolution of the remaining issues in the adversary proceeding because none of the issues remaining in the case relate to debtor entitlement to commissions since april.in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.
invoking the doctrine of practical finality,the district court agreed that the issues decided by the bankruptcy court were discrete and that no effect or impact of those decisions would change as a result of the bankruptcy court future ultimate decision as to whether pim is entitled to damages for wrongful termination.professional ins.management,at.therefore,the district court ruled that the bankruptcy court orders of july,and october,were final orders subject to its review.
we agree with this conclusion.we note that congress had previously provided that orders in bankruptcy cases finally disposing of discrete disputes within the larger case may be immediately appealed,and that a bankruptcy court order ending a separate adversary proceeding is appealable as a final order even though that order does not conclude the entire bankruptcy case.in re moody,cir citing in re saco local development,cir.the bankruptcy court orders finally determined whether ohio was obligated to pay pim commissions following the termination of its agency agreement and the amount of that obligation.pim disagrees,contending that the order is interlocutory and that additional,related issues remain to be heard before the bankruptcy court.it is true that the bankruptcy court is still considering the resolution of significant issues between these two parties,specifically an adversary proceeding alleging ohio casualty wrongful termination of pim under the fair act,and the allegation that ohio failed adequately to service the book of business,resulting in commissions owed to pim during this period.however,we agree with the district court that this appeal is entirely distinct and that the issues noted above are unaffected by our resolution of this appeal 
moreover,the two orders,considered together,effect a turnover of commissions,which is widely regarded as a final order for purposes of appeal.
following the lead of every circuit court that has considered the question directly or indirectly,we hold that a bankruptcy court turnover order,in a separate adversary proceeding,compelling a defendant to turn over property in his possession to the trustee in bankruptcy,is a final order and hence appealable as of right.
in re moody,at.see also in re cash currency exchange,cir in re flying airways,cir sproul levin,cir george fuller of,matta,cir landow,cir.we conclude that the effect of the bankruptcy court determination that subsection d of the agency termination statute was triggered by ohio termination of pim,in conjunction with the turnover order,completely disposed before that court of the issues under appeal.therefore the bankruptcy court orders were final,appealable orders to the district court under a 
having concluded that the bankruptcy court orders were final,we now briefly discuss the finality of the district court order of february.that order 
affirmed the bankruptcy court order with respect to subsection d of the agency termination statute 
affirmed the turnover of accrued commissions and interest and continuing commissions 
vacated the order holding ohio casualty in contempt for failure to pay over commissions 
directed the clerk of court to withdraw from the registry of court and make payment to pim counsel and 
ordered ohio casualty to calculate the additional interest and commissions due to date.
professional ins.management.just as the bankruptcy court proceeding below fully adjudicated a specific adversary proceeding between the parties,the challenged order of the district court does the same therefore,jurisdiction over this final order is proper in our court pursuant to d.
iii.new jersey agency termination statute 
having jurisdiction over this appeal,we now turn to the merits of the district court decision regarding new jersey agency termination statute.because the district court sat as an appellate court,reviewing an order of the bankruptcy court,our review of the district court determinations is plenary.in re rashid,cir.in reviewing the bankruptcy court determinations,we exercise the same standard of review as the district court.fellheimer,eichen braverman,charter technologies,cir.therefore,we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercises of discretion for abuse thereof.in re engel,cir.
after reviewing the voluminous record before us,we conclude that both the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly interpreted the provisions of the agency termination statute to be predicated on the termination of an agency relationship.we agree with the district court that an at will termination under stat.ann.a d could morph into a for cause termination under stat.ann.a e prior to the effective date of termination and that the bankruptcy court erred when it set the notice date as the relevant point of inquiry into whether the statute at will or for cause provisions apply.however,we do not subscribe to the district court conclusion that the bankruptcy court error was nonetheless harmless.because neither the district court nor the bankruptcy court considered the relevant conduct pim failure to pay over premiums due between the date of notice and the effective date of termination and whether ohio casualty recognized this conduct as a reason for termination irrespective of whether it was aware of subsection e,the error was prejudicial and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy court.
interpretation of the statute 
that new jersey considers the insurance industry to be strongly affected by the public interest is demonstrated through its comprehensive regulation of the industry.in enacting the no fault law,for example,it was the new jersey legislature intent to provide insureds the advantage of guaranteed renewals of indefinite duration with a particular company.sheeran nationwide mutual insurance.with respect to new jersey agency termination law,the legislature was primarily concerned with the rights of insurance agents the protection which it affords to the insured public,although important,is only secondary.id.at.the legislature enacted the statute to regulate the termination of agency agreements between insurance companies and their independent agents.cohen home ins.the legislative history and case law also reflect a concern that new jersey policyholders should not be deprived of the benefit of continued effective policy service by motivated agents.in re terminated aetna agents,certif.denied.this case illustrates a point of conflict over the protection of the interests of agents and the public at the expense of the insurance carrier.
pim entitlement to renewal commissions,following the termination of its agency relationship with ohio,is governed by new jersey agency termination statute.as already noted,if ohio terminated pim because of gross and willful misconduct or failure to pay premiums due after written notice,new jersey law would preclude pim from receiving commissions or renewals.on the other hand,if ohio terminated pim at will,new jersey law provides pim with the right to renewal commissions on the commercial policies for one year,and automatic renewal commissions on personal automobile policies indefinitely.
both the district court and the bankruptcy court interpreted the exception to a d created in e to apply specifically to terminations,as opposed to situations where an agent fails to remit premiums at some point after the termination of the agency relationship.what ohio casualty initially disputes is the courts construction of subsection e to include the phrase or failure to pay over to the company moneys due to the company after his receipt of a written demand therefor,as a termination condition rather than an independent reason disqualifying the agent from receipt of commissions.
to aid in this interpretation,we turn first to general rules of statutory construction established by the united states supreme court.as a general rule,the meaning of a statute must be sought in the language in which the act is framed,and if that is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.caminetti united states.see,vreeland byrne.in applying this rule,courts have generally agreed that where a legislature has made a choice of language which fairly brings a given situation within a statute,it is unimportant that the particular application may not have been contemplated by the legislators.sears,roebuck united states,cust.pat app see,barr united states.vreeland,at finding no room for judicial interpretation.the new jersey supreme court upheld these principles of statutory construction in the insurance regulation context when it rejected a defendant argument to rewrite the clear wording of new jersey no fault act to exempt that defendant from its proscriptions.sheeran,at.
the district court applied these general rules of statutory construction and agreed with the bankruptcy court interpretation of the statute,noting that t he plain and unambiguous language of subsection e clearly establishes that subsection e applies if the termination is a result of gross and willful misconduct or failure to pay over funds the causal relationship is a necessary predicate to subsection e applicability.professional ins.management,at italics in original.upon review of the text,this reading is correct.
ohio casualty asserts that strict application of subsection e produces the inequitable result of preserving indeed requiring pim right to receive commissions even where it failed to remit premiums after the date of termination.the district court,sympathetic to the inequities posed by ohio casualty situation,agreed that the ruling in department of insurance universal brokerage,supports the policy that a terminated agent can not profit from failure to remit premiums after demand therefor even when it occurs after the termination date.professional ins.management,at.nonetheless,the court explained that while t his policy statement may well have an effect on the bankruptcy court equitable determinations,universal brokerage did not interpret subsection e nor could it alter the effect of the statute plain language.id.at.the district court firmly declared that this court is not free to rewrite the statute to preclude that result where the unambiguous language of subsection e does not.id.at.the purpose and policy behind this preserve the rights of terminated agents and to maintain the benefit of continued service by motivated this interpretation.we therefore conclude that the bankruptcy court and the district court correctly read subsection e necessarily to apply to the termination of agents as opposed to an agent conduct independent of termination.
application of the statute 
on appeal,ohio casualty claims that pim improper credits and failure to turn over commercial premiums from january,forward was a continuation of the improper accounting practices and indebtedness for which ohio casualty initially terminated pim.pim conduct,therefore,arguably constitutes gross and willful misconduct and the failure to pay over premiums due,thus qualifying as a termination under subsection e of the agency termination statute.moreover,ohio casualty advises us that the agency termination statute does not direct how a carrier is to terminate an agent the agency contract does.according to ohio casualty,the sole purpose of the statute is to guide the renewals of policies of agents after termination.ohio casualty br.at.
whether ohio casualty allegations legitimately constituted a reason for termination under subsection e was the inquiry that the bankruptcy court undertook.in reaching its holding that pim termination was effectively at will,under subsection d,the bankruptcy court limited its review of the record to the period prior to the date of the notice of termination.in re professional ins.management,letter op.at.july.it can not be disputed that the agency relationship between the debtor and ohio was terminated by letter dated november.any indebtedness that arose following the termination will not be considered as a basis for the activation of subsection e.it did so because pim was effectively prevented from writing new business pursuant to the terms of the notice of termination,and because by that time ohio casualty reasons for termination were already fully formed.professional ins.management,at.
the district court ruled that this limited review was erroneous although noting that the bankruptcy court decision to ignore evidence from after november,was based on an incorrect assumption that an agent could not be terminated under both subsection d and subsection e,the district court nevertheless found this error harmless.professional ins.management,at.in its harmless error analysis,the district court relied on evidence in the record that ohio casualty gave pim notice,paid pim commissions in apparent accordance with subsection d,and never gave a subsequent notice to pim or anyone that it was terminated for failure to remit premiums.the district court concluded that there was simply no evidence that ohio casualty affirmatively changed the character of the termination between november,and march.id.at.
we agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court failure to extend its inquiry to pim conduct,is error.however,we can not support the district court conclusion that the bankruptcy court error in this matter was harmless under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure see in re barclay industries,cir overturning district court harmless error ruling in the context of a bankruptcy court failure to consider factors relevant to the legal determination at issue.the bankruptcy court limited precludes the application of the correct legal determination made by the district court,namely that the reasons for terminating an agent can change between the time of notice and the effective date of termination.consequently,the relevant factual inquiry was not made whether pim conduct legitimately qualifies as a reason for termination under subsection e and whether ohio casualty recognized this conduct not necessarily subsection e itself,sometime prior to march,as one of the reasons for terminating pim.such an omission appears to us as inequitable.
contrary to the ruling of the district court,we conclude that the fact that ohio casualty gave pim notice and continued its commissions for a period of one year does not automatically place the termination under subsection d.first,ohio casualty was obligated to do so according to its agency contract with pim.ohio casualty continued to renew and pay commissions in accordance with the contract and subsection d because,at the time,pim had not yet taken the improper credits.in addition,ohio casualty employees admitted at trial that they were not aware of subsection e when the initial termination notice was sent.professional ins.management,at.the question,however,is not whether ohio casualty complied with the agency termination statute when it terminated pim,but whether the reason ohio casualty terminated pim was one of the reasons listed in subsection e.ohio casualty knowledge of subsection e is irrelevant to answer this question.
furthermore,that ohio casualty did not send a subsequent notice of termination to pim citing the improper credits taken after january,does not disqualify ohio casualty from the protection that subsection e affords.in fact,subsection e does not contain a notice requirement.the only requirement triggering subsection e is that the agent be terminated for one of the reasons listed.we can not reconcile the district court recognition of this fact with its subsequent conclusion that because ohio casualty never notified anyone that pim was being terminated for one of the reasons listed in subsection e,it therefore by default terminated pim at will.after ohio casualty sent pim its initial termination notice alleging improper accounting procedures resulting in substantial indebtedness which,if proved,would satisfy subsection e,ohio casualty was not thereafter required to pim that its increased indebtedness stemming from additional improprieties was yet another reason for the termination.the district court expressed concern when it declared that an insurance company can not just decide that an agent termination is now under subsection e without telling anybody there must be some evidence that the insurance company told the insureds renewals would no longer come through the terminated agent,professional ins.management,at is not implicated by the facts of this case.ohio casualty continued correspondence with pim declaring that premiums were due and payable and documenting the improper credits effectively put pim on notice of the reasons for its termination and satisfied any implied notice requirement 
because a termination under subsection d of the statute can be converted into a subsection e termination based on conduct of the agent between the time of notice of termination and the effective date of the termination,and this can occur without formal notice by ohio casualty to pim that a termination under e has occurred,the bankruptcy court needs to apply this legal determination to the evidence of pim improper credits and failure to remit premiums after november,in ascertaining if that conduct is sufficient under subsection e to effect pim termination as ohio casualty agent and whether ohio casualty recognized this conduct,sometime prior to march,as one of the reasons for terminating pim 
iv.conclusion 
accordingly,we vacate the order of the district court and remand to that court so that in turn the case may be remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
because we recognized that this issue was one of first impression in new jersey,a majority of the panel granted a motion to certify the issue under new jersey court rule a to the new jersey supreme court.the motion had been granted just prior to oral argument initially scheduled for december.as a consequence,we filed a petition for certification with the new jersey supreme court on january.on february,the new jersey supreme court denied our petition,thereby making necessary this opinion.
the claims of constructive trust and contempt of court addressed by the district court were not raised on appeal.therefore,we render no opinion on those issues and the orders with respect to each remain unchanged.

the new jersey agency termination statute,codified at stat.ann.a,governs the rights of a terminated agent.the relevant subsections d,e and l provide.termination of any such contract for any reason other than one excluded herein shall become effective after not less than days notice in writing given by the company to the agent and the commissioner of banking and insurance.no new business or changes in liability on renewal or in force business,except as provided in subsection of this section,shall be written by the agent for the company after notice of termination without prior written approval of the company.however,during the term of the agency contract,including the said period,the company shall not refuse to renew such business from the agent as would be in accordance with said company current underwriting standards.the company shall,during a period of months from the effective date of such termination,provided the former agent has not been replaced as the broker of record by the insured,and upon request in writing of the terminated agent,renew all contracts of insurance for such agent for said company as may be in accordance with said company then current underwriting standards and pay to the terminated agent a commission in accordance with the agency contract in effect at the time notice of termination was issued.said commission can be paid only to the holder of a valid new jersey insurance producer license.in the event any risk shall not meet the then current underwriting standards of said company,that company may decline its renewal,provided that the company shall give the terminated agent and the insured not less than days notice of its intention not to renew said contract of.the agency termination provisions of this act shall not apply to those contracts in which the agent is paid on a salary basis without commission or where he agrees to represent exclusively one company or to the termination of an agent contract for insolvency,abandonment,gross and willful misconduct,or failure to pay over to the company moneys due to the company after his receipt of a written demand therefor,or after revocation of the agent license by the commissioner of banking and insurance and in any such case the company shall,upon request of the insured,provided he meets the then current underwriting standards of the company,renew any contract of insurance formerly processed by the terminated agent,through an active agent,or directly pursuant to such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by the commissioner of banking and insurance l.a company which terminates its contractual relationship with an agent subject to the provisions of subsection of this section shall,at the time of the agent termination,with respect to insurance covering an automobile as defined in
