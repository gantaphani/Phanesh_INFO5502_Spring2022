state compensation insurance fund state fund obtained summary judgment in an action filed by plaintiff power fabricating,power,which sought declaratory relief and damages arising from state fund failure to defend it in a separate action against power brought by the widow of a worker who died in an industrial accident.power contends it presented a triable issue of fact on whether the decedent was employed by power,an entity related to power,or a joint venture between the two entities.power asserts that if the trier of fact determines the decedent had been employed by either power or the joint venturer,the widow claims could be covered under the employer liability insurance eli provisions under state fund policy,triggering a duty to defend.state fund,contends,however,that the situation falls within the worker compensation provisions of the policy,not the eli provisions,and its full payment of death benefits to the widow discharged any responsibility to defend.
we agree with state fund.eli coverage accrues only if a the worker was acting in the course and scope of employment with the insured and b workers compensation law either does not apply or the employer may be sued in a capacity other than as an employer.because power failed to raise a material triable issue of fact on any of the conditions required in b,eli coverage does not apply.we therefore conclude the trial court did not err in granting state fund summary judgment 
factual and procedural background 
power and a related entity,temp power systems,are in the business of providing temporary electrical power to construction sites.after receiving complaints from subcontractors about the supply of electrical power at a homebuilding project in san diego county,the homebuilder requested temp to provide a switch over at various locations to increase the amperage of the supply.a switch over involves rerouting electrical power from one source to another.in performing this task,apprentice electrician jonathon kryzak contacted an energized electrical line and was fatally electrocuted.state fund paid kryzak widow in workers compensation benefits.
separate from her workers compensation claim,kryzak widow sued the homebuilder and power in san diego county kryzak action for negligence and negligence per se,alleging,inter alia,that power negligently failed to confirm that the developer had deenergized the electrical system before kryzak began work,failed to inspect kryzak work,failed to implement safety procedures,and failed to provide a safe workplace.power tendered defense of the action to state fund and power commercial general liability insurer,liberty surplus insurance corporation liberty.liberty denied power defense request because kryzak death purportedly arose from work he was performing for power,thus falling within policy exclusions for claims covered by workers compensation.state fund denied power defense request,asserting it did not have a defense obligation because it had paid benefits to kryzak widow under its policy.
power brought the present action for damages and declaratory relief against state fund and liberty,alleging they each had a duty to defend and indemnify power for the kryzak action.the trial court sustained liberty demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend based on power allegations in this case that it had employed kryzak at the time the accident occurred,and therefore statutory workers compensation exclusivity barred any claims kryzak widow might bring against power.we reversed,noting the kryzak action presented a factual issue on whether kryzak worked for power or tpsi.power fabricating liberty surplus insurance corporation,wl,nonpub.opn.power later settled the kryzak action.
while the appeal regarding liberty demurrers was pending,the trial court granted summary judgment for state fund.power now appeals the summary judgment ruling.
discussionthe issue of which entity employed kryzak at the time of the accident does not preclude summary judgment 
the state fund policy at issue here consists of two parts.part provides workers compensation coverage to the insured as required by law.state fund compensated kryzak widow under part,and power does not contend part created a duty to defend power in the kryzak action.
part of the policy provides eli coverage.the key provisions include the following 
a.how this insurance applies this employer liability insurance applies to bodily injury by accident of an employee.the bodily injury must arise out of and in the course of the injured employee employment by you.the employment must be necessary or incidental to your work in california.
b.we will pay we will pay all sums you legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury to your employees the damages we will pay include damages.for care and loss of services p rovided that these damages are the direct consequence of bodily injury that arises out of and in the course of the insured employee employment by you and.because of bodily injury to your employee that arises out of an in the course of employment claimed against you in a capacity other than as employer.
exclusions this insurance does not cover.any obligation imposed by a workers compensation law 
d.we will defend we have the right and duty to defend,at our expense,any claim,proceeding or suit against you for damages payable by this employer liability insurance 
the state fund policy lists both power and tpsi as employer under the policy,and notes the two companies are under common ownership.power contends a triable issue of material fact exists whether kryzak was acting as an employee of power,tpsi,or a joint venture between the two entities at the time of the accident.power asserts it could have been held liable for the widow claims falling within the eli coverage,but outside of the workers compensation exclusion,if the trier of fact in the kryzak action ultimately determined either kryzak,as the employee of a joint venture,was injured by power negligent acts with the widow holding power liable for its own negligence,or kryzak,as power employee,was injured by the joint venture with the widow holding power derivatively liable for the joint venture negligence.we consider each of these two possible scenarios separately.
scenario kryzak as employee of a joint venture 
it is a basic principle of insurance contract interpretation that doubts,uncertainties and ambiguities arising out of policy language ordinarily should be resolved in favor of the insured in order to protect his reasonable expectation of coverage.citations.it is also well established,however,that this rule of construction is applicable only when the policy language is found to be unclear.citations.a policy provision is ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.citation.whether language in a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.citation.we are also guided by the principle that words in an insurance policy must be read in their ordinary sense,and any ambiguity can not be based on a strained interpretation of the policy language.producers dairy delivery sentry ins.cal d,original italics producers dairy.
we see nothing ambiguous about the eli coverage clause requiring that the bodily injury must arise out of and in the course of the injured employee employment by you.true,both tpsi and power are listed as employer in the policy.but power can not invoke coverage under the policy eli provisions if a trier of fact determined a joint venture,as an entity separate from power,employed kryzak at the time of the accident.in essence,power seeks to aggregate the tpsi and power entities to invoke eli coverage,yet separate the two companies to avoid the eli workers compensation exclusion.nothing in the policy language or purpose supports this interpretation.
indeed,the court in producers dairy,supra,cal d,rejected this identical tactic.there,a trucker was injured when unloading milk from a delivery truck.the trucker worked for las corporation las,an entity created by a dairy to distribute milk products using the dairy trucks.las and the dairy shared common officers and directors,and the officers treated the two
