in this first party insurance bad faith action,the question on review is whether summary judgment was properly granted for the insurer.eight months after plaintiff reagan wilson was injured in an automobile accident by a drunk driver,her insurer,defendant century insurance company century,rejected her demand for payment of the policy limit on her underinsured motorist coverage.although wilson treating physician had opined that the woman had degenerative disk changes as a result of occult disk injury at the levels in her neck from her high speed motor vehicle accident,and that these spinal changes were atypical for her age and almost certainly caused by the automobile accident,century rejected the claim on the asserted ground that she had suffered only soft tissue injuries in the collision and had preexisting degenerative disc disease.because,based on the undisputed facts in the summary judgment record,a jury could reasonably find century reached this medical conclusion without a good faith investigation of the claim and without a reasonable basis for genuine dispute,we agree with the court of appeal that summary judgment on plaintiff bad faith cause of action was improper.

the summary judgment record reflects the following facts 
on november,an intoxicated driver made a left turn directly in front of the vehicle wilson was driving,resulting in a collision.she was treated at an emergency room in monterey for bruises and a wrist injury she also complained of pain in her chest and upon moving her neck.several days later she told douglas jackson in santa barbara,where she was attending college,that she was still feeling pain in her neck and left shoulder,as well as in her left wrist.a limited cervical spine ordered by jackson was evaluated as normal,with m ild straightening of lordosis but no fracture,degenerative change or soft tissue swelling.jackson prescribed physical therapy for the neck pain.
on january,wilson was examined by edward southern,an orthopedist in long beach.she reported continued neck,back and arm pain.not having the prior film before him,southern ordered additional cervical spine,which he found showed reversal of the cervical lordosis with calcification of the anterior disk spaces at and with narrowing of the disk space more so at.southern ordered a magnetic resonance imaging scan mri to determine whether the obviously degenerative motion segment within her cervical spine was causing the arm pain.if the mri was markedly abnormal,southern noted,wilson might have to delay her planned departure for a period of study in australia.
southern clinical impression was as follows a young woman involved in a high speed motor vehicle accident with changes now in the cervical spine which are atypical for a patient of her age and are almost certainly due to the history of trauma.she probably has degenerative disk changes as a result of occult disk injury at the levels in the neck from her high speed motor vehicle accident.
the mri showed mild desiccated discs at,and,mild dextroscoliosis and or less posterior disc bulges at,and,while the central canal and neural foramina are patent at these levels.no significant disc pathology was found at other levels.
in february,donald hall,wilson attorney,told paul le,century claims examiner,that his client wanted to make a claim on her underinsured motorist uim coverage.in april,after wilson reached a settlement with the other driver for his liability coverage,le asked hall to send century a demand package so he could evaluate the uim claim.
hall sent le a demand letter and documentation on june.the medical reports described above were attached.hall told le that after the accident wilson had made a trip to europe,which was ruined by her injuries.at the time of the demand letter,hall wrote,she was studying in australia but was still experiencing pain on a regular basis.he quoted southern opinion that wilson had suffered degenerative disk changes as a result of the automobile accident.the general damages resulting from such an injury at wilson young age,hall asserted,exceeded the uim policy limits.he requested that century pay wilson,the uim policy benefit remaining after wilson recovery of from the other driver.
le and hall discussed the claim by telephone on july.according to le notes of the conversation,he asked hall if there was any additional medical documentation for the claim.hall said there was not,but that southern report indicated disk changes that would affect wilson later in life.le then asked,w hy is she in australia if her inj ury is so severe and observed that wilson is young and may not experience any pain in future from deg enerative disk.le also noted his own opinion that the mri does not show bulge touching the nerves.
by a memorandum dated july,le sought and obtained the approval of his superior,jay boomer,to reject wilson uim claim.in the memo,le wrote that wilson has a condition pertaining to scolosis sic,mri shows no encroachment of a neural structure,it is unlikely that the bulge was produced by this accident.presently,the insured is on vacation in australia and is not expected to return until november,this discounts her attorney allegation that the pain suffering and injuries are severe.le recommended offering wilson the limit of her medical payments coverage with the received from the negligent other driver,le asserted,this would fully compensate her.boomer approved this course,noting his view that wilson injuries were really just st soft tissue.
before making the recommendation to reject wilson uim claim,le did not attempt to contact southern and did not speak with any other medical practitioner about the claim.
century rejected wilson uim claim by a letter from le to hall dated july.after noting that the were normal and paraphrasing the conclusions of the january mri report,le stated based on the above,we believe your client sustain sic soft tissue injury superimposed by a preexisting degenerative disc disease.therefore,we believe that your client has been fully compensated for her injuries by the payment of the policy limits from north pointe insurance plus our medical payment limits of.
soon after receiving century rejection,wilson initiated arbitration of the claim.in late and,wilson saw southern and other physicians for her continuing neck pain.after a diskogram was performed in june,one orthopedic surgeon recommended spinal fusion surgery.wilson did not go through with the surgery at that time.in august,she saw a neurosurgeon who recommended pain management instead of surgery wilson pursued that course,which to some extent alleviated the pain,through the remainder of.
in,after learning of the surgery recommendation through deposing wilson in preparation for arbitration,century retained independent physicians to examine wilson and review her medical records.stephen nagelberg,the retained orthopedic surgeon,saw evidence on the diskogram of bilateral leakage of,and a annular tear with leakage of.in june,nagelberg reported to century that wilson neck pain was caused by these disk injuries,which resulted from the november automobile accident.he recommended surgery.allan chan,the claims examiner now handling the case,promptly prepared a revised evaluation of wilson claim and requested and received authorization to pay wilson the remainder of her uim policy limit.century paid wilson the on july.
wilson sued century,alleging in her second cause of action that century denial of benefits in july and the resulting delay until the uim claim was paid in july breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and caused her damages in the form of lost interest on the policy benefits,attorney fees and costs incurred to recover payment,and general damages including emotional distress.century moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication of this cause of action on the ground that its decision to refuse the uim demand was,in light of the facts known to the company at the time,reasonable as a matter of law.the superior court granted the motion,finding no triable issue of fact as to whether century had acted in bad faith.
the court of appeal reversed,holding triable issues of fact existed as to whether century had thoroughly investigated and objectively evaluated wilson uim claim before denying it.we granted century petition for review.
discussion 
a trial court properly grants a motion for summary judgment only if no issues of triable fact appear and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c see also,subd.f summary adjudication of issues.the moving party bears the burden of showing the court that the plaintiff has not established,and can not reasonably expect to establish,the elements of his or her cause of action.miller department of corrections cal th,d.
the law implies in every contract,including insurance policies,a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.the implied promise requires each contracting party to refrain from doing anything to injure the right of the other to receive the agreement benefits.to fulfill its implied obligation,an insurer must give at least as much consideration to the interests of the insured as it gives to its own interests.when the insurer unreasonably and in bad faith withholds payment of the claim of its insured,it is subject to liability in tort.frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange cal d.
lack of thorough investigation and fair evaluation 
while an insurance company has no obligation under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to pay every claim its insured makes,the insurer can not deny the claim without fully investigating the grounds for its denial.frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange,supra,cal d at.to protect its insured contractual interest in security and peace of mind,it is essential that an insurer fully inquire into possible bases that might support the insured claim before denying it.egan mutual of omaha ins.cal d.by the same token,denial of a claim on a basis unfounded in the facts known to the insurer,or contradicted by those facts,may be deemed unreasonable.a trier of fact may find that an insurer acted unreasonably if the insurer ignores evidence available to it which supports the claim.the insurer may not just focus on those facts which justify denial of the claim.mariscal old republic life ins.th,d see also shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,d.
applying these principles to the facts in the summary judgment record,we agree with the court of appeal that plaintiff has demonstrated a triable issue of fact as to whether century decision to deny her uim claim in july was made unreasonably and in bad faith wilson complained of neck pain after the accident and in subsequent weeks and months.on examination of the patient and her,southern,an orthopedist,concluded a segment of her cervical spine was obviously degenerative,that such a change was unusual at her age,and was probably due to her recent automobile accident.the mri he ordered confirmed bulging disks in the vertebrae of her neck.wilson was continuing to feel neck pain in june when,through her attorney,she made the uim claim.
despite his receipt of this information,century claims examiner asserted in his internal denial memo that it was unlikely the disk bulges were caused by the accident and that because wilson was on vacation in australia her claims of severe pain should be discount ed.having received approval to deny the claim,he then did so on the ground that wilson pain was due only to soft tissue injury superimposed by a preexisting degenerative disc disease.
unfortunately for century summary judgment position,a jury could reasonably find that nothing in the material the claims examiner had received justified these conclusions.century directs us to no medical report or opinion on the basis of which the claims examiner could reasonably have ignored or disbelieved southern conclusion that the changes in wilson cervical spine were probably caused by her recent trauma as far as the record reveals,the claims examiner had no basis for his contrary conclusion that such a causative link was unlikely.nor is there any apparent medical basis for the claims examiner assertion that wilson had preexisting degenerative disc disease.no such diagnosis appears in the medical reports submitted to century,and we are directed to no evidence that the company claims examiner had sufficient medical expertise to make such a diagnosis himself as to the fact that wilson was studying in australia not on vacation,as the claims examiner baselessly asserted in,the court of appeal aptly observed that it is as possible to suffer severe pain in australia as in southern california.
century,of course,was not obliged to accept southern opinion without scrutiny or investigation.to the extent it had good faith doubts,the insurer would have been within its rights to investigate the basis for wilson claim by asking southern to reexamine or further explain his findings,having a physician review all the submitted medical records and offer an opinion,or,if necessary,having its insured examined by other physicians as it later did.what it could not do,consistent with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,was ignore southern conclusions without any attempt at adequate investigation,and reach contrary conclusions lacking any discernable medical foundation.egan mutual of omaha ins,supra,cal d at,mariscal old republic life ins,supra,th at,d.a jury could reasonably find century did so here 
on the subject of further investigation,century criticizes the court of appeal statement that when proper adjustment of a claim turns on a medical evaluation of the insured condition an insurer breaches its duty to thoroughly investigate the claim if it fails to have the insured examined by a doctor of its choice or at least to consult with the insured treating physician.the appellate court,century argues,incorrectly held that the failure to order an examination is bad faith in all cases,while regulations of the insurance commissioner indicate an insurer should ask for an independent examination only when it believes it reasonably necessary.see,tit,subd.n.we agree that,the critical issue being the reasonableness of the insurer conduct under the facts of the particular case,stating a general rule as to how much or what type of investigation is needed to meet the insurer obligations under the implied covenant is difficult.an insurer good or bad faith must be evaluated in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding its actions.nager allstate ins.th,d walbrook ins.liberty mutual ins.th,d.in some cases,review of the insured submitted medical records might reveal an indisputably reasonable basis to deny the claim without further investigation.but as the court of appeal explained in passages following the statement century criticizes,and as we demonstrate above,under the facts of this case a triable issue of fact exists as to whether it was reasonable to deny wilson claim on the grounds stated without further medical investigation.
ii.the genuine dispute rule 
as discussed earlier,an insurer denial of or delay in paying benefits gives rise to tort damages only if the insured shows the denial or delay was unreasonable.frommoethelydo fire ins.exchange,supra,cal d at.as a close corollary of that principle,it has been said that an insurer denying or delaying the payment of policy benefits due to the existence of a genuine dispute with its insured as to the existence of coverage liability or the amount of the insured coverage claim is not liable in bad faith even though it might be liable for breach of contract.chateau chamberay homeowners asso
