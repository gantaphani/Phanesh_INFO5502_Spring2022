this case involves a dispute between insurance companies over whose policy covers payless cashways,payless liability related to the tragic death of brent hincher,who was killed during a work accident on payless premises.the district court granted summary judgment to commercial union midwest insurance company cu and american employers insurance company ae,finding that payless was not insured under ae policy and that cu policy provided only excess insurance after united states fidelity and guarantee insurance company usf g primary coverage was exhausted.the plaintiffs appeal the district court judgment granting summary judgment to cu,and we reverse and remand for further proceedings 
payless contracted with kamco to install lighting displays and to perform work at payless stores,including one in newport,minnesota.the late hincher worked for kamco and was performing work in payless newport store when a display fell,killing him.catherine rootness,hincher widow and trustee for the heirs and next of kin of hincher,commenced a wrongful death action on behalf of hincher estate against payless in.payless filed a claim against kamco,asserting that kamco was liable under the contract to defend and indemnify payless for any liability related to the accident.kamco had a commercial general liability cgl policy with ae and an umbrella policy with cu.payless carried its own excess liability policy with usf 
payless and kamco disagreed about whether their contract included an indemnity agreement,the terms of which were contained in an unsigned supplementary terms and conditions agreement supplementary agreement.in addition to the indemnity provisions,the supplementary agreement required kamco to provide and maintain million worth of cgl insurance and to name payless as an additional insured.in june,payless and kamco entered into a stipulation,in which they agreed to allow the district court to determine whether their agreement included the supplementary agreement.the court ultimately found that the supplementary agreement was part of the contract between payless and kamco.payless agreed in the stipulation to waive its claim against kamco for payless defense costs in the underlying wrongful death suit.the parties also agreed that kamco was obligated to indemnify payless under the indemnity agreement only for fault attributable to kamco kamco was not obligated to indemnify payless for payless own negligence.
after the court determined that the supplementary agreement was part of the contract,payless insurer,usf g,tendered payless defense of the wrongful death lawsuit to kamco insurers,cu and ae,pursuant to payless status as an additional insured under kamco cgl policies.both insurers refused the tender.rootness settled the claim with kamco,whereby ae paid to rootness on kamco behalf under the cgl policy that ae had issued to kamco.
the case proceeded to trial where a jury awarded total damages of million,apportioning fault as follows to kamco,to payless,and to the decedent,hincher.rootness received a judgment against payless for based on payless share of the fault.during rootness appeal of the jury verdict to this court,rootness settled the claims with payless and its insurer,usf g,for,which was paid as in cash from usf g and in payless stock.cu and ae refused to participate in the settlement negotiations on payless behalf or contribute toward the settlement.
following the settlement,rootness,payless,and usf g commenced this action to recover the amounts paid by or on behalf of payless,as well as the defense costs,from cu and ae the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment to ae and cu.the district court found that payless was not insured under ae policy because,even though kamco was contractually obligated to add payless as an additional insured under its cgl policies,kamco had failed to notify ae and pay the required premium for adding additional insureds to ae policy.
cu policy definition of additional insureds was broader than ae policy,extending insured status to any person or organization with whom or with which kamco ha d agreed in writing prior to any loss,occurrence or offense to provide insurance such as is afforded by this policy,but only with respect to kamco operations or facilities kamco own ed or use d.appellants app.at,section ii.the policy defined an insured as any person or organization qualifying as such under section is an insured.id.at.for purposes of summary judgment,cu agreed that payless was an additional insured under this provision of cu policy.the district court determined that cu and usf g both provided excess insurance,that their other insurance provisions conflicted,and that usf g policy should provide primary coverage as it was closer to the risk.in the district court view,because usf g policy limits exceeded the it had paid to the estate,cu secondary excess coverage was never triggered.the district court also concluded that payless was to the extent of the sir in the usf g policy and that the was other insurance that was primary to cu excess coverage,such that cu was not liable for the first of liability not covered by the usf g policy.finally,the district court found that cu was not obligated to pay the defense fees for either the underlying wrongful death lawsuit or the current lawsuit.the plaintiffs appeal the district court ruling to the extent that it dismissed their claims against cu.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact to be decided,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.dowdle life ins,cir.c.the parties agree that minnesota law applies to this diversity action.the interpretation of insurance policies is a legal issue for the court to determine.dowdle,at.
the parties agree that payless is insured under cu policy as an additional insured.the cu and the usf g policies both provide coverage for payless own liability resulting from hincher accident.when two policies provide coverage for the same incident,the question of which policy provides primary coverage is a legal determination that we make by looking to the language of the policies at issue.see christensen milbank ins.minnesota courts determine the order of coverage by looking to the priority rules contained in each policy,generally found in the policies other insurance provisions.see star mut.ins.midwest family mut.ins.if the other insurance clauses contained in the applicable policies conflict,then the court looks beyond the language of the policies and assigns primary coverage to the policy that more closely contemplated the risk.christensen,at.where the policies equally contemplate the risk,minnesota courts pro rate the loss among the applicable policies.see cargill,commercial union ins,cir applying minnesota law and apportioning liability based on the proportion that each insurer policy limit bears to the total available insurance limits.
the district court first determined that the other insurance clauses conflicted,and then went on to determine that usf g policy was closer to the risk of loss stemming from hincher death.the cu policy contained an other insurance clause which provided in part if there is other insurance,other than as provided above,which applies to the loss,we pay only for the excess of the amount due from such other insurance,whether collectible or not.appellants app.at.usf g policy likewise contained an other insurance clause that provided this insurance is excess over other insurance whether primary,excess,contingent or on any other basis,except other such insurance purchased specifically to apply in excess of this insurance.id.at.other insurance provisions contained in two different policies conflict if the apportionment among the companies can not be made without violating the other insurance clause of at least one company.christensen,at quoting integrity mut.ins.state auto.cas.underwriters ins.the clauses at issue here conflict as both policies purport to provide excess coverage where another policy applies to the loss,and application of each policy other insurance provision would preclude coverage by either.see star mut.ins,at because each policy other insurance clause provided for coverage only after all other applicable insurance coverage was exhausted,the clauses conflict.we,like the district court,proceed to determine which policy more closely contemplated the risk.
minnesota courts apply two different tests in apportioning liability between insurers when the other insurance clauses conflict the total policy insuring intent analysis or the closer to the risk analysis.the total policy insuring intent analysis is a broader test and examines the primary policy risks upon which each policy premiums were based and the primary function of each policy.cpt paul fire marine ins.in assessing which policy is closer to a given risk,minnesota courts consider three specific questions 
which policy specifically described the instrumentality which premium is reflective of the greater contemplated exposure does one policy contemplate the risk and use of the instrumentality with greater specificity than the other is,is coverage of the risk primary in one policy and incidental to the other 
ed kraemer sons,transit cas,internal marks omitted.the tests are similar,though application of the total policy insuring intent analysis is less mechanical than the closer to the risk analysis.
the district court found that usf g policy was closer to the risk primarily because payless paid a premium to usf g specifically to cover payless negligence,whereas cu received no additional premium to cover payless negligence.the district court also made much of the fact that the liability at issue was solely that of payless as determined by the jury apportionment of of the fault to payless,and the parties agreed that kamco was obligated to indemnify payless under the supplementary agreement only for any fault attributed to kamco.we respectfully believe the district court erroneously relied on these facts in applying the closer to the risk analysis.
although kamco liability under the indemnity agreement was limited to the fault attributable to kamco,cu insurance policy does not so limit cu policy coverage of payless.the cu policy covers any organization with which kamco ha s agreed in writing to provide insurance such as is afforded by this cu policy,but only with respect to kamco operations.appellants app.at.minnesota courts have held in similar circumstances that as long as there is a causation between the loss and the named insured operations,the additional insured coverage provides coverage for the additional insured own liability,irrespective of any limitations of liability between the named insured and the additional insured.see andrew youngquist,cincinnati ins.the loss at issue here clearly has a connection to kamco operations hincher,a kamco employee,would not have been killed on payless premises if kamco had not been performing its obligations under the contract.having satisfied the contingencies of the policy,cu policy provides coverage for payless liability arising from its own fault regardless of kamco indemnity agreement.the district court erred in relying on the allocation of fault by the jury because t he closeness to the risk test is separate from any dispute among defendants as to whose actions negligently contributed to the accident.see ed kraemer sons,at reversing district court allocation of the risk and noting that it was disturbed by this focus on kraemer potential negligence.
considering the closer to the risk analysis,we find the test to be of little guidance.neither policy specifically describes the instrumentality,in this case,the display being installed at payless store.usf g policy is an excess general liability policy and provides that it will pay ultimate net loss because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory.appellants app.at.ultimate net loss is defined as those sums that the insured payless becomes legally obligated to pay as damages.id.at.as it is titled,the usf g policy provides excess general liability coverage to payless for its building supplies business.id.at.the loss at issue occurred in the course of payless business of building supplies to the extent that payless was changing the display of those building supplies.
cu policy is equally general.cu agreed to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies.id.at.thus,the cu policy covers those sums that payless becomes legally obligated to pay because of bodily injury.the insurance applies to payless as an additional insured,but only with respect to kamco operations id.at,which include hanging display services id.at.the loss at issue here was incurred with respect to kamco operations of hanging displays.thus,the risk was also contemplated by cu policy,but not with any specificity.
although kamco paid a premium for cu coverage,the policy clearly contemplated that cu would be providing coverage to other entities with which kamco contracted to provide coverage as additional insureds without requiring an additional premium to cover the additional insured.the supreme court of minnesota has noted the practice in the construction industry by which the parties to a subcontract agree that one party would protect others involved in the performance of the construction project.holmes,explaining the minnesota legislature actions in prohibiting indemnity agreements in construction contracts that indemnify a party from its own negligence,but allowing one party to provide insurance that covers the other party negligence.that cu did not charge an additional premium to add additional insureds under its policy does not change the clear import of its policy that provides coverage to additional insureds.presumably,cu considered the risk posed by including additional insureds within its policy coverage when it set its rate and issued the policy at the premium.presley homes,am.states ins,th,d,if,as defendant asserts,it simply provided the additional insured endorsements without increasing the amount of the subcontractors premiums,that still would not affect a covered party reliance on the policies language and the nature of the activity covered by them.
although payless paid a much larger premium for its policy with usf g than kamco paid for its policy with cu,those are the total premiums paid for two policies that covered widely divergent risks.neither policy required or stated a premium specifically for the loss at issue here.kamco premium was a premium,and its coverage explicitly contemplated additional insureds similar to payless for risks stemming from kamco operations.payless premium was based on a percentage of payless receipts over a period,which were estimated at billion dollars,and appeared to cover all of payless stores throughout the country.thus,the premium sizes do not reflect that usf g contemplated the specific risk of hincher death,an employee of a subcontractor installing displays at one of payless stores,any more than cu policy contemplated that risk,which involved an employee of cu named insured injured in the course of the named insured business.the third factor of the closer to the risk test adds little to our analysis,as neither policy specifically contemplated the risk or the instrumentality at issue here,so neither one can be said to have provided primary rather than incidental coverage for the loss.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa republic underwriters ins,concluding that a liability policy issued to a daycare provider for her business provided primary coverage for an injury to a child in the daycare over the daycare provider homeowner policy because the liability policy specifically described the type of risk involved.
we turn then to application of the total policy insuring intent analysis,which focuses on the primary risks and functions of each policy.our review of each policy under this analysis convinces us that the loss here should be shared pro rata.both policies provide general liability coverage rather than coverage for a specific risk or instrumentality.redeem
