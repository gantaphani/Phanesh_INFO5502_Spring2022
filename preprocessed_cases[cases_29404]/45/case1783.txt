the liability risk retention act the lrra broadly preempts any state law,rule,regulation,or order to the extent that such law,rule,regulation,or order would make unlawful,or regulate,directly or indirectly,the operation of a risk retention group.a.this provision preempts the order of the nevada commissioner of insurance the commissioner,which prohibited alliance of nonprofits for insurance,risk retention group ani from writing first dollar liability policies in nevada.therefore,we affirm the district court entry of declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of ani.however,because the lrra preemption provision does not unambiguously confer a right to be free from state law that can be enforced under,we vacate the fee award.
ani is a risk retention group rrg chartered in vermont.in,ani registered with the division of insurance of nevada department of business and industry the division to transact liability insurance in nevada.by registering with the division,ani obtained a certificate of registration however,the division has not issued ani a certificate of authority 
as a registered insurer,ani provided first dollar,automobile liability coverage to its nevada members.first dollar insurance policies are motor vehicle polices that are required by state law to comply with financial responsibility minimums.for example,to register a vehicle in nevada,state law requires the owner to obtain an insurance policy that covers,at a minimum,per person,per accident per two or more persons,per accident and of property damage,per accident.a policy that meets these coverage requirements is a first dollar liability policy,because the first dollars paid out on a claim up to the coverage limits are paid out under the policy.
under nevada motor vehicle insurance and financial responsibility act nmvifra,automobile owners who have registered their cars in the state must obtain their first dollar liability policy from a provider who is authorized to transact business in nevada.id.only insurers who possess a certificate of authority from the commissioner are authorized to transact business in the state.id.ani does not have such a certificate.as a result,in april,the nevada department of motor vehicles dmv began denying vehicle registrations to vehicle owners who obtained their first dollar liability policies from ani.
in may,ani sought a hearing before the commissioner.following the hearing,the commissioner issued an order prohibiting ani from writing first dollar liability policies in nevada.the commissioner order contained the following relevant provision 
ani shall,within sixty days from the date of this order,cease and desist writing first dollar or mandated motor vehicle financial responsibility insurance coverage,required by nrs.ani may directly write excess liability coverage however,a fronting arrangement with an authorized insurer that holds a valid nevada certificate of authority shall be required to provide first dollar or mandated motor vehicle financial responsibility insurance coverage,required by nrs.
primarily,the commissioner enjoined ani from writing first dollar liability insurance,because it did not possess a certificate of authority and,therefore,was not an authorized insurer.
ani then filed this lawsuit,in the united states district court for the district of nevada,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the commissioner and the division of insurance under.the parties filed for summary judgment.ruling on the motions,the district court granted summary judgment to ani in an order without any discussion.the relevant parts of the order state 
it is further ordered that.stat,nev stat.and.stat.and related statutes and regulations of the state of nevada are preempted by the lrra pursuant to the supremacy clause of the constitution,as applied to ani insofar as they prohibit ani from issuing first dollar automobile liability insurance policies in the state of nevada.
it is further ordered that the phrase authorized insurer,as used in the.stat,shall be interpreted to include rrgs such as ani.
it is further ordered that defendants are permanently enjoined from enforcing.stat.stat.and.stat.and related statutes and regulations against members of ani,insofar as they prohibit ani from issuing first dollar automobile liability insurance policies in the state of nevada.
it is further ordered that ani is entitled to a remedy under and,therefore is entitled to an award of attorney fees under to be set pursuant to frcp.
as the prevailing party,ani then requested in fees and in costs.in its request,ani sought to recover fees and costs both for itself and for its amicus,the national risk retention association nrra.for itself,ani requested in fees and in costs.for the nrra,ani requested in fees and in costs.on november,the district court awarded ani in fees and costs,but only awarded costs to the nrra in the amount of.the commissioner then appealed.
on appeal,the commissioner challenges both the grant of summary judgment and the award of attorneys fees the commissioner argues that ani was not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief,because the lrra does not preempt nevada law.the commissioner also argues that,even if the lrra does preempt nevada law,ani was not entitled to attorneys fees.we affirm the district court entry of declaratory and injunctive relief,but vacate the fee award.
discussion 
i.the district court correctly held that the lrra preempts the commissioner order.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment to ani,finding that the lrra preempts the commissioner order,de novo.schmidt contra costa,cir.in this case,there are no disputes about the material facts.samson city of bainbridge island,cir.therefore,the only question is the legal one of whether the lrra preempts nevada law.id.
the lrra broadly preempts any state order to the extent that such order would make unlawful,or regulate,directly or indirectly,the operation of an rrg.a.here,the commissioner order makes it unlawful for ani,an rrg,to operate in nevada,to the extent ani sought to write first dollar liability insurance.thus,the order plainly fits within the scope of lrra preemption.because the order fits within the scope of lrra preemption,it is invalid unless one of the lrra exceptions from preemption applies.
only one exception is relevant here section d saves from preemption state laws that specify acceptable means of demonstrating financial responsibility where the state has required a demonstration of financial responsibility as a condition for obtaining a license or permit to undertake specified activities.d.nevada mvifra which gave rise to the commissioner order is an example of such a state statute.the nmvifra requires those who own or operate a vehicle in nevada to demonstrate financial responsibility in order to register and operate the vehicle.see.a id.owners and operators demonstrate financial responsibility by providing proof of insurance from an authorized insurance provider in specified minimum coverage amounts.id.
section d of the lrra preserves nevada ability to specify which types of insurance may satisfy this requirement.specifically,d permits states to include or exclude insurance coverage obtained from an rrg as a means of satisfying the state financial responsibility requirements.d.arguably,the commissioner order does not fit within this exception,because it bars ani from writing a certain type of insurance policy altogether.thus,it goes beyond merely excluding first dollar liability policies written by ani from the acceptable class of insurance policies that will satisfy nevada financial responsibility requirement.
assuming,however,that the order fits within the scope of d,it still would not qualify for the exception.section d is subject to the provisions of section a the lrra provision.section a preempts state laws that otherwise,discriminate against a risk retention group or any of its members.under our precedent,the commissioner order discriminates against ani in violation of this section.
in national warranty insurance greenfield,cir,we held that the lrra preempted the oregon service contract act the osca,and that the osca did not qualify for the d exception from preemption.similar to the nvmifra,the osca required car dealers in oregon who sold vehicle service contracts to demonstrate financial responsibility by obtaining insurance coverage for their contract obligations from an authorized insurer.id.at.through a combination of state statutes and the lrra,rrgs not domiciled in oregon could not become authorized insurers,because they could not obtain a certificate of authority.id.at.as a result,oregon effectively preclude d all rrgs from providing insurance coverage for motor vehicle service contracts.id.at emphasis added.we concluded that such laws,which exclude all rrgs from providing a certain type of insurance,do not qualify for the d exception.
we also held that the osca violated the a provision id.at.to make that determination,we held that insurers could prove that a state law discriminated in violation of a by showing that a law differentiates between insurance providers without an acceptable justification.id.at.thus,to survive a,the state must show that a law differentiating between an rrg and an authorized insurer or between all rrgs and all authorized insurers is justified by the desire to protect those who would benefit from the purchase of insurance.id.at.members of the public,who may suffer harm as a result of the policyholder conduct,benefit from the purchase of first dollar liability policies.the insurer obligation under the policy to pay claims made against its insured increases an injured individual opportunity for recovery.the lrra expressly permits states to regulate rrgs in order to protect the interests of such individuals.as a result,state laws requiring an rrg to engage in fair settlement practices,to designate an agent for the service of process,to submit to examinations necessary to insure financial soundness,and to avoid false and misleading advertisements are exempt from preemption.see also a.nevertheless,in national warranty,the state of oregon did not offer such a justification for preventing all rrgs from writing insurance that would satisfy the osca financial responsibility requirement.id.at.by differentiating between rrgs and authorized insurers without an acceptable justification,the osca violated a.
we reach the same conclusion in this case.the commissioner order bars ani from writing first dollar insurance,because ani does not possess a certificate of authority.the order itself does not provide any other acceptable justification for treating ani differently than authorized insurers the commissioner has not cited any other acceptable justification on appeal.thus,the order violates a by differentiating between ani and authorized insurers without an acceptable justification.accordingly,it can not be saved from preemption by d.
none of the commissioner objections to this analysis are persuasive.first,the commissioner urges us to overrule national warranty and to instead adopt the reasoning of the eleventh and seventh circuits.see mears transp.grp.florida,cir opthalmic mutual ins.musser,cir.under those cases,a plaintiff could only prove discrimination under a by proving intentional discrimination.mears,at opthalmic,at.however,under our circuit precedent,we must apply national warranty here.it is binding authority that no competent body has overruled.see gonzalez arizona,cir en banc.additionally,we decided national warranty after both mears and opthalmic,and considered the reasoning of those opinions before reaching our holding in national warranty.see national warranty,at w e know that,in deciding this case as we do,we disagree with the seventh and eleventh circuits.accordingly,we decline the commissioner invitation to revisit national warranty.
second,the commissioner argues that nevada statutory scheme is not discriminatory.even if that is true,the commissioner argument misses the point that the state law at issue here is the commissioner order,which prohibits ani from writing first dollar liability insurance.thus,it is not relevant to this case that as the commissioner asserts state statutes do not prevent domestic rrgs from obtaining certificates of authority and,therefore,writing first dollar liability insurance.it is also not relevant that foreign rrgs like ani could use certain workarounds to effectively write first dollar insurance in other ways,by,or entering into a fronting arrangement with a company because the commissioner order itself is discriminatory,it is preempted by the lrra.
finally,the commissioner argues that,even if nevada mvifra does discriminate against rrgs,that discrimination is justified,because it is done in the interest of protecting innocent third parties who may be harmed by a policyholder,and therefore make a claim against the insurance company.although we are not analyzing nevada mvifra itself here,we will assume that the commissioner would offer this same justification in support of his order.on that assumption,we have recognized that the state desire to protect those who would benefit from the purchase of insurance could justify differentiating between an rrg and another insurer.see national warranty,at.however,this policy concern fails to justify the commissioner differentiation between ani and authorized insurers.the commissioner does not suggest that,because it lacks a certificate of authority,ani presents a greater risk to those who would benefit from the purchase of insurance than an authorized insurer.contrary to the commissioner assertion,a certificate of authority is not necessary to provide such protection.nevada law requires rrgs who do have a certificate of authority to comply with requirements that facilitate the commissioner oversight of their operations.for example,each foreign rrg must submit to examinations by the commissioner to determine its financial condition.id.see also a e excepting such requirements from preemption under the lrra.further,as recognized in national warranty,the lrra permits states to protect the interest of those who benefit from the purchase of insurance through a variety of means,obviating the need for an rrg to obtain a certificate of authority from a state.see national warranty,at.therefore,the commissioner can still protect innocent third parties against the risks ani might present,even though it does not have a certificate of authority.accordingly,the commissioner proffered justification for treating ani differently from an authorized insurer fails.
we agree with the district court that the lrra preempts the commissioner order.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to ani on its preemption claim.
ii.ani is not entitled to attorneys fees under.
because ani brought this suit under and was the prevailing party,the district court awarded ani attorneys fees under.on appeal,the commissioner argues that ani was not entitled to attorneys fees,because preemption of state law under the lrra is not a right that can be enforced under.we agree with the commissioner,and vacate the fee award 
as a predicate to an award of attorneys fees under,one must bring an action or proceeding to enforce.b.section provides a cause of action for the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities,secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.therefore,to determine whether ani is entitled to an award of attorneys fees,we must first determine whether the lrra preemption provision confers an enforceable right to be free from state law.no federal courts of appeal have directly analyzed whether of the lrra confers such a right on rrgs 
t he supremacy clause,of its own force,does not create rights enforceable under.see golden state transit city of,d footnote omitted.accordingly,it would obviously be incorrect to assume that a federal right of action pursuant to exists every time a federal rule of law state regulatory authority.id.at.instead,we must analyze the statute that allegedly gives rise to the enforceable right to determine whether congress conferred such a right in the statute.in blessing freestone,d,the supreme court outlined the framework for conducting such an analysis.a statute only confers an enforceable right if the plaintiff demonstrates that
