after examining the briefs and appellate record,this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument.see.f.g.accordingly the case has been ordered submitted without oral argument.
this appeal poses the question of the recoverability of attorneys fees and expenses incurred by fleming companies,fleming and a number of its officers and stauth,harry winn,kevin twomey,donald eyler,randolph devening and james connection with their institution and successful prosecution of a declaratory judgment action to resolve the question of which of two sets of director and officer executive liability policies covered them fleming fee request was denied by the district court on the premise that.b section b requires the submission of a proof of loss in support of such a request and no document fitting that term in the usual sense had been tendered by fleming.fleming has appealed the district court denial of attorneys fees.
we conclude that section b applies to declaratory judgment actions such as that brought by fleming,and we also hold that fleming complied fully with its contractual obligations under the insurance policies involved so as to satisfy the statutory requirements.we further hold that under the circumstances an award of attorneys fees is mandatory under section b.we therefore reverse and remand this action to the district court,directing it to award fleming its attorneys fees and expenses associated with the declaratory judgment action.
background 
in fleming purchased two directors and officers d and o liability policies the policies one from federal insurance company federal providing basic coverage and the other from national union fire insurance company national union providing excess coverage we refer to federal and national collectively as insurers.in fleming renewed these two policies the policies.
between march and june,fleming shareholders and noteholders filed ten different class actions against fleming,all alleging its violation of the federal securities laws by having failed to disclose the existence of litigation that began in and settled in.those multiple actions were eventually consolidated into two actions the class actions,one by fleming noteholders and the other by its shareholders.fleming notified insurers of the existence of the class actions and provided them with copies of the complaints.
as we discuss at greater length later,such submission of the complaints was all the notice that the policies required of fleming for it to become entitled to policy coverage and to bring an appropriate action against insurers if need be.indeed,by contrast with other types of coverage provided by the multiperil policy,the relevant provision for d and o coverage did not require fleming to submit a proof of loss.
in october fleming filed a declaratory judgment action against insurers,seeking a determination that they had a duty to indemnify fleming in the class actions under the policies.although insurers agreed to cover fleming,they contended that it was covered under the policies and not the policies.that made a real world difference because part of the coverage afforded by the policies had already been exhausted,more coverage was available to fleming under the policies.fleming also raised a separate issue in the declaratory judgment action as to what rule larger settlement or relative exposure controlled the allocation of coverage between insureds and.
on november,the district court ruled that the policies rather than the policies provided coverage for the class actions.on the other disputed issue,the district court ruled that the larger settlement rule of allocation controlled.insurers then appealed the district court judgment.
on appeal a panel of this court affirmed the holding that the policies provided coverage but vacated the trial court ruling on allocation as premature stauth national union fire ins,wl,at,cir table.for that reason the panel directed the district court to hold the case in abeyance until the underlying lawsuits were resolved id.at.because that has not yet occurred,no liability to the class action plaintiffs has been suffered to this point,although fleming has of course incurred the expense of this litigation while insurers have been providing the defense in the underlying class actions.
meanwhile,some two weeks after the district court november,ruling on the coverage and allocation issues,fleming filed a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to section b.as stated earlier,this appeal has been taken from the district court denial of that motion.
section b and the standard of review 
section b provides in relevant part 
it shall be the duty of the insurer,receiving a proof of loss,to submit a written offer of settlement or rejection of the claim to the insured party within ninety days of receipt of that proof of loss.upon a judgment rendered to either party,costs and attorney fees shall be allowable to the prevailing party.for purposes of this section,the prevailing party is the insurer in those cases where the judgment does not exceed the written offer of settlement.in all other judgments the insured party shall be the prevailing party.
before us the parties have raised several issues as to that statute interpretation and applicability.we address those issues in this order 
whether section b applies to fleming declaratory judgment actions 
whether the absence of a conventional formal proof of loss is fatal to fleming request for attorneys fees 
whether fleming was a prevailing party under section b and 
whether an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party is mandatory under that statute.
despite the general rule that the standard of review for a denial of attorneys fees is an abuse of discretion standard see,mann reynolds,cir and cases cited there,in this instance the district court did not exercise any discretion because it based its decision on its reading of section b as requiring a proof of loss as a matter of law.because the parties dispute is not as to the underlying facts but rather as to the proper application of section b,we conduct our review of the district court statutory interpretation under a de novo standard ward allstate ins,cir.
application of section b to declaratory judgment actions 
as an initial matter we must determine whether section b operates at all in this type of action a declaratory judgment proceeding concerned primarily with the preliminary question of which d and o policies or applied to fleming claim for coverage of the class action suits.fifteen years ago we gave an affirmative answer to the question of section b applicability to declaratory judgment actions seeking coverage under liability policies.in ins,cir an insured party had requested that its liability insurer defend it in a personal injury action id.at.after the insurer rejected the claim and the insured provided its own representation,it brought suit under section b to recover its expenditures,alleging that the insurer had breached its duty to defend id.at.
in concluding that the statute did apply to such actions,at first observed that the oklahoma courts interpreted the statute broadly,citing shinault ins.next the opinion emphasized that the statute declared an insured to be the prevailing party in all judgments other than in a specific and limited category of cases id.finally,after noting a split of authority on the question whether an insured can recover attorneys fees incurred in a declaratory judgment or indemnity action,id.at expressed the belief that the oklahoma supreme court would find persuasive this argument set out in john appleman,insurance law and practice,at 
after all,the insurer had contracted to defend the insured,and it failed to do so.it guessed wrong as to its duty,and should be compelled to bear the consequences thereof.if the rule laid down by these courts which have denied recovery should be followed by other authorities,it would actually amount to permitting the insurer to do by indirection that which it could not do directly.that is,the insured has a contract right to have actions against him defended by the insurer,at its expense.i
