in this insurance coverage action the district court,exercising diversity jurisdiction,granted to federal insurance company federal a summary judgment that it was not obligated by an officers and directors liability policy to reimburse telxon corporation telxon for certain costs which it incurred in defending a stockholder class action brought against it and two of its covered by that policy.telxon appealed.we affirm.
background 
a.the d o policy 
telxon,a global designer and manufacturer of wireless and mobile information systems,purchased from federal an executive liability indemnification policy,commonly known as a directors and officers policy hereinafter,the d o policy,covering claims made against its directors and officers during the period of may,to may.the d o policy contained an insuring clause entitled executive liability coverage,which provided that federal 
shall pay on behalf of each of the insured persons all loss for which the insured person is not indemnified by the insured organization and which the insured person becomes legally obligated to pay on account of any claim first made against him,individually or otherwise,during the policy period for a wrongful act committed,attempted,or allegedly committed or attempted,by the insured person s before or during the policy period.
joint appendix at d o policy,
the policy defined the insured organization as telxon and its subsidiaries,and the insured persons as a ny person who has been,now is,or shall become a duly elected director,or a duly elected or appointed officer of the insured organization.id.at d o policy,items.the policy defined loss as the total amount which any insured person s becomes legally obligated to pay on account of each claim and for all claims in each policy year made against them for wrongful acts for which coverage applies,including,but not limited to,damages,judgments,settlements,costs and defense costs.id.at d o policy.the policy defined defense costs as that part of loss consisting of costs,charges and expenses incurred in defending,investigating or monitoring legal actions,claims,or proceedings and appeals therefrom and the cost of appeal,attachment or similar bonds.id.in addition,the policy stated that federal shall not be liable for any settlements or defense costs to which it has not consented.id.at d o policy.
thus,on its face,telxon d o policy provides direct coverage to telxon directors and officers for any loss that they are legally obligated to pay.the policy provides coverage to telxon only to the extent that telxon is permitted or required by law to indemnify its directors and officers for a covered loss that the directors and officers were legally obligated to pay.
b.the underlying action 
in december,during the policy period,shareholders filed four class action securities lawsuits in the northern district of ohio against telxon,its former president and incumbent chief executive officer raymond meyo,and its incumbent president and chief operating officer daniel wipff.the district court later consolidated the cases and styled them,collectively,as stavroff meyo.the consolidated complaint alleged,inter alia,that telxon,through meyo and wipff,misrepresented telxon financial performance in order to raise the market price of its common stock.at complaint.on september,the district court in the underlying action granted summary judgment to telxon,meyo,and wipff.see stavroff meyo,aff,cir unpublished table decision.
telxon initially engaged its general counsel,goodman weiss miller goodman to defend it in the class action,with skadden,arps,meagher flom skadden serving as.goodman and december and january,appearances on behalf of telxon and wipff,but not meyo.id.at.on february,meyo retained thompson hine flory thompson,replacing his initial counsel,chattman sutrela friedlander.id.at telxon corporation certification dated.shortly thereafter,wipff retained howrey simon howrey.in march,howrey entered an appearance on behalf of wipff in place and stead of goodman.id.at.
on february,federal sent goodman a reservation of rights letter setting forth its coverage analysis with respect to the underlying litigation.the letter stated in relevant part,defense costs coverage is afforded to defendants raymond meyo and daniel wipff solely in their capacity as directors officers of telxon corporation.telxon corporation is insured under the policy solely for its liability to indemnify any or all of the insured persons for loss including defense costs sustained in the litigation.id.at letter from donna kurzawski to steven miller dated,emphasis in original.
by letter dated april,federal,at telxon request,described to telxon insurance agent its proposal for the allocation of attorney fees incurred in the underlying action.id.at letter from donna kurzawski to anthony gruppo dated.federal stated that it would reimburse of the fees charged by thompson and howrey on behalf of meyo and wipff,respectively.id.the proposal further stated,however,that it would cover none of skadden fees,and only of the fees charged by goodman between december to may.id.it explained,it is our position that meyo wipff retained separate counsel early in the litigation and that federal should not reimburse any fees incurred by goodman after the retention of separate counsel by meyo wipff.id.federal undertook partial reimbursement of fees charged by goodman because some work was expended by goodman on behalf of meyo and wipff in the drafting and filing of a motion to dismiss the underlying action,which the district court ruled on in early june of.id.at.
ultimately,federal reimbursed telxon for a total of in defense costs incurred in the underlying litigation.id.at declaration of margaret klimczyk dated.of that amount,represented fees charged by goodman prior to wipff retention of howrey and reasonable during the ensuing transition.id.in response to a show cause order in the coverage action,federal later paid an additional attributable to fees charged by goodman prior to may,though without conceding that it was obligated to do so.the remainder of the represented fees and costs charged by thompson and howrey for services they rendered to meyo and wipff.id.
coverage action 
on may,telxon filed this lawsuit,seeking a declaration that all of the fees charged by goodman and skadden were covered by the d o policy.telxon and federal filed for summary judgment.in its motion,as on this appeal,telxon invoked the reasonably related rule as authority for its entitlement to reimbursement of these fees.the maryland court of appeals had pioneered the concept that defense costs not expressly covered by a d o policy may nonetheless be reimbursed if they are reasonably related to the defense of a claim that is covered by the policy.continental casualty board of educ.of charles county.telxon also cited the larger settlement rule,a variation of the reasonably related rule,which allows allocation of the costs of a settlement only where that settlement is larger because of the activities of uninsured persons who were sued or persons who were not sued but whose actions may have contributed to the suit.owens corning national union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir quoting caterpillar,great am.ins,cir.
the district court below concluded that the reasonably related rule was simply inapplicable to the facts of this case.at order at.the court observed that such allocation rules are designed to solve allocation disputes that is,when a corporation and its officers and directors share legal representation and it is,therefore,difficult to determine who is responsible for the costs of the representation.id.the court then stated the corollary principle that such rules can not apply when no need exists to determine who is responsible for the costs of the joint legal representation.id.the district court further found that in this case,there is nothing to allocate because each of the three defendants in the underlying action had retained separate,and not joint,legal representation.id.the court stated that no reasonable jury could find that goodman and skadden actually represented meyo and wipff as additional counsel or that federal consented to such representation.id.order at.as the court put it,telxon,meyo and wipff chose the counsel structure they wished to employ in this case and chose how those counsel would interact.whatever the basis for that choice,it resulted in each defendant acting through separate counsel.id.at order at emphasis in original.the court continued,the fact that took the step of dividing up the responsibilities of their respective counsel does not transform this action into one to which allocation principles should be applied.id.at order at.
ultimately the district court focused on the provision of the d o policy limiting federal liability to fees the insured directors and officers were legally obligated to pay.id.at order at.the court ruled that this phrase was unambiguous because it was not susceptible to more than one interpretation.said the district court,legally obligated to pay means simply what it says,that the insurance policy only covers defense costs that the insured person has a legal obligation to pay,not a desire to pay or even a moral obligation to pay.id.at order at emphasis in original.the court found that there is no evidence that meyo and wipff undertook any legal obligation to pay goodman weiss and skadden fees after those officers retained separate counsel.id.after noting that the larger settlement rule was also inapplicable since the underlying action was not settled,the district court concluded that all of the fees and expenses charged by goodman and skadden were telxon sole responsibility.accordingly,the district court granted federal motion for summary judgment and denied telxon motion for the same.this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
the issue in this appeal is whether telxon can recover the defense fees and costs charged by goodman and skadden under its d o policy.telxon asserts that its alleged liability in the underlying action was wholly derivative of,and concurrent with,that of meyo and wipff.telxon argues that affording it the coverage it seeks will give full effect to the d o policy underlying purpose of protecting an uninsured corporation against liability arising from the wrongful acts of its directors and officers.
our jurisdiction to address telxon arguments is based solely on the diversity of the citizenship of the parties the insurance coverage issue telxon raises is a matter of state law.see transamerica ins.duro bag,cir interpretation of insurance contracts is,of course,a matter of state law omaha prop.and cas.ins.johnson,cir the states regulate insurance companies for the protection of their residents.we apply the relevant state law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the highest court of that state.see erie tompkins.see also owens corning national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,cir citing erie and applying ohio law to resolve an insurance coverage question.
applying this analytical framework,we conclude that telxon is not entitled to the coverage it seeks under its d o policy.it is in ohio,and indeed universally,that contracts,including insurance policies,are to be interpreted so as to carry out the intent of the parties,as that intent is evidenced by the contractual language.skivolocki east ohio gas,ohio,citations omitted.the words of the insurance policy should be given their ordinary and commonly understood meaning.king nationwide ins,ohio,quoting dealers dairy prods.royal ins,ohio.
telxon d o policy unambiguously covered only losses that the insured person s here,meyo and legally obligated to pay.the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of this provision is that telxon d o policy necessarily excludes from coverage any amount that meyo and wipff were not legally obligated to pay.
we conclude that meyo and wipff were never legally obligated to pay goodman and skadden.there was no express contract between meyo or wipff on one hand,and goodman or skadden on the other.nor were the ingredients of an implied contract present.in ohio,when a client seeks and obtains an attorney advice on a legal matter,an implied contract to pay a reasonable value for the professional services rendered may arise,unless there is a special agreement to the contrary.see warm greenberg,ohio app d.
here,it is undisputed that meyo and wipff engaged their own counsel and never sought advice or services directly from goodman and skadden,as distinguished from thompson and howrey.in their filings in the district court in the underlying action,goodman and skadden stated that they represented only telxon.neither goodman nor skadden ever entered an appearance on behalf of meyo.both firms originally entered appearances on behalf of telxon and wipff.soon thereafter,however,wipff retained howrey,who appeared on his behalf in place and stead of goodman.goodman pleadings filed in the underlying action identify goodman and skadden only as attorneys for defendant telxon corporation.see,at excerpts from pleadings filed in the underlying action.
goodman and telxon made similar statements out of court.for example,a telxon official signed a certification stating that thompson represented meyo,howrey represented wipff,and goodman and skadden represented telxon.id.at telxon corporation certification dated.goodman wrote to counsel for the plaintiffs in the underlying action that a s counsel for telxon it had no objection regarding a particular discovery matter,but i am not speaking on behalf of counsel for the other defendants,whom you may contact directly.id.at letter from steven miller to richard wayne dated july.in separate letters to federal,goodman described thompson as meyo counsel and howrey as wipff separate counsel.id.at.there is no evidence that telxon or goodman exercised any oversight over thompson or howrey.
thompson and howrey were not mere shadow counsel.compare raychem federal ins,noting that several of the directors and officers involved in a shareholder class action retained shadow counsel to monitor the litigation on their behalf.it is undisputed that thompson and howrey actively participated in the litigation on behalf of meyo and wipff,respectively.howrey filed motions,discovery requests,or other papers with the district court in the underlying litigation,and thompson filed thirteen such pleadings.id.at michele engle decl.these pleadings stated that they were filed only on behalf of meyo or wipff,just as goodman pleadings stated that they were filed only on behalf of telxon.lawyers from howrey participated in each of the depositions taken in the case,and lawyers from thompson participated in all but one of those depositions.id.at engle decl.thompson and howrey argued separately at the summary judgment hearing in the underlying litigation on behalf of their respective clients.id.at.the transcript of the summary judgment hearing states that goodman and skadden appeared only on behalf of telxon,while thompson and howrey appeared only on behalf of meyo and wipff,respectively.id.at.that hearing took place sixteen months after federal stated,in its reservation of rights letter,that it would not reimburse any fees charged by goodman after the retention of separate counsel by meyo and wipff.for these services,meyo and wipff were legally obligated to pay a combined total of million,which federal paid pursuant to the plain policy language.
telxon argues that goodman assumed the role of lead counsel in the underlying action and thus provided direct representation to all of the defendants.after meyo and wipff retained separate counsel,telxon insisted that goodman take the lead in defending the underlying action.at letter from robe
