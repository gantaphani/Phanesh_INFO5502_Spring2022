this case arose after cuna mutual insurance society cuna stopped paying disability benefits to the appellant,barbara gent.cuna ceased its payments after determining that gent was subject to the mental illness limitation in its policy.under this limitation,an insured who is disabled due to a mental illness may not receive disability benefits for more than two years.gent took several administrative appeals of cuna determination,arguing that her disability was caused by a physical condition,specifically,lyme disease.when these appeals were unsuccessful,gent filed this action in federal district court under erisa,claiming that cuna had unlawfully terminated her benefits.after reviewing the administrative record,the district court granted summary judgment to cuna.the court held that the policy mental illness limitation applied because gent had failed to prove that her disability was caused by lyme disease.this appeal ensued.
gent primary argument is that the district court erroneously required her to prove that her disability stemmed from a physical condition.in her view,the burden was on cuna to prove that she was disabled due to a mental illness and thus subject to the mental illness limitation.we think that,regardless of who bore the burden,cuna evidence is stronger and so affirm.
a.the policy 
at all relevant times,gent was employed by the westerly community credit union as the vice president of operations.as a benefit of her employment,gent was covered under the credit union disability insurance plan.plan benefits are paid under a disability insurance policy issued by cuna.cuna also administers this plan.
three aspects of cuna policy bear mentioning.first,cuna policy provides that it will pay an insured monthly benefits if the insured is disabled due to sickness or injury.under the terms of the policy,an insured is totally disabled if among other things an injury or sickness prevents her from performing all of the material and substantial duties of her occupation on a basis because of a disability.second,although cuna policy defines sickness as an illness or disease,the policy also contains a mental illness limitation.this limitation states that an insured who is disabled due to a mental illness may receive a maximum of two years of disability benefits.finally,cuna policy requires an insured who is seeking benefits to submit a proof of claim that must include the date the disability started the cause of disability and the degree of disability.
b.the claim 
in march,stress led gent to see a therapist.during her session with the therapist,gent expressed fears that the new president at the westerly community credit union was trying to take responsibilities away from her and to get me out of there.shortly thereafter,gent met with her psychiatrist,parmentier.she informed parmentier that stress had caused her to become depressed.in addition to depression,gent complained of anxiety,sleep disturbance,poor energy,difficulty focusing,crying spells,and the inability to think clearly.after evaluating gent,parmentier diagnosed her with recurrent major depression and excused her from work.in his evaluation,parmentier observed that gent had a history of depression.in she had been hospitalized for depression triggered by stress.
in june,gent submitted a claim for benefits under her policy.filed along with her claim was a required attending physician statement.this statement,completed by parmentier,listed recurrent major depressive disorder as the diagnosis.parmentier further indicated that gent had a class mental impairment,which meant that she was unable to engage in stress situations or engage in interpersonal relations marked limitations.no cardiac or physical impairments were identified by parmentier.
in august,cuna approved gent claim for disability benefits.in the approval letter mailed to gent,cuna prominently excerpted the mental illness limitation.
c.the administrative appeals and current lawsuit 
in april,cuna sent gent a letter informing her that,because of the mental illness limitation,her benefits would end in july.when cuna stopped paying benefits in july,gent appealed,claiming that the cap on benefits did not apply to her because her disability now stemmed from a physical condition,specifically lyme disease.according to gent,approximately one year after cuna started paying her monthly disability benefits roughly june a tick bit her,infecting her with lyme disease.cuna asked scott yarosh,a psychiatrist,to review gent medical records.after review of these records,yarosh concluded that gent was psychiatrically impaired and that the medical records as a whole do not document specific criteria to suggest that there are other disabling medical conditions.cuna denied gent appeal.
from november to march,gent appealed the adverse benefits determination five more times.throughout the appeals process,both gent and cuna supplemented the administrative record with medical opinions from various doctors.these doctors came to divergent conclusions,with some opining that gent was disabled by lyme disease and others that gent,if disabled,was disabled by a depressive disorder cuna rejected four of these five appeals,declining to consider her fifth,the sixth overall,on administrative exhaustion grounds.
in june,gent filed this lawsuit in federal district court.in due course,both she and cuna moved for summary judgment.as already noted,the district court granted summary judgment to cuna,upholding the termination of disability benefits.
ii.standards of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.orndorf paul revere life ins,cir.when deciding whether a party is entitled to summary judgment,we typically view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the party,drawing all reasonable inferences in that party favor.leahy raytheon,cir.our approach is different,however,in the erisa context,where the record before us is the same record that was before the plan administrator.orndorf,at.in such a case,summary judgment is simply a vehicle for deciding the benefits issue and the party is not entitled to the usual inferences in its favor.id 
what level of deference we must give to the plan administrator benefits determination is a separate issue.where,as here,the plan does not give the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,our review of the administrator decision is de novo.denmark liberty life assur,cir.under this standard,w e grant no deference to the administrators opinions or conclusions.richards,cir.
iii.discussion 
gent argues that the district court erred when it saddled her with the burden of proving that lyme disease rendered her disabled under the terms of the policy in her view,the mental illness limitation operates as would a coverage exclusion under traditional insurance law principles.under those principles,once an insured has met her initial burden of proving that a claim falls within the grant of coverage,the burden shifts to the insurer to show that an exclusion defeats coverage.see mcgee hca,cir it is a basic rule of insurance law that the insured carries the burden of showing a covered loss has occurred and the insurer must prove facts that bring a loss within an exclusionary clause of the policy.see also glista unum life ins.of,cir gre ins.group metro.boston hous,cir describing how exclusions operate under massachusetts law.
facially,the limitation might appear to operate much like an exclusion.the parties agreed that gent was disabled and was entitled to benefits whether the cause was psychological or physical,and cuna then tried to cut off those payments by pointing to a time limit on payments for those disabled by mental illness rather than by a physical cause.on the other hand,the policy,which listed the mental illness limitation under the heading benefits,required that the insured provide proof of disability due to sickness or injury that includes the cause of disability.one could argue that these provisions put the burden on gent to establish the physical or organic etiology of her disability in order for her to be eligible to continu
