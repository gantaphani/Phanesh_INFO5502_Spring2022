certain underwriters at lloyd of london brought this suit against max harry cohen,a general surgeon,and max harry cohen,the corporate entity under which his practice operated collectively,seeking a declaration that they properly rescinded his disability insurance policies.the magistrate judge held that cohen made material misrepresentations on his policy applications and so granted summary judgment to the underwriters.for the reasons that follow,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on april,cohen submitted several initial applications for disability insurance to petersen international underwriters,a broker authorized by the underwriters to enter into insurance contracts on their behalf.each insurance application consists of questions pertaining to an applicant personal,financial,and medical information.
at issue here are cohen responses to three of those questions.when asked are you actively at work,cohen checked the yes box.in response to the question are you aware of any fact that could change your occupation or financial stability,cohen checked the no box.when asked are you party to any legal proceeding at this time,cohen again checked the no box.cohen signed final applications with these answers on august,and the policies became effective on that date.
on april,shortly after submission of his initial applications and prior to submission of his final applications,cohen signed a consent order with the maryland state board of physicians the board,which suspended his license to practice medicine in maryland.the consent order provided that cohen suspension would begin on august,and continue for a period of three months.cohen agreed in the consent order to wind down his practice and refer all patients to other doctors during the period prior to his suspension,and supply the board with sixty days notice of his intent to become clinically active following his suspension.the consent order further provided that if cohen returned to active practice,he would be on probation for five years,and would be supervised for the first year 
on september,one month after the disability policies went into effect,cohen sought medical treatment for injuries to his thumb and leg resulting from a fall.later that month,cohen insurance agent provided the underwriters with notice of a possible claim.the underwriters retained disability management services,to investigate and adjust the potential claim.that investigation uncovered the consent order.the underwriters then notified cohen that they intended to rescind the policies,and issued a check refunding his premium payments.
cohen initiated the policies grievance procedures,under which the rescission was affirmed.he requested an informal review,and the rescission was again upheld.the underwriters,which are incorporated under the laws of england and wales,and have their principal places of business in london,subsequently brought this diversity action against cohen,a maryland citizen.the underwriters asserted that cohen made material misrepresentations on his applications for insurance and sought a declaration that they properly rescinded his policies.the parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge.
cohen filed a motion in limine to exclude all references to any proceedings,records,files,or orders by the board.after a telephonic hearing,the magistrate judge orally denied the motion,concluding that the consent order was admissible.the parties then filed for summary judgment.in a memorandum opinion,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment to the underwriters and denied cohen.the court concluded that the underwriters validly rescinded the insurance policies because cohen made material misrepresentations in his applications.
cohen timely noted this appeal,challenging both the magistrate judge grant of summary judgment to the underwriters and denial of his motion in limine to exclude all references to the consent order.

the underwriters contend that cohen provided materially false answers to three questions on his policy applications are you actively at work to which he answered yes are you aware of any fact that could change your occupation or financial stability to which he answered no and are you a party to any legal proceeding at this time to which he answered no.
under maryland law,which the parties agree applies here,a material misrepresentation on an insurance policy application justifies the rescission of a policy issued on the basis of that application.stumpf state farm mut.auto.ins.to decide whether an insurer has validly rescinded a policy,a court must first determine whether the policyholder made a false statement on the application.monumental life ins.taylor.if so,a court then considers whether the false statement was material to the risk assumed by the insurer.id.ordinarily and generally,whether a representation is true or false,or material to the risk,is for the jury to determine,but when the insurer demonstrates falsity and materiality by uncontradicted or clear and convincing evidence,the question may be one of law.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.

applying these principles we can only conclude that each of the questions to which cohen allegedly gave false answers is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,and so is ambiguous.first,the question a re you actively at work is ambiguous because there are several possible interpretations of what it means to be actively at work.the underwriters contend that by answering yes,cohen represented that he was perform ing surgery on a daily basis when he was,in fact,prohibited from performing surgery.appellees br.cohen interpretation is more expansive.he maintains that he was actively at work during the suspension both because he was a licensed surgeon in the district of columbia,and because he continued to perform various duties related to his maryland practice,including administrative work,research,and professional development.he asserts that,during his suspension,he often arrived home from being at work in the office after midnight.
neither of these interpretations is unreasonable both find support in the insurance policies.as the underwriters point out,on another portion of the application,cohen indicated that his occupation was surgeon and his daily duties were surgery,possibly suggesting that this was his only work work he lacked the authority to perform in maryland during his suspension.maybe so.but the application does not define the phrase actively at work,does not limit its inquiry to maryland work,and does not provide that being actively at work requires performance of the specific daily duties an applicant may have listed in the limited space available for that response.
the second question to which the magistrate judge found cohen had provided a false response a re you aware of any fact that could change your occupation or financial stability is also ambiguous.the underwriters contend that
