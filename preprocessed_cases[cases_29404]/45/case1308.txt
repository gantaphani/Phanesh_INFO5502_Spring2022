the,auburn gear,terminated benefits to retired employees of auburn gear and its predecessor.the retired employees filed suit,claiming that their collectively bargained insurance agreements provided lifetime benefits that could not be terminated.the district court found that the language of the collectively bargained insurance agreements limited benefits to the term of the agreements and contained no patent or latent ambiguities.as a result,when the terms of the collectively bargained insurance agreements expired,so did auburn gear obligation to provide benefits.on this basis,the district court granted summary judgment for auburn gear.
for the following reasons,we now affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the are retired hourly employees of a manufacturing facility located in auburn,indiana.throughout the relevant time period,the employees now retirees were represented by united auto workers local union.approximately every three years,the union negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement cba and collectively bargained insurance agreement cbia with the employer.the original employer,corporation,sold the facility to auburn gear in november 
the retirees health insurance benefits were discussed in each cbia.although union representatives sometimes met with the retirees to explain new terms in the contracts,there is no allegation that the union required the retirees consent to ratify the cbias.
at issue in this case are cbias negotiated by and the union covering the time periods from,and,as well as the cbias between auburn gear and the union covering the time periods from,and.
the cba contains an integration clause similar to integration clauses contained in the other relevant agreements 
it is understood that this agreement,together with the following agreements,shall be considered the full working arrangement between the company and the union 
a retirement income agreement and plan.
b insurance agreement.
c supplemental unemployment benefit agreement and plan.
each said agreement shall be considered a separate portion which can be negotiated independently 
section i of the cbia,entitled group insurance agreement,states,the company will maintain during the period of this agreement various insurance and other benefits as set forth in this agreement.emphasis added.each cbia,including the contract,states,this agreement shall be in full force and effect until midnight of the expiration date.section ii of the cbia sets forth benefits available to active employees.section vi describes healthcare benefits and life insurance plans available under the cbia to retired employees.
the first cbia between the union and auburn gear was signed in.except for the effective dates of coverage,most contract terms remained the same as the terms negotiated by the union and.however,the cbia contained different language relating to bridge and transition benefits.in the cbia these benefits were available to retirees who had retired under total and permanent disability provisions.in the cbia these benefits were limited to active employees.
additionally,the cbia is the first cbia to address the impact of medicare supplemental insurance.under the contract,individuals who had previously retired retirees were not subject to certain increases in deductibles,percentages,or limitations that new retirees were.
in an attempt to explain the parties contemporary understanding,the retirees present handwritten minutes from a meeting on march.these minutes recount an exchange between auburn gear chief negotiator and the union president.auburn gear negotiator stated,when we entered into negotiations we had told you that retiree costs could be changed,now we think it can be changed.the union president responded,it is our legal opinion that we ca negotiate away retiree benefits.
auburn gear claims its major goal in the negotiation was to eliminate benefits under the and out provision,which allowed employees to retire before reaching the age of.under the cbia,employees who retired before the age of were not eligible for retiree benefits until their birthday.immediately following the execution of the contract,however,and pursuant to negotiations,a group of fifteen to twenty grandfathered active employees were sent by terry dean,a supervisor for auburn that they would still be eligible for the and out provision.auburn gear made this exception to avoid an exodus of experienced employees.in subsequent agreements,these grandfathered employees were treated as if they retired under the previous contract.
in his deposition,union president salvatore bevilacqua admitted that the cbia altered the prescription drug plan for retirees,adding a that applied to both new and existing retirees.terry dean explained that,as he understood the plans in,benefits were not vested.although retirees could elect to take a pension benefit plan that would last until they died,the insurance benefits were contract to contract.during his deposition,dean explained that his letter was intended to communicate to the retirees that their benefits were vested and that they would receive those benefits when they retired as long as they were negotiated in every agreement.emphasis added.in addition to the prescription,beginning in,retirees who were ineligible to receive medicare were charged a monthly fee to retain their hospital and surgical benefits.
in,a preferred care plan was added and the provisions for retirees not eligible for medicare were changed to include deductibles.in the cbia,contributions and were altered again.
the plaintiffs claim that auburn gear actions during a arbitration proceeding demonstrates that auburn gear understood the benefits to have an indefinite duration.auburn gear claimed it was not obligated to provide benefits and possible survivor benefits to a spouse of a retiree.terry dean stated that auburn gear did not want to be stuck paying for an uncontrollable amount of benefits over an uncontrollable amount of time.auburn gear lost the arbitration.
a new cbia signed on december,introduced language that was significantly different from previous cbias.for the first time,the cbia included retiree benefits in the list of items that section i specified auburn gear must provide during the term of the agreement.the agreement also tied the duration of the cbia to the duration of the cba.
retiree insurance was provided by auburn gear until the agreements expired in april.a series of letter agreements between auburn gear and the union continued retiree insurance until november.in october,auburn gear informed the union of its intention to terminate retiree health insurance benefits.the union active employees went on strike on november.the next day auburn gear sent a letter to all retirees terminating benefits.the retirees challenge that termination.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see,matuszak torrington,cir.summary judgment is not warranted when there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to the interpretation of a contract.see diehl twin disc,cir.a contract meaning is a matter of law,and where there is no contractual ambiguity,there is no resort to extrinsic evidence,hence no factual dispute to preclude summary judgment.id.citing gciu employer ret.fund chi.tribune,cir.unless patent or latent ambiguity can be proven,extrinsic evidence is not proper to stave off summary judgment.barnett ameren,cir.
unlike pension benefits under erisa,insurance benefits,such as the benefits at issue in this case,do not automatically vest.see,bidlack wheelabrator,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.unless a contract provides for the vesting of benefits,the presumption is that benefits terminate when a collective bargaining agreement ends.bidlack,at pabst brewing corrao,cir erisa does not require the vesting of welfare benefits if they vest at all,they do so under the terms of a particular contract.
the presumption that healthcare benefits do not exceed the life of an agreement imposes a high burden of proof upon the retirees.see bidlack,at rossetto,pabst brewing,cir a s word of the bidlack presumption spreads and collective bargaining agreements are renegotiated,it will become obvious to unions that if they want to assure that health benefits for the workers they represent are vested they will have to insist on explicit language to this effect.this presumption can be rebutted by extrinsic evidence only if an ambiguity exists in the contractual language or if there is a yawning void that cries out for an implied term.bidlack,at.
the district court correctly relied upon the standards for contract interpretation enunciated by this court in rossetto 
if a collective bargaining agreement is completely silent on the duration of health benefits,the entitlement to them expires with the agreement,as a matter of law that is,without going beyond the pleadings,unless the plaintiff can show by objective evidence that the agreement is latently ambiguous,that is,that anyone knowledgeable about the context of the agreement would realize that it might not mean what it says.this is the bidlack presumption and its rebuttal.
if the agreement makes clear that the entitlement expires with the agreement,as by including such a phrase as during the term of this agreement,then,once again,the plaintiff loses as a matter of law unless he can show a latent ambiguity by means of objective evidence.this is a general rule of contract law,independent of but consistent with bidlack.
if there is language in the agreement to suggest a grant of lifetime benefits,and the suggestion is not negated by the agreement read as a whole,the plaintiff is entitled to a trial.of course,if the agreement expressly grants such benefits,the plaintiff is entitled,not to a trial,but to a judgment in his favor.we are speaking of a case in which merely suggestive language creates a patent ambiguity.
if the plaintiff is entitled to a trial by reason of either a patent or a latent ambiguity,the normal rules of evidence will govern the trial,and so the parties will not be limited at trial to presenting objective evidence of meaning.
when examining a collectively bargained insurance agreement,the language of the contract itself and the existence or of patent ambiguity will determine which of the four models for contract interpretation presented in rossetto the court will utilize.we examine the contract to determine if the cbia is completely silent on the duration of health benefits,if it makes clear that the entitlement expires with the agreement,or i f there is language in the agreement to suggest a grant of lifetime benefits.rossetto,at.
a patent ambiguity is a n ambiguity that clearly appears on the face of a document,arising from the language itself.black law dictionary ed.when an ambiguity is apparent just from reading the contract without having to know anything about how it interacts with the the contract has what is called a patent,or intrinsic,ambiguity,and evidence is admissible to cure it.rossetto,at citations omitted.only if the language of the plan document is ambiguous and these ambiguities are not clarified in the document may we consider evidence of the parties intent that is extrinsic to the writing.bland fiatallis,cir citing vallone cna fin,cir.
the plaintiffs have attempted to analogize this case to bidlack wheelabrator.bidlack allowed the introduction of extrinsic evidence to establish intent where an agreement was not silent,but merely vague,as to whether benefits constituted a perpetual entitlement.id.at.
the plaintiffs comparison to bidlack,however,is misplaced.the language in this cbia goes beyond vagueness or silence,and explicitly states that the benefits at issue in this case expire at the end of the contract term.thus,we find no patent ambiguity.
section i of the cbia states 
the company will maintain during the period of this agreement,subject to the terms and conditions established by the master plan or plans with the insurance carrier or carriers,a program of life insurance,accidental death and dismemberment insurance,accident and sickness insurance,hospital and surgical benefits,outpatient diagnostic and laboratory benefits,and therapy benefits,emergency benefits,transition and bridge benefits,prescription drug plan,dental plan,extended care benefits,vision care,and extended disability benefits as set forth in this agreement.
emphasis added.auburn gear obligation to provide benefits continues during the period of this agreement,but not beyond.
in corrao,we examined the following contractual language,similar to section i provisions for the term of this agreement,the employer shall provide major medical,health,dental,sickness and accident,and life insurance benefits in accordance with another part of the agreement.this court found that the quoted language limited each named benefit to the term of this agreement,as if the phrase had been inserted when discussing each benefit specifically.see corrao,at although corrao recognized the harsh result of the bidlack presumption,the court found that termination of benefits without reference to extrinsic evidence is appropriate where the text of an agreement,accompanied by an integration clause,provides no gaps to fill or ambiguous terms to be interpreted.id.
section i makes no attempt to indicate that it is exclusive to active employees or only applies to section ii of the cbia which does not include the retirees.the retirees claim that because section i uses the singular program,it ca apply to both retirees and active employees.this argument lacks merit.the singular program applies to the entire agreement.
further evidence for the general nature of section i is found in the clause limiting auburn gear obligation to the terms and conditions established by the master plan or plans with insurance carrier or carriers.this warning appears nowhere else in the cbia,but is vital to notify retirees and active employees of the possibility that changes outside the company control could occur.thus,section i acts as an overriding preamble for both active and retired employees.
as in corrao,the parties practice of changing the contractual terms in succeeding agreements lends support to auburn gear claim that neither party understood the benefits to be permanent or inalterable.see corrao,at the employer behavior suggests that it did not believe that it was forbidden to change benefit levels for retirees.it shifted the package around,and it imposed various forms of managed care on the retirees.in the instant case,every three years,when the cbia was renegotiated,the parties felt free to alter and other benefits.
the retirees argue that the cbia is implicitly extended beyond its term by a clause that provides benefits for surviving spouses until their death or remarriage.this provision,however,refers to the eligibility of individuals to receive benefits under the agreement,not to the duration of the agreement.surviving spouses were eligible to receive benefits only so long as the cbia was in place.
it is well established that lifetime benefits can be limited to the duration of a contract.we have previously found that where a reservation of rights clause coexists with a guarantee of lifetime benefits,w e must resolve the tension between the lifetime benefits clause,and the plan termination and reservation of rights clauses,by giving meaning to all of them a lthough the plan in its current iteration entitles retirees to health coverage for the duration of their lives and the lives of their eligible surviving spouses,the terms of the the plan continued subject to change at the will of the employer.uaw rockford powertrain,cir citations omitted see also vallone,at.
the provision in section i of the cbia,limiting benefits to the period of this agreement,is a reservation of rights clause.see barnett,at cir.at the end of each cbia,lifetime benefits ceased and auburn gear was free to revoke or modify benefits.see id.at citing vallone at.so long as the cbia was in effect,benefits remained valid when the cbia ceased to be effective,lifetime benefits ceased as well.
the retirees also allege that similarities in language between the pension plan and cbia demonstrates an intention to vest health benefits.while pensions are assumed to vest,there is no similar presumption in the provision of healthcare benefit
