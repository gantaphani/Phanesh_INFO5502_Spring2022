background 
between may and april,the state of illinois,the united states,and a group of individuals filed five separate lawsuits the underlying suits against apex in state and federal courts in illinois based on the actions of apex and its predecessor companies in releasing contaminants into the soil surrounding its oil refinery in hartford,illinois.royal indemnity company defended apex on the majority of the underlying suits.on august,apex brought suit against multiple insurers in the circuit court of madison county,illinois the illinois lawsuit,seeking a declaration of the parties rights and responsibilities with respect to the hartford soil contamination under policies the insurance companies had issued to apex.
on march,royal indemnity company initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint in federal court pursuant to the declaratory judgment act,and,seeking adjudication of the parties rights and obligations under certain insurance policies.in its complaint,royal indemnity company also sought a declaration of the rights and responsibilities of the parties based on claims of equitable contribution,subrogation,unjust enrichment equitable estoppel for the costs royal indemnity company incurred in defending apex as well as attorneys fees,costs and interest.in this lawsuit,royal indemnity company named ace insurance company of illinois central national insurance company of omaha maryland casualty company,as successor in interest to american general insurance company national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pa and tig insurance company as defendants.in the course of this lawsuit,national union and tig insurance company filed separate against apex,and national union interpleaded corroon black of missouri,and frank hall of missouri,as defendants.
on may,apex amended its complaint in the illinois lawsuit to name as defendants the same entities who are parties to this lawsuit.apex then filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit as duplicative of the illinois lawsuit.the illinois lawsuit remains active,although two of the defendants,national union and corroon black,have filed motions to dismiss,which were still pending before the illinois state court at the time this appeal was submitted.the district court granted apex motions to dismiss royal indemnity company initial complaint and national union and tig,dismissing all claims without prejudice under the abstention doctrine of wilton seven falls,d.the district court found that the illinois lawsuit and this lawsuit were parallel,that the claim was essentially one for declaratory judgment,and that it had the discretion to abstain from this lawsuit under wilton and brillhart excess insurance of america.
royal indemnity company,national union and tig collectively royal appeal the dismissal,claiming the district court erred in finding that it could abstain under wilton and brillhart.royal requests that we either find that the abstention test articulated in wilton and brillhart does not apply or,in the alternative,that we remand so the district court can enter an order staying these proceedings instead of dismissing this lawsuit.we affirm the district court decision to abstain,but we vacate the dismissal and remand for the district court to enter an order staying the proceedings in this lawsuit.
ii.discussion 
although rare,federal courts may sometimes refrain from exercising jurisdiction over a case properly filed in federal court.the doctrine of abstention,under which a district court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction,is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.county of allegheny frank mashuda,d.in colorado river water conservation district united states,d,the supreme court noted that federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction given them.under the standard articulated in colorado river,a federal court should only abstain from a case in which there are parallel state proceedings for exceptional circumstances.id.at.quoting county of allegheny,at.
however,the test articulated in colorado river for a federal court to abstain when there are parallel state proceedings does not apply to actions under the declaratory judgment act.see wilton,at.federal courts have more discretion to abstain in an action when a party seeks relief under the declaratory judgment act.see wilton,at.brillhart,at.this broader discretion arises out of the declaratory judgment act language that a court may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.a emphasis added.the supreme court has noted that it has repeatedly characterized the declaratory judgment act as an enabling act,which confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.wilton,at.quoting public serv.comm of utah wycoff.in emphasizing the uniqueness of the declaratory judgment act,the court commented that its textual commitment to discretion,and the breadth of leeway we have always understood it to suggest,distinguish the declaratory judgment context from other areas of the law in which concepts of discretion surface.id.at.therefore,in a declaratory judgment action,a federal court has broad discretion to abstain from exercising jurisdiction even if there are no exceptional circumstances as articulated in colorado river.see scottsdale ins.detco,cir.
according to brillhart,for a district court to have discretion to abstain in a proceeding under the declaratory judgment act,the parallel state court proceeding must present the same issues,not governed by federal law,between the same parties,and the court must evaluate whether the claims of all parties in interest can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding,whether necessary parties have been joined,whether such parties are amenable to process in that proceeding,brillhart,at.after considering these factors,a federal court may abstain from the proceeding because o rdinarily it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where a parallel state court proceeding is pending.id.

royal argues that the district court erred in applying the wilton and brillhart abstention doctrine and instead should have applied the exceptional circumstances test articulated in colorado river.however,unlike colorado river,this lawsuit involves a declaratory judgment action.apex,therefore,claims that the district court correctly relied upon wilton and brillhart to govern its abstention analysis.royal responds by arguing that royal indemnity company claims for contribution,subrogation,unjust enrichment and equitable estoppel are independent from its claims for declaratory judgment,and the existence of these claims causes wilton and brillhart to be inapplicable and requires instead that we analyze the decision to abstain under the test articulated in colorado river.royal thus concludes that the circumstances here are not so exceptional as to allow a federal court to abstain and that we should therefore reverse the district court and remand for this lawsuit to proceed on the merits.
however,the fact that royal indemnity company seeks monetary damages in addition to declaratory relief does not require a federal court automatically to apply the exceptional circumstances test articulated in colorado river.the declaratory judgment act allows a court to grant any further necessary or proper relief based on its dec
