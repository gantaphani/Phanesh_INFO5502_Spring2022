stores,took out life insurance on its employees and made itself the beneficiary.this interlocutory appeal arises from a grant of partial summary judgment involving a dispute over death benefits from one of these life insurance coli policies.douglas sims estate sued on the ground that the coli policy taken out in sims name violated the texas insurable interest doctrine.we hold that texas law,which requires an insurable interest for valid life insurance policies,governs the dispute an employer has no insurable interest in an ordinary employee under texas law and failed to establish its affirmative defense that the estate claims were barred by limitations.in so holding,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment for and affirm its grant of partial summary judgment for the sims estate.
in,established a trust to serve as the legal holder of life insurance policies insuring the lives of its employees and naming itself as beneficiary.the instrument establishing the trust provided that georgia law would govern the trust construction,validity,and administration,and named wachovia bank of georgia,wachovia as trustee.acted in pursuit of tax benefits related to the deductibility of premium payments,and was only one of many similarly situated companies which took this course of action.after congress and the irs eliminated the tax advantages of coli program,unwound the otherwise unprofitable program,surrendering the last of its policies by.
coli policies insured the lives of all employees also called associates with service time sufficient for enrollment in the associates health and welfare plan,unless those associates elected not to participate in a special death benefit program that introduced in conjunction with the coli program.fewer than one percent of the eligible employees opted out of the program,which was discontinued by early.coli program was intended to be mortality neutral,such that the death benefits paid to upon its associates deaths would fund employee benefit plans and death expenses,or otherwise be repaid to the insurer as cost of insurance adjustments.
douglas sims was a associate from may until his death on december,and was insured under a coli policy from december,until his death though the special death benefit program had been discontinued prior to sims death.on june,after his estate discovered the existence of this policy,it sued,alleging a violation of the texas insurable interest doctrine.the estate sought,in relevant part,a declaratory judgment of its rights under sims coli policy,the imposition of a constructive trust on the policy benefits,and disgorgement of the money unjustly received at some point in.
moved for summary judgment on the grounds that,in relevant part,georgia law applies and thus sims has no claim and,in the alternative,the texas statute of limitations bars sims claim.after the district court denied this motion,moved for reconsideration,renewing its choice of law argument and adding that recent developments in texas law placed doubt on the public policy underlying the state insurable interest doctrine.sims then filed a motion for partial summary judgment,seeking a declaration that lacked an insurable interest in sims life.responded with a for summary judgment,arguing that had an insurable interest in sims.
the district court granted motion for reconsideration,but again denied summary judgment on all grounds in an amended opinion.the court then granted partial summary judgment in favor of sims,but certified its order under b for interlocutory appeal on the following issues which state substantive law applies to sims claims whether has an insurable interest in sims life and whether the statute of limitations bars sims claims.this court granted leave to appeal the district court order.
this court reviews grants or denials of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.morris covan world wide moving,cir.the issues we will address are the choice of which state law to apply an analysis of the texas insurable interest doctrine as it applies to this case and the applicable statute of limitations.we take these up in order.
first,contends that the district court erred in applying the substantive law of texas rather than georgia to the parties dispute.this court reviews de novo a district court choice of law determination.in re air disaster at ramstein air base,germany,cir.
in making a choice of law determination,a federal court exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state,here texas.klaxon stentor.see also spence glock,cir.texas courts use the most significant relationship test set forth in the restatement second of conflict of laws for all choice of law cases except contract cases in which the parties have agreed to a valid choice of law clause.duncan cessna aircraft.as the district court correctly noted,neither sims nor asserts that a statutory directive governs the choice of law determination here,and neither have they agreed on which state law to apply the trust instrument invocation of georgia law being of no moment because sims was not a party to that contract,so this court applies the restatement analysis.maxus exploration moran.
section of the restatement lists several general factors to be used by courts in making choice of law determinations 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems 
b the relevant policies of the forum 
c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue 
d the protection of justified expectations 
e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law 
f certainty,predictability,and uniformity of result and 
g ease in determination and application of the law to be applied.
restatement second of conflict of laws.the district court thoroughly and conscientiously analyzed each factor as it applies to this case.we have little to add to this analysis,only emphasizing that sims claim centers on an alleged violation of the texas insurable interest doctrine as it has evolved via common law and legislative guidance,and that texas interest in seeing its policy correctly applied far overwhelms any other consideration.
further,while the restatement does not provide a specific analytical schemata for determining insurable interest claims,it does address choice of law analyses for various kinds of disputes that can be analogized to this one.these later sections demonstrate the concrete application of the most significant relationship test,and all incorporate as the starting point for any such analysis.of potential relevance here are,governing issues in tort,governing contract disputes,governing certain life insurance contracts and,governing claims for unjust enrichment.
frames the issue in this case as a contractual dispute,and accordingly argues that should guide this court choice of law analysis.section provides that t he rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which,with respect to that issue,has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties.restatement second of conflict of laws.the inquiry is directed at unearthing and upholding contracting parties intent as to the governing law.
as sims and the district court point out,however,this case does not involve a dispute over the rights and duties of parties to a contract.instead,this case involves the application of texas common law on insurable interests in the context of an insurance contract to which sims was not a party.section focus on vindicating the intent of contracting parties,and on balancing factors surrounding the negotiation and finalization of their agreement,simply does not resound in this dispute.that is,properly framed,the contracts between and its insurer are only tangentially related to the particular substantive issue before the court,and there is no dispute over the contracting parties obligations.a analysis,even one as ably performed as the district court was,thus seems inapposite.
an alternative approach,that neither party nor the district court considered,is to view sims claim as one involving a tortious act akin to conversion,or the allegedly violating the insurable interest of the property of another.section lists the following contacts to be taken into account in applying principles the place where the injury occurred,the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,the domicile of the parties,and the place where the relationship between the parties was centered.restatement second of conflict of laws.
the parties reside in texas by place of business and the employment relationship was also wholly in texas.the injury and the conduct causing it took place either in texas or georgia or both,depending on whether one considers the injury to be the misappropriation of money,the insuring of a interest,or some other construction of the relevant events.the plurality of factors favor the application of texas law,particularly given that courts evaluate such contacts for their quality,not their and that all of the factors must be considered in the light of.
sims contends that provides the best guidance,as this section applies to claims,which are based neither on contract nor on tort,to recover for unjust enrichment.restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.a.this view appears to be a plausible interpretation of the claim.section,after reiterating the importance of the factors,adds the following factors the place where a relationship between the parties was centered,the place where the enrichment was received,the place where the act conferring the enrichment was done,the domicile of the parties,and the place where a physical thing related to the enrichment was situated during the time of the enrichment.restatement second of conflict of laws.
sims lived in texas and was employed by in texas.the enrichment was conferred and received in either georgia or texas depending on how one characterizes the triggering event,sims death,as well as the flow of death benefits.the thing related to the alleged the crux of the insurable interest if anything sims life,which was also,of course,in texas.if sims claim is for unjust enrichment,or if otherwise applies,then the relevant factors favor texas 
finally,specifies the choice of law analysis in cases involving life insurance contracts,but only those that have been issued to the insured upon his application.restatement second of conflict of laws,cmt.a.although not wholly on point,this provision does offer some guidance.it reads in its entirety 
the validity of a life insurance contract issued to the insured upon his application and the rights created thereby are determined,in the absence of an effective choice of law by the insured in his application,by the local law of the state where the insured was domiciled at the time the policy was applied for,unless,with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in to the transaction and the parties,in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.
restatement second of conflict of laws emphasis added.if sims had taken out the policy,therefore,even if it had been through a georgia trust,its terms would be governed by texas law.we fail to see how the fact that took it out militates against this principle 
in sum,every viable most significant relationship analysis performed in following the forum state choice of law provisions points to the application of texas law to this case.we thus affirm the district court on this issue.
we now apply texas insurable interest doctrine.contends that,even if texas law applies,the district court erred in determining that its coli policy violated the texas insurable interest doctrine.the district court concluded that the policy was void because lacks a sufficient financial interest in the lives of its employees.
for this diversity action,and because the texas supreme court has not ruled on the insurable interest doctrine in the light of a legislative amendments,the district court was required to make an as to how that court would apply substantive state law.erie tompkins.transcontinental gas pipe line transportation ins,cir i t is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can,what the highest court of the state would decide.
motion requesting certification of this and how the texas insurable interest doctrine applies to this the texas supreme court was carried with the present appeal.although the texas supreme court has not recently addressed the insurable interest doctrine,the question is not so complex or opaque as to justify certification.further,this court familiarity with the doctrine,see discussion infra,and the unambiguous line of texas lower court decisions,make certification unnecessary.accordingly,we deny the motion to certify.
as such,we review the district court de novo.williamson elf aquitaine,cir.in this regard,deference can not be given to the rulings by the district court,even though it sits in the state whose law is being applied.id.citing salve regina college russell,d when de novo review is compelled,no form of appellate deference is acceptable.
texas requires a person insuring the life of another to have an insurable interest in the insured person life.empire life ins.of america moody,drane jefferson standard life ins.the state common law insurable interest doctrine deems that it is against the public policy of the state of texas to allow anyone who has no insurable interest to be the owner of a policy of insurance upon the life of a human being.griffin mccoach,cir.consequently,insurance policies procured by those lacking a sufficient interest in the life of the insured are unenforceable.going back to,texas courts have recognized three categories of individuals having an adequate interest close relatives creditors and those having an expectation of financial gain from the insured continued life.drane,at tamez certain underwriters at lloyd,london,stillwagoner travelers ins.
argues that it has a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit in the continued lives of its employees sufficient to bring it within the last of the three categories described in drane.texas courts have held,however,that the state of employment alone does not give an employer an insurable interest.see,stillwagoner,at the mere existence of an relationship is never sufficient to give the employer an insurable interest in the life of the employee.
contends that,in addition to the bare relationship,it possesses an expectation of financial gain from the continued lives of its employees by virtue of the costs associated with the death of an employee,such as productivity losses,hiring and training a replacement,and payment of death benefits.these are costs that are associated with the loss of any employee,however,and,as texas precedent clearly indicates,employers lack an insurable interest in ordinary employees,id.at.indeed,texas courts have recently rejected similar arguments based on the costs flowing from an employee death and,as sims ripostes,does not claim that sims was of any special importance to the company,much less that success or failure was dependent upon the insured employee.stillwagoner,at.
given that courts will uphold the insurable interest doctrine in the absence of contrary legislation,argues that just such legislative pronouncements have expanded the definition of insurable interest after drane.a review of this legislation shows,however,that while the texas legislature has crafted certain addenda to the insurable interest doctrine,none of these modifications are relevant to the present case.
