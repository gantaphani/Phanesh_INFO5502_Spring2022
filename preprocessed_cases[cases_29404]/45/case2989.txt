this appeal tests the validity of an order of the trial court summarily adjudicating,in favor of the insurer,the claim that the insurer was liable for its bad faith adjustment of the insured claim of loss.following the northridge earthquake on january,the appellant,chateau chamberay homeowners association hoa,submitted a claim of loss to its insurer,the respondent,associated international insurance company aiic.when it was finally calculated,hoa claim totaled.
during the investigation process,aiic paid to hoa several interim payments,which together represented the total amount aiic believed was due that amount totaled.a subsequent stipulated arbitration determined that aiic had underpaid the total amount of hoa covered loss and ordered that aiic pay an additional,plus interest thus,hoa total covered loss was determined to be,or approximately of its claimed total loss.
while the amount of hoa covered loss was resolved by arbitration,its claim for bad faith conduct on the part of aiic went forward in the trial court.concluding from the evidence presented that aiic and hoa had a genuine dispute as to what was covered under aiic policy and the proper amount of hoa loss,the trial court determined that aiic could not be found liable in bad faith for its adjustment activities and the resulting delayed payment of hoa claim.based on that determination,it granted aiic motion for the summary adjudication of hoa cause of action for bad faith.as all other issues have now been resolved and a final judgment entered,that ruling may now be reviewed.
the record before us reflects that aiic and hoa did have a genuine dispute as to just what portion of hoa claimed loss was actually covered under the policy and the proper amount of hoa covered loss.in addition,we can find no factual support for the conclusion that aiic acted unreasonably or without proper cause in its adjustment of hoa claim.we thus are able to determine,as a matter of law,that aiic can not be found liable in bad faith.as a result,we conclude that the trial court did not err in summarily adjudicating hoa bad faith claim.we therefore will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
prior to january,aiic had issued a million policy of property insurance including earthquake coverage to hoa covering the common areas of its condominium building at roscomare road in los angeles on that date,the northridge earthquake caused significant damage to hoa building.hoa promptly notified aiic and made a claim of loss.
on or about january,aiic employed an adjuster to assist in the adjustment of hoa loss.it also retained the services of a general contractor and a structural engineer to evaluate the nature and extent of the damage sustained to hoa building.within the following week,site inspections of the property were completed and aiic paid an advance of to hoa on february.
at about the same time,hoa retained a public adjuster and two structural engineers to assist it with the evaluation of its loss.on february,one of its engineers submitted a structural damage report which reflected,in part internally the building seemed to have survived the earthquake with relatively little damage,with the exception of the four units located in the north and south wings of the building fronting the street damages to units on levels a b were negligible.however,the report went on to make repair recommendations that were designed to minimize any further damage which may occur from future seismic activity,the installation of plywood on all exterior walls of the first and second floors.within days to two weeks thereafter,it was reported to aiic that the general contractor retained by hoa was installing shear paneling unnecessary for emergency shoring,but apparently for the purpose of meeting current building codes 
after several more site inspections during the spring of,representatives of the adjusters hired by aiic and hoa agreed that hoa adjuster would submit to aiic a repair scope and estimate which would be used as a basis for attempting to resolve hoa claim.on or about march,aiic discovered that public records reflected that the property had a settlement problem which had existed before the earthquake.in addition,aiic later learned through a review of hoa board meeting minutes that there were other problems,including land erosion,and water intrusion and tile buckling problems.it is aiic position that the impact these circumstances would necessarily have upon the damage sustained by hoa building and the extent of hoa covered loss had to be investigated.
although hoa scope and repair estimate had not yet been provided,aiic advanced another to hoa on may.on june,aiic formally advised hoa adjuster of its position on the scope of coverage under the policy repairs required by new building codes were not covered under the subject policy,asbestos removal was covered only from those areas of the property which were damaged by the earthquake,only consequential damage to the interiors of the units resulting from repairs to the common area were covered,and no coverage existed for the plywood shear panels which were installed after the earthquake absent evidence that they were installed on an emergency basis to stabilize the building 
hoa finally submitted its scope and estimate of repairs on september,which was nine months after the loss.it totaled and included items such as fortification of a defectively constructed foundation,removal of stucco in order to install plywood sheathing,repair of floor vibration problems,repair of water intrusion problems,and repair of the individual units.aiic had significant problems with this estimate and,over the next several months,it had a number of discussions with hoa adjuster.during the same time period,aiic continued site inspections,including inspection of individual units.
on december,despite its reservations about hoa repair estimate,aiic made another advance payment,this time in the amount of.at the time of this payment,there was still no agreement on the scope or cost of covered repairs under the policy,and aiic contended that hoa estimate was grossly overstated.finally,in march,hoa adjuster withdrew the estimate,citing problems with it.
during the spring of,aiic attempted to ascertain the extent of the problems with hoa building.in aiic view,this was critical because problems with the property that the earthquake could not properly be included in the earthquake claim.on or about may,aiic adjuster requested all expert reports and construction repair estimates which the earthquake so that aiic could evaluate these problems.subsequently,on june,the hoa submitted a new repair estimate.this estimate was in the amount of,and it far exceeded aiic evaluation of the covered loss.still included was the cost of items not covered under the policy such as compliance with current building code regulations,repair of damage and construction and design defects,including the improperly constructed foundation,installation of caissons and grading and repair of floor vibrations and repair of the interior of certain individual homeowner units 
based on its investigation and what it believed to be covered under the policy,aiic paid another million on the claim on september,bringing the total payments to hoa,as of that date,to.thereafter,in order to reach an agreement on the balance of hoa claim,which was not disputed,aiic adjuster entered into negotiations with hoa representative.aiic proposed a compromise agreement on the scope and cost of repair of the earthquake damage to the hoa property covered under the policy in the amount of.an effort was then made to negotiate a narrative of what claims would be settled by payment of such amount,and what disputed items would remain open.hoa,however,ultimately refused to agree to a narrative.aiic thereafter nonetheless paid an additional sum of,bringing the total payments made to hoa to.following that payment,aiic took the formal position that there was no more owing under the policy.
hoa responded by filing this action on january,for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.with respect to its bad faith claim,hoa sought punitive damages,arguing that aiic conduct,in delaying the payments that it had made and refusing to pay hoa claim in full,constituted acts committed with malice and oppression.
the basic dispute between aiic and hoa with respect to the latter claim for earthquake damage to its property raised several issues on which the parties could not agree whether hoa claim included losses for which it was not at risk,damage sustained to noncommon areas and thus not covered under the policy,whether hoa claim included sums to perform upgrades required by current building codes but which were not covered under the policy,whether hoa claim included amounts to correct conditions,including construction or design defects,which existed prior to the earthquake and thus were not covered under the policy,whether the amounts claimed by hoa exceeded those reasonably necessary to replace damaged property with comparable material and quality as to that which existed prior to the earthquake and whether the professional fees and costs for emergency repairs exceeded that which were reasonably required.
contending that its position was reasonable and that a genuine dispute existed between it and hoa as to each of these issues,aiic moved for summary adjudication of hoa cause of action for bad faith.hoa opposed this motion primarily with the declaration of its expert witness,keith charleston.hoa offered evidence of no facts other than those summarized above,but relied upon the opinion of charleston to the effect that aiic adjustment and handling of hoa claim was unreasonable and constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith.on april,the trial court,concluding that aiic position with respect to hoa claim was reasonable as a matter of law,granted the motion.the case then went forward on hoa first cause of action for breach of contract.
before that cause of action could come to trial,however,the parties entered into a stipulation on april,that provided hoa claim could be resolved in binding arbitration.such arbitration was conducted and,on july,an award was made in favor of hoa in the sum of,plus interest of for a total award of,less a credit of.thus,hoa original claim of,was substantially rejected by the arbitrator.the sum already paid by aiic,together with the sum of,found by the arbitrator to be due,represents only of the original claim.
after the trial court entered a judgment of confirmation of the arbitrator award,hoa filed this timely appeal asserting that the trial court had erred in granting aiic motion for summary adjudication of the bad faith cause of action.hoa argues that aiic handling of the claim including,from hoa point of view,its inadequate investigation and the delayed and inadequate payment of policy benefits was unreasonable in the circumstances and presented an issue for the jury,not the court.thus,hoa contends,it was improperly denied a jury trial on its second cause of action.hoa further argues that the opinions expressed by its expert,charleston,were sufficient evidence to raise triable issues of fact which could not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment or adjudication.
aiic counters that the essential or underlying facts are not in dispute and its position on coverage under the policy,as well as its estimate of the value of hoa covered losses,was reasonable.it contends that,at the very least,there was a genuine dispute between the parties as to these issues and therefore aiic could not be held liable for the tort of bad faith.

to establish bad faith it must be shown that insurer acted unreasonably or without proper cause

thus,allegations which assert such a claim must show that the conduct of the defendant,whether or not it also constitutes a breach of a consensual contract term,demonstrates a failure or refusal to discharge contractual responsibilities,prompted not by an honest mistake,bad judgment or negligence but rather by a conscious and deliberate act,which unfairly frustrates the agreed common purposes and disappoints the reasonable expectations of the other party thereby depriving that party of the benefits of the agreement.just what conduct will meet these criteria must be determined on a case by case basis and will depend on the contractual purposes and reasonably justified expectations of the parties.careau security pacific business credit,d.accord state farm fire casualty superior court th,d.
