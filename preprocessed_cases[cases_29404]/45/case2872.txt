introduction 
in this case,which involves a dispute regarding the effectiveness of a notice of cancellation of an automobile insurance policy due to nonpayment of premiums,plaintiff timothy brian adams appeals from the summary judgment entered in favor of defendant explorer insurance company.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural 
explorer insurance company explorer issued plaintiff a new personal automobile insurance policy,number,with an effective date of december.the declarations page of the policy reveals that the policy was issued for a period of one year.at its inception,the policy listed three vehicles,a chevrolet camaro,a chevrolet blazer and a chevrolet suburban,to which the coverage afforded by the policy applied.the policy provided coverage for bodily injury,property damage and uninsured motorist bodily injury.it also provided comprehensive and collision coverage.
plaintiff policy premium was to be paid in nine monthly installments.a billing notice dated january,showed that plaintiff first monthly installment was due on january.plaintiff routinely was late in making his payments.
on may,plaintiff camaro was stolen.plaintiff reported the loss to explorer.
by july,explorer had not received plaintiff june installment.on that day,explorer issued plaintiff a notice of cancellation.the notice listed the reason for cancellation as nonpayment of premiums and specified the amount due as.the cancellation was to be effective july,at.the notice also contained an offer to reinstate your policy,without any lapse in coverage,if the amount shown above is mailed to the explorer insurance company and post marked prior to explorer mailed this notice of cancellation to plaintiff on july.plaintiff did not recall seeing the notice of cancellation.
south coast auto insurance mktg.south coast is an authorized insurance broker and agent for explorer.on july,plaintiff,through south coast,submitted an endorsement request asking explorer to add to policy a gmc and a chevrolet suburban and to delete plaintiff chevrolet suburban and chevrolet camaro.above the signature line of the endorsement request,the following printed statement appears i,the undersigned acknowledge and agree that if for any reason my policy is not active,the above endorsement is null and void.in addition,the endorsement being done is subject to acceptance by insurance company ies in accordance with their underwriting guidelines.directly under this printed statement,plaintiff wrote,i have read and understand the above.his signature followed.
the endorsement request form indicates that the endorsement was t elebound on july,at.a payment due date of july,also was listed.
johnny kafieh kafieh was the south coast sales representative who helped plaintiff with his endorsement request.kafieh telephoned an explorer telebind phone number to get a binder number.kafieh was unable to zap the endorsement request through the computer.according to kafieh,e ndorsement requests are not zapable.they have to be processed manually.only new business is zapable from south coast to explorer via the computer.during his meeting with kafieh,plaintiff paid south coast.kafieh could not recall if he told plaintiff that his payment was for an excess policy rather than his endorsement request.kafieh normally would not have given such an explanation.
on july,explorer sent plaintiff a premium recap setting forth a summary of his payments.plaintiff total premium was listed as with an explanation that y our policy change resulted in a premium adjustment of which is included in the total premium amount shown.the document further noted that plaintiff had paid premiums totaling and that his unpaid balance was.the adjustment resulted from the deletion of plaintiff stolen camaro.
an amended declarations page effective june,listed plaintiff chevrolet blazer and chevrolet suburban as the insured vehicles.the amended declaration therefore reflected the deletion of plaintiff stolen camaro.
as of july,explorer had not received plaintiff delinquent payment.in a cancellation memo dated july,explorer advised plaintiff that his automobile insurance policy had been cancelled effective july.the memorandum contained a reinstatement offer that provided,subject to company approval,we may reinstate your policy with a lapse in coverage if payment of is received by.italics added.the listed as due on the cancellation memorandum was less than the reflected as due on the july notice of cancellation.this difference represented a manual adjustment of the premium.stated otherwise,it was a credit for a premium payment plaintiff had made for the camaro before explorer declared it a total loss.
on august,an explorer underwriting assistant received plaintiff july,endorsement request.learning that plaintiff policy had been cancelled,the assistant did not process the request.rather,she made a notation that the changes would have to be processed at a later time if the policy subsequently was reinstated.
in ascertaining the premium amount due,plaintiff always relied on what his mail said.explorer did not receive a payment from plaintiff by the august,deadline specified in the july cancellation memorandum.plaintiff therefore remained uninsured.
on august,plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist.he was driving his gmc at the time.plaintiff sustained property damage and personal injuries as a result of the accident.
on august,one day after plaintiff accident and well after the august deadline for reinstating plaintiff policy with a lapse in coverage,explorer received plaintiff premium payment via money order in the amount of.plaintiff payment arrived in an envelope postmarked august.a postage meter date of august,which had been imprinted with the postage meter at plaintiff workplace,also appeared on the envelope.the money order itself bore the handwritten date.
on august,explorer generated a reinstatement notice,thanking plaintiff for resuming his automobile insurance coverage and reinstating his policy.explorer reinstated plaintiff policy effective august,in accordance with its custom and practice of reinstating coverage one day after the postmark date on the envelope containing the payment required for reinstatement.a declarations page generated upon reinstatement continued to list plaintiff chevrolet blazer and chevrolet suburban as the insured vehicles.it did not reflect the changes made to the policy by virtue of plaintiff july,endorsement request,in that the endorsement request was not processed by explorer until august.
after his accident,plaintiff submitted an insurance claim to explorer under the uninsured motorist provisions of his policy.explorer denied the claim.inasmuch as plaintiff accident occurred after july,when his policy lapsed due to nonpayment of premium,and before august,when it was reinstated,explorer concluded there was no coverage for the accident.
on august,explorer finally processed plaintiff july endorsement request.plaintiff gmc and his suburban had been effectively insured,however,from july,until the policy was cancelled for nonpayment of premium on july.
following the denial of his insurance claim,plaintiff filed this action seeking compensatory and punitive damages against explorer.in a first amended complaint filed on may,plaintiff alleged against explorer causes of action for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,and unfair business practices explorer subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment against plaintiff.the trial court granted the motion on july,ruling as follows when plaintiff added and deleted two vehicles on july,such constituted an endorsement to his existing policy,regardless that the transmittal used the word telebound.plaintiff obviously did not rely on the alleged comments of the agent,as he ultimately sent in as a late premium.the fact that plaintiff can not recall receiving the notice of cancellation does not create a triable issue of material fact.citation.thereafter,judgment in favor of explorer and against plaintiff was entered.this appeal followed.
contentions 
plaintiff contends triable issues of material fact exist with regard to whether explorer july,notice of cancellation was effective and whether a new notice of cancellation should have been issued before coverage for the gmc could be cancelled.
plaintiff also contends that explorer failed to meet its burden of proving that the new coverage for the gmc was cancelled effectively after it was issued.
there is no merit to these contentions.the undisputed evidence discloses that plaintiff had no automobile insurance on the day of his accident.the trial court therefore properly granted explorer motion for summary judgment.

explorer notice of cancellation was effective 
insurance code section,subdivision a,in pertinent part provides that a notice of cancellation of a policy shall be effective only if it is based on one or more of the following reasons nonpayment of premium.section does not apply to any policy or coverage that has been in effect less than days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless it is a renewal policy.subd.b.to be effective,a notice of cancellation issued pursuant to section for nonpayment of premiums must be mailed to the named insured at least days prior to the effective date of the cancellation.
insurance code section provides that n o cancellation of a policy or coverage of insurance subject to this chapter but not subject to section or because it has been in effect less than days shall be effective unless a notice of cancellation subject to sections and,when applicable,but not to any other provision of this chapter,be mailed or delivered by the insurer to the named insured not later than the day following its effective date and at least days prior to the effective date of cancellation.italics added.
plaintiff argues that explorer notice of cancellation could not cancel the coverage for his gmc effectively,in that this vehicle was not added to the policy until july,after the notice of cancellation was issued.stated otherwise,plaintiff argues that his july,endorsement effectively added new coverage for his gmc and suburban and that a new notice of cancellation was required to terminate that specific coverage.plaintiff argument rests upon the faulty premise that his july endorsement added new coverage to his policy.it clearly did not.
as used in insurance code sections,and,the term p olicy means an automobile liability,automobile physical damage,or automobile collision policy,or any combination thereof,delivered or issued for delivery in this state,insuring a single individual or individuals residing in the same household,as named insured,and under which the insured vehicles therein designated are of a particular type,subd.a.the term coverage as it is used in sections and refers to the specific types of coverage delineated in section.automobile liability coverage includes only coverage of bodily injury and property damage liability,medical payments,and uninsured motorists coverage,subd.b.automobile physical damage coverage includes all coverage of loss or damage to an automobile insured under the policy except loss or damage resulting from collision or upset,subd.c.automobile collision coverage includes all coverage of loss or damage to an automobile insured under the policy resulting from collision or upset,subd.d.the term c ancellation means termination of coverage by an insurer other than termination at the request of the insured during a policy period,subd.g.
in this case,the undisputed evidence discloses that explorer issued plaintiff a new automobile insurance policy effective december.from its inception,this policy provided coverage for bodily injury,property damage and uninsured motorist bodily injury.it also provided comprehensive and collision coverage.plaintiff endorsement did not broaden the type of coverage afforded under the policy.it effected only a change in the vehicles to which coverage in existence since the inception of the policy applied.
as of july,plaintiff had failed to pay his june premium installment.on that date,explorer generated a notice of cancellation,specifying nonpayment of premiums as the basis for cancellation.explorer mailed the notice of cancellation to plaintiff on the next day,july.since plaintiff automobile insurance policy and the particular types of coverage afforded thereunder had been in effect for more than days when explorer issued its notice of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums,insurance code sections and,not section,govern the validity of explorer notice of cancellation.moreover,inasmuch as the effective date of the cancellation was listed as july,the notice of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums mailed days earlier was mailed timely and therefore effective under section.
accordingly,plaintiff july,endorsement did not affect the validity or effectiveness of explorer previous notice of cancellation,and a new notice of cancellation was not required.plaintiff cites no legal authority for the proposition that a change made to the policy after the insurer issued the notice of cancellation but before the cancellation becomes effective,which only adds to the policy new vehicles to which existing coverage applies,invalidates an otherwise valid notice of cancellation,advising the insured that the insurer will cancel his or her policy of insurance due to nonpayment of premiums unless the insured makes payment by a specific date.that plaintiff could not recall receiving the notice does not raise a material factual issue as to the validity and effectiveness of the notice of cancellation that explorer sent to plaintiff in a timely fashion.
plaintiff also asserts the notice of cancellation is ineffective for other reasons.plaintiff does not dispute that he was delinquent in paying his premiums when the notice of cancellation was sent.he argues,however,that he owed rather than the reflected in the notice of cancellation.he maintains that since the amount due on the notice of cancellation was incorrect,the notice was ineffective.plaintiff cites no california statutory authority or case law for this proposition,and we are aware of none.authorities are instructive,however.
in mcmillan farm bureau mut.auto.ins,the insured argued that a notice of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums was ineffective because it stated the entire premium was due when only half the premium was due.the court rejected this argument,stating,the notice of cancellation was effective,even though the amount which it specified,as the amount to be paid to nullify the cancellation,was in excess of the amount then due,under the alleged oral agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant agent.the plaintiff was not misled by the notice.he knew that the period covered by his initial payment had expired and that a further payment of premium would be required to avoid a cancellation of the policy.if the plaintiff desired to stand upon his claim of an oral agreement requiring him to pay only on march,he should have advised the company of that claim and should have tendered payment accordingly.the plaintiff not having paid or offered to pay any additional premium in any amount,the notice of cancellation remained in effect.at.
