when an insured who has financed the purchase of an insurance policy through a lender defaults,and the lender notifies the insurer under insurance code section,subdivision d,that it is exercising the insured right to cancel the policy,must the insurer notify additional named insureds of the cancellation in these circumstances,we hold that neither section nor section requires the insurer to provide notice of cancellation to an additional named insured 
procedural and factual background 
gorham company,gorham,appeals from the summary judgment granted in favor of first financial insurance company first financial on gorham first amended.gorham also challenges the denial of its own motion for summary adjudication.the issues in this appeal arise from gorham contention that first financial,the insurer of one of gorham subcontractors on a construction project for which gorham was the general contractor,had a duty to defend gorham when it was sued for construction defects allegedly caused by the subcontractor negligent work.we affirm the judgment.
a.the project 
in january,gorham contracted with the city of los angeles harbor department the city to be the general contractor for the construction of a publicly owned community center.gorham subcontractor on the project was reza ebrahimi dba pdc associates pdc.pdc was insured by first financial,which issued a commercial lines policy to pdc for the policy period september,to september,the pdc policy.the endorsement of the pdc policy made gorham an insured for any liability arising out of pdc work for gorham pdc financed the policy premium through a lender,arizona premium finance,apfc.as part of the financing agreement,pdc assigned its right to cancel the policy to apfc in the event pdc did not pay its premium.on november,on instructions from apfc,first financial cancelled the policy for nonpayment of the premium.gorham did not receive notice of the cancellation.
pdc continued to work on the project until july,when gorham terminated pdc.pdc had not finished its work.in november,gorham terminated its contract with the city,and left the project.the city then replaced gorham with another general contractor,who finished construction.
b.the underlying litigation 
complex litigation involving the city,gorham and pdc ensued the various actions ultimately were deemed related and assigned to a single judge.as here relevant,in march,gorham sued the city for various claims,contending that the city plans were defective.the city then filed a against gorham alleging,among other things,that gorham breached its contract,and that its negligent work caused many defects in construction.gorham then filed a of its own against its subcontractors,including pdc,alleging that the construction defects identified by the city were caused by the subcontractor negligence.
to fund its defense to the city,gorham tendered its defense not only to its own liability carriers,but also to its subcontractors carriers,including first financial,relying on its status as an additional insured under the subcontractors policies.gorham liability carriers,and the carriers for several subcontractors,accepted gorham defense.first financial,however,was not among them.first financial denied the tender on various grounds,including that no property damage covered by the pdc policy had occurred while the policy was active.
ultimately,with the exception of gorham against pdc,the underlying litigation settled.included among the settled claims was the city against gorham.
c.the instant case 
first financial commenced the instant case by filing a complaint for declaratory relief against pdc and gorham.first financial was funding pdc defense to gorham still pending in the underlying litigation.first financial declaratory relief complaint in the instant case sought a declaration that first financial had no duty to defend and indemnify pdc against gorham claims.in a ruling not involved in this appeal,the trial court granted summary judgment for first financial on its declaratory relief complaint.
however,before that ruling,gorham filed a in the instant action against first financial,seeking damages for first financial failure to participate in funding gorham defense to the city in the underlying litigation.gorham operative pleading is its first amended,and it is that pleading which is in issue on this appeal.
gorham first amended alleges that gorham was an additional insured under pdc policy,and that first financial had a duty to defend gorham against the city claims.gorham alleges causes of action for breach of contract on and theories,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and declaratory relief.
first financial motion for summary judgment 
first financial moved for summary judgment on gorham first amended.its motion raised two grounds under the terms of the pdc policy,there was no potential for coverage for damages sought by the city in the underlying litigation and because other insurers defended and indemnified gorham in the underlying litigation,gorham suffered no damage from first financial failure to participate in the defense.
gorham motion for summary adjudication 
gorham moved for summary adjudication on its first amended.however,its notice of motion failed to identify the issues on which summary adjudication was sought.its memorandum of points and authorities identified two issues whether first financial cancellation of the pdc insurance policy was effective as to gorham and whether damage done by pdc invoked coverage under the pdc policy.
f.the trial court ruling 
the trial court granted first financial motion for summary judgment.it concluded that under the language of the pdc policy,first financial had no duty to defend gorham against the city the court therefore did not discuss the second issue raised by first financial gorham suffered any damage.
the court denied gorham motion for summary adjudication because the notice of motion failed to state the issues sought to be adjudicated.in the alternative,the court ruled that the issue of whether the pdc policy was cancelled was not a proper issue for summary adjudication.further,the court observed that the issue of whether first financial had a duty to defend gorham was resolved by the ruling on first financial motion for summary judgment.
on appeal,gorham challenges both the grant of summary judgment,and the denial of summary adjudication.
discussion 
first financial summary judgment motion 
as noted,the trial court granted first financial motion for summary judgment on gorham first amended.all of gorham causes of action depend on the existence of a duty by first financial to defend gorham against the city in the underlying litigation.because gorham is an additional named insured under the pdc policy,first financial duty to defend under that policy extends to gorham if any of the city claims sought damages possibly covered by the pdc policy.see maryland casualty nationwide ins.th,d.
gorham contends,in substance,that the city in the underlying litigation alleged claims that invoked the property damage coverage of the pdc policy.therefore,according to gorham,first financial had a duty to defend gorham against the city claims,and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.
the evidence necessary to determine the existence of such a language of the policy,and the circumstances under which the policy was undisputed we review the grant of summary judgment de novo to determine whether there is a triable issue of material fact.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.we conclude that there is no possibility of coverage under the pdc policy.the policy period ended on november,when the policy was cancelled.any damage caused by pdc work within the scope of the city in the underlying litigation occurred after that date,and was the result of pdc ongoing operations.therefore,the damage was not covered by the pdc policy,and the trial court properly granted summary judgment.
cancellation of the policy under section 
the insuring agreement section of the pdc policy obligates first financial to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies.it also obligates first financial to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.subject to various exclusions,the policy defines property damage to include p hysical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.to be covered,such property damage must occur during the policy period.
setting aside for the moment the precise boundaries of property damage within the meaning of the policy,we first decide whether the policy was effectively canceled on november,thereby ending the policy period.we conclude that it was.
the undisputed evidence shows that pdc financed the purchase of its policy by entering a premium finance agreement,with apfc,an industrial loan company,as part of its premium finance agreement with apfc,pdc assigned its right to cancel the policy to apfc in the event pdc did not pay its premium under the agreement the pdc insurance policy gave pdc,as t he first named insured shown in the declarations,the right to cancel the policy by mailing or delivering to first financial advance written notice of cancellation.
upon pdc failure to make a required installment payment,apfc sent notice of cancellation to first financial,instructing first financial to cancel the policy effective november.the notice stated that apfc was canceling the policy for nonpayment of the premium.as instructed,first financial canceled the policy effective november.neither apfc nor first financial sent notice of cancellation to gorham.
gorham contends that because it received no notice of the cancellation,policy coverage for gorham as an additional named insured did not terminate.section,however,provides otherwise.section governs cancellation of an insurance policy by a lender for nonpayment of the premium.we set forth the provisions relevant to this case in the margin,and discuss them individually as necessary to resolve the issues in this appeal 
subdivision b of section states no lender shall exercise the right to cancel a financed insurance policy because of the default of the insured under a premium payment loan agreement except in accordance with this section.in relevant part,the term exercise the right to cancel is defined by subdivision a of section as the act of formally electing to use the right of the insured to cancel any insurance policy in accordance with and subject to the provisions of that policy,when the right has been assigned in writing to the lender.
when the lender is an industrial loan company,the relevant procedure for cancellation is provided by section,subdivision d.the procedure of subdivision d involves three steps,none of which requires the lender or insurer to give notice of cancellation to additional named insureds such as gorham.
first,subdivision d provides that the industrial loan company shall,in giving the insured days notice of its intent to cancel pursuant to section of the financial code,furnish a copy of such notice to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement,subd.d,italics added.financial code section requires the lender to mail to the insured,to his last known address or to the address shown on the premium finance agreement at least days prior to cancellation,a notice of its intent to cancel the insurance contract or contracts.the insured entitled to such notice is the person who has purchased or arranged to purchase an insurance contract and who enters into a premium finance agreement with a premium finance agency.the term insured does not encompass an additional named insured such as gorham.therefore,the notice required by the first step of section,subdivision d,does not include additional insureds.
second,a fter expiration of the period,the industrial loan company may thereafter,in the name of the insured,cancel the insurance contract or contracts by mailing to the insurer a written notice of cancellation,and the insurance contract shall be cancelled as if the notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured person,but without requiring the return of the insurance contract or contracts,subd.d.thus,the lender notice of cancellation,sent to the insurer,effects a cancellation of the policy in the same manner as if the insured had exercised the right to cancel.
third,t he industrial loan company shall also mail a notice of cancellation,setting forth the effective date of cancellation of the finance insurance contract,to the insured at his or her last known address and to the insurance agent or insurance broker indicated on the premium finance agreement,subd.d,italics added.as we have noted,the insured within the meaning of subdivision d is the person who purchased the policy through the premium finance agreement.the term insured does not include additional named insureds.
thus,section,subdivision d does not require the lender to provide notice of cancellation to an additional named insured.nor does it impose that duty on the insurer.indeed,with limited exceptions listed in subdivision f discussed below,the insurer is relieved of any duty of notification.section,subdivision i provides in relevant part an insurer relying upon written exercise of that right,the lender exercise of the insured right to cancel the policy containing a confirmation of cancellation date shall be relieved from complying with any other duty or form of cancellation required by this code.italics added.therefore,when the insurer terminates the policy after receiving the industrial loan company notice that it is exercising the insured right to cancel,the insurer has no further duty of notification to effect cancellation.
gorham contends that it was entitled to notice from first financial under subdivision f of section.subdivision f states a limited exception requiring the insurer to notify governmental agencies,mortgagees,or other third parties when required by statute,regulation,or contract.subdivision f provides all statutory,regulatory,and contractual restrictions providing that the financed insurance policy may not be canceled unless notice is given to a governmental agency,mortgagee,or other third party shall apply where cancellation is effected under this section.the insurer shall give the prescribed notice on behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency,mortgagee,or other third party on or before the fifth business day after the day it receives a written notice of cancellation from an industrial loan company,pursuant to subdivision d,and shall,for purpose of the notice,determine the effective date of cancellation as to those persons mentioned in this subdivision only,taking into consideration the number of days notice required to complete the cancellation.italics added.
gorham asserts that it is a third party entitled to notice under subdivision f.yet gorham points to no regulatory or contractual restrictions providing that the financed policy may not be cancelled unless gorham receives notice.gorham suggests that there is a statutory restriction that requires notice from the.
section applies only to cancellations pursuant to section,subd.d.for purposes of section and as well,the term c ancellation means termination of coverage by an insurer other than termination at the request of the insured during a policy period,italics added.when such a cancellation by the insurer occurs for nonpayment of the premium,section requires that the insurer provide days written notice to the named insured,subd.b.in kotlar hartford fire ins.th,d,the court construed the term named insured to include additional insureds named in the policy.
contrary to gorham contention,section is inapplicable to cancellation of the pdc policy under section.as noted,section applies only to termination of the policy other than at the insured request.termination of the policy under,however,is treated the same as termination at the request of the insured the lender formally elects to use the insured right to cancel the policy,subd.a the lender gives notice of cancellation to the insurer in the name of the insured,subd.d and the insurer cancels the insurance as if the notice of cancellation had been sub
