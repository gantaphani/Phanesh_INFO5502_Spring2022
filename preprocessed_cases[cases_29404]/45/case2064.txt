on november,a fire destroyed sammy restaurant in lakewood,colorado.in this subrogation case,plaintiff truck insurance exchange claims that a fluorescent light ballast manufactured by defendant magnetek,incorporated,caused the fire,and seeks to recover over million paid out to sammy.the district court jurisdiction was based on diversity between truck,a california corporation,and magnetek,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in tennessee.see.we have jurisdiction on appeal pursuant to.
following the completion of discovery,magnetek moved to exclude certain opinion testimony of truck experts under daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the district court granted magnetek daubert motions in part,finding that the experts conclusions about the cause of the fire were not based on a sufficiently reliable scientific theory.the district court then ruled that without such expert testimony a rational trier of fact could not find for truck,and granted summary judgment in favor of magnetek.
truck appeals both of these decisions and we affirm.
background 
the afternoon of november,crews from the west metro fire protection district responded to a report of smoke coming from sammy restaurant.when firemen arrived at the restaurant they encountered heavy smoke,but no open flames.the firemen could not locate the source of the smoke until the fire broke through the kitchen floor and the ceiling of the storage area below.the fire then quickly spread and destroyed the building.
investigators from the west metro fire protection district and phoenix investigations,a private fire inspection company hired by truck,performed the initial investigation of the fire.they began by sifting through the fire debris to identify burn patterns and other evidence of the fire origin and cause.the investigators concluded that the fire started in the void space between the basement storeroom ceiling and the kitchen floor.
amongst the debris in the basement,the investigators found a fluorescent light fixture that had been mounted to the storeroom ceiling.three investigators,dan pfannenstiel of the west metro fire protection district,and thomas mcadam and george hodge of phoenix investigations,concluded that the light fixture somehow started the fire because there were no other apparent heat sources in the area of the fire origin knowing that fluorescent light fixtures contain a component called a ballast that is designed to control the amount of heat the fixture can generate,the investigators then focused on the ballast as a likely cause of the fire.
after their initial examination,pfannenstiel and mcadam turned the fixture over to hodge of phoenix investigations and joe romig of ponderosa associates,another investigation firm hired by truck,for further analysis.hodge disassembled the fixture and examined the various parts of the ballast in an effort to determine both its manufacturer and whether it had in fact overheated.eventually,these analysts determined that the ballast had been manufactured by magnetek.they also observed oxidation patterns on the fixture and discoloration of the ballast heating coils that suggested the ballast had shorted,causing internal overheating prior to the external fire.
the ballast contained a device called a thermal protector,which is designed to shut off power running through the fixture if the temperature exceeds fahrenheit,well below the approximately generally believed to be the minimum temperature necessary to ignite wood.once the temperature falls sufficiently,the thermal protector restores power.both parties agree that the thermal protector in the ballast from sammy continued to function properly even after the fire.
because they had eliminated any other heat source,truck experts remained convinced that the ballast was the likely cause of the fire.they therefore began to study how the ballast might have started a fire in spite of the functioning thermal protector.
truck experts conducted a series of simulations,at least one of which showed that a shorted exemplar or test ballast of a type similar to that found at sammy reached temperatures of before the thermal protector began to cycle on and off.the test ballast eventually reached stable temperatures over.
though both this peak temperature and the stable temperature are significantly below normal wood ignition temperature,romig proposed to testify that this level of overheating was sufficient to have caused the sammy fire.romig based his conclusion that the shorted ballast could have and,in his opinion,did start the fire on a theory called pyrolysis,which posits that wood can catch fire at temperatures below if it is exposed to such temperatures over a long enough period of time pfannenstiel testimony likewise would have been that in his opinion the ballast caused the fire.his opinion was based not on scientific theory,but on his experience as an investigator and his having eliminated any other possible heat source as a cause.
magnetek,disagreeing that pyrolysis could be relied upon to explain the start of the fire,and further disagreeing that the evidence supported the conclusion that there was no other possible source of the fire,moved to exclude the opinions of both romig and pfannenstiel and for summary judgment.applying daubert and its progeny,the trial court granted these motions to the extent the experts expressed opinions about the actual cause of the fire the end result was that truck had no expert testimony showing that the ballast could have reached temperatures approaching or that wood can catch fire below that temperature.the court then concluded that without any such evidence,truck could not establish causation,an essential element of all its claims,and granted magnetek motion for summary judgment.
discussion 
exclusion of expert testimony 
rule of the federal rules of evidence states 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
the supreme court has laid out a framework for analyzing proffered expert testimony in the daubert trilogy,which consists of daubert,general electric joiner,d,and kumho tire,carmichael,d.
analysis under daubert is intended to ensure that the evidence is both reliable and relevant.see at.in this case,the district court addressed only the first of these requirements,and found that the conclusions of romig and pfannenstiel were not sufficiently reliable.
to determine the reliability of expert testimony,courts assess whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.daubert,at.in daubert,the court listed four factors that,while not an exclusive list of considerations for a trial court,will often be important in making this assessment whether the opinion has been subjected to testing or is susceptible of such testing whether the opinion has been subjected to publication and peer review whether the methodology used has standards controlling its use and known rate of error whether the theory has been accepted in the scientific community.see id.at.
we have summarized the burden of the plaintiff to show the reliability of proffered expert opinions this way 
the plaintiff need not prove that the expert is undisputably correct or that the expert theory is generally accepted in the scientific community.instead,the plaintiff must show that the method employed by the expert in reaching the conclusion is scientifically sound and that the opinion is based on facts which sufficiently satisfy rule reliability requirements.

we review the district court application of daubert to exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.see joiner,at.mitchell,at.the trial court is afforded substantial deference in its application of daubert.see hollander sandoz pharm,cir citing kumho tire,at.therefore we will only disturb the trial court decision if we have a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.united states ortiz,cir 
romig has advanced degrees in physics from oxford university and the university of colorado and has been studying the causes of fires and explosions for over years.there is no question he is qualified to testify as an expert under rule.nor is there any question that his opinion as to the cause of the sammy fire would have been relevant.after reviewing the reliability requirements of the daubert trilogy,however,the district court concluded that the hypothesis for long term,low temperature ignition of wood can not be considered to be a reliable basis for the admission of expert opinion testimony under rule.the court therefore granted magnetek motion to strike as to testimony by romig that the fluorescent light ballast at issue in this case caused the fire which is the basis for the plaintiff claims.
the district court accurately summarized the relevant struck testimony by romig as follows 
romig most crucial opinion in this case is his opinion that heat from the ballast,varying between and degrees fahrenheit,was sufficient to cause one of the furring strips in the ceiling to catch on fire.romig would testify that this long term heating of the ceiling and the furring strips caused the formation of pyrophoric carbon or activated carbon in a furring strip.according to romig,with the formation of pyrophoric carbon,and given otherwise proper conditions,ignition of wood can occur when the wood is exposed to long term heating within the temperature ranges he says the magnetek ballast produced.such carbon is said to and thus may cause a fire.this type of ignition,romig would testify,most likely caused the fire at sammy restaurant.
app.at internal citations to depositions and exhibits omitted.the district court gave two alternative reasons for its decision to exclude this testimony,finding both that the,ignition theory was unreliable,and that it had not been reliably applied to the facts of this case.because we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the testimony was not the product of reliable principles and methods,we need not address whether it was or could be reliably applied see.mitchell,at.
truck introduced three publications to support the pyrolysis theory underpinning romig opinion.as the district court noted,all three do indeed posit that pyrolysis could explain the origin of some fires.the district court was also correct,however,when it found that all three cast doubt on the general scientific acceptance,the methodology,and the adequacy of the experimentation underlying pyrolysis at this time.it was therefore within the district court discretion to reject the theory as insufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert testimony.
the first article discussed,by john dehaan,reviews two studies that concluded that wood heated to temperatures below could,over a period of years or a very long time,degrade into charcoal,which would eventually ignite.the district court,however,found that both studies gave only vague parameters to the conditions required for such an event to occur,and that neither described testing that could have specified those conditions.
the second article,by vytenis babrauskas,is even more dubious as a foundation for pyrolysis the babrauskas article discusses the same materials reviewed by dehaan,and notes an additional study that found that wood exposed for a few years to temperatures between and celsius fahrenheit would char.it also states that other studies have done nothing to disprove the possibility of,ignitions of wood.babrauskas goes on,however,to list a number of things not known about the process,and to state that the question,while unsolved now,can be solved.it may be many decades before it will be solved by sufficiently improving theory.also,the studies showing low temperature charring do not find actual ignition of the charred wood.the article concludes that the phenomenon of,ignition of wood has neither been proven nor successfully disproven at this time.
the final article relied on by truck,by bernard cuzzillo and patrick pagni,is generally supportive of the theory of pyrolysis,and describes one experiment in which an cube of solid wood caught fire after nine days in an oven heated to.the district court noted that cuzzillo and pagni,however,did not cite any testing of wood at temperatures closer to the at issue in this case.furthermore,cuzzillo and pagni themselves highlight unanswered questions about the interaction of important factors such as s ize,shape,temperature and material characteristics,and state that t he time needed to adequately cook wood to the point of uninhibited at different temperatures is not well known.
romig himself underscored the scientific uncertainty about the pyrolytic process.during his deposition he stated that the process depends on a lot of factors,as yet quantitatively unidentified.he later acknowledged that to understand how the furring strips could ignite at low temperatures,y ou would have to have a good theory of pyrophoric carbon and formation and the chemical kinetics of that and there is one,as babrauskas points out.
surveying this evidence,the district court concluded that when considering the temperatures at issue here,the long term,low temperature ignition of wood is an hypothesis which has not been subjected to sufficient testing.without such testing,there are few if any reliable principles about the phenomenon and methods to determine when the phenomenon might occur.the court therefore ruled that the hypothesis could not be considered a reliable basis for the admission of expert testimony under rule.
given the cautionary statements about the reliability and foundation of pyrolysis from the authors of the articles offered by truck and from truck own expert,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion in excluding romig opinion testimony we are faced with a situation similar to that in mitchell,where this court held that the analytical gaps in the experts opinions are too broad for their testimony to endure under the strictures of daubert and rule.mitchell,at.as in mitchell,several of the daubert court factors support the district court decision,including the insufficient testing cited by the district court,as well as a lack of evidence showing how romig opinion could be tested and his theory applicable rate of error,and questions about the theory in the scientific community.see mitchell,at.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion when it ruled that under the daubert trilogy,pyrolysis was not yet a sufficiently reliable scientific theory upon which to base an expert opinion about the cause of the sammy fire.see at.
pfannenstiel 
dan pfannenstiel is an investigator with the west metro fire protection district.he,along with thomas mcadam of phoenix investigations,initially investigated the sammy fire and offered testimony on behalf of truck detailing their findings,as well as expert opinions about the origin and cause of the fire.pfannenstiel and mcadam concluded that the fire started in the void between the basement ceiling and the kitchen floor,and that the light fixture was both located in the area of ignition and was the only potential source of ignition in the area.they further offered their opinions that the ballast was in fact the cause of the fire.the district court struck both pfannenstiel and mcadams opinion testimony about the ballast.
truck has appealed only the district court striking of pfannenstiel testimony.as with romig,pfannenstiel status as an expert and the relevance of his proffered opinion are not in question.the only issue,again,is whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.daubert,at.
in its order,the district court stated that the opinion that the ballast caused the fire was not admissible under rule because pfannenstiel did not have any evidence that
