silvia thomas sued elmwood cemetery and chancey miller,her former employer and supervisor,respectively,for health benefits under the consolidated omnibus reconciliation act cobra.both parties agreed that elmwood falls below the statute application threshold of twenty or more employees,which is codified at b.thomas argued,however,that the doctrine of equitable estoppel should bar the defendants from claiming that they fall below the statutory threshold.the district court granted summary judgment to elmwood and miller,holding as a matter of law that estoppel could not be applied to excuse the failure to meet the numerical threshold.
this case presents two questions in the context of an action under cobra.first,can the doctrine of equitable estoppel bar an employer,who employs fewer than the statute threshold of twenty employees,from defending an action on that basis second,if equitable estoppel can so apply,can thomas satisfy the doctrine requirements in this case 
as we explain more fully below,the supreme court decision last term in arbaugh y h,d,which held that such an application threshold is an element of a claim rather than a jurisdictional bar,renders this an open question in our circuit.there is no principled reason we can see,in arbaugh wake,to set such a threshold apart from other elements of claims,which parties generally may concede,be ordered by a court to admit as in a discovery sanction,or be equitably estopped from contesting.thus,we hold that equitable estoppel may,in appropriate cases,bar an employer from arguing that it does not satisfy a statute numerical application threshold.nevertheless,thomas can not satisfy the estoppel doctrine requirements in this case.her claim can not withstand summary judgment.we affirm the judgment of the district court 
thomas was employed by elmwood cemetery from through january.the parties agree that elmwood consistently employed fewer than twenty people during that period.thomas had health insurance coverage provided by elmwood while she was employed there,although she was not formally notified of that coverage termination until two months after elmwood fired her.that notification took place during a phone call in the first week of march.during that call,her provider informed her that elmwood cemetery had notified them,in a letter signed by miller,to cancel her health insurance coverage,retroactive to january,the date of her termination.
during thomas employment,elmwood offered cobra benefits to another employee,john winn thomas became aware of elmwood provision of those benefits to winn from conversations overheard within the very small office in which she formerly worked.those conversations involved winn failure to pay his cobra premiums on time,which resulted in trouble between miller and elmwood board of directors.
since her termination,thomas has suffered a series of strokes,which she believes were caused by her inability to obtain medical care after her termination.thomas also developed serious cardiac and respiratory problems.due to those maladies,thomas incurred substantial medical expenses,portions of which remain outstanding or were paid using borrowed funds.
thomas filed suit in february against elmwood and miller.she alleged that they had a duty under a,a provision of cobra,to notify her of her right to continue in force without interruption the health insurance that she had been provided as a perquisite of her employment.thomas alleged that the defendants failed to meet that duty.as a consequence,she requested relief in the form of continued health coverage during the litigation,notification of her rights under cobra,per day as a penalty for failure to comply with the statute,and other appropriate remedies.she also sought attorney fees and costs.
the defendants moved for summary judgment without filing an answer.they argued that cobra did not apply to elmwood because,at all times relevant to the litigation,elmwood employed fewer than twenty people cobra applies only to employers with twenty or more employees.see b subsection a shall not apply to any group health plan for any calendar year if all employers maintaining such plan normally employed fewer than twenty employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year.
thomas conceded that elmwood did not employ twenty or more people.nevertheless,she claimed that the defendants offered continuing cobra benefits to a white male employee and denied those benefits to her,a black female.she further claimed that elmwood knowingly engaged in racist and sexist practices.she thus argued 
plaintiff is entitled to the application of an equitable estoppel as to defendants who,by their wholly voluntary conduct in a providing as sic health insurance,a perquisite to all of its employees,which included cobra coverage upon separation and b actually providing cobra coverage to one john winn,apparently because he was a white male after he left elmwood,created a condition suitable for the application of the doctrine to bar them from raising b as a defense.
defendants should be equitably estopped from asserting any rights or defenses which might otherwise be available to them under the small business exemption set forth at usc b against plaintiff herein,who,in good faith relied upon the promises or offers of cobra set forth in the manual,and further relied upon cobra being available to her,should she ever leave elmwood employ,because she knew that winn got cobra when he left.
the district court sought authority from thomas supporting her contention that equitable estoppel should apply in this case,but she provided little other than generic cases discussing the doctrine itself.at the time,our precedent precluded the use of estoppel in the fashion sought by thomas because we had deemed statutory thresholds,such as cobra,to be issues of subject matter jurisdiction.see,douglas baldwin,cir.thus,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment because thomas had not shown that cobra applied to elmwood thomas timely appealed and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.trustees of the.laborers health care fund gibbons,cir.the decision below may be affirmed only if the pleadings,affidavits,and other submissions show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we must draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the.see matsushita indus,zenith radio,d.
the first question for our decision is whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel can,in appropriate cases,bar an employer,concededly not meeting cobra numerical application threshold,from defending an action under that statute on that basis.we hold,in the wake of the supreme court decision in arbaugh,at,that it can.
cobra is an amendment to the employment retirement income security act erisa.see mcdowell,at.we already have held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel can apply in erisa cases when welfare benefits plans,rather than pension plans,are at issue.see armistead vernitron,cir.in armistead,we wrote that erisa authorizes the courts to fashion a body of federal common law to enforce the agreement s that these statutes bring within their jurisdiction.ibid.that body of federal common law includes equitable estoppel.ibid.
despite our application of estoppel in erisa and other cases,we previously have refused to apply the doctrine when the issue was whether that party satisfied a statute numerical threshold.see,douglas,at.our precedent makes clear,however,that the basis for our earlier decisions was a view that requirements were jurisdictional matters rather than elements of claims.id.at citing armbruster quinn,cir the essential question in this case is whether the plaintiffs sic are barred from bringing their claim in federal court by the title vii jurisdictional requirement of fifteen employees.see also mickler nimishillen tuscarawas ry,cir this court has no jurisdiction over plaintiff estoppel claim federal jurisdiction simply can not be conferred by estoppel.thus,when we addressed this question in douglas,our decision was dictated by the maxim that parties can neither consent to federal jurisdiction nor waive a court lack of jurisdiction.douglas,at parties can not create subject matter jurisdiction by contract where none exists,nor can they waive a court lack of subject matter jurisdiction because,quite simply,subject matter jurisdiction can not be created where none exists.citing stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir.
the supreme court effectively overruled douglas jurisdictional holding in arbaugh,at.in cobb contract transport,we recently wrote that several recent supreme court cases have overruled the holding in douglas.most directly on point is arbaugh,in which the supreme court held that title vii requirement is not jurisdictional in nature,cir citing arbaugh,at.eberhart united states,d and kontrick ryan,d we continued,noting that arbaugh expressly overruled armbruster,the title vii decision on which douglas based its holding.ibid.douglas jurisdictional holding no longer binds this court.
the question,then,is whether anything remains of douglas that would bar the application of estoppel here.equitable estoppel often operates to prevent a party from contesting an issue of fact or advancing a particular claim or defense.armistead,at apponi sunshine biscuits,cir.because we previously dealt with such cases on jurisdictional grounds,precedent in our own circuit is sparse on the question of whether,absent a jurisdictional bar,estoppel can apply in these circumstances.
at bottom,though,the issue here is the power of a court to compel a party either to admit,or not to deny,the existence of a particular fact relevant to a claim for relief.here,the factual issue is whether an employer has a certain number of employees.on issues,the power of the federal courts to take such action is well established.for example,federal courts may order as discovery sanctions that certain facts be taken as established or that a party be precluded from supporting or opposing claims or defenses.a court may even enter default judgment or dismissal against a party in that context.see.b.see also taylor medtronics,cir smith chicago sch.reform bd.of,cir in re attorney of united states,cir.
the power to enter default judgment is critical to this inquiry because it conclusively establishes every factual predicate of a claim for relief.harmon csx,cir goldman,antonetti,ferraiuoli,axtmayer hertell medfit int l,st cir defendant argument ignores the maxim that an entry of a default against a defendant establishes the defendant liability.citing brockton savings bank peat,marwick,mitchell,st cir there is no question that,default having been entered,each of plaintiff allegations of fact must be taken as true and each of its claims must be considered established as a matter of law.
in other words,federal courts already possess the power,in certain contexts,to establish conclusively each element of a claim.after the supreme court holding in arbaugh,we must view statutes numerical thresholds in that light they are merely elements of claims.at.many other federal statutes have similar thresholds.see b title vii b ii family and medical leave act a worker adjustment and retraining notification act.we can not accept the general proposition that courts could enter default judgments and compel factual admissions on all elements of claims except an employer number of employees.doing so would separate one element of a claim from another without any statutory or logical reason.arbaugh,at.
equitable estoppel is not materially different,in this context,from discovery sanctions or the entry of a default judgment.discovery sanctions often require the showing of bad faith by the disobedient party.see,regional refuse,inland reclamation,cir.estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked to avoid injustice in particular cases.heckler community health,d.like discovery sanctions,the doctrine often operates to prevent a party who engaged in bad faith conduct from making certain arguments or claims in court.armistead,at affirming district court estoppel of defendant from arguing that plaintiffs could not collect erisa retirement benefits because defendant had made representations promising them such benefits.
certainly,bad faith conduct under the discovery rules necessarily can occur only during the litigation itself,whereas a court considering the estoppel issue could consider conduct that occurred prior to parties resort to the courts.however,it seems to us that such a distinction is of no moment where the question is whether a federal court possesses a particular power.estoppel,like all equitable doctrines,is a flexible doctrine that seeks to balance the equities in particular cases.roche,cir citing alternative.concepts,synopsys,cir.sweeton brown,cir en banc noting that the standard for modifying equitable decrees is flexible and has an ancient lineage in our common law.given the flexible nature of the doctrine,and that we already have held that it applies in erisa cases,see armistead,at,we break little new ground by holding that it applies to a particular element of a cobra claim.
we also acknowledge that our holding might seem at first blush to run counter to cobra text,which says clearly that the statute does not apply to employers with fewer than twenty employees.b.under that reasoning,a court could never compel a defendant to concede an element or admit a fact that a legislature determined was a prerequisite to liability.thus,a party in a negligence case could not acknowledge that he breached his duty of care a party in a fraud case could not acknowledge intentional deceit.we can not accept that logic.courts long have exercised the power to compel admission on elements of claims.under the reasoning of arbaugh,at,cobra requirement is no different.we can see no meaningful distinction between numerical requirements and other elements of claims,such that we could ignore well established equitable principles and procedural rules.
there is an argument that refusing to apply estoppel in these particular cases would better respect the separation between federal and state causes of action that congress has established.grable sons metal prods.darue eng g,d.there are established bodies of law in nearly every state that could cover a situation,like that at issue here,in which an individual allegedly makes a misrepresentation and another supposedly relies to her detriment 
why should we permit estoppel to operate in a cobra case,when the underlying conduct otherwise might be covered by a cause of action we believe that in the limited context of colorable estoppel claims based on misrepresentations about cobra or erisa benefits,there is a danger that state law actions will be preempted.see,ramsey formica,cir.erisa contains an expansive preemption provision,which mandates that erisa preempts any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan governed by erisa.see a ramsey,at.we previously have held that,in certain situations,a may preempt estoppel claims.briscoe fine,cir lion volunteer blind industries,automated group administration,cir davis kentucky finance.retirement plan,cir.
thus,were we to cut off the limited avenue of equitable estoppel,many claims premised on misrepresentation might be simultaneously preempted by erisa and foreclosed by cobra requirement.a recent decision of this court illustrates just how finely the erisa preemption line must be drawn in cases where misrepresentations by employers and the erisa framework intersect.see thurman pfizer,cir.in that case,we drew a distinction between expectation and reliance damages in a claim based on a prospective employer false promise of retirement benefits,which lured the plaintiff away from his former job.id.at.we reasoned that only the former was preempted because it would have required a calculation of benefits under the prospective plan.id.at.the latter would have required a calculation only of what the injured party stock options,wages,and other perquisites he gave up in order to enter the defendant employ.because those claims did not relate to the erisa plan,we held that they survived e
