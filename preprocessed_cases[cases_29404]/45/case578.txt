opinion of the court 
plaintiff scirex scirex,a firm specializing in clinical testing of new drugs for pharmaceutical companies,brought this suit against defendant federal insurance company federal in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,seeking payment under federal blanket employee dishonesty policy,which covered losses caused by scirex employees fraudulent and dishonest acts.although the protocols for the four clinical trials at issue required scirex nurses to observe patients for eight hours and record their observations every thirty minutes,in many cases the nurses sent patients home after as little as an hour,yet they recorded and submitted observations allegedly covering the full eight hours.their misrepresentations made it impossible for supervisors to discover the breaches of protocol until a former employee tipped them to the practice,at which advanced point the four studies were unfit for food and drug administration review,and therefore were worthless.
scirex replicated the studies,which cost a combined million,at no charge to the sponsors.federal,however,refused to cover scirex losses.it defended on the ground that the nurses actions were not dishonest because they had acted on their belief that strict adherence to protocol was unnecessary,and that while their actions might have been negligent,dishonesty implies a cognizance of one wrongdoing that they did not possess.federal also maintained that even if the nurses actions were dishonest,its policy covered only direct losses,and scirex losses more strongly resembled ordinary business expenses from failed ventures than losses,such as false claims of working overtime,due directly to employee dishonesty.finally,federal contended that even if it were liable for scirex losses,it would be liable only in the amount of,the policy limit for one occurrence,because the losses across the four ruined studies were related.
following a bench trial,the district court held that scirex could not recover against federal because dishonesty implies a culpable intent,and the nurses stubborn belief that the drug companies were imposing unnecessary requirements did not equate to dishonesty.scirex fed.ins,wl,dist.lexis.it therefore denied scirex claim,but noted in dicta that,were the nurses actions to be found dishonest,the losses they caused would be direct,and therefore federal policy would cover them.id.wl at,at.it also opined that,at all events,the policy would limit federal liability to,the ceiling for one occurrence.id.wl at,at.
because we conclude that the nurses actions were dishonest,as well as negligent,we hold that they are covered by federal policy,and we reverse the district court holding to the contrary.we are satisfied that,whatever may be said of the decision to send patients home early in violation of protocol,the nurses practice of submitting records containing observations they did not make is ineluctably and irrefutably dishonest.however,we agree with the district court that the nurses actions directly caused scirex losses.pennsylvania law equates direct cause with proximate cause,jefferson bank progressive casualty ins,cir,and the nurses conduct rendered those studies worthless to their sponsors,and therefore worthless to scirex.finally,although we believe that federal policy covers scirex losses,we agree with the district court that federal liability is limited to for the four studies.
background facts and procedural history 
in and,scirex conducted four clinical studies for three different sponsors.each tested a pain medication for patients who had undergone dental surgery,and each had a protocol,written by the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the study,which specified in great detail the procedures to be followed in that study.the four protocols required patients to remain under the observation of scirex nurses,at scirex clinic,for at least eight hours after being given the first medication dose.because the effects of pain medication to some extent vary by individual,the pharmaceutical companies anticipated that there would be a certain number of test subjects for whom the medication would be ineffective,and for these subjects,the protocols mandated providing supplemental pain medication.subjects who received such supplemental medication were termed rescued,while those who took only the drug being studied were termed unrescued.
although the protocols provided for rescuing certain subjects,they did not provide for treating those subjects otherwise differently specifically,they stated that s ubjects are required to remain at the study facility for the entire postdosing observation period,even if the supplemental analgesic medication is taken.johnson protocol.during one of the four studies,however,algos,the study sponsor,told scirex that rescued patients did not have to remain in the clinic for the full eight hours.that excepting instruction applied only to algos study,and even then,only to rescued subjects.the other three studies were to proceed strictly according to protocol.
during the course of a subject stay,the protocols required scirex nurses to observe the subject and record their observations.the records had to be timely,accurate and complete,because they were what the fda evaluated t imely,accurate,and complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical trials is crucial for the production of subjects,investigators,and the sponsor,and is mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide.johnson protocol.nurse mary ellen conforto,a scirex supervisor and tenured employee,testified that she understood the need for the records to be accurate,and agreed that if a patient were released early,the records should have reflected the change.she explained,however,that it was common for nurses to fill out a patient record ahead of time,in order to cut down on paperwork at the end of the day,and that the nurses in doing this would predict and record in advance the time that a patient would leave if he or she remained for the required eight hours.still,she acknowledged that if a patient whose record had been so prepared then left earlier than anticipated,an addendum to that patient record should have been prepared and submitted.
despite these understandings,over the course of the four studies,at various times scirex nurses released both rescued and unrescued patients early,that is,before eight hours had passed,but they submitted records for those patients that made it appear that the nurses had followed the protocols and observed them for the full eight hours.these discrepancies were discovered when scirex received a tip from an,following which it conducted an audit of test subjects that involved calling them and asking what time they were discharged.the audit showed that unrescued patients were often released early,sometimes after as little as one hour.one of the audits reported that a ll of the unrescued subjects stated they were discharged from the unit before the completion of the period,indicating periods of to hours.however,in all cases the nurses notes indicated the subjects were discharged after hours.compliance audit report,algos protocol.as the fda clinical testing requirements are exacting and inflexible,the discrepancies between the actual release times and the recorded release times rendered the four studies worthless,and scirex had to make financial amends to the pharmaceutical companies.indeed,scirex performed each study again without charge to its sponsor.
at the time of these events,scirex had an insurance policy with federal that had a limit of and covered direct loss caused by any fraudulent or dishonest acts committed by its employees.it provided that 
the most we will pay for any loss under blanket employee dishonesty for any loss caused by any employee whether acting alone or in collusion with others,either resulting from a single act or any number of acts,regardless of when those acts occurred during the period of this insurance or prior insurance,is the amount of loss,not to exceed the limit of insurance for blanket employee dishonesty shown in the declarations.
policy at,limits of insurance.a separate provision limited liability for multiple related acts,stating that a ll losses resulting from an actual or attempted fraudulent or dishonest act or series of related acts at the premises whether committed by one or more persons will be deemed to be one occurrence or event.policy at.
scirex submitted a claim to federal under this policy,contending that the actions of the nurses in sending patients home early,and submitting data sheets that falsely indicated that the patients had remained for the required eight hours,were fraudulent or dishonest and were therefore covered under the policy.it ultimately sought compensation for the loss of its investment in the four studies,an amount that included employee salaries,facility rentals,and other expenses.it claimed on the johnson study,on the forest labs study,and a combined on the two algos studies,for a total of approximately million.
in response to scirex claim,federal claim adjuster,patricia duffy,testified that for the purposes of the discussion with the insured,i accepted the fact that what they were presenting to me seemed to be seemed to be a dishonest act.duffy dep.at.she therefore requested that the claim be paid at policy limits.upon receiving duffy request,however,an attorney at federal home office questioned whether scirex loss had been direct.the policy does not define direct or direct loss,and eventually federal denied the claim,finding that scirex losses were more akin to ordinary expenses from a failed business venture than losses,such as overtime,caused by employee dishonesty.it also asserted that even if there had been a direct loss,scirex would have been entitled only to one policy limit of,rather than four,because the four ruined studies constituted only a single occurrence or event.scirex subsequently filed suit for the losses it incurred,up to the limit of,on each study.
at trial,federal asserted for the first time that the nurses actions had not been fraudulent or dishonest.the district court agreed,based on its finding that the scirex nurses did not believe their conduct to be wrongful.the court reasoned that the words fraudulent and dishonest both focus on the intent of the actor,and connote intentional conduct by the actor as wrongful,scirex,wl at,dist.lexis at,but the nurses acted on their stubborn belief that they were right and that the drug companies were imposing unreasonable and unnecessary requirements.id.wl at,at.it reasoned that they gained no personal benefit from their actions,although it acknowledged that by sending patients home early,they might have gained a slight reduction in paperwork,yielding an earlier end to their workday.id.wl at,at.in summary,the court found that while the nurses actions might have been,they did not believe they were being duplicitous or dishonest,and therefore their actions were not dishonest within the meaning of the policy.it accordingly found against scirex.the district court also stated that,although the nurses actions ruined four studies,the losses all stemmed from a series of related acts,and therefore only would be recoverable if coverage were found to exist.id.wl at,at.
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.although the district court made certain fact findings which would be subject to deferential review,primarily at issue on appeal are the district court legal conclusions that federal insurance policy does not cover the scirex nurses acts,and that if it does cover those acts,scirex is entitled to only one payout for the four studies,over which we exercise plenary review.
ii.discussion 
does federal policy cover the nurses acts.were the nurses acts dishonest 
federal policy covers fraudulent or dishonest acts.we will assume that the nurses did not commit fraud in ordering patients early discharge and failing to record those discharges accurately aside from a very slight reduction in their workload,they did not benefit from their questionable conduct.the district court noted this lack of fraud,but also found no dishonesty because the word dishonest focus es upon the intent of the actor,and connote s intentional conduct perceived by the actor as wrongful.scirex,wl at,dist.lexis at.the evidence as a whole makes clear that conforto and the other nurses honestly believed that they were substantially complying with the requirements of the protocols.in their view there was no real need to keep the patients at the clinic when they wanted to go home early.id.wl at,at.dishonesty,the court concluded,must mean something more than an error in judgment.
in its brief,federal enthusiastically endorses this view.if the evidence supports the notion that the nurses honestly believed they were substantially complying with the protocols requirements,it asks,how can their acts be fairly termed dishonest federal points to many cases where courts have held that willfulness and an intent to deceive must be present in order for an employee actions to be dishonest.rock island bank.aetna cas.sur,cir see also jellico grocery sun indem,finding no dishonesty where an employee violated express instructions not to extend credit to a certain customer,to the employer detriment,because there was no showing of intent couch on insurance stating that mere irregularities,mistakes,negligence,errors in judgment or incompetence,committed without intent to deceive,do not constitute fraud or dishonesty 
federal relies most heavily on universal credit united states guarantee.in that case,an insurer contracted to indemnify an employer for all direct pecuniary losses sustained by any act or acts of fraud,dishonesty,larceny,embezzlement,forgery or wrongful extraction committed by any of its employees.id.
in order to ascertain whether any of the employer vehicles had been sold without repayment of the amount loaned,an employee,gregory,was charged with the duty of checking the cars at the dealer place of business.he recorded the results of his inspection on a report that contained the printed statement i have personally seen and checked the auto numbers on the cars listed above,and certify that the information given is correct.in reality,gregory had relied on the dealer for his information and had not personally checked to see whether particular cars were on hand.as a result,the dealer doublesold some cars and thereby suffered a loss.id.
the pennsylvania supreme court said,i t seems too clear to require citation of authority to support it that negligence is not fraud,and acts resulting from mistake of judgment are not acts of fraud or dishonesty any more than acts done negligently,id.at,and it found no insurance coverage.notably,however,the fidelity bond in universal credit covered only acts done for the purpose of harm or with a view to personal profit,id.at,qualifying language that does not exist in federal bond with scirex.
moreover,many cases expressly hold motive and intent irrelevant to the concept of dishonesty.in national newark and essex bank american ins,a bank manager made records that misstated the value of securities pledged as collateral for loans.when the borrower defaulted and the bank learned that the loans were inadequately secured,the bank filed a claim under a bond covering losses resulting from dishonest or fraudulent acts of employees.at the same time,however,the bank informed the insurer that there was no evidence of any defalcation,mysterious disappearance,kiting operation or other purported criminal act.id.at.the insurer denied the claim based on this concession,on the grounds that the employee acts were not dishonest or fraudulent.the new jersey supreme court held that the employee acts of misrepresenting or failing to disclose important facts concerning the loans were dishonest,and noted that,in a fidelity bond,the words dishonest and fraudulent extend beyond criminal acts and are to be given a broad signification and taken most strongly against the surety company.id.at.it concluded that those words encompass any acts which show a want of integrity or a breach of trust.id.
