after a flood occurred in the warehouse of a business that purchased and resold electronic parts,a dispute arose between the business and its insurer.the insured sued,alleging express breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith.the insurer moved for summary judgment.without holding a daubert hearing the district court excluded the insured expert witnesses and granted summary judgment to the insurer,finding insufficient evidence that the flood caused damage to the insured inventory.because the district court abused its discretion by not allowing a jury to resolve contested but otherwise admissible expert testimony,we reverse and remand for trial.
pyramid technologies,pyramid purchased an insurance policy the policy from hartford casualty insurance company hartford.the policy provides coverage limits of million for building replacement costs,million for business personal property replacement costs,and million for lost business income and additional expenses due to the interruption of business operations.to trigger coverage for building or business personal property replacement costs,the policy requires damage to property or its direct physical loss.
pyramid purchased and resold electronic parts,many of which were or not.it did not test the inventory unless required to do so by a customer or prospective customer.pyramid stored its inventory on shelves in a warehouse that did not have air conditioning or humidity control.pyramid had approximately million items in its warehouse at the time of the flood.
in the morning hours of august,pyramid employees arrived at work to find the warehouse and certain other building locations flooded with one to two inches of water.although the flood water did not reach the shelves on which inventory items were located,several employees saw visible condensation on packages in the lower three to four shelves.servpro,a professional cleanup company,performed cleanup operations from august through august.
after discovering the flood,pyramid was concerned about the humidity level in the warehouse and the condensation found on its packages.pyramid asked hartford to test the inventory.hartford expert,peter helms from belfor usa technical services,visited the site after cleanup and,relying on humidity tests conducted after most of the water had been removed and drying equipment had been in place for more than hours,determined that the humidity did not reach a level that could have caused damage to any of the inventory.hartford refused to test the inventory,which would have cost more than million to test every item.hartford based its decision largely on helms conclusion that the inventory was not damaged by the flood.
while hartford was visiting the site after the flood,a potential pyramid customer,wms gaming,wms,was conducting a quality control site visit before approving pyramid as a parts supplier.the hartford representative told this potential customer that the water intrusion was no big deal and that hartford would not test the parts.the customer replied that the flood was a big deal to wms.shortly thereafter,wms declined to approve pyramid as a parts supplier.
one month after the flood,pyramid hired allied public adjusters,to assist in pursuing an insurance claim.pyramid also hired its own expert,david spiegel,to determine what the humidity levels were at the time of the water intrusion.spiegel opined that the humidity level in the warehouse rose to more than and that the conditions caused by the flood exceeded the protection levels of the packaging.during routine inventory checks after the flood,pyramid employees quarantined more than items,looking for visible signs of corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration.in august,hartford finally agreed to conduct limited testing of a small subset of parts identified by pyramid as being damaged.
hartford retained arum kumar of seal laboratories to conduct tests on items out of pyramid inventory.these parts were selected by pyramid as exhibiting signs of water damage.kumar determined that of those items exhibited corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration.kumar conducted additional tests on those items.he found that two parts failed the additional testing,and they were deemed unsuitable for commercial applications.kumar stated that corrosion,tarnish,and discoloration are always caused by moisture,but he concluded that the august,flood was not the cause of the corrosion damage to the parts he examined.
pyramid hired two additional experts,del mortenson and ken pytlewski,to evaluate the validity of kumar report.mortenson questioned kumar opinion on the grounds that kumar used military standards of suitability instead of commercial standards.pytlewski challenged other opinions of kumar,including his opinions that any corrosion caused by the flood would necessarily have been uniform and that visible corrosion is not a failure criteria under military standards.pytlewski also noted the internal inconsistency in kumar report between his statement that the cause of the corrosion can not be determined and his conclusion that the flood was not the cause of any damage.pytlewski testified at a deposition that in his opinion,some of the corrosion to pyramid inventory occurred as a result of the high humidity caused by the august,flood.
by may,approximately million of pyramid million parts in inventory at the time of the flood had been sold,and approximately million parts remained in pyramid inventory.in october,pyramid sold most of its remaining inventory at a distress sale price of.
procedural background 
pyramid filed this civil action in california state court.hartford removed the lawsuit to federal court.on march,hartford moved for summary judgment.in opposition to hartford motion,pyramid offered the expert reports of spiegel,mortenson,and pytlewski,among other evidence.in reply to pyramid opposition,hartford argued that the expert reports of spiegel,mortenson,and pytlewski,and much of the testimony of tony mavusi,the president of pyramid,was inadmissible.the district court did not hold a daubert hearing.
the district court also did not hold oral argument on hartford motion for summary judgment.instead,on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hartford,sustained many of hartford objections to the testimony of mavusi,and excluded the expert reports of spiegel,mortenson,and pytlewski.the district court excluded the reports of mortenson and pytlewski as being illegible,and the court excluded the spiegel report on the grounds that spiegel was not a qualified expert and that his report was not based on sufficient facts or data and was not the product of reliable principles and methods.
pyramid moved for reconsideration and submitted enlarged and more legible versions of the mortenson and pytlewski reports.the district court accepted the enlarged reports as sufficiently readable,but then excluded them as unreliable and not based on sufficient facts or data.the district court also concluded that even if these reports were admissible,they fail to raise a genuine dispute of material fact because they do not sufficiently address causation.the district court denied pyramid motion for reconsideration.

rule of the federal rules of evidence provides that expert opinion evidence is admissible if the witness is sufficiently qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education the scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods and the expert has reliably applied the relevant principles and methods to the facts of the case.

like the test for admissibility in general,the test of reliability is also flexible.estate of barabin astenjohnson,cir en banc.to determine reliability,the supreme court has suggested several factors whether a theory or technique can be tested whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication the known or potential error rate of the theory or technique and whether the theory or technique enjoys general acceptance within the relevant scientific community.id.quoting united states hankey,cir see also primiano,at.these factors are meant to be helpful,not definitive,and the trial court has discretion to decide how to test an expert reliability as well as whether the testimony is reliable,based on the particular circumstances of the particular case.primiano,at citations and quotation marks omitted see also barabin,at.the test is not the correctness of the expert conclusions but the soundness of his methodology,and when an expert meets the threshold established by rule,the expert may testify and the fact finder decides how much weight to give that testimony.primiano,at.
after an expert establishes admissibility to the judge satisfaction,challenges that go to the weight of the evidence are within the province of a fact finder,not a trial court judge.a district court should not make credibility determinations that are reserved for the jury.
spiegel is a certified restorer with the national institute of disaster restoration.he is also a certified master restorer and water,fire and odor control journeyman with the institute of inspection,cleaning,and restoration indoor environmentalist and mold remediator with the indoor air quality association and level i thermographer with the infrared training center.spiegel is also a general and specialty licensed contractor with the state of california and has years of experience in property damage repair and more than years of experience in construction defect investigation.
in two conclusory sentences and without analysis or explanation,the district court held that spiegel was not a qualified expert on the scientific,technical,or specialized data on which he purports to opine and that his opinion regarding relative humidity was not based on sufficient facts or data and was not the product of reliable principles and methods.the district court abused its discretion in reaching these conclusions.
spiegel used weather data from the time of the incident,and infrared data,and ambient condition data to opine on the level of humidity in the warehouse at the time of the flood.as noted,spiegel is a certified thermographer,certified indoor environmentalist,certified master restorer,certified water control journeyman,and certified mold remediator,with decades of experience.this expertise and experience is relevant to the issues on which spiegel opined.because the district court provided no explanation or analysis for rejecting these qualifications,the district court abused its discretion in summarily determining that spiegel was not qualified as an expert.see barabin,at holding the district court failed to assume its role as gatekeeper when it excluded expert testimony for dubious credentials without conducting a daubert hearing or assessing expert findings.spiegel many relevant certifications and decades of relevant experience render him qualified to issue his expert opinion.
in addition,in preparing his report spiegel conducted two site visits to pyramid warehouse,interviewed several pyramid employees who saw the water intrusion and its immediate aftermath,reviewed servpro ambient condition measurements,and recorded his own ambient data during his visits,including data from a visit designed to compare the difference in indoor and outdoor conditions when the warehouse was closed and locked as it was during the flood.spiegel also took digital photographs and electronic readings,performed infrared imaging,reviewed to determine the weather conditions at a nearby airport at the time of the flood,and reviewed the helms report.these facts and data constitute a sufficient basis for spiegel expert report.
although not discussed by the district court,spiegel relies on more facts and data in reaching his expert conclusions than did hartford expert witness.hartford expert helms spent approximately two hours conducting a visual inspection of the warehouse but did not take any measurements,thermographic readings,infrared images,or other data.although helms contacted servpro for its readings,helms did not learn the locations from which servpro obtained its readings,what servpro did to get its readings,or what kind of detection machine servpro used.the day after his site visit,helms completed his report and concluded that based on the humidity levels measured by servpro,no damage occurred to the components in question.
spiegel also adequately explained his methodology in reaching his opinion.spiegel described how the data he collected and reviewed helped him determine the conditions of the warehouse at the time of the event and at the time of servpro measurements which were relied on by helms to determine that no damage from humidity could have occurred.unlike helms,however,spiegel took into consideration the fact that the warehouse doors were closed and locked during the flood but open during servpro measurements,and spiegel calculated and considered the difference between the indoor and outdoor conditions during his visit.spiegel applied that difference to the weather data at the nearby airport on the night of the incident to extrapolate the indoor conditions on the night of the flood.spiegel also used the infrared temperature readings of the packages on the shelves in comparison to the air temperature taken during his visit to determine the likely temperature of the packages on the night of the incident.
the record shows that the knowledge underlying spiegel report has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline,rendering his report reliable.primiano,at citation and quotation marks omitted.the record also shows that spiegel reliance on the nearby airport weather information from is acceptable in the industry,for helms testified that he relied on the same data.spiegel also explained how he applied the data to reach his conclusions and how helms failed to rely on proper data to reach his conclusion.in short,spiegel principles and methods were reliable and his report is not one of the unreliable nonsense opinions that should be screened from use.alaska rent a car,at.thus,the district court abused its discretion in excluding this evidence.
excluding the spiegel report was both erroneous and prejudicial.spiegel expert report provides evidence that the helms report relied on improper data to conclude that no damage was caused by humidity following the flood during the flood,the humidity exceeded and was above the dew point the applicable standards for packaging require a shelf life and humidity below to prevent failure the vast majority of the parts stored in packaging was well beyond the warranty protection and the conditions during the flood without question put the affected packages outside the packing standards.thus,as spiegel opines,the humidity and condensation caused by the flood may have compromised the packaging and possibly the components themselves.this is admissible evidence from which causation and damage reasonably may be inferred.although spiegel did not say with certainty that the humidity from the flood caused damage to pyramid inventory,a jury could reasonably infer causation from spiegel report and pyramid other evidence.it is not necessary for spiegel report to establish every element of pyramid claim in order for it to be admissible in evidence.see primiano,at reliable expert testimony need only be relevant,and need not establish every element that the plaintiff must prove,in order to be admissible.citation omitted.
if spiegel report had been admitted,the district court would have been required to view it in the light most favorable to pyramid when considering hartford motion for summary judgment.because the report could assist a trier of fact in inferring that the flood caused sufficiently high humidity to damage pyramid parts and that helms contrary conclusion was not reliable,the exclusion of spiegel report is prejudicial to pyramid.see messick novartis pharm,wl,at cir,reversing grant of summary judgment where expert testimony,which would have created a genuine issue of material fact,was excluded because it was erroneously deemed unreliable and irrelevant.
the district court also excluded the pytlewski report under rule,stating that it was not the product of reliable principles and methods,and under rule stating that the report does not explain how the opinions are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness.because pytlewski was proffered as an expert witness,however,only rule applies.
pytlewski was retained to review and comment on the report prepared by hartford expert kumar of seal laboratories.the district court appears to have accepted pytlewski as a qualified expert,excluding his report solely based on reliability.the district court concluded that pytlewski report was not the product of reliable principles and methods.
an expert opinion is reliable if the knowledge underlying it has a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of the relevant discipline.alaska rent a car,at quoting primiano,at.pytlewski opinions are based on his knowledge and experience as a professional engineer and metallurgist.for example,pytlewski countered kumar statement that the damage to pyramid inventory could not have been caused by the flood because the corrosion was not uniform by explaining that metal exposed to moisture would not oxidize uniformly.this opinion is within the knowledge and experience of a metallurgist.see,stilwell smith nephew,cir holding admissible metallurgist expert testimony that nails were poorly manufactured and could have been designed to last longer white ford motor,cir opinion amended on denial of reh g,cir describing metallurgist testimony that was well within his metallurgical expertise when he identified wear on the ratchet wheel of the brake that showed repeated engagement rather than the proper engagement see also.trials describing common use of expert metallurgists to describe,among other things,causes and effects of corrosion.the reliability test is flexible and should be applied based on the circumstances of the case.given the subject matter and type of opinions that pytlewski rendered and his knowledge and experience,pytlewski opinion is reliable.see messick,wl,at.
the exclusion of pytlewski report is prejudicial because his report provides evidence from which a fact finder could disregard the opinion of kumar and reasonably infer damages and causation relating to the flood.further,pytlewski deposition testimony links the flood as at least a partial cause of the damage to pyramid inventory.thus,the district court abused its discretion in excluding pytlewski expert report and testimony.
the district court also excluded the mortenson report under rule,stating it was not reliable,and under rule stating it was not based on facts or data known to mortenson.mortenson opined that it was improper for hartford expert kumar to use military standards of suitability instead of commercial standards in testing the selected parts from pyramid inventory.mortenson testified at deposition,however,that he did not know what standards should have been used and that he is not aware of the governing commercial standards because that is not his field of expertise.thus,mortenson testimony that kumar should not have used military standards and should have used commercial standards was not based on facts or data known to mortenson and is inadmissible under rule.additionally,mortenson testimony is not reliable because he did not have the knowledge or experience required under rule to permit him to give expert testimony in this matter.the exclusion of mortenson report by the district court was not an abuse of discretion.see kumho tire carmichael,holding trial court did not abuse its discretion to exclude expert testimony on grounds that expert methodology in analyzing relevant data was unreliable,even though the expert was qualified,where there was no evidence that other experts in the industry used the expert particular approach.
grant of summary judgment against pyramid claims 
in its complaint,pyramid alleges that hartford breached its insurance contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing properly to investigate and then improperly denying pyramid claim for an alleged loss of inventory,including refusing to test the inventory failing properly to respond to the building restoration claim,including making a estimate for damage that was of the value ultimately paid by hartford and unreasonably delaying final payment on the restoration claim and refusing to pay for an alleged business interruption.pyramid appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of hartford and against both of pyramid claims.

pyramid claim of loss of inventory 
pyramid argues that hartford breached the insurance contract by both failing properly to investigate and denying pyramid claim under the policy for loss of inventory.under the policy,the burden is on pyramid to initiate and support its claim.see euclid homeowners ass state farm ins.cas,d.to succeed on its breach of contract claim,pyramid must establish a contract,pyramid performance or excuse for nonperformance,hartford breach,and resulting damages to pyramid.abdelhamid fire ins,d.the disputed issues in this case are whether pyramid suffered damage to any of its inventory and,if so,whether that damage was caused by the flood.
it is undisputed that at least some of pyramid inventory had visible corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration.hartford expert kumar identified visible corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration on more than of the items he tested.pyramid quarantined more than items as showing visible signs of corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration.kumar testified that corrosion constituted actual physical damage.thus,at least some of pyramid inventory had actual,physical damage.when there is actual,physical damage,then the diminution of market value may be a proper measure of damages.see state farm fire cas.superior court,diminution of value is not a cause of a loss but a measure of damages.
the parties dispute whether visible corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration of a part is sufficient to constitute a failure under military standards of suitability.kumar determined that only two out of the parts failed under that standard,whereas pytlewski noted that under the department of defense test method standards of microcircuits visible corrosion is included as a failure criterion.whether visible corrosion constitutes a failure of a part under military standards is a factual dispute for the jury to resolve.
in addition,and even more importantly,regardless of this dispute over whether visible corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration constitutes a failure under military standards,two of the parts percent actually tested by kumar failed,even under kumar standards.extrapolating this failure percentage to million parts is evidence of at least some failure approximately parts.there is also evidence in the record that some customers returned a few parts because of corrosion.the failure of some parts and the return of other parts are evidence from which a jury reasonably could infer that pyramid was harmed by the presence of corrosion on at least some of its inventory.
additionally,if the inventory items were damaged by the flood,which hartford admits was a covered event,the inability to sell the items due to the physical damage,regardless of whether those items would fail a department of defense test under military standards,would constitute a covered loss.see,mri healthcare ctr.of glendale,state farm ins,d,in modern insurance policies,physical loss or damage is typically the trigger for coverage.clearly,this threshold is met when an item of tangible property has been physically altered by perils such as fire or water.citation omitted see also allstate ins.smith,cir describing an easy to imagine situation where a leaky roof could lead to water damage to someone property.presumably,water damage would be an ensuing loss covered by the policy but repairing the roof would not be covered.meridian textiles,indem.ins.of,no.cv cas,wl at,yarn that was,had a tangible change such as odor,mold or mildew,or had a detectable change such that the yarn was likely to develop odor,mold or mildew and was,therefore,unable to be sold,is a covered loss columbiaknit,affiliated fm ins,no.civ.hu,wl at,fabric with mold,odor,or with increased microbial counts that will develop mold or odor and unable to be sold,is a covered loss.drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of pyramid,a reasonable fact finder could find that some of the inventory items had damage that diminished their market value.that diminution in market value is a recoverable measure of damages.see state farm.at.
because there are at least some parts that have actual physical damage and some parts that failed testing or were returned by customers,there is evidence from which a jury could determine that pyramid suffered harm to its inventory.the fact that some,but not all,of the inventory was damaged does not support the granting of summary judgment against pyramid loss of inventory claim.determining the amount of harm suffered is for the jury.
hartford argues that pyramid failed to produce any evidence that the components corrosion,tarnish,or discoloration was caused by the flood of august,as opposed to the age of the parts,the lack of climate control in the warehouse,or other potential causes.because california provides the substantive law in this case,we follow california law on causation in an insurance coverage claim.
under california law,the efficient proximate cause doctrine is the preferred method for resolving first party insurance disputes involving losses caused by multiple risks or perils,at least one of which is covered by insurance and one of which is not.julian hartford underwriters ins,cal citations omitted see also brown mid century ins.d,noting that the efficient proximate cause doctrine applies when a loss is caused by a combination of a covered and specifically excluded risks citation and quotation marks omitted.

the evidence in the record,including both the spiegel report and the testimony by employees that they saw condensation on the packaging of the parts stored on the lower shelves,supports an inference that the humidity reached a high enough level during the flood to cause significant condensation on the packaging of the parts kept on the lower three or four shelves.there is also evidence that although pyramid inventory was generally stored in packaging,most of that packaging was either unsealed or had been compromised by age or the high humidity levels,allowing moisture to reach the components.pyramid employees testified that many of the packages were unsealed and some of those had been folded down and held closed only with a paperclip.the spiegel report noted that the vast majority of pyramid packages were much older than the industry standard packaging recommendation of months and that the package standards require lower than humidity.thus,there is evidence from which a jury could infer that moisture from the flood may have reached components because the packaging was not fully sealed,failed from age,or failed because the humidity caused by the flood reached above the dew point.
pytlewski,pyramid expert metallurgist,acknowledged in his report the difficulty in determining causation,but testified at a deposition that he believed that at least some of the damage was caused by the water intrusion that occurred during the flood.although he could not state definitively that the water intrusion caused all of the harm,l ack of certainty is not,for a qualified expert,the same thing as guesswork.primiano,at.additionally,as discussed above,there is evidence supporting an inference that the condensation may have breached the packaging and reached the components.further,the fact that more than items were quarantined because they showed visible signs of damage after the flood is evidence supporting an inference of causation.
the existence of material factual issues relating to causation is further evident in reviewing the reports of hartford experts.although helms opined that the humidity caused by the flood could not have caused any damage to pyramid inventory,there is evidence in the record from which a reasonable fact finder could discredit helms conclusion.helms spent only two to three hours conducting a visual inspection of pyramid warehouse and did not conduct any tests,take any building measurements,or otherwise investigate the inventory.it took helms one day to complete his report,and he relied exclusively on servpro readings and assumed they were accurate.helms also does not appear to have considered that servpro measurements were taken more than hours after the drying operation began and with open warehouse doors or that the moistureproof packaging was compromised on many items.it is the jury province to determine how much weight,if any,to give the conclusions reached by helms or any of the experts at trial.
kumar did not provide a definitive statement on causation and gave contradictory statements.his declaration and part of his report state that the water intrusion did not cause the corrosion found in his testing,but his deposition testimony and another portion of his report state that the cause can not be determined because it could have been the water intrusion or it could have been age or some other exposure to moisture.under california efficient proximate cause doctrine,whether the damage found by kumar was caused by the flood or by some other cause is an issue for the jury.see julian,d at.
analyzing the causal chain is necessarily speculative and c hoosing between the speculations is ordinarily a question for the trier of fact,who must determine the balance of probabilities.shawmut bank,kress,cir citation omitted.this is not a case where the party with the burden of proof at trial submitted no evidence from which causation could be inferred,thereby requiring summary judgment.id.at.there is sufficient evidence in the record,drawing all reasonable inferences in pyramid favor,from which a reasonable jury could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to a favorable verdict.narayan,at citation omitted.whether those inferences should be drawn in favor of pyramid after considering and weighing all of the evidence is for a jury to decide.thus,summary judgment is inappropriate against pyramid claim of loss of inventory.
pyramid claim of business interruption 
pyramid submitted,withdrew,and then modified its business interruption claim.the only lost business currently claimed by pyramid is from wms,a potential customer.the burden is on pyramid to initiate and support this claim under the policy.see euclid,d at.thus,to defeat summary judgment against its business interruption claim against hartford,pyramid must show that there are material factual issues about whether its loss of potential wms business is a covered loss under the policy.
business interruption is covered under the policy,through an endorsement entitled gross earnings that deleted and replaced the policy original business income and extra expense provisions.the gross earnings endorsement provides 
we will pay for the actual loss of business income you sustain and the actual,necessary and reasonable extra expense you incur due to the necessary interruption of your business operations during the period of restoration due to the direct physical loss of or direct physical damage caused by or resulting from a covered cause of loss to property at scheduled premises.
pyramid must,therefore,show that it actually lost business income from wms because of the flood in order to prevail on its claim that hartford breached the insurance contract by failing to cover pyramid alleged business interruption.
pyramid fails to show that there are material issues of fact that it actually lost wms business as a result of the flood.whether wms would have contracted with pyramid if there was no flood,and for what amount,is too speculative to support pyramid claim.although carmine greco,the senior buyer at wms,testified that he had committed to buy at least million dollars of inventory from pyramid,he also explained that any purchase by wms from pyramid was subject to the approval of wms quality control people and subject to additional negotiation.pyramid and wms,thus,were still negotiating and had not yet entered into a binding and enforceable contract.
greco further testified that he and pyramid had discussed contract terms for only a few parts,although he anticipated more parts would be purchased from pyramid.he added that after learning of the flood,he needed the inventory tested before he would consider purchasing any of it.he also stated that if the product had been tested,he probably would have bought it.
wms quality control manager,nick savich,also participated in the site visit at pyramid.savich sent a letter to pyramid after the visit,stating that wms did not approve pyramid as a supplier based on water intrusion.savich testified at deposition,however,that if he had known that pyramid did not have humidity control in its warehouse,that fact alone would have disqualified pyramid as a supplier.
to find for pyramid on its claim of business interruption,a jury would need to speculate that savich would not have discovered the fact that the warehouse did not have humidity control,that wms quality control people would have signed off on pyramid as a supplier,that greco and pyramid would have successfully negotiated pricing and other terms for many additional parts,and that greco would have followed through with a large purchase.the record evidence does not support and the law does not permit such speculation.see neely,at parties are entitled to have the determination of their rights rest on more than speculation and guesswork.here,the connection between the proffered evidence and the conclusions is too tenuous to permit a jury to make it.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of the motion for summary judgment against pyramid on the claim of business interruption.
pyramid claim of good faith and fair dealing 
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing has particular application to insurers because they are invested with a discretionary power affecting the rights of another.amadeo principal mut.life ins,cir quoting carma developers cal,marathon dev,cal.under california law,to establish a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,a plaintiff must show benefits due under the policy were withheld and the reason for withholding benefits was unreasonable or without proper cause.guebara allstate ins,cir citing love fire ins.the reasonableness of an insurer conduct is ordinarily a question of fact.amadeo,at.
an insured claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may be dismissed on summary judgment if the defendant insurer can show that there was a genuine dispute as to liability.guebara,at.this genuine dispute doctrine should be applied on a basis and does not protect allegedly biased investigations.id.at.biased investigation claims include circumstances where the insurer misrepresents the nature of the investigatory proceedings the insurer employees lie during depositions or to an insured the insurer dishonestly selects experts the insurer experts were unreasonable or the insurer fails to conduct a thorough investigation.id.at.
pyramid argues that hartford breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by improperly refusing to test pyramid inventory for more than two years and conducting inadequate testing denying coverage on pyramid claim of inventory loss making a building restoration estimate and delaying payment on the supplemental building restoration amount for four months and conducting a biased investigation through dishonestly selecting unreasonable experts and an inadequate investigation.hartford argues that it did not act unreasonably because there was a genuine dispute as to coverage,its investigation was proper,its coverage denial was based on expert opinions,and it ultimately paid all of the building restoration amounts making any delay harmless.
there is evidence in the record supporting an inference that hartford acted unreasonably or with bias.pyramid submitted testimony stating that a hartford representative,while visiting pyramid premises to assess damages,said that it is pyramid job to try to collect under the insurance policy and hartford job to make sure pyramid does not collect.pyramid also provided evidence that hartford adjuster to
