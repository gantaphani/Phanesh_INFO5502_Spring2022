defendant harold simpson appeals the sentence and order of restitution imposed for his crime of mail fraud.for several years,simpson underreported payroll information for his businesses to his workers compensation insurance carriers.the district court concluded that the loss caused by this conduct was the amount of additional premiums that the insurance carriers would have charged had they been given accurate information.the court then used those figures to calculate simpson sentencing guidelines range and the amount of restitution due to the carriers.on appeal,simpson argues that the proper measure of loss was not the unpaid premiums,but the amount of money that the carriers actually paid on claims.this argument fails,however,because what simpson took through his deceit was insurance coverage,and the fair market value of that coverage was the amount of the unpaid premiums.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
during the periods relevant to this case,simpson was involved in the operation of two underground mining companies,simpson mining company and motivation enterprise.simpson was the owner and operator of simpson mining,and the of motivation enterprise,which was owned by his wife.because the companies performed their mining operations in kentucky.required that simpson maintain workers compensation insurance for each.
from december,until april,insurance for simpson mining was provided by kentucky employers mutual insurance kemi.as with any workers compensation policy,the size of the premiums due to kemi depended on the payroll information provided by simpson mining,including the number of workers that it employed.simpson drastically underreported his monthly payroll to kemi.at one point,for example,simpson mining was reporting only fourteen of its forty employees.in the last year of the policy alone,simpson fraud enabled him to avoid paying in additional premiums.
kemi did not discover this scheme until september,when one of simpson mining employees attempted to file a workers compensation claim.although this individual had been working for the company for approximately nine months,his employment was never reported to kemi.kemi consequently cancelled simpson mining policy.a subsequent investigation by the kentucky office of mine safety and licensing confirmed that simpson mining had a larger workforce and payroll than it had reported to kemi in monthly payroll reports.
notwithstanding these developments,simpson mining was able to procure immediately a workers compensation policy from another insurance carrier,employers risk services.once again,simpson underreported his payroll information in order to obtain reduced premiums.according to a conservative estimate by employers risk services,simpson underpaid it by at least.
when motivation enterprise was incorporated in,it too misrepresented the size of its workforce to achieve reduced insurance rates.over the course of the two years in which it obtained workers compensation coverage from aig global energy,motivation enterprise avoided in premiums through its falsifications.
in may of,federal officials executing a search warrant for the offices of simpson mining and motivation enterprise discovered that both companies kept two sets of payroll ledgers.the first ledger for each contained handwritten notes reflecting the amount of cash needed to satisfy its actual weekly payroll.the second contained falsified payroll information that the company sent to its bookkeeping agency.this second ledger significantly underrepresented the size of each company payroll.further investigation showed that simpson paid his employees primarily in cash in order to conceal his fraudulent insurance reporting.
the united states subsequently charged simpson with mail fraud in violation of.simpson pled guilty to that charge and was sentenced by the district court on june.at his sentencing hearing,simpson objected to the dollar amount of loss that the presentence report psr used to calculate his guidelines range and the size of his restitution order.the psr figured the amount of loss caused by simpson fraud as the additional in premiums that the insurance carriers would have charged had they received accurate payroll information.simpson took issue with this methodology,arguing that the unpaid premiums were an improper measure of loss.because the insurance carriers allegedly received more in premiums than they paid out on claims,simpson contended that they had not suffered any losses.the district court,however,agreed with the psr and adopted the loss figures that the psr recommended.
this decision had a significant impact on the punishment that simpson received.because the resulting loss was calculated to be greater than but less than,the district court applied a increase to simpson base offense under the sentencing guidelines.see b i.the increase resulted in a guidelines range of months,and the district court sentenced simpson to months of imprisonment.simpson was also ordered to pay a total of in restitution to the three insurance carriers,pursuant to.
on appeal,simpson argues that the value of the unpaid premiums was not the appropriate measure of the loss,and that his guidelines range and restitution obligations were thus not properly calculated.however,because it was insurance coverage that simpson stole through his fraud,both calculations were correct.
guidelines calculation 
because the additional amount of premiums that simpson carriers would have received but for his fraud represents the loss caused by that misconduct for guidelines purposes,application of a increase to simpson base offense was proper.simpson attempted to take something of substantial value,insurance coverage,without compensating the carriers,thus causing the requisite direct pecuniary loss.
the unpaid premiums fall squarely within the definition of loss provided in b,the relevant guidelines provision.where,as here,a defendant commits an offense involving fraud,b requires that his offense level be increased in accordance with the size of the resulting or intended loss.the commentary to b broadly defines loss as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.cmt.a.the commentary then elaborates that pecuniary harm means any harm that is monetary or that otherwise is readily measurable in money.id.here,simpson intended to cause harm that is monetary,that harm would directly result from simpson fraud,and the extent of that harm was reasonably foreseeable.by attempting to deprive the carriers of compensation for coverage provided,simpson sought to cause a monetary injury.such harm is a foreseeable result of the crime intended the entire point of simpson underreporting scheme was to avoid paying the additional premiums.
moreover,the amount of the unpaid premiums represents the fair market value of the coverage that simpson sought to obtain.the commentary to b provides that the fair market value of the thing taken or destroyed shall be the ordinary determinant of the dollar amount of loss.as this court has observed,fair market value is the price a willing buyer would pay a willing seller at the time of the crime.united states sosebee,cir.the market value of the insurance coverage is accordingly the amount of the premiums that would have been charged,as that is the price that consumers paid for such protection.
simpson argues that loss can result from the type of fraudulent insurance reporting that occurred here only to the extent that the amount paid out on claims by the carrier exceeds the premiums that it received.because the government offered no evidence at sentencing as to whether simpson carriers paid out on any claims,simpson contends that no loss occurred.underlying this argument is the idea that the mere provision of insurance coverage confers no value,and that value is conferred only when a carrier actually pays on a claim.however,this contention ignores the fact that,by agreeing to provide coverage,a carrier obligates itself to pay claims arising during the period of coverage,even if those claims exceed the premiums paid.in doing so,the carrier certainly gives up something valuable.insurance coverage,by its very nature,is,and can not be valued using the type of analysis advocated by simpson.
moreover,and contrary to simpson contentions,it is not the case that no loss occurs in a case like this if insurance coverage may be cancelled for fraud.at least for guidelines purposes,it is irrelevant whether,upon uncovering simpson fraud and cancelling his policy,a carrier would or would not have been required to pay on claims for injuries that termination.even assuming that simpson is correct that his carriers would not have been so bound,it appears obvious that simpson would have directed undeclared workers to his carriers in hopes of evading detection and obtaining coverage.a resourceful employer such as simpson will attempt to disguise the fact that an employee for whom benefits are sought has not been reported.where,for example,a policy requires that the employer list the names of the specific individuals for whom coverage has been purchased,an employer may wait to report an employee existence until the employee is injured,and then explain the discrepancy by claiming,for instance,that the employee is a recent hire.see united states ratliff,cir.indeed,the record suggests that simpson did direct injured,unreported employees to his carriers,this being the reason for the cancellation of his policy with kemi.because simpson clearly intended to obtain coverage for which he had not paid,he caused loss,as that term is used in the guidelines.under b,intended loss is adequate to justify an offense level increase even if,for instance,discovery of the fraud precluded actual loss.as the commentary to that section makes clear,loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.cmt.a.
as a final ground for challenging the district court definition of loss,simpson claims that the avoided premiums represent consequential damages and thus can not be used as the measure of loss here.the term loss in b does not encompass every harm resulting from a crime,no matter how attenuated the causal link.in accordance with this principle,consequential damages generally are not included in loss.united states izydore,cir.however,as the ninth circuit concluded in an analogous case,the loss of premium fees is a direct result of fraud and thus is not consequential.united states sanders,wl,at cir.june.when an individual underreports his payroll,he is attempting to take coverage directly and thereby to deprive a carrier of premiums directly.it is not as though the district court in this case defined loss to include the additional monies that the carriers could have made by,for example,investing the unpaid premiums.such a loss would be consequential,but that is not what we have here.
the conclusion that the unpaid premiums represent the loss caused by simpson underreporting is further consistent with the purpose of b,which is to ensure that a defendant offense level reflects his culpability.subsection b sets out a table with sixteen ranges of dollar amounts and accompanying base offense level increases.as the amount of money involved in a crime rises,so does the corresponding base offense level.the purpose of these loss gradations is to ensure that,the more harm the conduct at issue threatens,the more severely it is punished.in essence,t he guidelines use loss as a proxy for the seriousness of the fraud.united states austin,cir see also united states triana,cir the base offense level in fraud cases often does not identify the seriousness of the offense.when the amount of premiums avoided is used to calculate loss,a defendant offense level increase is tied to the harm risked.by contrast,there is no link between loss and culpability under simpson approach.if loss is determined using the amount of claims paid out,offense level increases are based upon the fortuity of whether employees of a dishonest company become injured.it can not be,however,that a crime spanning several years and through which million was purposefully avoided is not very serious merely because none of the employer workers happened to get hurt.
tying offense level increases to the defendant culpability,in turn,prevents arbitrary disparities in guidelines ranges.using unpaid premiums as the measure of loss helps ensure that otherwise similarly situated defendants who intend to,and actually do,fraudulently avoid the same amount of premiums will receive similar guidelines ranges.
while our court has not previously addressed this issue,our holding is consistent with united states garavaglia,wl,at cir.april.in that case we affirmed a district court decision holding that loss should,at least for purposes of restitution,be the amount of avoided premiums.the main issue on appeal there regarding the award of restitution,however,was whether the district court had erred in estimating the dollar amount of the unpaid premiums,and not whether,for purposes of b,the measure of loss in a situation such as this should be the value of the unpaid premiums or the amount that was eventually paid out on claims.in an appeal involving the calculation of restitution for a workers compensation fraud case though,the seventh circuit relied on our garavaglia case to support the very reasoning that we adopt here 
leahy argues that the insurance council does not merit restitution because it received more in premiums than it paid out in claims,so it sustained no loss for restitution purposes.we disagree.the insurance companies were entitled to the benefit of their amount of money they would have charged to insure the actual risk that windy labor presented.see united states garavaglia,d,aff,cir.otherwise,windy labor would obtain a windfall through its fraud,receiving coverage for greater risks than the amount of premiums merited.
united states leahy,cir.
the second and eighth circuits have also explicitly upheld base level increases under b or its predecessor calculated using the amount of avoided workers compensation insurance premiums,although it is not clear that calculation based on claims paid was even advocated in those cases.in united states stevens,wl,at cir.april,the carrier actual loss was measured by the difference between the amount of premiums that the employer should have paid but for the fraud and the amount that it actually paid.united states radtke,cir,is similar.the ninth circuit has upheld a similar calculation in a case involving fraudulently obtained vehicle insurance.sanders,wl,at.
finally,although simpson challenge to his guidelines range is primarily based on the district court definition of loss,he argues in the alternative that the district court erred in calculating the amount of avoided premiums.given his poor financial status during the relevant periods,simpson contends that it is improper to assume that he would have remained in business after,and thus continued to underreport his employees,had he been required to pay the full amount of premiums from the start.it is further speculative to assume,he argues,that the carriers would have continued under the insurance contracts had they known the true state of affairs.these arguments are without merit.the fact of the matter is that simpson did stay in business,that his carriers did not discover his fraud initially,and that he did continue to cause loss to the carriers.it was hardly error for the district court to base its calculations upon what actually occurred,as opposed to what could have happened.
restitution 
parallel reasoning supports calculating the restitution awards in this case based on the additional premiums that should have been paid.pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,defendants such as simpson who commit certain crimes involving fraud must make restitution to their victims.where an award is appropriate,the statute requires restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim loss.f a.it is true that the mvra refers only to actual loss,and unlike of the guidelines does not include intended loss.united states younes,cir united states finkley,cir.but apart from the arguments rejected above,simpson does not really argue that there has been no actual loss.
instead,his remaining argument with respect to restitution is that
