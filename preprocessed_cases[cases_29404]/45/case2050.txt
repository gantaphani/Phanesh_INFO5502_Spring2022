background 
matrix is a maintenance and construction company based in tulsa,oklahoma.it provides health care benefits to its employees through the matrix service group benefit plan of june,the plan.matrix hired health services,as a third party administrator to oversee its health insurance claims.matrix contracted with zurich,a new york corporation,to issue a medical insurance policy the policy for the period of june,through may.under the policy,zurich pays for covered medical expenses of eligible employees that exceed up to and then from up to a maximum of the policy provides coverage to eligible employees who are defined as individuals who are covered under the plan of benefits.at.
the plan of benefits is expressly defined as the plan of health care benefits that the employer provides for the benefit of its employees.id.maxtrix plan describes the coverage and employee eligibility requirements for its employees who receive health benefits.the plan terminates coverage if an employee is at the end of an employer project and not reassigned to another project within days.id.at.the policy requires matrix to obtain the written consent of zurich for any changes to the plan.however,the plan grants sole discretion to a health benefit committee to construe the terms of the plan and determine whether an employee is eligible u ltimately,the committee determines whether or not an employee is eligible to participate in the plan in these,and all other circumstances.id.at.
enrique ortiz was employed by matrix as a craftsman.on july,ortiz was assigned to the tesoro anacortes project.the project was scheduled to last past august.the project,however,was suspended on august,due to problems at the job site with tesoro sour water stripper purification system.matrix was scheduled to return to the site on september,to continue the work.ortiz was instructed to remain on standby and be ready to return to the job site on september.prior to september,tesoro notified matrix that it had not corrected the problem and further postponed work on the project until september.sometime during the week of september,tesoro again postponed work on the project and told matrix that it would have to determine on a basis whether the project could resume.the project finally resumed on october,and was completed on january.
prior to the resumption of work by matrix,ortiz was involved in an automobile accident in which he was seriously injured.the accident occurred on october,approximately days after work on the tesoro project was initially suspended.ortiz medical bills totaled 
the health benefit committee determined that ortiz was covered under the plan and eligible to receive benefits.the committee reasoned that because the tesoro project had only been suspended,not finished,the day provision did not apply.because ortiz had been eligible for benefits prior to the suspension of the tesoro project and because the project was not finished before he suffered the accident,the committee determined ortiz was a covered employee and matrix must pay ortiz medical bills under the plan and the policy.it sought payment from zurich for the remaining medical bills in the amount of.
as allowed by the policy,zurich requested documentation from matrix that it had paid the appropriate premiums for ortiz and that he was a covered eligible employee.zurich underwriter,peru,notified zurich of the need to pay the claim promptly in order to take advantage of a medical discount,which it did on may,by issuing a check to matrix for,while continuing to press for supporting documentation.after some delay,matrix sent a memo which addressed the request for information regarding premium payments as follows 
evidence of premium payments for field employees like ortiz,under circumstances where the employee need for medical or fmla leave is unplanned or unexpected,it is matrix policy and customary practice to pay the contribution to the group benefit plan for the employee until arrangements can be made for contribution payment.employees are required to the company for advances of contribution upon return to work.
at.during this time,zurich realized that ortiz had been suspended from work for approximately fifty days and requested a refund from matrix.matrix refused,stating it had correctly interpreted the plan and offered to provide zurich documentation concerning ortiz and other employees continued employment during the time period relevant to this matter.at.the last document concerning premium payments generated prior to the filing of this lawsuit is a telephone message memo indicating matrix claims broker had telephoned regarding zurich continued requests for the premium billing statements.the memo concluded,the broker thinks zurich must be checking eligibility.she will check with the group benefit committee.at.
on november,zurich filed a complaint alleging breach of contract and seeking the return of the.zurich alleged matrix interpretation of the contract constituted an impermissible change in the terms for which adequate notice was not received.zurich did not allege matrix had failed to make premium payments.zurich filed a motion for summary judgment on may,on august,matrix filed a response and its for summary judgment.the district court denied zurich motion for summary judgment and granted matrix for summary judgment on june.judgment was entered on june.zurich never raised matrix failure to provide evidence of premium payments during the pleading,discovery or summary judgment processes.
it appears around the time of the district court summary judgment decision,zurich renewed its request for documentation of premium payments from matrix,specifically an active plan participant census as of november,through june.at.after receiving that list,on june,zurich again asked for the premium billing statements for october,through may.one week later,zurich underwriter wrote to check on the status of the request and related that zurich was asking specifically for the august,september and october itemized statements.at.those exchanges were not made through counsel in this case.but on the same day,zurich counsel sent a written request to matrix counsel for the same documentation,to be provided by july.matrix counsel responded the following day stating the timing of the request was unreasonable,but that matrix will evaluate your request and respond appropriately,within a reasonable time.at.on july,zurich counsel again requested the premiums documentation be provided either by fax or production at matrix offices no later than july.zurich advised that if the documents were not received,it would file a motion for an order to show cause asserting that matrix had misrepresented ortiz status as a covered employee because the premiums were not paid for him during those months.on july,matrix refused to produce the documents,stating that it considered the case resolved pursuant to the summary judgment ruling.
on july,nearly a month after the district court decision was announced,zurich filed an order to show cause to compel matrix to produce relevant premium documents from october,through may.zurich also sought relief pursuant to rule b,and relief from judgement or order,claiming matrix refusal to produce the relevant documentation,as required by contract,required an inference that the documents would prove that matrix had not paid ortiz premiums,and therefore he was not a covered employee at the time of his accident.on july,the district court denied zurich request for relief under rule b and.it did not specifically address rule b or zurich request for injunctive relief.
discussion 
zurich argues the district court erred by denying its summary judgment motion and granting summary judgment to matrix on the interpretation of the plan and policy documents.zurich also challenges the district court refusal to grant its request for relief premised on matrix failure to produce documentation of premium payments for ortiz.this includes its broad brush requests for a suspension of the judgment,an order compelling production of matrix insurance documentation,or a new trial based on the presence of new evidence fraud allegedly committed by matrix.
summary judgment 
zurich argues that the district court ignored the plain language of the plan and policy by preferring matrix interpretation of coverage.zurich further contends that matrix interpretation constituted an impermissible plan change appellant br.at.matrix argues that its interpretation of the documents is reasonable based on the language,and even if not,matrix was given the sole power to interpret the provisions of the plan.
a district court grant of summary judgment under.is subject to de novo review.pitman blue cross blue shield of,cir.the reviewing court must apply the same standards as the district court.kimber thiokol,cir.summary judgment shall be granted if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in ruling on summary judgment,the court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.
under oklahoma law,insurance policies are to be interpreted using the same principles that apply to any adhesion contract.redcorn state farm fire cas.
parties to a contract for insurance are free to choose the risks to be covered by the policy.once agreed upon,the parties are bound by the terms of the contract and courts will not rewrite those terms.the construction of a policy should be natural and reasonable,viewed in the light of common sense.the result should not be absurd.
id.moreover,an insurance contract is to be construed so as to give effect to all of its provisions,if possible,and its terms are accepted in their plain and ordinary sense.great am.ins.of packing.any ambiguity is to be construed strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured.see,county fire ins.of phila.harper.
the critical plan provision in dispute is the continuous break limitation which provides 
if you are an employee who is at the end of an employer project,your coverage will end the last day of work on the project.however,if you are ending an employer project,but are scheduled to begin another employer project within days,your coverage will not be terminated you will not receive pay for the days you are not working,but you will continue to be considered an active employee with health benefits if enrolled.if,after a continuous break,you have not started another employer project,you will be terminated at that time,your coverage will cease and you will receive cobra notification.
at.as zurich points out,this provision states that a continuous break in employment will cause the coverage to lapse.however,this provision is triggered only when you are an employee who is terminated at the end of an employer project.id.emphasis added.according to the health benefits committee,because the tesoro project was suspended before completion,ortiz was not an employee whose project had ended.thus,according to the committee,this limitation does not apply.
three factors weigh in favor of the health benefit committee interpretation of the continuous break limitation.first,the language of the provision is crafted to apply to an employee being terminated at the end of an employer project.certainly,august,the day ortiz work on the project was suspended,was not the end of the project.although the project was postponed several times,it was done on a periodic and eventually weekly basis and with the full expectation that work would resume,as it did on october.thus,the health benefit committee interpretation that the limitation did not apply is reasonable in light of the plan language.had the limitation provided any continuous day break in work would terminate coverage,zurich would have a valid argument.but the plan provision specifically limited coverage termination to day breaks after the end of a project.
second,through the health benefit committee,matrix was specifically granted the sole power to interpret the provisions of the plan.the plan provides,
the committee shall have the sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility for plan benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,and benefits under the plan will be paid only if the committee decides,in its discretion,that the participant or beneficiary is entitled to such benefits.
at.because the continuous break limitation was part of the plan,the health benefits committee had the sole power to interpret its meaning and whether the limitation applied to ortiz.
zurich contends that matrix authority to interpret the policy was limited to disputes with an employee,not the insurance company.it maintains that matrix interpretation of the plan was actually a revision of the plan and therefore matrix was required to submit the changes to zurich in writing for approval.however,zurich attempt to limit matrix authority to interpret the contract is not manifest in the contract language.the policy only provides that matrix will not change the plan of benefits without the prior written consent of zurich,and if matrix does not give written notice of the change,zurich liability is limited to the lesser of the new plan of benefits or the plan of benefits prior to the change.at.both the continuous break limitation as well as the provision granting the health benefit committee the power to interpret plan provisions were originally in the plan which was incorporated into the policy.the health benefit committee did not rewrite or modify the contract provisions.it merely interpreted the plan language including any attendant ambiguity as it applied to an employee.even if zurich understood the interpretation power to extend only to disputes between matrix and its employees,zurich would still be affected and bound by matrix decisions implementing employee benefits.
finally,under oklahoma law,the insurance contract is to be construed against the insurer,zurich.great am.ins.of,at harper,at.even if the contractual language regarding the end of an employer project was ambiguous and matrix health benefit committee did not possess the sole power to interpret the contract,oklahoma rule of construction would weigh in favor of matrix.the plain language of the plan limitation coupled with matrix ability to interpret that provision and the oklahoma rule of construction against the insurer leaves little reason to prefer zurich interpretation of plan coverage over that of matrix.the district court appropriately granted summary judgment to matrix and denied it to zurich.
rule b,federal rules of civil procedure,and relief 
one month after summary judgment was entered,zurich requested several forms of relief based on matrix failure to provide evidence to zurich that it had paid the premiums for ortiz insurance coverage as it was obligated to do under the terms of the policy.zurich requested the district court to grant relief under.b give it an extension of time to appeal from the district court order stay the district court order on summary judgment pending appeal and issue an order compelling matrix to produce evidence that it had paid the premiums.
rule b relief 
zurich filed a request for relief under rule b,and,which provide 
on motion and upon such terms as are just,the court may relieve a party or a party legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons 
newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b 
fraud whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party 
or any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.
the motion shall be made within a reasonable time,and for reasons,and not more than one year after the judgment was entered or taken.
the savings clause to rule b further provides t his rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.
this court reviews a district court denial of a rule b motion for abuse of discretion.servants of paraclete does,cir.rule b relief is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.id.parties seeking relief under rule b have a higher hurdle to overcome because such a motion is not a substitute for an appeal.cummings general motors,cir.accordingly,our review is meaningfully narrower than review of the merits of a direct appeal.amoco oil epa,cir internal quotation omitted.given the lower court discretion,the district court ruling is only reviewed to determine if a definite,clear or unmistakable error occurred below.cummings,at internal quotation omitted.a reviewing court may reverse only if it finds a complete absence of a reasonable basis and is certain that the decision is wrong.yapp excel,cir internal quotation omitted.however,a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.fdic united pac.ins,cir internal quotation omitted.
the district court decided rule b was unavailable because zurich did not possess any newly discovered evidence.at best,zurich merely suspects the information it seeks would lead to new documentary evidence.assuming the new evidence would substantiate matrix alleged concealment of damaging information,zurich motion still fails.for newly discovered evidence to provide a basis for a new trial under rule b,the moving party must show the evidence was newly discovered since the trial the moving party was diligent in discovering the new evidence the newly discovered evidence could not be merely cumulative or impeaching the newly discovered evidence is material and that a new trial with the newly discovered evidence would probably produce a different result.graham wyeth,cir.zurich motion founders on the first two requirements.although zurich attorney represented he did not learn of matrix refusal to provide contractually required documentation until after the district court granted summary judgment,zurich knew the documentation was missing almost a year prior to the start of trial and made no attempt to explicitly include it in the discovery process.order july,at thus,the district court correctly determined that matrix failure to produce the documents does not qualify as newly discovered evidence and zurich abandonment of its requests for the documents for over a year does not demonstrate diligence in discovering the new evidence.
the district court dismissed zurich rule b motion because it failed to allege sufficiently egregious conduct to constitute fraud on the court as set forth in united states buck,cir.zurich argues the district court erroneously applied buck heightened fraud on the court standard to its motion by requiring proof of intent to deceive or defraud the court,through a deliberate scheme,id.internal quotation omitted,rather than the lower rule b standard for fraud or misconduct between the parties.in support,zurich cites the rule b standards applied by other circuits which do not require evidence of intent to deceive through a deliberate scheme.see schultz butcher,cir requiring under rule b only that the defendant prove by clear and convincing evidence that it has a meritorious defense,the party engaged in misconduct and the misconduct prevented the moving party from fully presenting its case for claims of fraud anderson cryovac,cir holding misconduct under rule b does not require proof of intent to deceive.
rule b allows a court to relieve a party from a final judgment based on fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party.regardless of the specific form of the allegation,the party relying on rule b must,by adequate proof,clearly substantiate the claim of fraud,misconduct or misrepresentation.wilkin sunbeam,cir.in other words,they must show clear and convincing proof of fraud,misrepresentation,or misconduct.cummings,at.see yapp,at anderson dep t of health human,cir.moreover,the challenged behavior must substantially have interfered with the aggrieved party ability fully and fairly to prepare for and proceed at trial.woodworker supply,at internal quotation omitted cummings,at.subsection b is aimed at judgments which were unfairly obtained,not at those which are factually incorrect,which may be remedied under subsections b or.rozier ford motor,cir.
by its terms,rule b deals with fraud,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an adverse party,while the savings clause to rule b recognizes the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment for fraud upon the court.see wilkin,at recognizing rule b does not limit a court power to redress fraud on the court.this distinction allows fraud on the court claims to be brought outside of the one year period of limitations imposed on the grounds expressly listed in rule b.ordinarily,therefore,claims of fraud between the parties are brought under rule b,while claims of fraud on the court are brought as an independent action which is recognized in the savings clause.however,courts have allowed parties to file a claim for fraud on the court under subsection b.see gonzalez secretary for of corrections,cir a claim that the state had perpetrated a fraud on the federal court in order to obtain the judgment denying the habeas petition could be raised in a rule b motion.aff by gonzalez crosby,d.
fraud between the parties and fraud on the court are two distinct bases for relief.fraud on the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties buck,at.fraud on the court claims merit separate analysis not only because they are exempt from the one year for filing claims under rule b,but also because they are much more difficult to prove.see charles alan wright arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,ed.
generally speaking,only the most egregious conduct,such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury,or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated will constitute a fraud on the court.less egregious misconduct,such as nondisclosure to the court of facts allegedly pertinent to the matter before it,will not ordinarily rise to the level of fraud on the court.
weese schukman,cir internal quotation omitted.see also,buck,at it has been held that allegations of nondisclosure in pretrial discovery will not support an action for fraud on the court.these parameters are strictly applied because a finding of fraud on the court permits the severe consequence of allowing a party to overturn the finality of a judgment.weese,at.intent to defraud is an absolute prerequisite to a finding of fraud on the court.robinson audi aktiengesellschaft,cir discussing the required intent element.see also,yapp excel,cir same.
in this case,zurich argues that the district court applied the wrong standard due to its reliance on united states buck.zurich contends buck is inapposite because it did not even concern a motion under rule b,much less purport to set forth the standard for such a motion appellant br.at.we agree.to be sure,buck was clearly a fraud on the court case,brought to avoid the time bar of rule b.we specifically referred to the words of rule b savings clause that t his rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from judgment,order,or proceeding,or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.our agreement,however,provides cold comfort because in yapp,we applied the heightened fraud on the court standard of buck and robinson to misconduct
