statement of the case and facts 
frederick kimbark died after falling through a hole in a metal roof at a construction site where he was working as a carpenter.mccrary was the general contractor on the project metal deck was a subcontractor,responsible for furnishing and installing the metal deck system on the roof horizon was another subcontractor,responsible for installing heating,ventilation and air conditioning units and performing miscellaneous sheet metal work.metal deck employees cut the hole through which kimbark subsequently fell,but left the work site without covering it.a horizon employee,plummer,covered the hole in question at the request of mccrary superintendent,mark nelson,but did not secure the covering.kimbark fell through the hole when he lifted the plywood covering it and stepped forward,not realizing the plywood had been covering a hole.among many disputed issues at trial were whether metal deck had a duty to cover the holes it cut or properly left that task to mccrary,and whether mccrary agreed to assume responsibility for covering the holes or was forced to do so by metal deck refusal.
at the wrongful death trial,the jury concluded that metal deck,mccrary,horizon and kimbark himself were all negligent with respect to the accident.the jury apportioned fault percent to mccrary,percent to metal deck,and percent to kimbark.it found that horizon negligence did not cause kimbark injury.mccrary satisfied its portion of the judgment with a payment of,which it described as representing its stated percentage of responsibility under the jury verdict plus costs and interest.metal deck appealed the judgment.
in kimbark metal deck mccrary,wl,filed november,this court affirmed the judgment,rejecting metal deck arguments that it owed no duty to kimbark or properly discharged its duty.we noted that although metal deck subcontract with mccrary did not expressly require it to cover the holes it cut in the roof,the contract did expressly require metal deck to comply with applicable safety laws,rules and regulations,one of which specifically required secured and marked covers for floor,roof and skylight openings.we also held that metal deck had a duty to cover the holes under rowland christian cal d,and that substantial evidence supported the jury conclusion that metal deck did not properly discharge its duty.metal deck represents in this court that it has since satisfied the remainder of the wrongful death judgment,paying its percent share plus interest 
while metal deck appeal in the wrongful death action was pending,the trial court heard mccrary previously bifurcated for breach of contract and indemnity.mccrary first amended sought full indemnity under causes of action for breach of contract and express contractual indemnity,and comparative equitable indemnity under a cause of action for implied and equitable indemnity.metal deck answer raised affirmative defenses,asserting that it was not liable for any indemnity as well as that,under the doctrine of comparative indemnity,mccrary should be barred from recovery of damages directly attributable to its proportionate share of fault.horizon raised affirmative defenses,asserting the was barred for reasons including mccrary comparative fault and denying its own liability for any damages.
the indemnity provision in metal deck and horizon subcontracts with mccrary provided subcontractor agrees to defend and indemnify contractor against,and save him harmless from,any and all claims,suits or liability for injuries to property,injuries to persons,including death,and from any other claims,suits or liability on account of,or related to,any act or omission,or alleged act or omission of the subcontractor,or any of his officers,agents,employees or servants.subcontractor shall be liable to contractor for all expenses,including court costs and attorney fee incurred by contractor in connection with any such claims,suits or liability,in connection with any claim by contractor against subcontractor arising out of the provisions of this article.
metal deck trial brief argued that mccrary was not entitled to indemnity under theories of express or implied indemnity because mccrary was actively negligent with respect to the accident,metal deck was not negligent,and mccrary failed to perform its obligations under its contract with metal deck.horizon brief denied liability for indemnity on the basis that the jury had determined its conduct did not cause the underlying injury.mccrary trial brief argued as to metal deck that language of the contract required full indemnity regardless of mccrary own negligence and that metal deck was negligent.as to horizon,mccrary argued that the language of the indemnity clause was broad enough to impose liability based on horizon negligence despite the jury finding that horizon conduct was not a substantial factor in causing the fatal accident.
the matter was tried to the court on february,and the court statement of decision was filed on march.the court concurred with the jury allocation of fault as to kimbark percent,mccrary percent and metal deck percent,as well as its finding that horizon was negligent,but disagreed that horizon negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident.the court found that after metal deck refused to cover the holes it had cut on the deck,nelson obtained a commitment from horizon to cover the holes.the court stated the record is quite clear that horizon agreed to cover the holes in question and obviously failed to either secure or appropriately label same according to occupational safety and health act osha standards and general negligence standards.the record clearly establishes that the decedent raised an unsecured piece of plywood obviously unaware that there was a hole beneath as he stepped forward to his death.this court concludes that horizon negligence clearly was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff fatal injury.the court also found metal deck was negligent and its negligence was a substantial factor in causing kimbark death.it cited evidence that metal deck refused to cover the holes,forcing nelson to find a third party on short notice to do so.
the court rejected the argument that because the indemnity clause in the subcontracts did not state what effect mccrary negligence would have on metal deck and horizon indemnity obligations,mccrary would not be entitled to indemnity if it was deemed actively negligent.with respect to metal deck,the court first found that the parties negotiated metal deck obligation to cover the holes it cut,then found mccrary conduct should not preclude indemnity because,quoting morton thiokol,metal building alteration d.morton thiokol,indemnity should be afforded under any circumstances where to do so furthers the manifest intent of the parties to the contract and where the loss sustained would not have occurred without the indemnitor negligence.
the court reached a contrary result regarding horizon obligation to provide indemnity.citing the rule of continental heller amtech mechanical services,th,d,that indemnity is required where the indemnitor was in some way connected to a specific act or omission,the court found horizon was connected to a far greater degree than the indemnitor in continental heller.the court found,however,that horizon was not responsible for covering the holes because its subcontract contained no provisions regarding covering of the holes,there was no evidence of relevant discussions pertaining to the indemnification clause and,but for plummer volunteering to cover the holes,the jury could not have found horizon negligent.accordingly,the court believed the indemnity question turned on whether mccrary negligence was active or passive.the court found mccrary negligence was active because,as general contractor,it was responsible for supervision of the construction,it was aware of the hazard presented by the uncovered holes and took control,albeit with little choice,by directing horizon employee to cover the holes,it had an affirmative duty to inspect horizon volunteer work but failed to do so,and it failed to instruct horizon on how to cover the holes.
metal deck filed objections to the statement of decision,including the objection that the statement of decision was ambiguous in failing to specify whether metal deck owed indemnity only in the amount of its own percentage of negligence liability or also to cover the percentage of fault attributed to mccrary.metal deck also asserted that an actively negligent indemnitee could obtain indemnity only for the portion of its liability attributable to the negligence of the indemnitor.
the court overruled metal deck objections,holding that it would be unreasonable to interpret the contract as failing to provide for full indemnity,given that mccrary only negligence was in failing to remedy a dangerous condition created by the negligence of metal deck,the indemnitor,and metal deck negligence involved the violation of an express term of the same contract containing the indemnity clause.
in its judgment filed on august,the court awarded mccrary judgment against metal deck in the amount of and ordered judgment for horizon.
metal deck argues that it owes no indemnity to mccrary under the parties contract for several reasons.first,metal deck urges that the issue should be determined in accordance with principles of comparative negligence,under which mccrary would not be entitled to indemnity because it paid only its proportionate share of the wrongful death judgment.second,metal deck contends that even under an all or nothing approach to indemnity,mccrary is not entitled to indemnity because it was actively negligent with respect to the accident.lastly,metal deck argues that if it does owe mccrary indemnity,horizon must as well because the two subcontractors contracts with mccrary contained identical indemnity clauses.
preliminarily,metal deck urges that this court must review the trial court judgment de novo,as metal deck contests only the court interpretation and application of the indemnity clause and does not challenge the factual findings on negligence.it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument unless the interpretation turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence.parsons bristol development cal d.where the facts are undisputed,we review the trial court application of law independently.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,franchise tax bd.d.however,where extrinsic evidence has been properly admitted as an aid to the interpretation of a contract and the evidence conflicts,a reasonable construction of the agreement by the trial court which is supported by substantial evidence will be upheld.in re marriage of fonstein cal d.
here,the trial court interpretation of the indemnity provision was based on its assessment of conflicting evidence regarding the parties contract negotiations such as whether the contract required metal deck to cover the holes it cut and facts leading to the accident such as whether mccrary voluntarily assumed responsibility for covering the holes or was forced to do so by metal deck refusal.thus,in construing the indemnity agreement,to the extent the evidence is in conflict,we accept the trial court implied credibility determinations to the extent the evidence is not in conflict,we construe the instrument,and we resolve any conflicting inferences,ourselves.parsons bristol development,supra,cal d at pp.and,fn.schaefer ambulance service county of san bernardino th,d.
mccrary is not entitled to be indemnified by metal deck 
indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.sammer ball d.this obligation may be expressly provided for by contract,markley beagle cal d,it may be implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity see cahill,clementina d,or it may arise from the equities of particular circumstances examiner division sweat d.see note,contribution and indemnity in california cal.where,as here,the parties have expressly contracted with respect to the duty to indemnify,the extent of that duty must be determined from the contract and not by reliance on the independent doctrine of equitable indemnity.markley beagle,supra,at.rossmoor sanitation,pylon,cal d,rossmoor.
some california cases have interpreted express indemnity provisions by reference to a classification system described in macdonald kruse,san jose steel d.macdonald kruse.according to macdonald kruse,the first type of indemnity provision type i provides expressly and unequivocally that the indemnitor is to indemnify the indemnitee for,among other things,the negligence of the indemnitee,and the indemnitee is indemnified whether its liability arises from its sole or concurrent negligence.id.at.under the second type of indemnity clause,the indemnitee would be indemnified for his or her own passive negligence but not for active negligence.macdonald kruse described the type ii indemnity clause by examples a clause providing for indemnity for the indemnitee liability howsoever same may be caused vinnell pacific ry.cal d,or regardless of responsibility for negligence goldman cal d,or arising from the use of the premises,facilities or services of the indemnitee harvey machine hatzel buehler,cal d,or which might arise in connection with the agreed work markley beagle,supra,cal d,or caused by or happening in connection with the equipment or the condition,maintenance,possession,operation or use thereof price shell oil cal d,or from any and all claims for damages to any person or property by reason of the use of said leased property morgan stubblefield cal d.macdonald kruse,at.the third type of indemnity clause is that which provides that the indemnitor is to indemnify the indemnitee for the indemnitee liabilities caused by the indemnitor,but which does not provide that the indemnitor is to indemnify the indemnitee for the indemnitee liabilities that were caused by other than the indemnitor.under this type of provision,any negligence on the part of the indemnitee,either active or passive,will bar indemnification against the indemnitor irrespective of whether the indemnitor may also have been a cause of the indemnitee liability.macdonald kruse,at.
under the macdonald kruse rules,mccrary would not be entitled to indemnity at all because the indemnity provision in its subcontract with metal deck is of the third category described in that case,calling for indemnity for liabilities on account of,or related to,any act or omission of the subcontractor.italics added.see macdonald kruse,supra,d at.promise to hold indemnitee harmless from any liability in any way caused by indemnitor viewed as type iii clause hernandez badger construction equipment th,d same.
in rossmoor,our supreme court described the governing law as follows if an indemnity clause does not address itself to the issue of an indemnitee negligence,it is referred to as a general indemnity clause.see markley beagle,supra,cal d at,morgan stubblefield,supra,cal d at.while such clauses may be construed to provide indemnity for a loss resulting in part from an indemnitee passive negligence,they will not be interpreted to provide indemnity if an indemnitee has been actively negligent.markley beagle,supra,at,morgan stubblefield,supra,at,see also burlingame motor peninsula activities,d.provisions purporting to hold an owner harmless in any suit at law markley beagle,supra,at,from all claims for damages to persons morgan stubblefield,supra,at,and from any cause whatsoever macdonald kruse,supra,d at pp,without expressly mentioning an indemnitee negligence,have been deemed to be general clauses.rossmoor,supra,cal d at.
