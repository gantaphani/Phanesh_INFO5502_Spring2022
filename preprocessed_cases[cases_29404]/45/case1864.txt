background 
angelina and bryan married in.in,bryan obtained a life insurance policy from nationwide in the amount of one million dollars,effective in september of that year.the policy names angelina as the primary beneficiary and names bryce and kendall as alternate beneficiaries.bryan was murdered on december,by means of manual strangulation.a state court jury subsequently convicted rafiel torre torre of the murder torre appeal of that conviction is pending.
angelina sought an advance on the policy proceeds within days after bryan death,made a formal claim for the proceeds on january,and received a advance on march.on september,pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,nationwide filed its complaint in interpleader in the district court.the complaint names angelina,bryce and kendall as defendants.keith subsequently was appointed guardian ad litem for bryce and kendall.
angelina filed a against keith and a against nationwide,seeking a declaration that she is entitled to the proceeds as the primary named beneficiary under the policy.keith filed a against angelina,seeking a declaration that bryce and kendall are entitled to the proceeds,and seeking return of the that nationwide advanced to angelina.keith asserted that angelina conspired in bryan murder,thus disqualifying herself from receiving any proceeds of the policy,and that as a result the policy benefits are payable to bryce and kendall as the alternate named beneficiaries nationwide deposited the policy proceeds into the district court registry and was granted judgment in interpleader.
the district court conducted a bench trial and thereafter issued findings of fact and conclusions of law ffcl in which it determined that angelina did conspire in,aid,and abet bryan murder,and thus is disqualified from receiving any proceeds from the policy.the district court entered judgment against angelina and for keith as guardian ad litem for bryce and kendall.the ffcl contain a lengthy narrative describing the events leading up to bryan murder and the evidence presented at trial,summarized as follows 
angelina met torre at a nightclub in july or august.torre competed professionally in mixed martial arts and also was a martial arts instructor.sometime thereafter,angelina and torre became lovers.angelina testified at trial that her relationship with torre did not become romantic until after bryan death.several other witnesses testified that by the fall of angelina marriage was strained,that bryan spoke of divorcing her,and that angelina and torre were seen together regularly,acting in a manner that suggested they were having an affair.in september angelina loaned torre,and in october she torre lease for commercial space to start a martial arts studio.the property manager testified that bryan was not a party to the negotiations or the lease,and that angelina and torre never mentioned bryan.angelina testified that she and bryan had problems but were committed to staying married.
at approximately on december,angelina called keith wife,lisa richards lisa,and stated that she did not know where bryan was.angelina called the police the following morning,december,to report bryan missing.angelina also called keith and told him that bryan had planned to go to a warehouse to pick up christmas gifts stored there.angelina asked keith to check the warehouse.keith did so,but found no evidence that bryan had been there recently.sometime on the afternoon of december,bryan brothers,keith and matthew richards matthew,visited angelina at home.angelina was drinking wine with a female friend.keith testified that he noticed bryan insurance policy binder on the kitchen table that he asked angelina if she had found bryan life insurance policy,and she said that she had not and that later that evening the policy binder was moved to the top of the washing machine in the laundry room,where it was partially hidden under a pile of clothes.
keith testified that at some point he asked angelina where bryan white utility truck was,and that angelina said torre had it.bryan had let torre drive the truck in the past.at keith request,angelina called torre and asked him to bring the truck to the house.when torre arrived,matthew looked in the truck lock box for bryan glock handgun,which normally was kept there,but the gun was gone.keith testified that while he and matthew were outside near the truck,angelina and torre spoke to each other in the doorway of the house.torre left with bryan utility truck,after which angelina stated for the first time that bryan had gone to the store to buy firewood.according to keith,angelina asked him to search for bryan at nearby grocery stores.keith and matthew left the house at about to do so.approximately twenty minutes later,they discovered bryan other truck in the parking lot of a nearby albertson market.bryan body was in the bed of the truck.he had been strangled.
on the following morning,december,sheriff detectives interviewed angelina,other members of bryan family,and torre.when asked about life insurance,angelina stated that bryan had life insurance but that she did not know the amount of the death benefit.angelina told the detectives that at one time bryan had been involved with a man named thomas esparza esparza in a scheme involving the receipt and sale of stolen medical equipment,and that both bryan and esparza had been convicted of crimes arising out of that scheme.angelina stated that after his release from prison earlier in the year,esparza frequently had called the richards home,had attempted to extort money from bryan,and had argued with bryan.torre likewise told the detectives about bryan conflict with esparza.neither angelina nor torre told the detectives about their relationship.
sometime later that day,or within a few days,angelina spoke with the insurance agent who sold bryan the policy,phil beh beh,and inquired whether the death benefit was or.beh testified that angelina called him,while angelina testified that beh called her.beh further testified that he and angelina spoke several times in the days after bryan death,and that angelina asked for an advance on the policy benefits.beh characterized the promptness of angelina inquiry as surprising,atypical and odd.beh also testified that angelina was calm and unemotional during their conversations.angelina made a formal claim for the policy proceeds on january,and received a advance on march.six days later,on march,angelina purchased a vacation package to cancun,mexico for herself and torre.witnesses testified that torre constantly was at angelina home beginning approximately two weeks after bryan death.
lisa testified that she and matthew wife,linda richards linda,invited angelina out for the evening of february,bryan birthday.according to lisa,angelina stated on that occasion that bryan was a drug dealer,that the sheriff department had recovered the drug ecstacy in bryan truck,and that there was an ongoing investigation into a possible link between bryan drug activities and his death.sheriff detectives testified that no drugs were found in bryan truck and that they never suspected bryan of dealing drugs.
deposition testimony of gerald strebendt 
gerald strebendt strebendt,a close personal friend of torre,did not testify in person at the trial.the district court admitted his prior deposition testimony over angelina objection.the court found that strebendt resided in north bend,oregon,and thus that his deposition testimony was admissible under former rule a b of the federal rules of civil procedure,now rule a b that provision states in relevant part that a party may use the deposition of a witness at a hearing or trial if the court finds that the witness is more than miles from the place of hearing or trial.a b formerly.a b.the court rejected as unsupported by the evidence angelina assertion that strebendt in fact resided in los angeles,california,and thus was not subject to the applicable provision.
strebendt is a professional fighter and martial arts instructor,and a former marine sniper and sniper instructor.he was deposed on february and,at which time he testified that he met angelina through torre in early september,and that later the same month he witnessed angelina and torre get bryan intoxicated so that the two of them could spend the evening together without bryan knowledge.angelina testified at trial that the idea to get bryan intoxicated was proposed by others,and that while she drove torre to his car after bryan went home,she did not have a sexual encounter with torre that night.
during his deposition,strebendt testified that angelina told him that she and torre were having an affair.strebendt also testified that he saw angelina give torre in cash,and that shortly afterward torre said the following angelina just wishes she could be rid of bryan,she wishes he was just gone and she even willing to pay somebody to do it and she knows you strebendt were a sniper in the marines and she wanted to know if you interested strebendt stated that he told torre that he would not kill bryan.
according to strebendt,torre called him several times in late december and early and,stated that bryan had been killed,and emphasized his need to see strebendt in person.strebendt testified that when he met with torre in early or,torre admitted to killing bryan but claimed that it was.torre said that bryan accused him of having an affair with angelina and pointed a glock handgun at him.torre claimed that he knocked the gun from bryan hands and applied a choke hold known in brazilian as mata leon,or to kill the lion.according to strebendt,torre stated that he just wanted to render bryan unconscious,but that he felt something crush in bryan neck,and that when he released the hold bryan was dead torre asked strebendt to provide an alibi,which strebendt refused to do,although strebendt did agree to keep bryan handgun.strebendt stored the gun at his home in oregon.
strebendt subsequently contacted sheriff detectives,recounted the conversation with bryan,and gave them the gun.strebendt agreed to make recorded telephone calls to angelina on december,which was the first time strebendt had spoken with angelina in approximately two years,strebendt told angelina that t he gun that rafiel gave me has been recovered,to which angelina responded that she did not know what strebendt was talking about and that he had better talk to torre.on december,during their second conversation,strebendt told angelina that torre had admitted to killing bryan in,had given strebendt bryan gun,and had told strebendt that angelina would pay for someone to kill bryan.angelina responded that ridiculous.i would never say that.angelina did not call the sheriff department or any other authorities to report the conversation.when questioned by sheriff deputies the following day,angelina admitted that she had spoken to strebendt the previous evening,but said the only matter discussed was whether torre was home.when asked how strebendt came to possess bryan gun,angelina said that she did not know.
at trial,angelina raised a hearsay objection to strebendt testimony regarding torre statements.the district court made a factual finding that angelina and torre were engaged in a conspiracy to murder bryan,and that torre statements as reported by strebendt thus were admissible as statements of a under rule d e of the federal rules of evidence.
on december,torre was arrested and charged with bryan murder.following a jury trial,torre was convicted of murder in the first degree for killing bryan with the intent to profit from the policy proceeds.
angelina assertion of the fifth amendment privilege 
angelina asserted the fifth amendment privilege against at torre criminal trial and declined to testify.she likewise invoked the privilege during her deposition taken in the instant lawsuit,refusing to answer the following seven questions 
did you ever express to rafiel torre a desire to,quote,get rid of brian sic 
d id you ever tell rafiel to kill brian sic 
prior to brian sic murder,did you ever tell anybody that you and rafiel were going to move away together 
d id you have any involvement at all in brian sic richards murder 
did you ever proposition rafiel to kill brian sic richards 
did you ever ask gerald strebendt to kill brian sic richards 
did you ever ask rafiel torre to provide you with an alibi because you had killed brian sic richards 
the district court precluded angelina from testifying at trial as to her involvement,or lack thereof,in bryan murder because she had refused to answer questions about this subject during her deposition.angelina was permitted to testify about all other subjects.the district court also exercised its discretion to draw an adverse inference from angelina assertion of the fifth amendment privilege against.

iii.discussion 
preclusion of angelina testimony 
at trial,angelina attempted to testify that she did not have anything to do with bryan murder,but the district court precluded any testimony on this subject on the ground that angelina had asserted the fifth amendment privilege against when asked during her deposition about her involvement in the murder the district court found expressly that keith was prejudiced by angelina refusal to answer deposition questions about this subject.
trial courts generally will not permit a party to invoke the privilege against with respect to deposition questions and then later testify about the same subject matter at trial.see ftc sharp.the federal rules of civil procedure contemplate full and equal discovery so as to prevent surprise,prejudice and perjury during trial.id.b ecause the privilege may be initially invoked and later waived at a time when an adverse party can no longer secure the benefits of discovery,the potential for exploitation is apparent.sec graystone nash,cir.the rights of the other litigant must be taken into consideration when one party invokes the fifth amendment during discovery,but on the eve of trial changes his mind and decides to waive the privilege.at that stage,the adverse conducted discovery and prepared the case without the benefit of knowing the content of the privileged be placed at a disadvantage.id.at see also cartagena,cir a defendant may not use the fifth amendment to shield herself from the opposition inquiries during discovery only to impale her accusers with surprise testimony at trial.the opportunity to combat the newly available testimony might no longer exist,a new investigation could be required,and orderly trial preparation could be disrupted.graystone nash,at.because the privilege is constitutionally based,however,the competing interests of the party asserting the privilege,and the party against whom the privilege is invoked must be carefully balanced,and the detriment to the party asserting it should be no more than is necessary to prevent unfair and unnecessary prejudice to the other side.doe ex rel.glanzer,cir quoting graystone nash,at addressing propriety of adverse inference as a consequence of asserting fifth amendment privilege during pretrial deposition.
angelina argues,as she did at trial,that keith was not prejudiced by her assertion of the privilege at her deposition.she asserts that during the investigation of bryan murder,she answered all questions asked by the investigating officers,including questions as to whether she was involved in bryan murder,and that she denied any involvement unequivocally.she also contends that keith knew of those denials,and that her deposition testimony on the subject would not have provided any additional useful information.she further argues that her statements to the officers investigating bryan death were sufficient to waive her fifth amendment privilege,and that keith could have filed a motion to compel her to answer deposition questions regarding the issue of her involvement,or lack of involvement,in bryan death.
angelina arguments are not persuasive.many of the interviews with investigating officers occurred shortly after bryan death in december,approximately four years prior to the deposition.during those years,a number of significant events occurred that might have altered angelina testimony and certainly would have been proper subjects for inquiry during the deposition.most significantly,torre was arrested and convicted of bryan murder,and strebendt statements describing the conspiracy between torre and angelina came to light.angelina was not questioned about these events in any proceeding,as she did not testify at torre criminal trial and declined to answer questions regarding her alleged involvement in the murder during her deposition in the instant case.under these circumstances,we conclude that the district court finding of prejudice was warranted.
moreover,angelina statements to investigating officers in the days following bryan death did not waive her privilege against with respect to the later criminal proceeding against torre or with respect to the instant civil proceeding.see united states licavoli,cir holding that voluntary testimony before a grand jury did not waive the privilege at trial,because i t is settled that a waiver of the fifth amendment privilege is limited to the particular proceeding in which the waiver occurs see also mccarthy arndstein.holding that when a witness previous disclosure is not an actual admission of guilt or incriminating facts,the witness subsequently may assert the privilege and decline to testify as to matters that might incriminate him.
notably,the district court precluded angelina from testifying only as to the subject as to which she asserted the fifth amendment privilege,that is,her involvement or lack thereof in bryan murder.the court order was narrowly tailored to impose upon angelina only that detriment necessary to prevent unfair prejudice to keith.accordingly,the order did not constitute an abuse of discretion.
even if we were to find that the district court did err in precluding a portion of angelina testimony,any such error was harmless.when reviewing the effect of an evidentiary ruling in a civil case,we presume prejudice absent a showing that it is more probable than not that the same verdict would have been reached without the erroneous ruling.obrey johnson,cir citing haddad lockheed cal,cir.here,the district court made an explicit adverse credibility finding with respect to angelina assertion that she did not know the amount of the policy death benefit,and noted several instances in which angelina testimony conflicted with other evidence.the court also cited to more than a dozen facts in support of its determination that angelina was involved in bryan murder.based upon this record,we conclude that it is more probable than not that the district court would have reached the same verdict even if angelina had testified.
adverse inference 
in addition to precluding angelina from testifying with respect to her involvement in bryan murder,the district court drew an adverse inference from angelina assertion of the fifth amendment as to this subject.when a party asserts the privilege against in a civil case,the district court has discretion to draw an adverse inference from such assertion.see glanzer,at citing colello,at.a decision not to draw the inference poses substantial problems for an adverse party who is deprived of a source of information that might conceivably be determinative in a search for the truth.id.quoting graystone nash,at.however,under certain circumstances an adverse inference from an assertion of one privilege not to reveal information is too high a price to pay.id.at.the tension between one party fifth amendment rights and the other party right to a fair proceeding is resolved by analyzing each instance where the adverse inference was drawn,or not drawn,on a basis under the microscope of the circumstances of that particular civil litigation.id.citing graystone nash,at.the inference may not be drawn unless there is a substantial need for the information and there is not another less burdensome way of obtaining that information.id.citing serafino hasbro,cir.the district court must determine whether the value of presenting the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the party asserting the privilege.id.at citing.brink city of new york,cir.moreover,the inference may be drawn only when there is independent evidence of the fact about which the party refuses to testify.id.at.
angelina argues that there was no substantial need for her deposition testimony as to her involvement in bryan murder that in any event she offered trial testimony on this subject that there is no independent evidence of her involvement in the murder and that the adverse inference constituted a double penalty for her legitimate assertion of her privilege against,because she already was precluded from testifying as to her alleged involvement.
the district court found explicitly that there was a substantial need for angelina testimony with respect to the deposition questions she refused to answer,because those questions went to the central question in this case,which was whether angelina asked torre to murder bryan or had any other involvement in his death.as discussed previously,angelina asserts that she told investigators that she had no involvement in bryan death,and that obviously she would have said the same thing had she testified.angelina argues that under these circumstances keith was not deprived of any information necessary to litigate this case.angelina argument ignores the fact that the deposition questions at issue went beyond a simple,did you conspire to kill your husband for example,one question asked whether before the murder angelina told others that she and torre were going to move away together.another asked whether angelina ever told torre that she wanted to be rid of bryan.the responses to these questions are not apparent from the record,and in fact there are conflicts in the evidence as to the status of angelina relationships with bryan and with torre.keith was entitled to pursue these avenues of inquiry.
with respect to angelina offer of trial testimony on these subjects,the district court was within its discretion to preclude such testimony on the ground of prejudice to keith,as discussed above.although angelina had offered bare denials of her involvement during the investigation of bryan murder,by the time of her deposition a number of significant new facts h
