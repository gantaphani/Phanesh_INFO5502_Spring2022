background 
statutory background 
in,congress passed the care security act ltcsa or the act,to ensure that care insurance would be available to federal employees.long term care is chronic care that an individual may need for the rest of his or her entire life.gunson james,d.by passing the ltcsa,congress intended to create affordable options for dealing with the catastrophic expenses of nursing home care,home care,assisted living,and other forms of care services,wl at,quoted in gunson,d at.
the act gave the office of personnel management opm the responsibility to enter into group contracts known as master contracts with qualified insurance carriers,and thereby establish and administer a program through which federal employees could obtain care insurance.a,a.the result was the fltcip.gunson,d at.
under the fltcip,the federal government does not pay for insurance,nor does it guarantee the availability of care insurance to its employees.id.at.instead,the ltcsa merely establishes minimal underwriting standards for master contracts,and delegates the establishment of further underwriting requirements to the qualified carriers and opm.id.citing e.ultimately,the carrier determines which employees are eligible for insurance under the program and makes this determination based on the guidelines negotiated with opm.id.
factual background 
conger care insurance application and claim 
on july,conger,who was a employee of the national weather service at the time,applied for insurance under the fltcip by completing an online application.the application contained a series of questions necessary for a coverage period,and a separate set of questions required of applicants seeking an unlimited coverage period.question in the latter group asked,within the last years,have you had,been diagnosed with or been treated for any of the following conditions the conditions listed included 
diabetes excluding gestational diabetes 
disorder of the brain tremor,seizure disorder,head injury,tumor,infection,neuropathy,syncope,paralysis,any chronic or progressive neurological disorder 
memory loss and 
muscle disorder,fibromyalgia,polymyalgia rheumatica,chronic fatigue syndrome.
conger responded no to each of the conditions listed under question.joint appendix at.
on july,long term care partners ltcp sent conger a letter approving his application,and indicating that the policy would be effective october.ltcp is a joint venture formed by john hancock life insurance company and metlife for the sole purpose of providing and administering care insurance under the fltcip.gunson,d at.each person enrolled for coverage under the fltcip receives insurance from one of the two companies.conger received his coverage from metlife,but ltcp administered the policy.
with the letter,ltcp enclosed a schedule of benefits and a benefit booklet.the benefit booklet first page of text states 
notices please read carefully 
important our decision to issue coverage was based upon your responses to the questions on your application we may deny benefits or rescind your insurance coverage if your answers are incorrect or untrue for any reason.
at.a later provision of the benefit booklet states that the insurer ha s discretion to interpret the terms,conditions and provisions of the group policy,this benefit booklet and your schedule of benefits.at.
in april,conger retired from the national weather service after over thirty years of service.on august,he submitted a claim to ltcp for care benefits stemming from difficulties with mobility and balance.
ltcp investigation of conger past medical history 
ltcp initiated an investigation of conger prior medical history.it discovered that conger had experienced difficulties with his balance for at least five years and had sought medical attention for this problem.more specifically,ltcp learned that on september,conger sent a letter to prospero ishkanian stating,
i still have the balance problem and have to hold on to anything i can grab to move about.if i do hold onto something i feel like i will lose my balance completely.
i have noticed that for the past months to year that my walking becomes more difficult after hours on shift and gets progressively worse and by the time i work my entire shift my walking becomes very bad and seems to be related to poor balance.
these difficulties led conger to seek medical help from a number of different doctors over the following four years.for instance,conger made several visits to john morris an ear,nose,and throat specialist in late and early,apparently to determine whether sinus problems caused his unsteadiness.in december,a doctor note after an mri reported that conger was suffering from e xtensive sinusitis,but also noted that conger b rain demonstrate d no significant abnormality,essentially normal for patient age.specifically,i see no cerebellar abnormality.at.
shortly thereafter,conger began seeing a group of neurologists,including robert tillett and walter mcfarland.on april,one of the doctors sent a letter to morris reporting the results of a muscle biopsy.in this letter,the neurologist noted that the right quadricep muscle biopsy material was consistent with inactive mild neuropathic muscle changes and that t here was note of type ii myofiber grouping implying a neurogenic process.at.mris performed in did not produce any clear diagnoses,but the radiologists indicated that conger had degenerative spinal disc changes,at,and sinus opacification,at.the notes from conger november,mri indicate a n egative mri of the brain.id.
conger continued visiting tillett.in his notes after a visit in april,tillett indicated that conger had a gradually progressive ataxia and that his symptoms we re gradually getting worse.at.however,tillett also labeled conger condition very puzzling,noted that conger two brain mris were normal,and refrained from any diagnosis.id.he stated his impression that conger has a syndrome with spastic paraparesis with possibly some mild sensory changes and maybe some mild cognitive impairment he does not have any obvious underlying systemic illness.id.similarly,after seeing conger in november,tillett impression was that conger has a central process involving sensory pathways,corticospinal tract diffuse bilateral dysfunction.he is not ataxic in the cerebellar sense.his imbalance is more of a nonspecific coordination dysfunction that i think reflects his position loss as well as mild corticospinal tract dysfunction.id.at.tillett ordered a third mri,which again revealed no abnormalities.
ltcp rejection of conger claim 
on september,ltcp sent conger a letter rescinding his policy for unlimited benefits,but leaving in force his policy for a benefit period.the letter stated that conger medical records revealed a medical history of diabetes mellitus type,progressive ataxia,cognitive impairment and a syndrome with spastic paraparesis.at.ltcp concluded that conger incorrectly had answered question on his application for insurance by stating that he did not have diabetes,a brain disorder,memory loss,or a muscle disorder.
on september,conger requested a review of ltcp denial of unlimited benefits,emphasizing that his three mris were normal and that his doctors indicated that ataxia was only a symptom,not a diagnosis.in response,ltcp undertook an internal review.on november,mary lou asbell of ltcp faxed a request for review to carolyn jackson,a physician working for metlife.two days later,jackson sent a letter stating that she had reviewed the records and in her opinion,the medical records,dating from through,clearly document a progressive neurological disorder.at.jackson further noted that s ymptoms consistent with of sic a progressive neurological disorder that have resulted in significant neurological deficits impairment are a reason for declin ing an application for insurance whether or not an actual diagnosis is given.at.jackson letter did not discuss whether the medical records revealed a history of diabetes,memory loss,or muscle disorder,nor did it address the multiple mris that revealed no abnormalities.
the same day it received jackson letter,ltcp sent a letter to conger confirming its decision to rescind his unlimited care coverage,basing its decision solely on conger symptoms consistent with a progressive neurological disorder and omitting any reference to diabetes,ataxia,cognitive impairment,or spastic paraparesis.this letter further told conger that the decision was final and that no further review was available 
procedural background 
on september,metlife filed a complaint in the district court for the western district of kentucky seeking rescission and a declaratory judgment that either the contract for unlimited benefits was void ab initio or that metlife was entitled to rescind the contract.metlife filed an amended complaint seeking the same relief on november.substantively,metlife amended complaint pleads two claims.the first claim,for rescission,is based solely on conger response to question.the second claim,for declaratory relief,is based on the defendant concealment failure to disclose material facts regarding his medical condition.at first am.compl.at.
on april,metlife moved for judgment on the administrative record,and the district court granted metlife motion on october.metro.life ins.conger,d.in its opinion,the district court concluded that metlife had abused its discretion by concluding that conger answered question incorrectly because the record did not show that conger had a progressive neurological disorder.id.at.however,the district court concluded that conger materially misrepresented his condition by failing to discuss his symptoms and overall health condition,which would affect the risk undertaken by a care insurance provider.id.at.accordingly,the district court concluded that metlife decision to rescind the unlimited benefits portion of the policy was justified.id.conger now appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under a provision of the ltcsa granting federal courts jurisdiction over disputes arising under the fltcip.we have jurisdiction over conger appeal of the district court final judgment under.
the appropriate standard of review to apply to a district court judgment on the administrative record in an ltcsa eligibility dispute is a question of first impression.in the related arena of erisa benefit disputes,we review de novo a district court judgment on the administrative record.evans unumprovident,cir.neither party offers an argument for deviating from the de novo standard,nor do we see any reason to do so.accordingly,we adopt the erisa standard and hold that we review de novo a district court judgment on the administrative record in an ltcsa eligibility dispute.
iii.analysis 
first,we must determine whether conger response to question justified metlife decision to rescind conger coverage for an unlimited benefit period.because we conclude that it did not,we must proceed to the second metlife was nonetheless justified in rescinding the coverage because conger did not disclose his medical history on his application.ultimately,we conclude that metlife decision was not justified under this rationale either,and accordingly we reverse the district court judgment.
rescission effect of conger response to question 
as noted above,conger response to question is the sole basis for metlife rescission claim.metlife argues that conger medical history supports its conclusion that he had a progressive neurological disorder when he applied for insurance in july.on this basis,it contends that conger answer to question was inaccurate,and that it was justified in rescinding conger policy for an unlimited coverage period.the parties dispute the standard of review that we should apply in evaluating metlife conclusion.metlife claims that the policy vests it with discretion to make determinations as to whether conger application was inconsistent with his medical records and whether rescission of his coverage was appropriate.metlife br.at.accordingly,it maintains that we should review for abuse of discretion its conclusions regarding conger condition when he filled out his application,as the district court did.conger avers that we should review metlife conclusions de novo.because the policy proclaims that metlife has discretion regarding only the terms,conditions and provisions of the policy documents,at,and not discretion to interpret insureds medical records,we express some doubt that metlife discretion stretches as far as metlife now urges.see perez aetna life ins,cir en banc requiring erisa disability insurance plan to contain a clear grant of discretion for insurer to benefit from review,cert.denied,d we need not decide this issue,however,as we conclude that even under the standard,conger responses to question do not justify metlife decision to terminate his coverage.
in the similar context of erisa cases,we have held that applying the standard of review requires us to determine whether the insurer decision was arbitrary or capricious.gismondi united techs,cir.when the evidence supports a reasoned explanation for a particular outcome,that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.id.quoting davis.fin.ret.plan,cir.ultimately,we must determine whether the insurer decision is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and whether it is supported by substantial evidence.glenn metlife,cir quoting baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir.accordingly,we review not only the insurer conclusion,but also its reasoning.
metlife has not clarified which prong of question had,had been diagnosed with,or had been treated for it believes conger answered inaccurately.the record is clear,however,that conger was never diagnosed with a progressive neurological disorder,and metlife provides no indication that he received any treatment for such a condition.accordingly,no deliberate,principled reasoning process,glenn,at,could support the conclusion that conger was diagnosed with or treated for a progressive neurological disorder.
whether conger had a progressive neurological disorder in july is a thornier issue.conger had visited multiple doctors,none of whom diagnosed him with any such disorder.nonetheless,metlife concluded that conger had a progressive neurological disorder in july.to support such a conclusion,we would expect the administrative record to document clearly a progressive neurological disorder that was undiagnosed due to the doctors negligence or nonfeasance.however,our examination of the record makes clear that metlife determination that conger had a progressive neurological disorder was not the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process.
metlife reached its conclusion only by ignoring substantial contrary evidence in conger medical records.for instance,metlife did not address the doctor december,conclusion that conger b rain demonstrate d no significant abnormality,and was essentially normal for patient age,or the doctor statement that he saw no cerebellar abnormality.at.similarly,metlife ignored conger multiple brain mris that revealed no problems.metlife communications to conger through ltcp do not acknowledge these mris or even attempt to explain why they do not negate its conclusion regarding conger condition.the same is true of the internal communications between ltcp and metlife physician.metlife also ignored multiple neurologists failure to diagnose conger with a progressive neurological disorder or even to note an impression in their charts that he had such a disorder.further,metlife ignored tillett impression that conger ataxia was not cerebellar,which indicates that conger symptoms were not caused by a neurological disorder.
our previous decisions make clear that an administ
