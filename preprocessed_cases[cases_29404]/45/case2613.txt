background 
california rule of horizontal exhaustion in liability insurance law requires all primary insurance to be exhausted before an excess insurer must drop down to defend an insured,including in cases of continuing loss.community redevelopment agency aetna casualty surety th,d.unless there is excess insurance that describes underlying insurance and promises to cover a claim when that specific underlying insurance is exhausted vertical exhaustion,the rule of horizontal exhaustion applies to cases of alleged continuing property often happens when the insured is sued for construction defects.id.at,d.
also,in montrose chemical admiral ins.cal th,d,our supreme court adopted a continuous injury trigger as the test for the defense obligation of traditional,primary commercial liability insurance when the underlying claims involve continuous or deteriorating damage.the continuous injury trigger generally means absent consideration of some defense other than trigger itself that would render no claim in the underlying suit even potentially covered that all primary insurers over the time of the alleged continuous injury will be obligated to defend an underlying action claiming such continuous damage 
justice croskey prophesied in community redevelopment that the issue of horizontal versus vertical exhaustion would become increasingly common in light of the california supreme court adoption of the continuous injury trigger in montrose ii.see community redevelopment,supra,th at,d.this case validates justice croskey prophecy,in that it presents us with two major problems inherent in a rule of horizontal exhaustion interacting with a continuous injury trigger.
the first problem involves whether an excess insurer has a duty to drop down and defend in an underlying action alleging that the insured caused continuous property damage that existed at points in time prior to the inception of a policy of the only primary insurer that is defending the insured.on this point,the insured theory the insured is the appellant here is that since there is no way at all that the primary insurer would have any duty to indemnify the insured for any liability for property damage that occurred prior to the primary insurer policy inception,there was no other insurance available for that prior occurring property damage.therefore the excess insurer had to drop down and defend because of the potential for liability for the increment of damage occurring before the one defending primary policy period.
the solution to this problem is relatively easy.as we show below,under buss superior court cal th,d,the lone defending primary insurer had a duty to defend entirely,and so,from the point of view of the excess insurer,there was indeed other insurance is,other insurance to undertake the task of defending the insured.accordingly,the mere fact that portions of the continuous damage could not possibly have been covered by the primary insurer makes no difference as far as the excess insurer duty to defend is concerned.
the other problem builds on the implications of whether there is other insurance available within the meaning of the excess insurer policy when the lone defending primary insurer policy contains a retention or sir.in justice croskey own treatise on insurance law,he or his suggest that because sirs are not considered insurance,there would be no need to exhaust such an sir before the policy of an excess insurer covering another policy period could be triggered the question thus arises does the treatment of sirs as not insurance mean that,in a situation like the present case,there would be no other insurance available for the first x dollars x representing the retention spent on the underlying action,and therefore the excess insurer whose own underlying primary insurer has already exhausted would have a duty to defend to at least that extent 
we reject the idea,for several reasons,the primary of which is it is perfect legal logic leading to is,it would be contrary to the reasonable expectations of all parties by obliterating the distinction between excess and primary insurance.an excess insurer could end up defending a claim before the primary insurer had an obligation to defend that claim reasonable insureds do expect to receive a defense from a typically much cheaper excess policy unless all the expensive primary insurance they bought has been exhausted.moreover,such an idea ignores the substance of the lone defending primary insurer relationship with the insured.that relationship is to act as primary insurer,with a normal defense duty,not an excess insurer on top of other insurers.
in sum,under the facts of this case,the,lone defending primary insurer can not share the misery with the excess insurer.see state of california pacific indemnity th,d primary insurer on risk for one year out of had to bear the entire costs of defense of underlying action because insured had no other insurance during any of the other years.accordingly,the trial court judgment to that effect was correct,and is affirmed.
there was an underlying continuous damage construction defect suit filed in june by two homeowners against the developer of their property.specifically,the suit alleged that foundation vents were blocked with stucco,which stucco work was done by the insured,padilla construction,in we shall refer to padilla as the insured often in this opinion.the insured was brought into the suit two months later by way of by the developer.
the insured had four successive primary liability policies from january until march,
from the beginning of to end of transcontinental insurance.
from the beginning of to end of reliance insurance.
from the beginning of to march,legion indemnity.
from march,to march,steadfast insurance.
additionally,coincident with transcontinental primary policy january through the end of,the insured had two yearly commercial umbrella policies issued by transportation insurance.
in tabular form,over the period of the continuing loss,the policies may be expressed this way 
we will refer to transcontinental as the stage primary insurer,transportation as the stage umbrella insurer and steadfast the lone defending primary insurer of the introduction as the stage primary insurer.
of the four primary insurers,only two were available to defend the insured in the underlying suit.both the reliance and legion became insolvent,and both sides in this case have assumed that nothing was available from either carrier by way of a defense.we will also operate on that assumption.
the insured initially requested only stage primary insurer to provide it a defense of the underlying suit.the request was made in late september.however,after the stage primary insurer accepted the request for a defense under a reservation of rights,and hired a firm to defend the insured,the newly hired defense counsel then requested a defense from stage primary insurer.the request for a defense,however,was routed through the insured third party claims administrator.in april the third party claims administrator took the position,on the insured behalf,that it elect ed not to trigger the stage primary insurer policies,at least in part because the stage primary insurer policies had a retention.the mechanics of the retention are discussed in part iii below,when we set forth the policy language bearing on this case.
however,in june a few months after the insured at least putative election not to trigger stage primary insurer policies,the stage primary insurer notified the insured that,because of numerous other claims against the insured,its policies were nearing exhaustion.in response,the insured reiterated its position that it elected not to trigger the stage primary insurer policies,and requested its defense attorney to tender the defense and indemnity to transportation,which we will refer to as the stage umbrella insurer.the stage umbrella insurer quickly declined the tender on the ground that the stage primary insurer policies had not yet exhausted.
the stage primary insurer exhaustion formally occurred on december.along with the exhaustion came a formal notification to the insured that the stage primary insurer defense was being entirely withdrawn.the insured then assumed its own defense,and,at some point in,reached a settlement with the developer.the settlement was presumably or less,to which the stage primary insurer contributed.
this coverage litigation between the insured and the stage umbrella insurer ensued,the insured theory being that the stage umbrella insurer had a duty to drop down and defend and if necessary indemnify the insured once the stage primary insurer limits were exhausted.after an expedited court trial based on stipulated facts and exhibits,the trial court ruled that because there was still primary coverage available to the insured in the form of the stage primary insurer policies,the stage umbrella insurer was not obligated to provide a defense.
iii.the policies 
a.the stage primary insurer 
whatever else the stage primary insurer policies provide,they provide no coverage for occurrences not within the stage primary insurer policy period,here from march,through march.the policy language is this insurance applies to property damage only if the property damage occurs during the policy period.
the stage primary insurer policies were also clearly commercial general liability cgl policies,a fact also stipulated to by the parties.that is,the policies contained a typical cgl insuring clause accordingly,the premiums for the two stage were costly,respectively and for the two successive policies.
and,by the same token,the policies were also their other insurance they were primary policies.here is the language if other valid and collectible insurance is available to the insured for a loss we cover under coverage a or b of this policy,our obligations are limited as follows primary insurance this insurance is primary except when there is other insurance applying on a primary basis.then below applies.excess insurance this insurance is excess over any of the other insurance,whether primary,excess,contingent or on any other basis.when this insurance is excess,we will have no duty to defend any claim or suit that any other insurer has a duty to defend.if no other insurer defends,we will undertake to do so,but we will be entitled to the insured rights against all those other insurers.when this insurance is excess over other insurance,we will pay only our share of the amount of the loss,if any,that exceeds the sum of the total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the loss in the absence of this insurance and the total of all deductible and amounts under any other insurance.italics added.
as to the retention endorsement,it began with language that this endorsement modifies insurance provided under the commercial general liability coverage part,then provided a schedule showing that the retention was per occurrence,but per claim and aggregate.the insured was also required to notify the insurer if there was potential penetration of the retention at of self insured retention.
the text that followed the schedule was clear that the insured was responsible for defense costs,as well as indemnity costs,up to the retention amount of hence it was truly a retention as distinct from a deductible.the self insured retention endorsement defense costs included began with a schedule listing per occurrence as the retention amount,and underneath the schedule provided if a per occurrence self insured retention amount is shown in the schedule of this endorsement,you shall be responsible for payment of all damages and defense costs for each occurrence or offense,until you have paid self insured retention amounts and defense costs equal to the per occurrence amount shown in the schedule,subject to the provisions of.below,if applicable.below involved aggregate retention,which,on this insured schedule,was specifically not applicable.the per occurrence amount is the most you will pay for self insured retention amounts and defense costs arising out of any one occurrence or offense,regardless of the number of persons or organizations making claims or bringing suits because of the occurrence or offense.thus,after the was exhausted,the stage primary insurer was obligated to defend.
one of the facts to which the parties stipulated was that the insured defense costs in the underlying suit currently exceeds.
b.the stage umbrella insurer 
there is no argument that the stage umbrella insurer policies were primary policies.they were.in comparison with the annual premiums paid by the insured for the state primary insurer policy,the cost of the two stage umbrella insurer policies was even for the a relatively cheap and a year respectively for the years and.
the stage umbrella insurer policies had an other insurance clause which makes its insurance excess over any unexhausted primary policies otherwise providing coverage to the insured,regardless of whether they are listed on the umbrella carrier schedule of underlying insurance.here is the entire other insurance clause from the policy whenever you are covered by other primary excess or insurance not scheduled on this policy as scheduled underlying insurance,this policy shall apply only in excess of,and will not contribute with,such other insurance.this policy shall not be subject to terms,conditions or limitations of other insurance.in the event of payment under this policy where you are covered by such other insurance,we shall be subrogated to all of your rights of recovery against such other insurance and you shall execute and deliver instruments and papers,including assignment of rights,and do what is necessary to secure such rights.
the stage primary insurer was indeed listed on the schedule of underlying insurance in the two policies in the record.
another section of the policies dealt with defense payment and related duties which further bore on the issue of the policies interactions with other policies.we will call this clause the defense clause because it fastened an obligation onto the insurer given the circumstance of exhaustion by all primary insurers.the defense clause read in pertinent part.if a claim or suit alleges damages covered by underlying policies and the obligation of all underlying insurers either to investigate and defend the insured or pay the costs of such investigation and defense ceases solely through the exhaustion of all underlying limits of liability through payment of a combination of covered expenses,settlements or judgments for incidents taking place during our policy period,then we will either assume the investigation and defense of the insured against suits seeking damages or if we elect not to assume the investigation and defense in.above,we will reimburse the insured for reasonable defense costs and expenses incurred with our written consent.we will investigate and defend suits brought against an insured for a claim or suit that alleges damages from an incident not covered under scheduled underlying insurance and unscheduled underlying insurance but which seeks damages arising out of an incident otherwise covered by this policy 
the stage umbrella insurer policies also defined underlying insurer this way underlying insurer means an insurer whose policy covers an incident also covered by this policy but does not include insurers whose policies were purchased specifically to be in excess of this policy.it includes all insurers providing unscheduled underlying insurance and scheduled underlying insurance.
the policies further defined unscheduled underlying insurance this way unscheduled underlying insurance means insurance policies available to an insured,whether primary excess or otherwise except the policies listed in the schedule of underlying insurance.unscheduled underlying insurance does not include insurance purchased specifically to be in excess of this policy.
iv.analysis 
a.the policy period problem 
the main focus of the insured briefing involves the logical implications of the policy period language in the stage primary insurer policy.here is the logic 
the underlying case involved continuing property damage that spanned the policy periods of four insurers,from to at least the time of the lawsuit in.
there is no question that the stage primary insurer policies do not cover liability for property damage outside its policy period,the period before march,which,we might add,constitutes the lion share of the time on the risk.
by definition,the continuing loss encompassed a period clearly not covered by any of the stage primary insurer policies,all the damage for which the insured was alleged to be responsible that occurred before the state primary insurer came on the risk.
therefore,there the insolvencies of the stage and primary insurers and the exhaustion of the stage primary insurer coverage at all for whatever quantum of property damage or to use justice baxter phrase from montrose ii increment of harm that might be ascribed to the loss period prior to march,when the stage primary insurer came on the risk.
therefore,there was thus at least some damage for which the insured was being sued that was not even potentially covered by the stage primary insurer policy.
and,since there was no coverage at all for that increment of harm,it follows that the stage umbrella insurer other insurance exclusion was not implicated there track the language of that other primary insurance to cover those increments of harm.
ergo,the stage umbrella insurer was obligated to drop down and defend the underlying suit.
the insured argument is not without considerable force.no court could,in good conscience given the unambiguous language of the stage primary insurer policy period language,say there was even potential coverage for the insured liability for property damage that occurred in the period through the stage umbrella insurer period,or,for that matter,any property damage that occurred prior to march.
but there is a core flaw in the logic.it confuses the obligation of the stage primary insurer to is indeed limited only to that increment of harm after march,the obligation of the stage primary insurer to defend a suit that includes an increment of harm after march.if the stage primary insurer had any defense duty at all to defend the underlying lawsuit against the,because of the potential for coverage raised by,it had a duty to defend the entirety of that underlying lawsuit,including that portion of the underlying lawsuit asserting claims for damage occurring before march.as the supreme court explained in buss superior court,supra,cal th at page,d,an insurer must defend an entire action when there is at least one claim that is potentially the balance of the action,which may press claims that are not even potentially covered 
to be sure,the buss case involved an underlying mixed action,which included claims both potentially and not potentially covered,and therefore the insurer had a duty to defend entirely.accord,horace mann.ins.barbara cal th,d,since an insurer has a duty to defend the entire third party action if any claim encompassed within it potentially may be covered absent allocation,as noted above,the mere fact that horace mann could not indemnify lee for the molestation did not eliminate its duty to defend other,possibly covered claims.presley homes,american states ins.th,d complete defense required even though framing issues involving work of additional insureds could be easily paid for separately.
however,after buss,our high court decided transport indemnity cal th,d,which did involve damage stretched across policy periods,and held that one insurer duty to defend extended to underlying actions where damage putatively occurred during some other insurer policy period.see id.at,d.
yet there is one more wrinkle to the problem.in articulating the principle as to time,as distinct from covered claims,the court framed the rule as to an insurer duty to defend an action alleging continuous damage extending beyond its policy period in terms of time forward,not time past.
the relevant passages are worth quoting in the text here,because it shows that the high court was choosing its words carefully,so as to keep the issue open for another day generally,the insurers assume that their contractual duty to defend is limited to only that part of a mixed claim that comes within a policy period because specified harm may possibly have been caused by an included occurrence therein.they are wrong.as explained above,the duty to defend embraces all the parts of such a claim in which some harm may possibly have resulted,whether within the policy period or beyond.it bears repeating if specified harm may possibly have been caused by an included occurrence and may possibly have resulted,at least in part within the policy period,the duty to defend perdures to all points of time at which some such harm may possibly have resulted thereafter.its transport insurance duty to defend was triggered when specified harm was possibly caused by an included occurrence,because at least some such harm may possibly have resulted within the policy period in the first year.it extended to all specified harm that was possibly caused by an included occurrence,even if some such harm may possibly have resulted beyond the policy period in the succeeding years,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
to give an example if insurer a policy period extended from,say,to,and there was an action against its insured alleging continuous property damage that took place over the years through,insurer a would have a duty to defend the entire action.assuming,of course,that there was not some other basis that would relieve insurer a of its duty to defend even for damages that were alleged to have occurred in the period through.our case,by contrast,is like one where the action against the insured alleged continuous property damage that took place in the period through.does this twist make a difference 
while we do have a supreme court case on point,a couple of decisions of the court of appeal indicate that the requirement to defend entirely extends even to underlying actions where the continuous property damage happens before the policy period.
first there is an observation from haskel,superior court th,d.there,an insurer unilateral attempt to only pay for a percent share of a total defense percent being calculated as that insurer pro rata share of its time on the risk of a continuing treated as the functional equivalent of a total denial and also rejected.id.at,fn,d.the court observed that barbara meant that once there was any defense burden at all,that burden must be fully borne,with allocations of that burden among other responsible parties to be determined later.ibid.
second,and more directly on point,is state of california pacific indemnity th,d,which rejected the notion of restricting an insurer defense obligation to just an amount pro rated based on its time on the risk.the state of california pacific indemnity case is particularly instructive in regards to the case before us because it involved allegations of underlying continuing damage that continued on for until the insured had elected to for all but one of the years of continuing damage,and that year was september through september is,about years of continuing property damage had elapsed before the insurer policy period making it similar to the present case in that respect.but it made no difference.the insurer may have been on the risk for one year but it was required to provide the entire defense.
here is the key passage from state of california pacific indemnity the comprehensive general liability insurance policy in this case covered property damage,and pacific indemnity does not dispute that at least some of the claims were potentially covered.this triggered pacific indemnity contractual duty to defend claims potentially covered.buss,supra,cal th at,d.its prophylactic duty required it to defend the entire action,even if not all claims were potentially covered.id.at,d,italics in original.pacific indemnity argument that its duty to defend should be apportioned with its insured based on the one year of its coverage is contrary to california law.state of california pacific indemnity,supra,th at,d.
we see nothing in state of california pacific indemnity or the haskel observation to justify departing from the rule they articulate or at least adumbrate.the main possible conceptual objection to a common law rule that obligates a defending insurer to defend entirely,even though there are damages not even potentially covered because they occurred prior to the policy period,is the rule see.there is a discussion of the rule in montrose ii,supra,cal th at pages through,d,and that discussion relying on section of the insurance code makes it clear that it is enough that the damage be unknown,as distinct from already existent but unknown 
indeed,the facts of montrose ii apply at least equally to the case before us,if not a fortiori.there,the insured even received a potentially responsible person letter from the epa indicating that the insured might be held liable for cleanup costs before the inception of the insurer policy montrose ii,supra,cal th at,d,and that fact still did not bar potential coverage,or relieve the insurer of its duty to defend under the policies it had issued id.at,d.in the present case,there has been no assertion that the insured had any knowledge at all of the underlying lawsuit that would be filed in june,much less a letter from a public agency telling it that it could be sued as a responsible party.
the montrose ii court also noted that since the insurer policies did not purport to cover damage or injury that occurred prior to the time those policies went into effect montrose ii,supra,cal th at,d,the existence and extent of prospective injuries were clearly unknown and contingent from the insured viewpoint at the time it first purchased its policies from the insurer.ibid.the same thing could be said in the case before us the existence and extent of the damages were readily unknown and contingent from the insured viewpoint at the time it purchased the policies from the stage primary insurer.
we need only add,by way of strengthening our resolve to follow state of california pacific indemnity,that buss has already solved the essential problem of the potential for inequity when a common law duty to defend entirely collides with contract language clearly precluding any coverage for property damage outside of the policy period and doubly so for any property damage occurring before the policy period.the inequity arises because the law gives the insured something the insured did pay defense of claims never even potentially covered.see buss,supra,cal th at,d.the solution,said the buss court,is allowing the insurer right to seek reimbursement if the insured is willing to run the necessary gauntlet of preservation of that right.
this is not an case,so we need not detail just exactly might be required for a successful insurer reimbursement action here.thus we do not comment on any potential buss action brought by the stage primary insurer against the insured for reimbursement for money spent defending damage claims that were never even potentially covered.nor do we comment on the ensuing question of whether,in such a hypothetical reimbursement action,the insured might have a valid claim for indemnity or reimbursement from the stage umbrella insurer 
buss made clear that the insurer can seek reimbursement for money spent on claims never even potentially covered,and we see no reason the same rule should not apply for money spent on damages never even potentially covered assuming,for sake of argument,that defense costs for such damages could be segregated out.both claims and damages are equally uncovered.the insurer duty to defend the entirety of a lawsuit including such claims or damages is equally a matter of a prophylactic common law rule aimed at protecting the insured because the insured is entitled to an immediate and meaningful defense.buss,supra,cal th at,d.
all of which is by way of saying that there was indeed primary insurance available to the insured as regards the defense of the underlying suit from the stage primary insurer,even though there was an increment of harm claimed in the suit that was not even potentially covered by the stage primary insurer policy.there being such primary insurance available,there would be no defense obligation triggered by the stage umbrella insurer defense clause,while its other insurance affirmatively relieved it of any obligation to defend.
b.the retention problem 
the retention in the stage primary insurer policy,however,presents conceptually a somewhat more difficult problem as to the obligations of the stage umbrella insurer under the circumstances of this case.consider the following syllogism 
we know,from,that is not insurance.see,supra,cal th at,fn,d.and while cautioned readers that nothing it was saying was contrary to the rule that an excess insurer does not have a duty to defend an insured until primary insurance in the form of a retention is exhausted id.at,fn,d,the two appellate cases that the court cited for that proposition,nabisco,transport indemnity d.and city of oxnard twin city fire insurance th,d,are distinguishable from the case before us no case has yet held that an excess insurer with an other insurance clause that does not include a specific reference to has no duty to drop down until the retention and any primary insurance overlying that retention is exhausted.
the other insurance clause of the stage umbrella insurer policy operates,by its terms,only when there is other insurance.whenever you are covered by other insurance not scheduled on this policy as scheduled underlying insurance,this policy shall apply only in excess italics added.
from the viewpoint of the insured,the stage primary insurer retention clause did not provide for a defense obligation.that is,the stage primary insurer was not responsible for anything until the retention was reached indeed,the schedule required the insured to warn the insurer when expenses reached the mark.in other words,for the first,the insured really had no insurance from the stage primary insurer 
since the insured had no other insurance for the first of the claim against it,the stage umbrella insurer other insurance clause could not operate to make it excess of the stage primary insurer at least as to that amount.it was obligated to defend with dollar being,after all,no other insurance to pay dollars one through thousand 
the flaw in this logic is the assumption that the retention can be meaningfully separated from the stage primary insurer policy,of which it is a creature,for purposes of the stage umbrella insurer other insurance clause.in classic insurance law terms,treating the retention as a separate entity from the stage primary insurer policy defeats the reasonable expectations of all the parties,including the insured.it obliterates the distinction between primary and excess insurance.
we first off note the temporal anomaly that such parsing creates.an earlier excess insurer would have a duty to drop down and defend a claim beneath the coverage of a later primary.that counterintuitive,to say the least.
we have already noted the great disparity in the premiums charged by the stage primary insurer and the stage umbrella insurer.the yearly premiums charged by the former were no less than to times the yearly premiums charged by the latter.a primary policy imposes on an insurer a primary duty of defense while an excess or secondary or umbrella policy attaches only after primary coverage has been exhausted hence the latter is cheaper.olympic ins.employers surplus lines ins.d,fn.see also signal companies,harbor ins.cal d,noting premium differences between excess and primary coverages.a primary policy can fund a long war of attrition.by contrast,defense obligations of an excess policy is far less likely to be triggered,and that improbability is reflected in a cheaper premium.
but even more fundamentally bearing on the reasonable expectations of the parties,treating a retention lying beneath a primary policy as a period of for purposes of whether an earlier excess policy is triggered in a continuing loss scenario is to ignore the terms and expectations of the overlying primary policy.
the retention was part and parcel of the stage primary insurer policies.as alluded to above,the retention is itself a creature of the primary policy.the stage primary insurer policy announced that it was,under normal circumstances,a primary policy and would interact with other polici
