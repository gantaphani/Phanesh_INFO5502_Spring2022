norwest mortgage,norwest appeals from a judgment granting state farm fire and casualty company state farm motion for summary judgment and dismissal of its complaint for insurance bad faith.state farm had denied a claim by norwest for the proceeds of a fire insurance policy on a residence that norwest acquired through a nonjudicial foreclosure sale.the trial court concluded that norwest was insured only to the extent it had a security interest in the residence and the security interest was extinguished when it tendered a full credit bid at the foreclosure sale.
norwest appeals,contending it made a mistake in tendering full credit bids and the trustee sales at which the bids were made were later properly rescinded.
factual and procedural background 
in december,jesus and norma marroquin,the owners of real property located at mackennas gold avenue in palmdale,obtained a loan secured by a first deed of trust on the property.norwest predecessor was the beneficiary on the deed of trust.the marroquins,who used the property as a rental unit,obtained a rental dwelling policy from state farm,policy number.the policy included the following provision

on december,a fire severely damaged the property.jesus marroquin reported the loss to state farm,but said since the property was in foreclosure he was not interested in pursuing the claim.norwest also learned of the fire and initiated the insurance claim procedure.
in anticipation of the trustee sale scheduled for april,norwest retained ati foreclosure services,ati to handle its bidding process on the property and also to act as trustee at the sale.ati had access to norwest computer system that included norwest individual foreclosure files.the marroquin property file had a comment stating the property had sustained substantial fire damage.on april,one day before the scheduled trustee foreclosure sale,norwest,as was its practice,posted the unpaid principal,interest,fees and costs of and instructed ati to add its fees and costs to these figures.ati fees and costs were.ati did not notice the comment about the fire damage and did not contact norwest for further instructions.
on april,the first of three trustee foreclosure sales was held.norwest,which was the only bidder,made a full credit bid of and obtained the property.the trustee deed upon sale was never recorded.

on july,norwest informed state farm it had rescinded the foreclosure sale and a new trustee foreclosure sale was scheduled.
on november,a second trustee foreclosure sale was held again,norwest was the only bidder.norwest had replaced ati with lonestar mortgage services,llc,lonestar as the new foreclosing trustee.contrary to norwest instructions to bid,lonestar made a full credit bid on norwest behalf at the november foreclosure sale.norwest claimed it rescinded the second trustee sale when it learned that a full credit bid had been made and instructed lonestar not to record the trustee deed and to republish for another foreclosure sale

subsequently,norwest submitted the trustee deed upon sale for to state farm in pursuit of the insurance claim.state farm again rejected the claim.
in june,norwest filed the underlying complaint against state farm for breach of contract,bad faith and declaratory relief.
discussion 
norwest contends its full credit bid did not relieve state farm of its obligation to pay the claim because it rescinded the trustee sales.the contention is without merit.
