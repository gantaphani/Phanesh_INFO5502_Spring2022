this case involves an appeal by south lorain merchants association health welfare benefit plan and trust ordering it to pay to the university hospitals of cleveland the full amount billed for services rendered to the son of a participant in south lorain merchants association benefit plan.for the reasons discussed below,we reverse the district court judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
dylan ranallo was admitted to university hospital for medical treatment on june.dylan is the son of robert ranallo,who is a participant in south lorain merchants association benefit plan.on june,robert ranallo executed a document entitled university hospitals of cleveland consent form that purported to assign to university hospital the insurance rights and benefits relating to dylan care.on july,university hospital sent a bill totaling for services provided as part of dylan care to commerce benefits group,the company that south lorain merchants association employed to serve as its administrator.on november,commerce issued a document entitled explanation of benefits.the explanation of benefits contained a section entitled charge amount which listed charges submitted by university hospital totaling along with a deduction of,pursuant to a preferred provider organization discount.private healthcare systems,a nonparty here,was the source of the discount.
south lorain merchants association,through its agent cardinal utilization management,another nonparty,conducted an audit of the university hospital bill.the audit was conducted without prior notice to university hospital and without a university hospital representative in attendance.the numeric summary of cardinal audit was provided to commerce on september.the audit was finally completed on october.on november,an explanation of benefits for the services was sent to university hospital along with a check for.the explanation of benefits included the original deduction of based on a preferred provider organization discount.the explanation of benefits also contained a deduction of based on charges which the audit concluded were not covered under the plan because they were in excess of usual,customary,and reasonable amounts authorized under the coverage.
on december,university hospital filed an appeal from the partial denial of benefits.this appeal was not addressed by either south lorain merchants association or its agents.south lorain merchants association also later determined that its preferred provider organization discount was under the buckeye preferred network preferred provider organization contract,rather than the private healthcare systems contract noted above.as a result,south lorain merchants association concluded that it was entitled to only a percent preferred provider organization discount rather than a percent discount.south lorain merchants association therefore sent university hospital an additional payment of on august,in order to remedy the discrepancy but still stood by its decision to refuse payment of,the amount allegedly not authorized under the plan.
university hospital then brought suit in the united states district court seeking to be paid for the charges that south lorain merchants association had declined to pay.the court concluded that the factual record was incomplete.it therefore dismissed the case and remanded the matter to the south lorain merchants association administrator for further factual finding citing our decision in sanford harvard,cir in support of its remand order.the south lorain merchants association administrator made the required findings of facts and decided that south lorain merchants association had already paid the proper amount to university hospital.the plan administrator then sent its decision,along with the materials it used to reach that decision,to the district court and the district court reinstated the case.without a hearing and acting summarily,the district court concluded that south lorain merchants association owed university hospital.the district court decision was based on several alleged factors.first,the district court concluded that south lorain merchants association failure to provide university hospital with an appeal violated due process.additionally,the district court concluded that south lorain merchants association had likely miscalculated the preferred provider organization discount it was due because the proper discount under the buckeye preferred network contract was twenty percent.the district court concluded,however,that this error was immaterial because south lorain merchants association was not entitled to any discount or any deduction because it had failed to follow procedural requirements of its plan.specifically,south lorain merchants association had failed to comply with the buckeye preferred network contract that states that any discount is not available unless a hospital is paid within sixty days from receipt of a clean claim.as a result,the district court concluded,south lorain merchants association was not entitled to any preferred provider organization discount.the district court also concluded that the results of the audit could not be used because south lorain merchants association violated the preferred provider organization contract with buckeye preferred network,which stated that any audit had to take place upon ten days prior written notice to university hospital.the district court thus decided that south lorain merchants association owed university hospital the full amount requested by university hospital.south lorain merchants association then filed this timely appeal.
following remand to the plan administrator,the district court considered all the evidence before it and concluded that south lorain merchants association was liable to university hospital for the full amount university hospital submitted to south lorain merchants association.we review for clear error the district court findings of fact and we review de novo the district court conclusions of law.anderson international union,united plant guard workers of america,cir.
the south lorain merchants association raises three claimed errors on appeal.first,the association claims that the district court erred in reviewing the plan administrator decision de novo rather than under an abuse of discretion standard.second,south lorain merchants association claims that the district erred in denying it a preferred planned organization discount based on the university hospital contract with the buckeye preferred network.finally,south lorain merchants association claims that the district court erred by requiring south lorain merchants association to pay university hospital in excess of the amount covered by the plan terms.
before the case was sent back to the plan administrator for further factual findings,both parties and the district court agreed that de novo review of the denial of reimbursement was proper.following the plan administrator findings of facts and conclusion that south lorain merchants association had properly reimbursed university hospital,however,south lorain merchants association asserted that the proper standard of review was arbitrary and capricious.south lorain merchants association assertions were based on the supreme court holding in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,declaring that while de novo review of a plan administrator decision is the ordinary standard,the proper standard of review may be arbitrary and capricious where the benefit plan gives the administrator or the fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility or construe the terms of the plan.here the language clearly vests the plan administrator with such discretionary authority and thus the arbitrary and capricious standard of review would normally apply as it should here.
the district court,however,did not apply the arbitrary and capricious standard of review on the grounds that the sar stipulated administrative record lacks documentation required under vanderklok provident life acc.ins,cir,and therefore,the decision of the south lorain merchants association plan administrator,on appeal filed by the plaintiff,violated plaintiff due
