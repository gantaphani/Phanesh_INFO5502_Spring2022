background 
clearone is a,audio conferencing products company in salt lake city,utah.national union of pittsburgh,pennsylvania provides comprehensive commercial insurance policies for businesses.edward bagley is clearone single largest shareholder and is on the board of directors.
in september,clearone applied for a directors officers d o liability policy with national union.as part of the process,clearone was required to complete an insurance application.one question asked applicants to provide copies of various documents or to indicate whether the documents are available on the internet,including a form.see question,aplts.app.at.clearone directed national union to its website to obtain the latest report filed with the sec the latest interim financial statement available and all registration statements filed with the sec within the last twelve months.id.furthermore,in response to other questions seeking a list of the applicant executives,clearone responded,see.see question a and b,id.at.in bold capital letters,the application declares,all written statements and materials furnished to the insurer in conjunction with this application are hereby incorporated by reference into this application and made a part hereof.id.at.
the application also includes a severability clause.provision of the application states,
it is further agreed that in regard to the applicability of questions,and above the facts pertaining to any knowledge possessed by any insured other than the knowledge information possessed by the person s executing the application shall not be imputed to any other insured person only facts pertaining to and knowledge possessed by any past,present or future chairman of the board,president,chief executive officer ceo,chief operating officer coo,chief financial officer cfo and general counsel of the organization shall be imputed to the organization.
id.at emphasis added.
the application was signed by frances flood,the president and ceo of clearone,on behalf of the corporation.as part of the application,she warranted,the undersigned authorized of the applicant declares that the statements set forth herein are true.id.
upon receipt of the application,national union undertook a review and analysis of the documents.national union thoroughly examined the,the,and other financial documents provided by clearone.after reviewing clearone documents,national union had additional questions about the financial statements.brady head,a senior vice president of national union,emailed a clearone representative asking specifically if the company certified its financials as required by and if there were any issues with respect to its revenue recognition practices.head received answers to those questions in a conference call with susie strohm,clearone cfo,who indicated there were no issues and the financials were certified.national union issued a d o policy to clearone valued at million to run from october,until october.
in early,clearone publicly acknowledged that its financial statements for the previous two years were not reliable,later admitting that shareholders equity and net income had been substantially overstated the overstatement arose from clearone revenue recognition practices.clearone entered into distributor agreements with a policy of recognizing revenue when the product was shipped to distributors.it required distributor payments within days,but the common practice was to permit distributors to remit payment for the products if and when the products were subsequently sold.this practice was known as pay as you go or pay as you sell and led to the accelerated recognition of revenue not yet received.
the admission of financial irregularities precipitated several shareholder suits and an investigation by the sec.in anticipation of these matters,clearone notified national union as a prelude to tendering a claim under the policy.in response,national union announced its intention to rescind the insurance contract ab initio based on the financial misstatements,which it relied on in issuing the policy.
clearone later entered into a consent decree with the sec,enjoining any future securities law violations without admitting any guilt.based in part on national union refusal to honor the d o policy,clearone also settled a class action suit by its shareholders,paying million and issuing million shares of common stock to the class plaintiffs.
procedural history 
clearone and bagley brought this diversity action to enforce their rights under the million d o liability insurance policy.they each asserted a breach of contract claim and a tort claim based on bad faith,and both sought punitive damages.bagley claims specifically relate to the dilution of his ownership share based on the distribution of additional company shares as part of the settlement of the class action suit.he claims that the issuance of the million shares of clearone stock diluted his ownership and effectively forced him to contribute a portion of his shares in the company to the settlement.national union principal defense is that it properly rescinded the policy after discovering it had issued the policy in reliance upon material misrepresentations made by clearone in its insurance application and related materials.
both sides filed cross motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment.in granting summary judgment for national union,the district court held national union properly rescinded the insurance policy in its entirety under utah law,and rejected bagley claims since he suffered his loss in the capacity of a shareholder and not as a clearone director.the court rulings rendered moot the other summary judgment motions.
both clearone and bagley appeal the decision.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard that the district court applied.montero meyer,cir.under that standard,summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence allows a reasonable jury to resolve the issue either way and is material when it is essential to the proper disposition of the claim.haynes level,cir internal quotation omitted.on an appeal from a motion for summary judgment,we construe all factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment was entered.nish,rumsfeld,cir.
in addition,we review the district court interpretation and determination of state law de novo.hartford cas,cir.where the state highest court has not addressed the issue presented,the federal court must determine what decision the state court would make if faced with the same facts and issue.oliveros mitchell,cir internal quotation omitted.
iii.analysis 
clearone contends the district court erred by misapprehending the elements of rescission under utah law,the severability clause effect on rescission,and whether any claims survive rescission.we consider each contention in turn.
rescission 
starting with the rescission claim,clearone first contends it never gave an unqualified warranty that its financials were accurate,and therefore no misstatement exists to serve as a basis of rescission.it also contends that the elements of rescission were not satisfied on summary judgment because genuine issues of material facts exist as to knowledge of the misstatement,materiality of the misstatement,reasonable reliance on the misstatement and the estoppel defense to reliance,and the innocence of misstatements thereby defeating rescission.
rescission of an insurance contract is governed by utah law.under of the utah code,n o misrepresentation or breach of an affirmative warranty affects the insurer obligations under the policy unless a the insurer relies on it and it is either material or is made with intent to deceive or b the fact misrepresented or falsely warranted contributes to the loss.utah code ann.
in interpreting these elements,a utah appellate court has construed the misrepresentation term to contain a scienter element.derbidge mutual protective ins,utah.misrepresentation is something more than an innocent misstatement.id.at.consequently,an innocent misstatement does not constitute a misrepresentation for purposes of rescission 
national union sought rescission under the theory that it relied on clearone material misrepresentation in its insurance application.see a.accordingly,in order to invalidate clearone insurance policy,national union must first establish a misstatement,lack of innocence,materiality,and reliance.after reviewing the record and examining utah law,we agree with the district court that national union sufficiently demonstrated three,materiality,and reliance.nevertheless,we disagree that lack of innocence was established as a matter of law and we therefore remand on that issue.
misstatement 
preliminarily,the parties had divergent views as to the nature of the misstatement at issue.while it is uncontested that clearone financial statement falsely represented clearone true financial condition,see aplts.br.at clearone and bagley do not deny that the financial statements reviewed by national union while underwriting d o policy were misstated,two theories of the nature of the misstatement flow from the representations in the insurance application.
on one hand,national union claims the false financial statements themselves constitute the misstatement since they were incorporated into the application.clearone argues,on the other hand,that the financial statements could not serve as the basis of rescission because clearone never gave an unqualified representation that its financials were accurate,id.at,and incorporating the by reference into the application contravenes both utah law and an insurance policy provision against incorporation of items not found in the policy or application.instead,clearone maintains that the only possible misstatement flows from flood answer to two questions in the application which warranted against any knowledge or information that would give rise to a claim under the policy.see questions a and b,aplts.app.at.
the district court agreed with national union and held that the false financials constituted a misstatement for purposes of rescission.we concur.question of the application clearly asks applicants to provide copies of the latest report filed with the securities and exchange commission.in response,clearone directed national union to its website to gain the requested forms.the application then states,all written statements and materials furnished to the insurer in conjunction with this application are hereby incorporated by reference into this application and made a part hereof.aplts.app.at.the incorporated financials in turn become a basis of the contract issuing a policy between national union and clearone.id.at.
incorporation by reference 
taking clearone second argument first,we perceive no legal infirmity in incorporating the financials into the insurance application.under utah law,an insurance policy may not contain any agreement or incorporate any provision not fully set forth in the policy or in an application or other document attached to and made a part of the policy at the time of its delivery,unless the policy,application,or agreement accurately reflects the terms of the incorporated agreement,provision,or attached document.utah code ann.a.national union d o policy also states that t he application and all relevant documents will be attached to the policy at the time of delivery.aplts.app.at.clearone interprets these provisions as precluding the incorporation of the by reference.
neither the plain language nor the purpose behind the statute support clearone conclusion.first,a restricts only agreement s or provision s from incorporation into the insurance contract.the form is neither.instead,it is a part of the factual predicate of the application,serving to induce issuance of the policy.the financial form was not a part of the policy coverage terms,and was analytically no different than other information clearone provided to national union.as the utah supreme court has stated,the statute aim is to ensure that the entire insurance contract is contained in one document so that the insured can determine from the policy exactly what coverage he or she has.cullum farmers ins,utah.when insureds can determine their coverage under the policy solely by relying on the policy document,then a is not implicated.see also progressive cas.ins.dalgleish,utah.accordingly,we find that this statute does not apply to clearone financial statements incorporated into the national union application.
clearone first argument that it never gave an warranty as to the accuracy of its financials is also unpersuasive.clearone bases its argument on the fact that the financials included only a tepid certification of their accuracy nevertheless,under,a representation need not be warranted as true to constitute a misrepresentation.the provision distinguishes between a misrepresentation or a breach of an affirmative warranty and either may form the basis of rescission.utah code ann.a.the statute obviously contemplates a distinction between a statement that is falsely represented and a statement that violates a warranty of accuracy.reading a warranty requirement into misrepresentation fails to give full effect to both provisions of the statute,and we decline such an interpretation.
utah case law confirms this view.in fidelity casualty middlemiss,utah,the utah supreme court held,
if a representation is material to the risk and likewise knowingly false,it will be as potent for a rescission of the contract embodied in the policy as if the untrue statement was made in form of a warranty.
thus,clearone representations in its financials were as good as a warranty.an inaccurate statement is an inaccurate statement,regardless of whether the maker of that statement made an additional promise to be truthful.national union fire ins.sahlen.
accordingly,the district court did not err in concluding that national union met the misstatement element necessary to establish rescission.
clearone next contends a genuine dispute of fact exists as to whether its certifying official knew the financial statements were inaccurate,or,put differently,whether it innocently presented the financials as accurate to national union.clearone argues a factual dispute exists as to ceo frances flood knowledge of the misstatements incorporated into the insurance contract thereby negating the scienter requirement.nevertheless,whether flood had actual knowledge of the misstatements in the financials is only part of the equation since we conclude utah rescission statute only requires that flood knew or should have known about the misstatements.
recent analysis of insurance rescission law by a utah appellate court supports the knew or should have known standard for innocence.in derbidge mutual protective ins,utah,an applicant sought medical insurance from an insurer.as part of the insurer application,the applicant answered no to whether she received medical treatment or advice for an organic mental disease or disorder.id.at.the insurer issued the applicant a care policy pursuant to the application.six months later,the applicant filed a proof of loss,claiming she suffered from alzheimer disease.unknown to the applicant,several years beforehand,her doctor suspected she suffered from an organic brain syndrome.the doctor noted his suspicion in her medical records but did not discuss the possible diagnosis with the applicant.upon discovery of her medical records,the insurer rescinded her insurance policy based on the misrepresentation in her application.
reviewing utah law,law from other jurisdictions,and policy considerations,the court concluded that the rescission statute required an insurance applicant have knowledge or awareness of the misstatement in order for it to constitute a misrepresentation and serve as a basis of rescission.at.in other words,rescission may not be grounded solely on an innocent misstatement made by the insured.id.at.the applicant must,therefore,do something more than make an innocent misstatement.id.
the court,nevertheless,left open the question of what degree of knowledge is necessary before a misstatement can be considered a misrepresentation.while not directly answered in derbidge,we are not wholly left without guidance.first,the utah court states,at least some level of knowledge or awareness of a misstatement is required to make it a misrepresentation.id.emphasis added.second,the court determined that the insured must have no idea that the misstatements were inaccurate.third,the derbidge court quotes approvingly the utah common law standard which permits rescission of an insurance contract when the insured knew or should have known the statements and answers to be untrue at the time he made them.id.at quoting chadwick beneficial life ins,utah,see also middlemiss,at.while the common law was abrogated by statute,as the court noted,the common law can instruct the interpretation of the rescission statute.derbidge,at.we see no necessary conflict between the common law rule and section.
reading these statements together,in our view utah courts would apply a standard of recklessness to the insured state of mind under the statute.a misstatement is not innocent under derbidge if the applicant knew or should have known about its falsity.
in addition to support in utah common law,utah courts adopted a similar scienter requirement in interpreting the fraud element in utah predecessor insurance code.see hardy prudential ins,utah holding that an insured knowledge or good reason to know of misstatements constitute d a fraud practiced upon the insurer under utah code ann.citing chadwick.
next,a knew or should have known standard is consistent with utah courts interpretation of other knowledge elements.see,strand,utah using the standard to establish a bona fide purchaser under the uniform commercial code smith frandsen,utah applying standard to general negligent misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment claims russell packard,carson,utah employing test for knowledge element of the discovery rule adamson brockbank,utah,raising the standard as a factor in the creation of easements.
other jurisdictions that define misrepresentations as misstatements are faithful to this analysis.see,massachusetts mutual life ins.allen,failure to disclose a latent disease of which applicant had no knowledge,or reason to know,will not void a life insurance policy.lazar metropolitan life ins,a knowing misrepresentation occurs when an applicant gives an answer other than that which he has reason to believe is true.centrust mortg.pmi mortg.ins,legal fraud occurs when an insured incorrectly states a fact about which he has actual knowledge or that is presumed to be within his knowledge.intent to deceive need not be shown.first am.title ins.lawson,applying knew or should have known standard.
we find additional support in basic insurance law,which also yields a knew or should have known standard.see,appleman on ins.a policy will not be avoided by false representations unless the insured knew that they were false or was chargeable with such knowledge.d ins.legal fraud in connection with insurance occurs when the insured incorrectly states a fact about which the insured has actual knowledge or that is presumed to be within the insured knowledge.
under the weight of these authorities,we conclude that utah courts would hold that an applicant actual knowledge is not the sole basis for establishing a misrepresentation under.a misrepresentation occurs if the applicant knows or should have known about a misstatement in the application and still presents it to the insurer.
application 
in applying this standard to the facts of this case,the district court did not have the benefit of our interpretation of derbidge,and concluded that clearone knowledge,as a corporate entity,and not flood specific knowledge governed this factor.accordingly,the district court made no definitive conclusions as to whether flood knew or should have known about the financial misstatements attached to the national union application.
first,the district court wrongly held that clearone knowledge,as a corporate entity,as opposed to flood,is the dispositive question when adjudging the innocence of misstatements included in the insurance application.without finding that flood or any other corporate director possessed knowledge of the misstatements,the district court concluded,clearone,as an entity,was certainly aware of the conditions which gave rise to the misstated financial statements and had a reason to know that its financial statements were incorrect.order mem.decision at,aplts.app.at.the court then concluded that the misstatements were not innocently presented to national union.yet,this approach blurs the distinction between knowledge of a corporation and knowledge of an individual director.under the court standard,virtually any misstatement of financial information included within an application could give rise to a rescission of a corporate insurance policy.such a reading would effectively nullify the innocence defense established by derbidge since applicants ignorance of the misstatement offers no protection.
utah insurance law does not compel the per se imputation of any misstatement made in an insurance application to the corporation without first determining whether the application signor or another corporate director had knowledge of the misstatement.in utah,it is the general rule of corporate law that only knowledge possessed by its officers and agents can be imputed to a corporation.lowe april,utah k nowledge of the corporate entity is imputed to it from the knowledge possessed by its officers and agents.accordingly,national union must establish that flood knew or should have known about the financial misstatements attached to the application.we leave open the question of whether another corporate officer or director knowledge,aside from flood knowledge,may suffice to negate the innocence of any misstatement in clearone application for insurance 
second,although unclear from the court order,to the extent the district court held that flood had actual knowledge of the financial misstatements as a matter of law,we disagree.the crux of the district court argument seems to be statements made by tim morrison,clearone former vice president of product sales,inculpating flood in the pay as you go scheme.additionally,mike oltz,a managing member of one of clearone distributors,claimed that flood told him,for purposes of the accountants and legal requirements,clearone would require payment for shipments in days.order mem.decision at,aplts.app.at.then,according to oltz,flood stated,in writing there is a brick wall at days,in practice there is not.id.
yet,this contradicts flood own statements that she learned about the pay as you go arrangement in december,after signing the national union application.when a distributor earlier confronted her about the pay as you go arrangement,she said it was a point of concern for her because she did think it was accurate.id.at.she claims she assumed it was just a tactic of the distributor.id.even if the evidence does show that flood knew about the pay as you go scheme,it does not mean she knew that the contained misstatements.as she admitted,she was not an accountant and she would have needed to consult with ernst young,clearone accountant,to determine if the pay as you go scheme was a cause of concern.id.in fact,clearone is currently suing ernst young for negligence in providing accounting advice.id.at.furthermore,flood testified at the time she signed the certification for the financials and in september,she believed that there were no inaccuracies in the financials and that they fairly presented all material aspects of clearone financial condition.id.at.with all inferences drawn in clearone favor,we agree that flood actual knowledge of the misstatements in the is in doubt.
on the other hand,whether she should have known about the misstatements is a different question,and perhaps an easier matter to establish.in the corporate context,corporate directors have a general obligation to know the financial condition of their corporations.
as a general rule an officer or director of a corporation is chargeable with knowledge of all matters relating to the affairs of the corporation which he actually knows or which it is his duty to know.thus,in actions by strangers against an officer or director,the defendant will generally be charged with knowledge of all facts relating to the condition and business of the company which he might have known by the exercise of due diligence,whether actually known to him or not.
gay young men consol.mercantile,utah,see also fletcher cyc.t he corporate officer is chargeable with the knowledge he or she should have had in the discharge of his or her duties.furthermore,under the act,the signing officer of a corporate in this case,flood is required to certify the accuracy of the corporation financial statements and requires the officer to design internal controls to ensure that material information relating to the corporation is made known to such officer by others within the corporation.a.
under the record before us,we do not know if flood should have known about the financial misstatements in the.we do not know if flood utilized reasonable internal controls that would have ferreted out the financial misstatements in the or whether she reasonably relied on ernst young in conducting their business operations to satisfy the due diligence requirement of corporate directors especially in light of clearone suit against the accounting firm.accordingly,summary judgment on this question is inappropriate since the district court did not yet have the opportunity to consider these questions.we remand this matter to the district court to consider whether flood should have known about the financial misstatements.
materiality 
a fact is material to the risk assumed by an insurance company if reasonable insurers would regard the fact as one which substantially increases the chance that the risk insured against will happen and therefore would reject the application.burnham bankers life casualty,utah.in other words,a material fact is one that would naturally influence the insurer judgment in making the contract,in estimating the degree and character of the risk,or in fixing the rate of insurance.middlemiss,at.
we do not see how clearone financial records,which give an account of the financial health of the company,could not influence national union assessment of the company risk.in any event,clearone conceded the issue at oral argument.accordingly,we find no factual dispute as to the materiality of the financial statements.
reliance and the defense of equitable estoppel 
finally,clearone contends a genuine dispute exists as to whether national union actually relied on the financial statements in issuing the policy.it argues,moreover,that national union should be equitably estopped from rescinding the insurance policy based on its knowledge of the irregularities in the financial statements.
the utah supreme court has laid out the standard for analyzing reliance 
an insurance company can not escape liability on a policy if it is established that there should have been no actual reliance on the applicant misrepresentation,concealment,or omission.
hardy prudential ins,utah.the court set forth two corollaries to this rule which,if shown,prevent the insurer from escaping liability if the insurer has information which would have put a prudent person on notice of possible falsity and would have caused an inquiry which,if carried out with reasonable diligence,would have revealed the truth,the insurer can not rely on the misrepresentation and if the insurer chooses to make an independent inquiry and a reasonable search would have uncovered the misrepresentation but the facts were not discovered because the investigation was cursory,the insurer can not rely on the misrepresentation.id.
clearone claims that national union underwriters are trained to spot the red flags in its financial statements and knew or should have known of clearone misstatements and likely priced the risks of the irregularities into the premium charged clearone for coverage.clearone avers this knowledge of the misrepresentation precludes reliance upon the financials and should estop rescission of the policy.
nevertheless,we agree that national union conducted a reasonable inquiry into the red flags in clearone financial statements.after the insurance application was submitted,brady head,national union lead underwriter,sent questions regarding national union concerns to clearone via email.head received a call from susan strohm,clearone cfo,indicating that there had been no issues with clearone revenue recognition practices and that its financial statements had been certified as accurate under.clearone does not challenge this assertion.
instead,clearone claims that strohm call actually heightened head concerns.this is unfounded in the record even in the light most favorable to clearone.to the contrary,while they discussed some problems with accounts receivable and inventory levels,head testified that strohm answered his questions in a satisfactory manner.aplts.app.at.moreover,there is no indication national union was aware of the type of questionable accounting practices later revealed by clearone.no disputed facts suggest national union failed to investigate adequately the financial information it was provided.
consequently,we perceive no error in the district court findings on reliance and equitable estoppel.
accordingly,we find no genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a misstatement,materiality,and reliance.we remand,however,on the limited question of whether clearone financials were innocently presented to national union under utah law.
b.the severability clause 
next,we turn to the claims related to the severability clause.clearone argues the policy severability clause prevents national union from rescinding its policy ab initio and so partial coverage under the policy would survive any rescission.national union argues the severability clause is irrelevant to the rescission analysis.since we remand on the question of whether the misstatements supplied to national union were innocent,and whether any knowledge might be attributed to the officers and directors,we can not decide the precise question raised by the parties on appeal.but several points regarding the severability clause are clear at this stage in the litigation.
first of all,whether a severability clause precludes rescission is a fact intensive,inquiry dependent on the precise language of the severability clause and the facts of the misrepresentation.while severability clauses may in general limit the ability to rescind an insurance policy,in this case,the language of the severability clause does not preclude rescission of the insurance policy in its entirety.
the severability clause in national union application provides,
it is further agreed that in regard to the applicability of questions,and above,the facts pertaining to any knowledge possessed by any insured other than the knowledge information possessed by the person s executing the application shall not be imputed to any other insured person only facts pertaining to and knowledge possessed by any past,present or future chairman of the board,president,chief executive officer ceo,chief operating officer coo,chief
