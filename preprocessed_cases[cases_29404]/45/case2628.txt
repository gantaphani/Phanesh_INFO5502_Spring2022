this appeal arises out of a qui tam action filed by plaintiff and appellant john metz on behalf of the state of california,alleging defendant and respondent ccc information services,violated insurance code section by making false or misleading statements in connection with the settlement of metz automobile insurance claim under a policy issued by farmers insurance company,following an accident in which metz mitsubishi galant suffered a total loss.as more fully explained below,the statements at issue consisted of the comparable automobile valuations ccc provided to farmers in the claim settlement metz contends were made in violation of applicable regulations and designed to induce a fraudulently low insurance settlement,one that failed to adequately compensate for a total loss.
the trial court entered judgment in favor of ccc after sustaining a demurrer to metz first amended complaint without leave to amend,finding the action barred by the applicable statute of limitations and,alternatively,by section,subdivision e requirement that only the district attorney or insurance commissioner may bring a related action based on the facts underlying a pending action.the trial court found that before metz filed the underlying action against ccc,he had filed a prior qui tam action based on the same underlying facts against farmers and others the farmers action not including ccc,which was pending at the time of the demurrer.
metz argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer because he filed the complaint within three years of acquiring actual knowledge of all ccc actionable conduct,and he alleged actionable statements by ccc made less than three years before filing the original complaint.metz also argues his allegation of an ongoing conspiracy sufficed to defer the running of the statute of limitations.as to the trial court alternative ground,metz contends section,subdivision e does not bar the instant action because ccc was not a party to the farmers action,and the instant action includes distinct allegations concerning ccc that were not part of the farmers action.we hold that metz first amended complaint was time barred by section limitations period and its proscription against the filing of related actions by any person other than the district attorney or insurance commissioner accordingly,the judgment is affirmed.
procedural history 
metz,as a qui tam relator on behalf of the state of california,filed the farmers action on july,in los angeles superior court,alleging farmers and various related entities,along with two entities that provided farmers with total loss automotive consultants and enterprises,section by making false and misleading statements in connection with metz insurance claim for the total loss of his galant as in the instant action against ccc,metz sole cause of action against farmers was under section,based on the manner in which farmers reached its total loss valuation for metz car metz alleged farmers relied on false or misleading statements in the valuations provided by creative automotive consultants,enterprises,and ccc that were intended to unfairly reduce the claim value of the insured loss.as noted,ccc was not named as a defendant in the farmers action.on december,the trial court in the farmers action found,among other things,that metz stated a claim for relief under section,but struck metz prayer for civil penalties.on march,the same court overruled a demurrer by the farmers entities,but granted in part those defendants motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint.
on april,while the farmers action was pending in los angeles superior court,metz filed the original complaint against ccc in alameda county.he filed the first amended complaint on november,on march,ccc unopposed motion to transfer the ccc action to los angeles was granted,and the matter was assigned to the same judge who was presiding over the farmers action.
ccc demurred to the first amended complaint and requested judicial notice of various pleadings and orders from the farmers action,including metz second amended complaint,filed december.the trial court,having granted both parties motions for judicial notice,granted ccc demurrer on alternative grounds.it found the action time barred because the second amended complaint conclusively shows that,by january,metz had discovered facts to support his claim that ccc had provided a valuation based on false information.metz s ccc complaint was filed more than three years after this discovery and must be dismissed.the trial court also found as an alternative basis for its ruling that metz action against ccc was based on the same facts underlying the farmers action,which had been previously filed and was pending.as a result,the action against ccc was barred by section,subdivision e requirement that only the district attorney or insurance commissioner may bring a related action based on the facts underlying a pending action.
allegations in the relevant pleadings 
in the sole cause of action of the first amended complaint in the ccc action,metz alleged ccc violated section,subdivision b by providing farmers with a false and misleading valuation of metz galant.more specifically,metz alleged ccc used arbitrary and illegal criteria to improperly diminish the value for a replacement vehicle to compensate metz for the total loss of his car under the farmers policy.ccc concealed its improper valuation methodology and made misleading statements designed to induce him to settle for an amount below the full value of his insurance entitlement.metz sought civil penalties for each of ccc improper actions and an injunction to prevent it from engaging in such conduct in the future.
metz further alleged he is a longtime consumer advocate in matters.in,he purchased an insurance policy from farmers for his galant.on october,within the period covered by that policy,metz made a claim to farmers for damages to his car.a farmers representative informed metz on december,that his claim would be sent to ccc for a price valuation.the next day,the farmers representative told metz that ccc made a total loss valuation of metz car.in his ccc pleading,however,he included no factual allegations concerning the events of.instead,metz made allegations concerning his investigation of ccc valuation in,during which time ccc made several statements concerning the manner in which it had reached its valuation of metz galant.in may,metz requested ccc provide him with copies of the documents made in connection with its valuation.metz spoke to a ccc representative on june,who arranged for metz to receive such documents.upon review,metz found that ccc had discovered that the galant had suffered a prior accident,but the documentation did not indicate that ccc investigated whether any of the comparable vehicles it used for its valuation had suffered accidents.
on july,another ccc representative provided metz with additional documentation for its valuation.none of those documents reflected that ccc investigation of the comparable vehicles included prior damage histories or mechanical evaluations.two days later,the ccc representative told metz that it used a take price in computing its valuations,whereby the car dealership with the comparable vehicle agreed to supply ccc with a formula to discount the vehicle sticker price to reflect the price at which the car would actually be sold.when metz attempted to verify the existence of such a take price formula,the two dealerships he contacted denied any such agreement with ccc.on july,the ccc representative maintained to metz that it had take price agreements with each dealership it consulted,and denied that ccc selected comparable vehicles at the lowest end of the price spectrum in making its valuations.
in early august,metz requested that ccc provide him copies of the written agreements between ccc and the dealerships for determining the valuations that the representative said were in ccc possession.on august,the representative told metz he was trying to locate that documentation and would respond as soon as he did.metz never received a response.finally,on february,a ccc representative told metz that ccc does not investigate the damage history of the comparable vehicles used in making its valuations.
in contrast to the first amended complaint in the ccc action,the second amended complaint in the farmers action contained detailed factual allegations concerning metz knowledge of ccc valuation methodology as of.according to the first amended complaint against farmers,on december,a farmers representative told metz the insurance company sought a valuation of metz damaged vehicle,not the cost of a replacement vehicle.on january,in an effort to reach a settlement,metz supplied the insurer with information on improvements he had made to his galant before the accident,along with three comparable vehicle valuations he had obtained,all of which were greater than farmers december offer.
metz further alleged in the farmers action that the following day,during settlement negotiations with the farmers representative,metz said that his own investigation showed that ccc valuation was inaccurate because the comparables listed in the ccc valuation were based on false information.metz had discovered that two of the cars had been sold prior to the date on which ccc stated that it had inspected them.metz had also learned that one of those cars had been sold for an amount greater than that listed in ccc valuation.in the same conversation,the farmers representative said the insurer stood by its valuation,which was based in part on ccc valuation.the representative also stated that the insurer valuation included a discount below the asking price for the comparable vehicles.additionally,as of march,metz own investigation of comparable vehicles revealed that the vehicles he found were uniformly listed at a much higher price than those selected by ccc,creative automotive consultants,or enterprises and used by farmers for its violations.in a subsequent discussion on march,a farmers representative again stated that the insurer valuation was based in part on the valuation it received from ccc.five days later,the farmers representative again stated that the insurer valuation reflected an anticipated sticker price negotiation discount or take price.
in his ccc complaint,metz alleged ccc valuation procedures violated section,subdivision b,by using an undisclosed take price or arbitrary discount from the sticker price of comparable vehicles,based on the unsubstantiated assumption that insurance claimants will be able to negotiate a discounted price for replacement vehicles failing to investigate the damage history or the mechanical condition of the comparable vehicles used in making valuations falsely claiming its valuations are made in accordance with state law,including section,and california code of regulations,title,chapter,section et.fair claims settlement practices regulations gathering price quotations for a number of comparable vehicles,but choosing to use only those at the low end in calculating the valuation and making statements containing false or misleading information about facts material to policyholders claims,while concealing its unlawful valuation methods,from the time that insurance policies are sold,during the claims process,and prior to the settlement of claims 
metz further alleged that ccc and unnamed defendants violated section,subdivision b,not only by each such false or misleading statement made in connection with the valuation process,but also by concealment of its improper valuation method and by conspiring with unnamed defendants to deprive policyholders of the full amount of their insurance benefits.he also alleged that ccc and unnamed defendants realized unlawful profits through the perpetration of this scheme to deprive policyholders of the full amount of their insurance benefits.although metz sought to prosecute this action on behalf of the state of california and alleged that ccc engages in the same conduct as to other policyholders,the only violations he identifies are those pertaining to his own insurance claim for the loss of his galant.
discussion 
the demurrer was properly sustained 
metz argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint on the basis that the action was because the limitations period did not begin to run until he had actual notice of all the facts he alleged in support of his claim,ccc made actionable statements less than three years before filing the original complaint,and the allegations of an ongoing conspiracy served to delay the accrual of his cause of action.he also argues the farmers and ccc actions were not related for purposes of section,subdivision e requirement that only the district attorney or insurance commissioner may file such actions.we disagree.
standard of review 
in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer,we are guided by rules.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.blumhorst jewish family services of los angeles th,d.we may affirm a trial court judgment on any basis presented by the record whether or not relied upon by the trial court.ibid.
as is particularly relevant to this appeal,t he complaint should be read as containing the judicially noticeable facts,even when the pleading contains an express allegation to the contrary.citation.a plaintiff may not avoid a demurrer by pleading facts or positions in an amended complaint that contradict the facts pleaded in the original complaint or by suppressing facts which prove the pleaded facts false.citation.citations.mckell washington mutual,th,d.similarly,u nder the sham pleading doctrine,plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints to omit harmful allegations,without explanation,from previous complaints to avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment.see hendy losse cal d,d,affirming an order sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend when the plaintiff filed an amended complaint omitting harmful allegations from the original unverified complaint see also colapinto county of riverside d.if a party files an amended complaint and attempts to avoid the defects of the original complaint by either omitting facts which made the previous complaint defective or by adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings,the court may take judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent allegations.deveny entropin,th,d deveny,fn.omitted.accordingly,metz is bound by his allegations in the farmers action concerning his knowledge of ccc conduct.
to the extent we must determine the legal question of whether section limitation period requires reasonable inquiry notice or actual notice of the actionable facts,and to the extent we must interpret the meaning of section limitation on the filing of related actions,our review is de novo.state ex rel.nee unumprovident th,d nee.the standards we employ in interpreting statutes of limitation are well established.our function,as with the construction of any statute,is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in the first instance,we look to the plain meaning of the statutory language.if further analysis is necessary,we apply a reasonable and commonsense interpretation,avoiding absurdity.citations.we also consider the legislative purpose and public policy particularly relevant to statutes of limitation.citation.citation.deveny,supra,th at,d see also nee,supra,th at,d.
with regard to the statute of limitations aspect of the trial court ruling,we note while the bar of the statute of limitations may be considered a harsh result where there is an otherwise meritorious cause of action,as a matter of policy,this defense operates conclusively.it does so with respect to all causes of action,both those that do not have merit and also those that do.that it may bar meritorious causes of action as well as unmeritorious ones is the price of the orderly and timely processing of litigation citation a price that may be high,but one that must nevertheless be paid.citation.quiroz seventh center th,d.on the other hand,a demurrer based on a statute of limitations will not lie where the action may be,but is not necessarily,barred.citation.in order for the bar of the statute of limitations to be raised by demurrer,the defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint it is not enough that the complaint shows that the action may be barred.citation.marshall gibson,dunn crutcher th,d.geneva towers.partnership city of san francisco cal th,d,see also deveny,supra,th at,d in general,the legislative purpose behind such statutes is to prevent plaintiffs from asserting stale claims.
b.the statutory framework 
we recently explained that taken as a whole,section et is specifically tailored toward preventing and punishing the making of fraudulent claims to insurance companies.nee,supra,th at,d.subdivision a of section provides it is unlawful to knowingly employ runners,cappers,steerers,or other persons to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits under a contract of insurance or that will be the basis for a claim against an insured individual or his or her insurer.metz,of course,being the insurance claimant on the underlying transaction and seeking to vindicate the rights of similarly situated policyholders,does not allege any fraudulent insurance claim.
rather,as he can not allege a subdivision a violation against ccc,metz seeks to allege a violation under subdivision b,which authorizes an action on behalf of the state against every person who violates penal code sections and.nee,supra,th at,d.similarly,while penal code section generally criminalizes false or fraudulent insurance claims,metz seeks to ground his action on subdivision b of that statute,which,among other things,criminalizes those who present or cause to be presented any written or oral statement as part of,or in support of or opposition to,a claim for payment or other benefit pursuant to an insurance policy,knowing that the statement contains any false or misleading information concerning any material fact.prepare or make any written or oral statement that is intended to be presented to any insurer or any insurance claimant in connection with,or in support of or opposition to,any claim or payment or other benefit pursuant to an insurance policy,knowing that the statement contains any false or misleading information concerning any material fact.conceal,or knowingly fail to disclose the occurrence of,an event that affects any person initial or continued right or entitlement to any insurance benefit or payment,or the amount of any benefit or payment to which the person is entitled,subds.b,emphasis added.
it is metz theory that ccc valuation statements made in connection with the insurance claim on his galant violated penal code section,subdivisions b and b,because they were made in opposition to metz claim for payment under his farmers policy with ccc knowledge that they contained false and misleading facts as to a material proper value of a comparable vehicle.he also claims that ccc failure to disclose to metz the method it used in making its valuation violated subdivision b of penal code section.
section contains its own limitations provision.under subdivision l,a n action pursuant to this section may not be filed more than three years after the discovery of the facts constituting the grounds for commencing the action.the statute contains an additional limitation on the right to intervene or to bring related actions when a person or governmental agency brings an action under this section,no person other than the district attorney or commissioner may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action unless that action is authorized by another statute or common law,subd.e.
application of the limitations period 
metz argues the statute of limitations did not begin to run until he had actual notice of every fact alleged in his complaint,including those he discovered in the period from june through february,less than three years before he filed the ccc complaint.ccc responds that the rule of inquiry notice,generally applicable to fraud claims,applies to this particular insurance fraud provision.as such,ccc argues metz knowledge as of january and march that ccc had based its valuations of the galant on false information was sufficient to trigger the commencement of the statute and bar his claim,filed more that three years afterwards.
although no published california case has yet addressed whether section,subdivision l limitation period requires actual or inquiry notice to trigger the running of the limitations period,we find two recent decisions dealing with analogous provisions to be highly instructive.first,in debro los angeles raiders th,d debro,the appellate court interpreted the meaning of the word discovery in the context of government code section,subdivision a a civil action under section may not be filed more than three years after the date of discovery.debro,supra,th at,d.as the debro court explained,the term discovery is not foreign to california statutes of limitation.long before the legislature used that term in government code section,it was interpreted by california connection with the limitations period for causes of action based on common law fraud and mistake.code civ,subd.d.debro,supra,th at,d deveny,supra,th at,d.
the debro court began its analysis by noting that code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,includes common law fraud among the causes of action that must be asserted within three years.that provision does not distinguish between actual or inquiry notice,but states that a fraud cause of action does not accrue until the discovery,by the aggrieved party,of the facts constituting the fraud.debro,supra,th at,d,quoting code civ,subd.d.nevertheless,this state courts have long interpreted code of civil procedure section to commence upon the discovery by the aggrieved party of the fraud or facts that would lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect fraud.debro,supra,th at,d,citing miller bechtel cal d.such a rule strikes the proper balance between the competing purposes inherent in the limitation period in order to promote resolution of claims on the merits,inquiry notice protects fraud victims from having the limitations period run before they are even aware of the fraud however,it also avoids the undue delay and opportunistic behavior that would tend to result from a rule that required awareness of every fact necessary for a fraud claim.ibid.
the debro court therefore found it appropriate to interpret the discovery provision in government code section,subdivision a in the same manner as the provision for fraud claims under code of civil procedure section t his interpretation balances the policy of avoiding stale lawsuits with the policy of providing a reasonable time for a plaintiff to discover a false claim.furthermore,our interpretation is consistent with the tenets of civil code section,which reads every person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent man upon inquiry as to a particular fact,has constructive notice of the fact itself in all cases in which,by prosecuting such inquiry,he might have learned such fact.italics added.consequently,circumstances which put a reasonable person on inquiry of a false claim are constructive notice of the false claim itself.debro,supra,th at,d see also jolly eli lilly cal d,under the discovery rule,the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing,that someone has done something wrong to her.
in deveny,supra,th,d,the court relied on the debro rationale to find the inquiry notice rule applicable to the discovery provision in corporations code section for specified securities fraud claims.the relevant portion of corporations code section provided that an action be brought before the expiration of o
