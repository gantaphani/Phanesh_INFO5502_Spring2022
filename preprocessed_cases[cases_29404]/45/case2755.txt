the roman catholic archdiocese of san diego the church has been sued by numerous persons claiming they were the victims of childhood sexual abuse by various church priests.petitioners are the church insurer and the insurer corporate parent.they seek to vacate a written order by a settlement judge denying their motion to quash deposition subpoenas from the plaintiffs aimed at obtaining documents concerning the insurer financial condition,including its reserves and any reinsurance agreements.as set forth below,we conclude that the subpoenas sought items that were not discoverable.accordingly,we grant the petition,reverse the settlement judge order denying the motion to quash,and direct the court upon remand to enter a new and different order quashing the subpoenas.
facts and procedural history 
the church is the principal defendant in an action brought by approximately persons plaintiffs for alleged childhood abuse by certain priests.those cases,along with others involving the san bernardino archdiocese,are known collectively as clergy cases ii,and were coordinated within the los angeles county superior court with claims against dioceses from other parts of the state.
in september,pursuant to a stipulated order regarding settlement and mediation proceedings,the trial court issued an initial case management order which,among other things,directed the church to turn over copies of all insurance policies that might provide coverage for plaintiffs claims.petitioner catholic mutual relief society relief society is a corporation that administers a fund for more than three hundred archdioceses and other catholic church entities in the united states and canada,including the san diego archdiocese.the relief society is not an insurance company,but its subsidiary,the catholic relief insurance company of america relief insurance is.relief insurance is the church insurer petitioners are headquartered in nebraska but maintain claim and risk management offices in san diego and san bernardino.all sexual abuse claims are handled by the home office in nebraska,however.
in compliance with the case management order,the church produced copies of its insurance policies from petitioners.plaintiffs contended this information was insufficient.according to plaintiffs,they also needed to know whether petitioners were financially sound enough to cover their policy obligations.in april,in an attempt to resolve the matter informally,the trial court allowed plaintiffs to serve petitioners a series of questions aimed at obtaining the desired information petitioners objected to those questions on several grounds they sought information concerning their financial condition,reserves,and reinsurance agreements,which was not relevant for discovery purposes or was otherwise not discoverable much of the material sought was privileged the requests were overbroad and ambiguous and the trial court lacked authority to require interrogatory responses from such as petitioners.
on may,the settlement judge issued an order permitting plaintiffs to serve deposition subpoenas on petitioners in an attempt to secure the information requested by plaintiffs interrogatories.those subpoenas sought the following documents 
all writings pertaining to the financial relationship between the relief society and relief insurer with respect to financial responsibility for sexual abuse claims brought against the church.
all writings pertaining to the total amount of funds available to satisfy any defense expenses or indemnify losses in connection with sexual abuse claims against the church,whether from reserves,policyholder surplus,reinsurance,or other available sources of funding.
all writings evidencing the number of sexual abuse claims that have been filed against policyholders affiliated with the catholic church and the total amount of damages sought by these claims.
all writings evidencing the annual amount over the past five years of defense costs and indemnity payments incurred in connection with sexual abuse claims against policyholders affiliated with the catholic church.
all writings evidencing the amount in reserves that have been set for sexual abuse claims against the church by petitioners.
all writings evidencing the total indemnity reserves,total defense and expense reserves,and total incurred but not reported reserves for sexual abuse claims against the church by petitioners.
all writings evidencing the amount in reserves that has been set for sexual abuse claims against all policyholders affiliated with the catholic church.
all writings evidencing the totals for indemnity reserves,defense and expense reserves,and incurred but not reported reserves for sexual abuse claims against all policyholders affiliated with the catholic church.
all writings pertaining to reinsurance available to petitioners to satisfy defense or indemnity costs arising from the sexual abuse claims brought against the church.
all writings pertaining to the most recent balance sheets,financial statements,or other financial filings with insurance regulators.
petitioners moved to quash the subpoenas,contending that by seeking information about their financial condition,the document requests sought information that was not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and were therefore beyond the permissible scope of discovery the trial court denied the motions to quash,finding that the subpoena at determining whether petitioners were financially able to pay any judgment that might be clearly relevant and discoverable.his order was supported by decisions holding that information which might facilitate settlement was discoverable.petitioners then brought their petition asking us to overturn the order.on october,we issued an order to show cause why we should not do so

discussion 
an insurer financial condition is not included within code of civil procedure section,subdivision b 
the general scope of discovery is set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which provides,in relevant part any party may obtain discovery regarding any matter,not privileged,that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.discovery may relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.discovery may be obtained of the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter,as well as of the existence,description,nature,custody,condition,and location of any document,tangible thing,or land or other property.
evidence of a defendant liability insurance is not admissible at trial.nor does it relate to a party claims or defenses at trial.laddon superior court d,laddon.even so,section b allows for limited discovery of such information.under that section,the plaintiff is entitled to discover the existence and contents of any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy in whole or in part a judgment that may be entered in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.this discovery may include the identity of the carrier and the nature and limits of the coverage.a party may also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action,but not as to the nature and substance of that dispute b.
plaintiffs seek several categories of documents all related to one topic the financial condition of petitioners,which plaintiffs contend is discoverable under section b.petitioners point out that section b is restricted to the existence and contents of a defendant insurance policy.they also note that although a defendant financial condition may be discoverable in a case where punitive damages are sought,subd.c,with the exception of the existence and contents of the defendant liability insurance policy,it is not otherwise discoverable even though it might arguably encourage settlement.doak superior court d.doak assuming that the information was relevant to the subject matter of the dispute,but impermissibly invaded the defendant privacy rights in his confidential financial information.they argue that more care must be taken to protect the rights of nonparties when discovery is sought by the parties to an action,especially when financial information is involved.schnabel superior court cal th,d,monarch healthcare superior court th,d.because petitioners are not parties to this action,they contend there is neither statutory nor decisional authority for the type of discovery proposed by plaintiffs.
as noted,plaintiffs tried to obtain different types of information,such as reserves,reinsurance agreements,available funds,the number of sex abuse claims made,and defense costs incurred for other sex abuse claims.while the parties devote a fair portion of their briefs to these discrete notably to reserves and reinsurance individually or collectively,each category discoverability is based on the same underlying premise that under section b,a personal injury plaintiff is entitled to discover the assets and financial health of the defendant insurer in order to determine whether the insurer will be able to meet its coverage obligations and therefore conclude a settlement instead of discussing each separate category of information,we will address this overarching theme of plaintiffs subpoenas.
section b states only that a plaintiff may discover the existence and contents of an insurance policy.nothing in this language even remotely suggests that it was intended to authorize discovery by an injured plaintiff into the financial health of the defendant insurer.plaintiffs attempt to augment this plain language by reaching back to cases that predate section b.
section b was enacted as part of the civil discovery act of,et.before then,the discovery statutes did not provide for the discovery of a defendant liability insurance information.even though such information was not admissible,a case law exception to its discoverability had evolved.that exception arose from insurance code section,which required every policy of liability insurance to state that a plaintiff who obtains a judgment against an insured defendant is then entitled to sue the defendant insurer to recover the policy benefits.as a result of that statute,a contractual relationship was created between the insurer and every person who might be injured by the insured,giving the injured person a discoverable interest in the existence and terms of the defendant liability policy.superior ins.superior court cal d,pettie superior court d.pettie laddon,supra,d at.the pettie court noted in dicta that allowing such discovery could also help settle more cases because plaintiffs could learn whether there might be no more than a nominal recovery that would not justify extensive trial preparation and,because an insurer generally steps into the shoes of its insured,the plaintiff would be able to deal with his true litigation adversary.pettie,supra,at.
as part of its holding,the laddon court said that an injured plaintiff was entitled to learn of the existence and extent of the defendant liability insurance.d at.plaintiffs contend that the phrase existence and extent of liability insurance used in laddon means more than just the contents of the policy.instead,according to them,it also includes the petitioners financial condition,which would provide a measure of the true extent of the church insurance coverage.
plaintiffs argument fails for two reasons.first,laddon can not be read as plaintiffs contend.at issue in laddon was whether the plaintiff was entitled to discover the existence and policy limits of the defendant policy,with the court using the terms extent,limits,and policy limits interchangeably.d at.thus,when laddon spoke about the extent of insurance,it authorized discovery of no more than the coverage limits of a defendant policy and is therefore consistent with section b.second,even if laddon can be interpreted as plaintiffs suggest,we can not ignore the legislature plain language and choice of different phraseology when framing the reach of section b.jurcoane superior court th,d jurcoane our primary task is to give effect to the legislature intent.we first turn to the words themselves if their meaning is clear and unambiguous and is not at odds with the face of the statute or its legislative history,then the plain language controls.we therefore hold that section b does not authorize the discovery of information related to the financial condition of a defendant insurer.see in re dana,dana interpreting virtually identical texas rule allowing discovery of the existence and contents of a defendant liability policies held that the statute could not be construed to include information concerning whether coverage had been eroded by other claims in order to facilitate settlement.
plaintiffs next contend that,at a minimum,section b applies to reinsurance information because it specifically authorizes discovery of any agreement under which any insurance carrier may be liable to satisfy or reimburse a judgment.an understanding of the nature of reinsurance is necessary in order to analyze this contention.
reinsurance is a contract by which an insurer procures a third person to insure him against loss or liability by reason of such insurance.a reinsurance contract is presumed to be a contract of indemnity for the benefit of the insurance company and the original insured has no interest in it,ascherman general reinsurance d.ascherman.it is a special form of insurance obtained by insurance companies to help spread the burden of indemnification.a reinsurance company typically contracts with an insurance company to cover a specified portion of the insurance company obligation to indemnify a policyholder this excess insurance enables the insurance companies to write more policies than their reserves would otherwise sustain since it guarantees the ability to pay a part of all claims.the reinsurance contract is not with the.when a valid claim is made,the insurance company pays the first level insured,and the reinsurance company pays the insurance company.the reinsurance company obligation is to the insurance company,and the insurance company the reinsurer is thus the insured,or more appropriately,the reinsured.id.at,fn,quoting excess cas.reinsurance ass insurance com r,cir,italics added by ascherman court.
the california case law antecedents to section b were premised on the fact that insurance code section created a contractual relationship with all those who might be injured by an insurer policyholders,thus vesting any eventual injured plaintiffs with a discoverable interest in the defendant insurance policies.laddon,supra,d at.under insurance code section,the injured plaintiff becomes a third party beneficiary of the insured plaintiff liability policy.shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d.because reinsurance contracts are,by statute,solely between the insurer and its reinsurer,and because the original insured has no rights in that reinsurance policy,an injured plaintiff can not be considered a third party beneficiary to the reinsurance contracts of the plaintiff liability insurer.moreover,insurance code section does not list reinsurance policies among those as to which it is applicable,subd.a.therefore,to the extent section b is based on earlier california decisions which established the discoverability of insurance information as an adjunct to insurance code section,it does not apply to reinsurance policies 
apart from the effect prior california appellate decisions might have when interpreting section b,that section was derived from former federal rule of civil procedure b,superior court th,d.some federal and cases interpreting that provision or others like it have permitted discovery of reinsurance information,but only in bad faith or declaratory relief coverage actions where the insurer itself was a party and the reinsurance information was relevant to the parties claims or defenses.see potomac electric power california union ins.potomac suit by insured who paid judgment against its insurers nat.union fire ins.continental illinois union fire suit by insurer to rescind policies based on claims of misrepresentations by its insured national union fire ins.stauffer chemical stauffer chemical.
we recognize that potomac and union fire both stated that because former rule b referred to any agreements by any insurer,it applied to reinsurance.potomac,supra,at union fire,at.however,the statement in union fire came after the court had already held the discovery proper because it was relevant to the claims and defenses in the action.union fire,supra,at.the pronouncement in potomac was made without analysis or citation to authority,and preceded a discussion about why certain reinsurance information was relevant to the issues in the case.potomac,supra,at.in short,both statements appear to be dicta and are best viewed skeptically.neither case concerned the issue before us whether the statutory provision permitting discovery of insurance coverage information applied for settlement purposes only to reinsurance information from a insurer.
most important,however,is a key difference between section b and former rule b section b addition of language stating that a party could also obtain discovery as to whether that insurance carrier is disputing the agreement coverage of the claim involved in the action statutes must be read as a whole in a manner that leads to an internally consistent interpretation.jurcoane,supra,th at,d.under this rule,the insurance carrier referred to in the coverage dispute portion of section b must be the same insurance carrier described in the first sentence as the one who might be liable under any insurance agreement.the purpose of the coverage dispute language was to mak e explicit the right to discover whether an insurance carrier,although providing a defense,is nonetheless contesting whether its policy covers the occurrence involved in the lawsuit,supra,th at,d.reinsurance carriers do not defend the policyholders of their reinsureds,however.people highway insurance,reinsurer liability is solely to its reinsured,and that reinsured,as the defendant liability insurer,remains liable on its contract and handles all matters before and after the loss.based on this,the insurance carriers referred to in section b can not include reinsurers.we therefore conclude that section b was intended to reach only a defendant insurer,not that insurer reinsurance agreements.instead,as set forth below,the discoverability of reinsurance information,along with the other items requested by the subpoenas,rests on the general relevancy standards of section a.see dana,supra,at while discovery statute that permitted disclosure of existence and contents of defendant liability policies could not be read to also permit disclosure of information concerning possible erosion of coverage by other claims,the statute did not preclude its discovery.instead,plaintiff ability to obtain such information turned on whether it was relevant under general statutory principles of discoverability.
a insurer financial condition is not discoverable for settlement purposes under section a 
as mentioned above,information is discoverable if it is relevant to the subject matter of the action and,additionally,is either admissible in evidence or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.a.as both federal and california decisions have made clear,information concerning the existence and contents of a defendant liability insurance policy does not meet this standard.wegner cliff viessman,wegner former rule b was added to permit discovery of the existence and contents of a defendant liability policies because that information was not considered relevant for discovery purposes but was deemed useful in allowing counsel to realistically appraise the case and select both settlement and trial strategy pettie,supra,d at.because of these strong policy considerations,explicit statutory authorization was warranted in order to make the information discoverable.if that information is not relevant under general relevancy principles,it is difficult,if not impossible,to imagine how the broader class of financial information sought from petitioners might possibly be discoverable under section a.
combined with their other arguments concerning the existence and extent of insurance coverage as discussed in pettie,supra,d,plaintiffs appear to contend that a inquiry into the financial health of a defendant insurer is proper because that information will permit them to determine if the insurer can meet its coverage obligations.that information,according to plaintiffs,will facilitate settlement and is therefore discoverable.see garamendi golden eagle ins.th,fn,d information is discoverable if it might facilitate settlement.we do not believe that the discovery purpose of facilitating settlements can be read as broadly as plaintiffs contend.
when considering the purposes of discovery statutes,the seminal case is greyhound superior court cal d,greyhound.calcor space facility,superior court th,d.according to the greyhound court,one purpose of the discovery statutes is to educate the parties in advance of trial as to the real value of their claims and defenses,thereby encouraging settlements greyhound,supra,at.that language was recently endorsed by our supreme court in emerson electric superior court cal th,d.other courts and some commentators have apparently chosen to shorthand greyhound holding,stating that one purpose of discovery was to facilitate settlements,but without mention of greyhound qualifying language concerning educating the parties about their claims and defenses in order to encourage settlement.see glenfed development superior court th,d lipton superior court th,d lipton weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.other courts interpreting discovery statutes similar to ours have rejected attempts to discover the financial condition of a defendant liability insurer in order to facilitate settlement.
at issue in dana,supra,was the discoverability of information from a defendant insurer concerning whether the insurer coverage had been eroded by other claims.at plaintiffs request,the trial court ordered the deposition of an insurance company employee who could testify about the amount of insurance remaining under defendant policies.the court first held that the information was not covered by the texas discovery rule that permitted discovery of the existence and contents of a defendant liability policies.instead,its discoverability turned on the relevancy principles governing discoverability in general.id.at.in its relevancy discussion,the dana court cited various federal decisions which either allowed or denied discovery of insurance information beyond that permitted under former rule b.in each case mentioned,however,discoverability turned on whether the requested information was relevant to an issue in the case.id.at,and cases cited therein.the court did not reach a holding concerning the relevancy of the information requested by the plaintiff in its own case,however.instead,the supreme court allowed the deposition to go forward,but only because the trial court order permitting the deposition did not specifically address policy erosion.the witness could therefore testify about any relevant matters,with defense counsel free to object to any irrelevant inquiries concerning coverage erosion.therefore,even though dana did not directly hold that the information requested was irrelevant for discovery purposes,it strongly signaled that it was not discoverable.
the plaintiff in wegner,supra,sought discovery from defendant insurer about the amounts of available coverage that had already been expended,arguing that such information would allow him to make a realistic appraisal of his settlement prospects.after concluding that the requested information could not be sought under rule b,th
