j l lumber company,j l appeals from the order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of bituminous casualty bituminous and denying summary judgment in favor of j l in this declaratory judgment action.bituminous brought this action against j l in federal district court,seeking a declaration that it was not required to defend or indemnify j l in a personal injury action in state court relating to a logging accident that occurred on november,while phillip shields,plaintiff in the state action,was preparing to haul a load of timber from a j l logging site.the central issue in the federal action was whether shields was an employee of j l at the time of his injury and,therefore,excluded from coverage under the terms of j l commercial insurance policies with bituminous.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the district court order granting declaratory judgment relief to bituminous and remand the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the complaint.
background 
j l is a small,family owned and operated sawmill in eastern kentucky.besides family members,the mill employs approximately ten to fifteen additional workers in either the sawmill or the woods.in november,j l also owned three trucks and two tandems for hauling lumber and employed drivers for these vehicles.
phillip shields,the plaintiff in the underlying personal injury action against j l,is a man who has worked in or around the logging industry most of his adult life.at different times,shields has worked as a trucker,sawmill foreman,independent logger,and timber buyer.in the past,he worked for j l both as the sawmill foreman and as a truck driver.
sometime after quitting the sawmill foreman position at j l,shields formed a trucking company with the name phillip shields or shields trucking.he purchased two trucks,which were garaged at his house and were maintained primarily by him.shields also employed his own driver and incurred other expenses in connection with his trucking business,including fuel,contract labor,tolls,business telephone,and subcontractors.in,shields trucking business yielded a gross income of.
after shields started his trucking company,he and j l formed a business relationship.j l hired shields trucks and drivers when it needed loads hauled and did not have any available trucks or drivers of its own.although there was no formal contract between them,j l used shields trucks on a regular basis,but not exclusively.in fact,weather permitting,shields hauled for j l at least once a week and usually more.on occasion,he even drove a j l truck.
the payment arrangement between shields and j l was somewhat complicated.primarily,shields was paid by the load for his work hauling for j l.when he drove a j l truck,though,shields received only driver pay in the same manner as j l own drivers.in addition,from march through december,shields was listed as an employee on the j l payroll registers.he received a weekly payroll check of from which taxes and health insurance premiums were withheld.he also received a check from the general account from which no withholdings were taken.
j l described this unusual payment arrangement as an accounting device that permitted shields to obtain health insurance coverage.the deposition testimony indicated that in march or april,wilma myers myers,j l secretary and general office manager,and joel smith,an owner son who had been insured with blue cross and blue shield,decided to change insurance providers due to an increase in premiums.to get insurance under a plan with medquest insurance company,however,they needed a group of at least three.shields,who also needed insurance,became the third member of the group.myers placed shields on the payroll and began issuing him a weekly check from which the insurance premium was deducted.the amount of the payroll check was then deducted from the total amount due shields for his independent hauling.although joel was not an employee,his insurance premium was paid directly by j l because of his filial relationship to jerry smith,one of j l owners.
outside of their business relationship,shields and the owners of j l were good friends.they had known each other for approximately thirty years.in fact,shields characterized his relationship with jerry and lester smith as the best of friends.he lived approximately one mile from j l office and would go to the j l property usually once a day and sometimes two or three times a day to check for work or just to socialize.shields was also good friends with myers and the two had a social,dating relationship in the past.in addition,shields employed myers son,greg,as a driver for one of his.
on the evening of november,shields and myers were in the j l office drinking coffee when they received word that the woods crew was blocked out and could not continue working unless the cut timber was hauled away from the logging site.myers and shields arranged for shields to take a truck and haul the timber the next morning.on the morning of november,shields arrived at the j l lumber yard and picked up a j l truck,which was loaded with pulp wood.he delivered the load and proceeded to the site that was blocked out.after hauling a couple of loads,shields was injured during loading when a log dislodged from the truck and landed on him.as noted,at the time of the injury,shields was operating a j l truck and was picking up his third load of the day.
both shields and myers stated that shields was doing a favor for j l at the time of the accident and was not going to be compensated for his work.shields testified at deposition that his work on the morning of november was strictly voluntary.moreover,shields,myers and j l owners,jerry and lester smith,all insisted at deposition that shields was not an employee of j l at the time of his injury.
procedural history 
in july,shields filed a personal injury action in the ohio county circuit court of kentucky alleging negligence on the part of j l or its employees related to his injuries on november.as one of its affirmative defenses,j l asserted that shields action was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the kentucky workers compensation act.
j l did not carry workers compensation insurance at the time of the injury j l did,however,carry accident coverage for its employees under an employers underwriters policy.it also carried two commercial insurance policies with bituminous casualty,a general liability policy and a commercial auto policy.at the time of injury,shields was not covered under the employers underwriters policy.therefore,j l requested a defense from bituminous in the state tort action,which bituminous provided under reservation of rights.
on or about october,a few weeks before the expiration of the statute of limitation under the kentucky workers compensation act,shields filed a claim,presumably a protective filing,with the kentucky department of workers claims,alleging that he was injured on november,while in the course of employment.see.this claim was dismissed on january,after an administrative law judge for the kentucky department of workers claims determined that shields was an independent contractor and not an employee.the administrative law judge stated that,although it was a close question based upon the facts and kentucky case law,he found the intent of the parties to be paramount in determining that shields was not an employee.
in the underlying state personal injury action,on or about march,shields filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to strike the affirmative defense raised by j l that the workers compensation act was his exclusive remedy on the grounds that he was not an employee of j j l did not respond to this motion.on march,the ohio county circuit court of kentucky found that shields was not an employee of j l at the time of injury and struck the workers compensation act defense.specifically,the kentucky court found that j l had little,if any,control over shields,since shields was volunteering on the day of injury and that the true intent of the parties was that shields was not an employee.
in the meantime,on july,bituminous filed the instant action in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to defend or indemnify j l under its policies based on exclusions contained in each policy for employees.bituminous argued that shields was an employee of j l at the time of his injury and was,therefore,not covered by the policies.j l maintained that shields was not an employee of j l at the time of injury.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.
on october,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of bituminous,finding that shields was an employee as a matter of law.the district court found,among other things,that j l had the ultimate right to control shields work,that the method of payment indicated employment,and that the actions of j l and shields were inconsistent with their assertion that shields was not an employee.the district court did not make a finding regarding the testimony that shields had been working as a volunteer on the day of injury.in addition,the district court found that the october,kentucky state court judgment in the negligence action did not have preclusive effect because it determined that the state court decision was not the result of an adversarial proceeding,since a finding that shields was not an employee benefitted both shields and j j l benefitted by the finding that shields was not an employee because the finding entitled it to indemnity from bituminous.likewise,the finding benefitted shields because it enabled him to collect any judgment awarded in the negligence action from j l insurer,rather than j l and his close friends.
j l filed a motion to alter,amend or vacate judgment,which was denied on january.j l then filed this appeal,raising four issues whether the district court misapplied kentucky law when it used a workers compensation analysis rather than a common law analysis to determine whether shields was an employee pursuant to the insurance contract whether the district court erred in holding that shields was an employee of j l as a matter of law whether the district court erred in failing to consider the explicit policy definitions and whether the district court erred in applying federal preclusion law rather than state preclusion law to determine the effect of a prior state court judgment in a diversity action.
ii.standards of review 
summary judgment 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.hartsel keys,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
declaratory judgment actions 
exercise of jurisdiction under the declaratory judgment act,a is not mandatory.brillhart excess ins.therefore,we review the district court decision to exercise jurisdiction for abuse of discretion.wilton seven falls,d scottsdale ins.roumph,cir.
iii.analysis 
as noted,j l raises four issues on appeal.we do not reach these issues,however,because we conclude that the district court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action and should have dismissed the complaint.
declaratory judgment actions 
we have repeatedly held in insurance coverage diversity cases that declaratory judgment actions seeking an advance opinion on indemnity issues are seldom helpful in resolving an ongoing action in another court.manley,bennett,mcdonald paul fire marine ins,cir.further,s uch actions should normally be filed,if at all,in the court that has jurisdiction over the litigation which gives rise to the indemnity problem.otherwise confusing problems of scheduling,orderly presentation of fact issues and res judicata are created.see also scottsdale ins,omaha property and cas.ins.johnson,cir allstate ins.mercier,cir grand trunk consolid.rail,cir.that is not to say that there is a per se rule against exercising jurisdiction in actions involving insurance coverage questions.see allstate ins.green,cir state farm fire and cas.odom,cir.nevertheless,the factual and procedural postures of this case make exercise of jurisdiction particularly inappropriate.
propriety of declaratory judgment relief in this case 
this court generally considers five factors to determine whether a case is appropriate for declaratory judgment 
whether the judgment would settle the controversy 
whether the declaratory judgment action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue 
whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of procedural fencing or to provide an arena for a race for res judicata 
whether the use of a declaratory action would increase the friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach on state jurisdiction and 
whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective.
scottsdale,at citations omitted.the district court did not consider these criteria therefore,we review them for the first time on appeal.
whether the judgment would settle the controversy.
the controversy in this case is one of insurance coverage.bituminous seeks a declaration that it has no duty to defend or indemnify j l based on exclusions in its insurance policies for employees.if shields was an employee of j l at the time of his injury,bituminous would have no duty to defend or indemnify j l in the state court personal injury action.if shields was not an employee,on the other hand,bituminous would be obligated under its contracts to defend and indemnify j thus,resolution of the controversy hinges solely on whether shields was an employee of j l at the time of his injury,a,and in this case very close,question of state law.
when this declaratory judgment action was filed,however,shields employment status was already being considered in two independent state court proceedings the state tort action between shields and j l,and shields action before the kentucky department of workers claims.in the state tort action,which shields had filed against j l on negligence grounds,j l defended,in part,on the grounds that shields action was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the kentucky workers compensation act.this defense was only viable if shields was an employee of j l at the time of the injury.furthermore,although j l did not have workers compensation insurance and the exclusive remedy defense might have been dismissed on this ground alone,a determination of shields employment status was still necessary in the tort action because,under kentucky law,if shields was an employee,j l would not be allowed to plead the defenses of assumption of the risk or contributory negligence in the state court.see.
in the action before the kentucky department of workers claims,shields employment status was a crucial issue because,had shields not been an employee of j l,he would not be eligible to collect compensation under the act.thus,to rule on the issues presented,all three courts had to address the identical issue of whether shields was an employee of j l.the declaratory judgment action in federal court could serve no useful purpose.the federal court could either reach the same conclusion as the state court,in which case the declaration would have been unnecessary and the federal litigation a waste of judicial resources,or the federal court could disagree with the state court,resulting in inconsistent judgments.ultimately,inconsistent rulings on shields employment status did issue from the state and federal courts.both state courts determined that shields was not an employee of j l,and the federal court determined that he was.
moreover,a declaration of insurance coverage would not resolve the controversy.although a declaratory judgment would settle the controversy between bituminous and j l,shields was not made a party to the declaratory judgment action.therefore,any judgment in the federal court would not be binding as to him and could not be res judicata in the tort action.regardless of the judgment rendered in the declaratory judgment action,shields would be entitled to pursue recovery from bitumi
