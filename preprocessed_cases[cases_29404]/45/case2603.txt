thomas lee sued blue shield of california alleging that blue shield wrongfully suspended him from its network of medical providers for alleged medical incompetency,unlawfully denied him an administrative hearing on the issue of his competency and then illegally terminated his provider contract based on his alleged failure to cooperate in the administrative process.lee seeks damages and declaratory relief but not reinstatement as a provider.the trial court sustained blue shield demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that lee had not exhausted his administrative remedies.lee filed a timely appeal from the judgment dismissing his action.
the trial court correctly sustained blue shield demurrer to lee contract and tort causes of action.exhaustion of the administrative remedy under business and professions code sections commonly referred to as an hearing is a prerequisite to lee recovery of damages for wrongful suspension and termination as a blue shield physician,and lee admits he has not exhausted that remedy.the trial court erred,however,in sustaining the demurrer to lee cause of action for declaratory relief.instead,the court should have treated lee cause of action for declaratory relief as a petition requesting the court to issue a writ of mandate ordering blue shield to vacate its decision terminating his provider status for failure to cooperate with the hearing and to reinstate the proceedings.
facts and proceedings below 
a.the peer review hearing background 
we briefly summarize the peer review hearing process applicable to hospitals extending privileges to doctors and to health care service plans such as blue shield contracting with doctors as medical providers.
under the statutory scheme,if a peer review body,subd.a proposes to terminate a physician membership in the organization for a medical disciplinary cause or reason,subd.b or if it immediately suspends the physician on the ground that its failure to do so may result in an imminent danger to the health of a patient,subd.a,the physician is entitled to notice and an administrative hearing,subd.b.a peer review body includes a health care service plan,subd.a b.blue shield concedes it is a health care service plan subject to the hearing procedure.
section,subdivision a,states the hearing shall be held,as determined by the plan,before a trier of fact,which shall be an arbitrator or arbitrators selected by a process mutually acceptable to the doctor and the plan,or before a panel of unbiased individuals who shall gain no direct financial benefit from the outcome,who have not acted as an accuser,investigator,factfinder,or initial decisionmaker in the same matter,and which shall include,where feasible,an individual practicing the same specialty as the doctor.the panel may select a hearing officer to preside at the hearing but is not required to do so,subd.b.
when an hearing is requested by a doctor,the plan shall bear the burden of persuading the trier of fact the hearing panel by a preponderance of the evidence that the action or recommendation is reasonable and warranted,subd.b.

section,subdivision f,provides that a t the request of either side,the parties shall exchange lists of witnesses expected to testify and copies of all documents expected to be introduced at the hearing.as in subdivision d,quoted above,a party failure to timely exchange witness lists and copies of documents shall constitute good cause for a continuance.
of particular importance to this case,hearings apply only to proposed terminations and suspensions that are taken for a medical disciplinary cause or reason which is defined as that aspect of a doctor competence or professional conduct that is reasonably likely to be detrimental to patient safety or to the delivery of patient care,subd.a,subd.a.
summary of the facts.
for purposes of this appeal,we accept as true the properly pleaded factual allegations of the complaint.thompson county of alameda cal d.
lee is an obstetrician and gynecologist licensed to practice medicine in california.blue shield is a health care service plan.at the time of the events leading to this litigation,lee had been a blue shield health care provider for years.
blue shield proposed to terminate lee as a provider based on concerns about the quality of his medical care and gave lee notice of his right to an hearing.lee timely requested a hearing.blue shield and lee agreed on two persons,a doctor and a lawyer,to serve as the hearing panel.
while the hearing on lee proposed termination was pending,blue shield notified lee it was summarily suspending his provider status because he posed an imminent danger to the health of his patients the proposed termination and summary suspension were consolidated for the hearing.
two weeks before the scheduled start of the hearing,blue shield notified lee counsel by telephone that blue shield was no longer going to participate in the administrative process and that it was terminating lee contract for lee alleged failure to cooperate with the peer review process.according to lee,no further opportunity was provided to lee counsel to respond to the issues raised by blue shield counsel,and no effort whatsoever was made by blue shield counsel to seek the assistance of the hearing panel to resolve this perceived failure to cooperate on the part of lee counsel.three days after this conversation between counsel for blue shield and lee,blue shield notified lee and the hearing panel,in writing,that it was abandoning the fair hearing process and terminating lee contract.the same day,counsel for lee spoke with a member of the hearing panel and was told that as a result of blue shield actions in terminating lee contract,the hearing panel no longer had any authority to conduct the administrative hearing.
based on these facts lee alleges violation of the statutes governing hearings,violation of the common law right to fair procedure,breach of contract,various business torts and entitlement to declaratory relief.as previously noted,the trial court sustained blue shield demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the action on the ground that lee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
discussion 
assuming the truth of lee allegations,blue shield violated the hearing process by terminating the hearing based on its allegation that lee failed to cooperate with discovery.
blue shield argues that lee termination was not justiciable in an hearing because it was not based on a medical disciplinary cause or reason it was based on lee failure to cooperate with the hearing.in the alternative blue shield argues that if lee termination was justiciable in an hearing,his complaint fails because he admits that he did not exhaust his administrative remedy.
lee argues that once blue shield terminated his provider contract,his hearing remedy was no longer available and therefore he was entitled to bring a civil action for damages arising from the wrongful suspension of his provider status and the subsequent wrongful termination of his provider contract.
before lee can seek damages for the wrongful suspension or wrongful termination of his provider contract he must exhaust the hearing remedy,including seeking judicial review of the hearing decision should the suspension or termination be upheld.we conclude,however,that the trial court should have treated lee cause of action for declaratory relief as a petition requesting the court to issue a writ of mandate ordering
