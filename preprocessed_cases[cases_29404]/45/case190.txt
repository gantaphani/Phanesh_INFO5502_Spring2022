the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the seven former employees in this action against their former employer,john hancock mutual life insurance company.the complaint seeks enhanced early retirement benefits under the company pension plan.the question at issue is whether a amendment to the plan,making early retirement with full benefits available at age to those with years of service,applies to former employees whose jobs ended before they retired,or only to those who are still employed when they retire.john hancock appeals,and the former employees the district court calculation of attorney fees.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
john hancock terminated the employment of the seven plaintiffs in march as a result of john hancock sale of part of its business to unicare of california.despite their termination,the former employees remained vested participants in john hancock pension plan.
the company established the john hancock mutual life insurance company pension plan in.the plan has been amended a number of times since it was established,and these amendments have periodically been incorporated in restatements of the plan.the restatement is at issue in this case it was preceded by a restatement.the internal revenue service issued a favorable determination letter for the restatement,meaning that the form of the plan document complies with the internal revenue code requirements for qualified plans.
the parties agree that the plan was amended on october.hancock asserts that this amendment was among those included in the plan restatement,but the former employees refer to the restatement as the partial plan and assert that it is and therefore the amendment must be considered in addition to the restatement.the amendment lowered from to the age at which a qualifying plan participant could elect early retirement at reduced benefits.employees who were at least years old with years of service became eligible for full retirement benefits.before the amendment,employees were subject to a rule of,which allowed full retirement benefits to those with combined age and years of service equaling at least.under the amendment,eligible participants who choose to retire between the ages of and have their benefits calculated using a formula that subtracts of a participant full retirement benefit for each month that precedes the participant birthday.
the plan also had a special provision for participants whose service with hancock had been terminated other than by retirement.such participants had to choose between a full pension at age,or a reduced pension beginning whenever they became eligible for early retirement,with years of service,at age.that reduced pension would be calculated according to the formula with a baseline of age.
the former employees,with one exception,fall into a narrow category of plan participants who had accrued more than years of service with john hancock but had not reached years of age at the time of their termination they claimed full retirement benefits starting at age believing that the liberalization of the retirement age in the amendment applied to them.john hancock,acting in its capacity as plan administrator,denied these former employees full retirement benefits at age.because these individuals employment with john hancock had been terminated before retiring,hancock concluded that they were not eligible for those benefits.john hancock interpreted the plan to preclude this category of participants from obtaining full pension benefits at age.instead,john hancock deemed former employees who left the company prior to age ineligible for full pension benefits until age even if they had accrued years of service.under this reading of the plan,the former employees were early retirees whose pensions were reduced by for each month between the age at which they applied for retirement and age.although the former employees could elect to begin receiving reduced benefits as of age,those benefits would be calculated using the normal retirement age of.
the former employees filed a complaint to obtain the pension benefits described in the plan amendment.the first count is a traditional benefits claim in which the former employees seek a declaration of their rights under the plan pursuant to erisa section a b,a b.in the second count,the former employees allege john hancock breached its fiduciary duty under erisa section a,a.the third count,which asserts relief under the federal common law theory of estoppel,is asserted only on behalf of former employee diebold.the former employees moved for summary judgment on count i of their amended complaint while john hancock sought summary judgment on all three counts.the district court granted the former employees motion,denied john hancock motion on count i,declared moot john hancock motion on counts ii and iii,and awarded attorney fees and costs to the former employees in the amount of.john hancock appeals the summary judgment order and the award of fees and costs,and the former employees the award of attorney fees with respect to the rate at which they were calculated.
standard of review,by court of appeals,of district court decision 
we begin by determining the proper standard of review.the district court grant of summary judgment is,of course,reviewed de novo,with all inferences resolved in favor of john hancock.see chase manhattan bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine dispute as to material facts and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the erisa statute directs the district court to confine its analysis to the terms of the plan.erisa authorizes a participant to bring an action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a b emphasis added.the identity of the plan is thus a material fact,and we must determine whether a genuine issue exists as to that identity.
ii.identifying the plan 
underlying the dispute is a disagreement about which documents constitute the plan.john hancock urges that the plan consists only of the undated version of the john hancock mutual life insurance company pension plan which the former employees attached to their amended complaint as an exhibit.we will refer to this as the restatement,as john hancock admits it was a true and correct copy of the pension plan as of january of that year.john hancock contends it is the operative plan document,and that it alone governs the former employees rights as asserted in count 
the former employees,by contrast,refer to this document as the partial plan and describe it as a mere description of the technical terms of the plan which must be supplemented in order to present a complete statement of the plan terms.the former employees do not present a competing version of an integrated plan document.rather,they assert that a number of items must be considered along with the restatement.they refer to the amendment as the cornerstone of their claim,and state that they also follow the path carved by the district court by relying on the summary plan description and its update to provide additional terms.the summary plan description is a booklet entitled,your benefits program reflecting changing needs,and the update is labeled as such.the former employees find additional support for their interpretation of the plan from documents created around the time of the amendment,including a transcript of comments made by stephen brown,john hancock chairman and ceo,at a company meeting on october,and a letter of the same date from brown to employees.
in its recitation of undisputed facts,the district court quoted portions of the restatement,the amendment,the update to the plan summary plan description,and various letters,brochures,and other documents distributed by john hancock to its employees.likewise,the district court considered these documents in granting summary judgment on count i,the benefits claim,but it provided no explanation as to their relevance or admissibility.
john hancock argues that the summar
