we are asked to decide whether,under california law,the plaintiff general liability insurance policies required the defendants,two insurance companies,to defend their insured against a negligence and breach of contract suit brought by a third party.the district court granted summary judgment to the insurers.because the complaint at issue clearly raised the possibility that the claims against the insured would be covered under the insurance policies,we reverse,grant partial summary judgment to the plaintiff,and remand.
background 
in april,plaintiff and appellant anthem electronics agreed to supply circuit boards to kla instruments,a manufacturer,to be incorporated into scanners that kla then sold kla took delivery of anthem circuit boards from about august through november.
both the circuit boards supplied by anthem and kla final scanner products were quality tested before they were shipped to customers.despite this,the circuit boards had latent defects that caused some of the scanners to fail once in use.the circuit boards supplied by anthem,it turns out,were physically defective such that heat,physical vibration or electrical current over time could cause the electrical connections on the circuit boards to crack or lift apart,causing electrical opens that prevented the scanners from working.anthem admits that these defects were due to manufacturing flaws though it blames its own subcontractor for these flaws.
because some of the scanners in use by kla customers failed,kla was forced to replace them and to incur other unexpected costs due to the loss of use of the scanners into which anthem circuit boards had been installed.to recoup these costs,kla sued anthem in state court.the complaint,filed in november,states causes of action against anthem for breach of contract,negligence,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty of fitness,breach of implied warranty of merchantability,negligent misrepresentation,indebitatus assumpsit,and constructive trust.it alleges that the circuit boards supplied by anthem were defective that kla installed these boards into kla products that the boards intermittently failed and that,as a result of the defective boards,kla suffered damages exceeding million.
in answer to interrogatories,kla categorized its damages claim as including,among other expenses,the following 
approximately million in depreciation expenses for loaner scanners placed at customer sites while defective kla scanners were under repair 
approximately million in interest expenses inventory cost for scanners rendered unshippable by the defective anthem components 
approximately million in lost interest revenue as a result of customers failures to pay bills on time because of defective scanners 
anthem tendered kla complaint to its two general liability coverage insurers,pacific employers insurance pacific and federal insurance federal collectively,the insurers,and requested that the insurers defend anthem against the kla suit.the insurers refused,arguing that the losses alleged in kla complaint were not covered under their insurance policies.
the two insurance policies at issue are both commercial general liability cgl policies.pacific policy covered anthem from june,through june.federal cgl policy covered anthem from june,through june.the two are nearly identical in all relevant aspects,and both are based on standard forms used nationally.thus,we will detail the federal policy and will discuss the pacific policy separately only when a difference so requires.
the federal policy provides that 
we federal will pay damages the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of property damage caused by an occurrence to which this insurance applies.
this insurance applies to property damage which occurs during the policy period 
the policy defines property damage as physical injury to tangible property,including loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.an occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions which result in bodily injury or property damage.thus,the policy covers damages anthem is required to pay to third parties because of loss of use of tangible property due to an occurrence.the policy also gives federal the duty to defend anthem against any suit seeking covered damages.
lastly,the policy contains an impaired property exclusion which excludes coverage for 
property damage to impaired property or property that has not been physically injured arising out of defect,deficiency,inadequacy or dangerous condition in anthem product or anthem work or a delay or failure by anthem or anyone acting on its behalf to perform a contract in accordance with its terms.but this exclusion does not apply to the loss of use of other property arising out of sudden and accidental physical injury to anthem product or anthem work after it has been put to its intended use.
after the insurers refused to defend anthem against kla suit,anthem undertook its own defense and eventually settled with kla.anthem then filed the current action against the insurers for breach of contract,seeking attorney fees,reimbursement for the settlement,and declaratory relief.the district court issued a judgment on the pleadings for the insurers,which was reversed by this court.
anthem then filed a motion for partial summary judgment against the insurers on the duty to defend question,that is,whether the insurers were required to defend anthem against the kla suit federal filed a cross motion for summary judgment against anthem on this question,which pacific later joined.on march,the district court denied anthem motion for partial summary judgment and granted the insurers motion for summary judgment.the district court based its ruling on two grounds the failures of the smt assemblies were not occurrences under the policies,and even if the failures were occurrences,the policies impaired property exclusion barred coverage.
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.lopez smith,cir.we must determine,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to anthem,whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.
ii.discussion 
the insurance policies at issue are third party liability policies,that is,policies that provide coverage for liability of the insured to third parties.such policies provide broader coverage than typical first party property insurance policies,such as homeowners policies,in which the insurer promises to pay money to the insured upon the happening of an event,the risk of which has been insured against.montrose chem.admiral ins,cal th,d.in third party liability policies,by contrast,the carrier assumes a contractual duty to pay judgments the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by the insured.id.
whereas first party insurance coverage is typically triggered by certain enumerated perils,physical and fortuitous events,the right to coverage in the third party liability insurance context draws on traditional tort concepts of fault,proximate cause and duty b y insuring for personal liability,and agreeing to cover the insured for his own negligence,the insurer agrees to cover the insured for a broader spectrum of risks than in insurance policies.id.at,d,emphasis omitted.
an insurer has a very broad duty to defend its insured under california law.the california supreme court has stated that the insured is entitled to a defense if the underlying complaint alleges the insured liability for damages potentially covered under the policy,or if the complaint might be amended to give rise to a liability that would be covered under the policy.montrose chem.superior court,cal th,d.o nce the insured has established potential liability by reference to the factual allegations of the complaint,the terms of the policy,and any extrinsic evidence upon which the insured intends to rely,the insurer must assume its duty to defend unless and until it can conclusively refute that potential.id.emphasis added.to protect an insured right to call on the insurer superior resources for the defense of third party claims california courts have been consistently solicitous of insureds expectations on this score.id.at,d.any doubt as to whether the facts establish the existence of the defense duty must be resolved in the insured favor.id.at,d.
the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend is usually made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.see id.at,d.facts extrinsic to the complaint also give rise to a duty to defend when they reveal a possibility that the claim may be covered by the policy.id.furthermore,an insurer must undertake a reasonable investigation into the circumstances of the claim before denying coverage.am.int l bank fidelity and deposit,th,d.
against this backdrop,anthem case centers on whether,under its cgl policies,a the failure of anthem circuit boards due to faulty workmanship qualifies as an occurrence b the loss of use of kla scanners due to the failure of anthem circuit boards qualifies as property damage and c the impaired property exclusion applies to exclude coverage.once anthem establishes that the damages sought in the kla suit are potentially covered under the policies sometimes referred to as making a prima facie showing,the insurers must conclusively establish the absence of any potential for coverage in order to prevail on the issue.id.at,d.thus,to support the district court summary judgment in their favor,the insurers must show that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the potential for coverage.id.
a.did the kla complaint extrinsic facts establish the possibility of a covered occurrence 
anthem argues that the failures of the circuit boards were occurrences within the meaning of the policies.an occurrence is defined in the federal policy to mean an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions which result in bodily injury or property damage.similarly,the pacific policy defines an occurrence as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.in both definitions,the operative word is accident.
reviewing the kla complaint and comparing it to the terms of the policies,we conclude that the complaint establishes the possibility of a covered occurrence for which anthem may be liable.this is because,at bottom,an occurrence is simply an unexpected consequence of an insured act,even if due to negligence or faulty work.the breakage and failures of the circuit boards were unintended consequences of anthem production and sale of the boards.
in the liability insurance context,accidents need not crash or clatter they need only be unexpected consequences,and they may result even from the insured own negligence.dealing with the same definition of occurrence in a cgl insurance policy,the california court of appeal has defined accidental to include unexpected happenings that occur through carelessness.am.int l bank,th at,d see also hogan midland nat.ins,cal d.put another way,w hen the injury or property damage is an unexpected or unintended consequence of the insured conduct,it may be characterized as an accident for which coverage exists.chu canadian indem,d.
thus,california courts construing similar cgl policies have found coverage where the insured was negligent,and in particular where the insured had installed or supplied defective products,so long as the insured did not know it was doing so.see geddes smith,paul mercury indemnity,cal d,a classic case in which the california supreme court held that the failures of doors,which had been installed with latent defects and which caused property damage,were accidents covered by the policy hogan,cal d at,holding that damage to timber boards resulting from a defective saw supplied by the insured was an accident maryland cas.am.ins,th,d holding that a complaint filed against an insured contractor alleging defective construction work that caused damage establishes a prima facie case of coverage for the contractor.
here,the circuit boards supplied by anthem unexpectedly failed.this failure,even if the result of anthem negligence,raises the possibility of a covered occurrence because it may have happen ed without intent or through carelessness.am.int l bank,th at,d.furthermore,the kla complaint sufficed to inform the insurers that this was so.the insurers knew from the complaint that anthem products had defects,that these products were installed into kla systems,and that the products failed.though the complaint said nothing affirmative about the defects being accidental,neither did it provide a reason to think that they were expected.the possibility that the defects were unexpected is enough to trigger the insurers duty to defend even though the complaint failed to allege an accident.see montrose,cal th at,d,affirming summary judgment for the insured because the allegations in the complaint sufficed to raise the possibility that the insured would be liable for negligent disposal,even though the complaint failed to allege negligence.
the insurers have a heavy burden when seeking summary judgment on the duty to defend.as noted,an insurer must defend its insured so long as the complaint at issue raises the possibility that the insured will be liable for losses covered by its policy.id.at,d,maryland cas,th at,d.put starkly by the california supreme court,the insurers here are relieved of their duty to defend only if kla complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.montrose,cal th at,d,quoting gray zurich ins,cal d.the insurers fail to meet this burden here.
in the main,the insurers counter with two arguments.first,they argue against an occurrence where,as here,a supplier simply breaches a contract and supplies defective goods.but this argument seeks to revive a wooden distinction recently rejected by the california supreme court between contractual claims and insurance claims.see vandenberg superior court,cal th,d,holding that courts must focus on the nature of the risk and the injury,in light of policy provisions,to determine on whether the insured breached a contract.so long as anthem can show that the circuit boards failed unexpectedly and caused covered property damage,it is well on its way to a prima facie case even though a breach of contract may be involved.see group,home indem,th,d dealing only with the breach of a real estate contract,not with the supply of defective goods that later fail unexpectedly.
second,the insurers argue that the economic loss rule precludes an occurrence here.the cases they rely on,however,simply reiterate that tangible property,as opposed to purely economic interests,must be affected to meet the cgl definition of property damage.see,waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,cgl policies do not provide coverage for intangible property losses,including economic losses.here tangible property,in the form of the kla scanners,was damaged within the meaning of the policies through loss of use.we decline to hold that coverage is precluded simply because the extent of such damage is expressed as an economic loss.see hogan,cal d at.
b.did the kla complaint extrinsic facts establish the possibility of covered property damage 
under the policy terms,the insurers owe coverage and the duty to defend only if covered occurrences proximately caused property damage.property damage is defined in both policies to include the loss of use of tangible property,even if that property is not itself physically injured.anthem argues that this definition is met because the circuit boards unexpected failures caused the loss of use of other property,namely,the scanners into which they had been installed.we agree.
anthem defective boards clearly caused property damage to other property,as that term is defined in the policies.kla customers lost the use of tangible property their scanners,and as a result kla suffered losses due to loaner scanners and diminished receivables.kla itself lost the use of unshippable scanners si
