this is a dispute over the meaning of a misplaced modifier.travelers does disagree that a critical modifying clause in the insurance policy it issued may be misplaced as a matter of good grammar.it argues,though,that the meaning of the document remains clear and clearly excludes coverage for payless claim.payless replies that the mis placement of the modifying clause precludes travelers interpretation,or at least renders the insurance policy meaning ambiguous.at summary judgment,the district court rejected payless arguments and entered judgment for travelers.payless now seeks to have that ruling undone.but while misplaced modifiers are syntactical sins righteously condemned by english teachers everywhere,our job is not to critique the parties grammar,but only,if possible,to adduce and enforce their contract meaning.here,a punctuation peccadillo notwithstanding,the meaning of the parties contract is unambiguous.by operation of the plain terms of the agreement,payless has no claim for coverage against travelers,and so we affirm.
this insurance coverage dispute is the offspring of an earlier state class action lawsuit,and some appreciation of that earlier lawsuit is essential to understanding the one now before us.in,a group of present and former payless employees filed a class action against the company in california state court.known for the lead plaintiff,lorena delgado,the class action suit charged that payless unlawfully required hourly employees to work off the clock without compensation and did various other things proscribed by the california labor code,the california business professions code,and state common law.when payless learned of the delgado suit,it notified its insurer,travelers,and asked the company to cover its litigation costs,as well as any eventual liability payless might incur.travelers responded by denying coverage,asserting that the violations of law alleged in delgado fell outside the bounds of the policy terms.
it is this denial of coverage that gives rise to our current case.after some wrangling,payless settled with the delgado plaintiffs for approximately million,including roughly million for class members and for their attorneys.payless then sued travelers in kansas state court seeking to recoup these costs and its costs of defending the suit.travelers removed the case to federal court,noting the parties diversity of citizenship,and each party eventually filed for summary judgment.in a thorough opinion,the district court granted travelers motion,denied payless,and entered a final judgment for travelers.payless now appeals that judgment,asking us to hold that the parties insurance contract requires judgment in its favor,or at least precludes entry of judgment for travelers.
we review appeals from a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,and will affirm only if,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the,we discern no genuine dispute of material fact in need of resolution by a factfinder and conclude that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in making our rule assessment in this diversity suit,the parties agree that the substantive law we must apply is kansas law.
the central battleground on which the parties pitch this appeal is exclusion of payless employment practices liability policy.that exclusion states that 
the insurer shall not be liable for loss on account of any claim made against any insured for an actual or alleged violation of the fair labor standards act except the equal pay act,the national labor relations act,the worker adjustment and retraining notification act,the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of,the occupational safety and health act,the employee retirement security act of,any workers compensation,unemployment insurance,social security,or disability benefits law,other similar provisions of any federal,state,or local statutory or common law or any amendments,rules or regulations promulgated under any of the foregoing provided,however,this exclusion shall not apply to any claim for any actual or alleged retaliatory treatment on account of the exercise of rights pursuant to any such law,rule or regulation.
at emphasis added.
travelers argument for summary judgment proceeds in two movements.first,it submits that the language of this exclusion unambiguously precludes coverage not just for claims arising under the flsa,as discussed in the exclusion first clause,but also for claims involving violations of state laws that are similar to the flsa,pursuant to the exclusion final clause.second,travelers contends that the provisions of state law at issue in the delgado suit are essentially state analogs to the flsa and thus excluded from coverage because they are similar.payless,of course,vigorously contests both of these moves.in what follows,we consider in turn each of these steps and the parties competing analyses of them.
travelers begins by arguing that the only reasonable understanding of the plain language of exclusion is that the other similar provisions phrase applies to and modifies all of the previously listed federal statutes.the policy thus does not require the indemnification of claims for the violation of any state or local law that is similar to any of the federal statutes previously mentioned.for its part,payless contends this reading is anything but plain.at the very least,payless argues,the other similar provisions clause might just as well modify only the clause immediately preceding it,rather than every preceding clause in the exclusion.indeed,payless submits,sound english grammar suggests that modifying clauses typically attach to the last antecedent,not earlier items,in a list.applying this rule,payless would have us read the contract to exclude from coverage only claims concerning violations of state laws that are similar to workers compensation,unemployment insurance,social security,or disability benefits law s,not those that are similar to any of the other listed federal statutes.in any event,payless contends that any ambiguity about all this should be construed against travelers,as the contract drafter.and because travelers only asserts that the allegedly violated state laws are similar to the flsa and not to federal workers compensation,unemployment insurance,social security,or disability laws,payless argues that the parties contract guarantees coverage of its losses.
in interpreting a contract,our job is to ascertain and effectuate the parties intentions whenever possible.see ryco packaging of chapelle int l,d.toward this end,under kansas law we are obliged to ask in the first instance whether the contract,when viewed as a whole,is clear and unambiguous.columbia ins.group.if it is,we are required to enforce the contract in its plain,ordinary,and popular sense as a matter of law.id.of course,if an ambiguity lurks in the parties agreement,judgment as a matter of law may not be possible.but at the same time,we must take care to avoid strain ing to create an ambiguity where,in common sense,there is none.first fin.ins.bugg.after all,ambiguity exists only where the meaning is genuinely uncertain and only after we give a reasonable and practical construction in light of the contract as a whole.penncro,sprint spectrum,cir construing kansas law.applying these principles to the contract before us,we can not least not without some considerable the parties have left any uncertainty about their intentions.several features of the agreement conspire to lead us to conclude that payless interpretation simply is not a plausible reading of the document.
first,in order for the other similar provisions clause plausibly to modify only the immediately preceding workers compensation clause rather than all of the preceding clauses,as payless suggests,one would expect a signal suggesting some connection between them.if,for example,the two clauses read or disability benefits law,other similar provisions,payless interpretation might well be plausible.but the contract does read that way.without some such conjunction,the other similar provisions clause bears no more apparent relation to the immediately preceding workers compensation clause than it does to any of the other preceding clauses.
second,the other similar provisions clause is set off by a comma in much the same manner as every other separately enumerated item in the list,thus further indicating its independence from the workers compensation clause.lists commonly distinguish between separate items by the introduction of commas or semicolons,and that exactly what we have here.of course,if a comma or semicolon did separate the two clauses,payless suggestion that they are more closely connected than the other clauses in the exclusion could bear some scrutiny.see,elliot coal min,office of workers comp.programs,cir i t is the absence of a comma or other punctuation before the coordinate conjunction or that would indicate it and its modifier,the limiting adjective clause,are to be treated separately rather than as part of the whole series.but,again,that simply is not the contract we have.
third,the other similar provisions clause comes at the end of the exclusion,not stuck somewhere in the middle,and it is at the end of a list where modifiers meant to address all of the preceding items are often found.see,am.mut.liability ins.of boston meyer,cir interpreting an insurance contract and finding it obvious that the qualifying clause last quoted should modify all that goes before it.after all,no airport that posted a sign prohibiting on airplanes knives,explosives,rifles,other similar items,or any item that could be mistaken for any of the foregoing would think it had forbidden shotguns but not samurai swords.shotguns are similar to rifles,just as samurai swords are similar to knives.by placing other similar items after the examples,the airport sign clearly means to signal its disapproval of both.
finally,under payless competing reading of the contract,travelers disclaimed coverage for litigation under a whole host of federal,nlra,warn,cobra,osha,and retained coverage for intentional violations of similar or identical state laws.and it did all this while expressly disclaiming coverage for liabilities arising under state laws similar to federal workers compensation laws.on this view of the contract,then,the parties clearly foresaw the possibility of claims arising under state laws with analogous,even identical,counterparts in federal law they also demonstrated a knowledge of how to exclude them from coverage yet,they excluded such claims only haphazardly or randomly.no one before us has suggested how the scheme of coverage and exclusion resulting from payless which travelers disclaimed responsibility for liabilities arising under certain federal laws but then assumed responsibility for some but not all liabilities arising under parallel and even identical state represent a rational understanding of the parties intent.indeed,every indication we have before us suggests such a scheme would vitiate that intent.and our obligation i n placing a construction on a written instrument,under kansas law,is to favor reasonable rather than unreasonable interpretations.arnold sjl of kansas,gore beren,instructing us to avoid r esults which vitiate the purpose or reduce the terms of the contract to an absurdity 
in spite of all this,payless characterizes its interpretation as at least sufficiently plausible to create an ambiguity about the contract meaning.in particular,payless emphasizes the fact that the other similar provisions clause appears just after the workers compensation clause and contends that it could well modify only that clause.in aid of its interpretation,payless invokes the dictum that relative and qualifying words,phrases,and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding.liberty life ins.guthrie.as payless itself concedes,however,this last antecedent principle is merely an interpretive presumption based on the grammatical rule against misplaced modifiers.operating on the assumption that most contracts follow most rules of grammar,courts tend to prefer interpretations that conform to those rules.at the same time,though,we know that grammatical rules are bent and broken all the time,and we will not enforce the more grammatical interpretation of a contract when evident sense and meaning require a different construction.link,city of hays,internal quotation mark omitted.or,as the united states supreme court has put it,the last antecedent presumption can assuredly be overcome by other indicia of meaning.jama immigration customs enforcement,d internal quotation marks omitted.given how common misplaced modifiers are in daily usage,the supreme court has candidly acknowledged that o ver the years,such indicia have counseled us against invoking the rule often unanimously at least as many times as we have relied on it.accord barnhart thomas,d.
all this underscores that,while the rules of english grammar often afford a valuable starting point to understanding a speaker meaning,they are violated so often by so many of us that they can hardly be safely relied upon as the end point of any analysis of the parties plain meaning.so it is that groucho marx could joke in animal crackers,one morning i shot an elephant in my pajamas.how he got into my pajamas i never know,leaving his audience at once amused by the image of a pachyderm stealing into his night clothes and yet certain that marx meant something very different.in the more mundane task of contract interpretation,we must be no less entitled to acknowledge the parties plain meaning without being by a grammatical rule into reaching a patently unintended result.see link,at i f application of the last antecedent rule would involve an absurdity,do violence to the plain intent of the language,or if the context for other reason requires a deviation from the rule,it will be necessary and proper to look for another antecedent.internal quotation marks omitted 
even if the last antecedent presumption does definitively resolve the interpretive issue in its favor,payless argues that the parties contract still must be construed against travelers as its drafter.the sensibility of the contra proferentem canon of construction,however,rests in large measure on an assumption of unequal bargaining strength between the seller and purchaser,see cas.sur.budig,supposing as it does the prototypical case of a large insurance company essentially dictating its terms in an adhesion contract to individuals with relatively little bargaining power.it is less clear whether and to what degree the doctrine has an appropriate role to play when the contracting parties are as sophisticated and able as payless and travelers both assuredly are.indeed,kansas courts seem to have begun wrestling with just these questions.see,wood river pipeline willbros energy servs,the principle that doubtful language in a contract is construed against the drafter is of little consequence when,among other things,the clauses were bargained for by two large and sophisticated companies of equal bargaining power,each acting through experienced persons.but even assuming without deciding the doctrine has some appropriate function in a dispute between commercial jupiters like travelers and payless,it is a function that can be triggered only if the terms of the policy are ambiguous,see fowler united equitable ins,and not to overcome a contract plain meaning.for the reasons we already explained,the exclusion before us in this case is not ambiguous,and the only plausible reading is that it precludes coverage for all state and local laws that are similar to any of the enumerated federal statutes,including the fair labor standards act.by its own terms,then,the contra proferentem canon holds no sway here.
having established that the parties agreement excludes coverage for claims alleging a violation of laws similar to the flsa,we are still only halfway home.the question remains whether the state laws invoked in the delgado suit meet this test.
the delgado lawsuit alleged,first and foremost,that payless violated the wage and hour restrictions of the california labor code.payless argues that the clc and flsa are not similar because,among other things,the flsa,unlike the california law,does not require employers to provide rest periods,m
