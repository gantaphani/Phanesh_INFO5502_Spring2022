council tower association council tower commenced this action in missouri state court against axis specialty insurance company axis,a connecticut insurer,and jim vavak,an independent claims adjuster and missouri resident.council tower asserts insurance coverage and related claims for losses incurred when a portion of the brick veneer covering the east wall of council tower apartment building in louis fell to the ground.axis removed the case,and council tower moved to remand.see.c.the district denied the motion to remand and dismissed council tower claims against vavak,concluding that those claims were without merit and had been fraudulently joined to destroy diversity jurisdiction.ruling on cross motions for summary judgment by axis and council tower,the court granted summary judgment for axis,concluding that council tower loss was not covered under the policy additional coverage for losses resulting from collapse of a building or any part of a building.council tower appeals both rulings.we affirm.
i.the claims against axis.
the east exterior wall of council tower building was covered with a decorative brick veneer,stories tall,attached to the concrete wall by steel shelf angles and anchor bolts.in october,during the policy coverage period,every brick below the eighth story of the east wall fell to the ground along with several of the supporting steel shelf angles.council tower filed a timely claim under the policy for reimbursement of its loss.
the axis commercial property policy insured council tower building against all risks of direct physical loss except losses specifically excluded or limited.excluded losses included wear and tear decay,deterioration,and latent defect settling,cracking,or expansion faulty or defective design,construction,or maintenance and collapse,except as provided below in the additional coverage for collapse.as relevant here,the additional coverage for collapse provided 
we will pay for direct physical loss or damage to covered property,caused by collapse of a building or any part of a building insured under this coverage form,if the collapse is caused by one or more of the following hidden decay 
collapse does not include settling,cracking,shrinkage,bulging or expansion.
after an investigation by independent insurance adjuster vavak,axis denied the claim on the ground that the loss was caused by inadequate design or construction and therefore excluded.when an expert reported that a loss of lateral stability had caused the bricks to collapse somewhat vertically,council tower commenced this lawsuit for breach of contract and vexatious refusal to pay its claim.
after substantial discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.axis argued that the loss was excluded by the and exclusions.council tower argued that the failure was a collapse of a part of the building caused by hidden decay of the anchor bolts therefore,the loss was covered under the additional coverage for collapse.axis countered that the failure was not a covered collapse under missouri law.the district court in a thorough opinion noted that collapse is the only theory of recovery advanced by council tower and concluded that this coverage theory failed because there was no collapse under missouri law.council tower ass axis spec.ins,wl,at.the court granted axis summary judgment and dismissed all claims.on appeal,council tower argues the court erred in concluding that the east wall failure was not a collapse of a part of the building within the meaning of the additional coverage for collapse 
in this diversity case,we must apply missouri law as declared by the state highest court,the supreme court of missouri.erie tompkins,cincinnati ins.bluewood,cir.under missouri law,it is that the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.seeck geico ins,banc.if the policy is unambiguous,it will be enforced as written.bluewood,at.
among state courts,two competing interpretations of the term collapse have emerged.many state courts limit the word collapse to its plain meaning,usually quoting or adopting a dictionary definition such as,t o fall into a confused mass or into a flattened form by loss of rigidity or support to break down,give way,fall in,cave in.eaglestein pac.fire ins,quoting the oxford english dictionary.the missouri court of appeals has consistently followed this line of authority,holding that collapse is an unambiguous term in a property insurance policy,plainly meaning a falling or reduction to a flattened form or rubble.williams state farm fire cas,quoting eaglestein,at accord heintz fid.guar.however,other state courts have adopted a broader definition,concluding that the term collapse is ambiguous in this context and holding that there need not be rubble on the ground for a loss to trigger coverage.this test examines whether there was a substantial impairment of the structural integrity of a building or part of a building.monroe guar.ins.magwerks.
the supreme court of missouri has not addressed this issue.though only that court decisions are controlling in a diversity case,we may not disregard decisions of the missouri court of appeals unless we are convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.west am.here,both parties treated the missouri court of appeals decisions as controlling in their for summary judgment,as did the district court.we will do likewise.applying this legal standard,we review the district court denial of coverage and grant of summary judgment de novo.
the narrow issue before us is whether,under missouri law,the falling of seven stories of a exterior brick veneer was a collapse of a building or any part of a building.without question,after the fall,there was some rubble on the ground,but the entire building was not reduc ed to a flattened form.williams,at.the question,then,is whether part of the building collapsed.it is clear that,under missouri law,not every event is a collapse of part of a building.eaglestein,at,quoting gage union mut.fire ins.
as the district court noted,this question was directly addressed by the missouri court of appeals in williams 
the language in the policy or any part thereof obviously refers to collapse of a part of a building,not partial collapse of a part or the whole of a building.the falling or reduction to a flattened form or rubble of an attached garage,supporting foundation wall or roof would appear to be but a few examples of collapse of a part of a building where the claim pertains to a collapse of a part of a building,there must be a collapse of that part.a partial collapse of a part is entirely outside the contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract.
at,quoting in part gage,at.relying on this passage,which was cited favorably in heintz,at,the district court concluded that the collapse of the lower seven stories of the brick veneer was not a collapse of a part of a building.though the issue is not free from doubt,we agree.
the issue is particularly doubtful because none of the three missouri court of appeals decisions construing the term collapse involved losses from events that produced a significant quantity of rubble.council tower argues that the pile of bricks on the ground is enough to prove a covered collapse.but the passage in williams makes clear,as the district court held,that fallen bricks alone do not establish that part of the building collapsed.here,we agree with the district court that the entire brick veneer covering the east wall,which served a decorative but not a structural purpose,constituted a part of the building.see ass of unit owners of nestani state farm fire cas,d,part of a building is an integral element that is essential to completeness.
whether the fall of seven stories of bricks constituted a collapse of this decorative part of the building may be debatable,but the district court conclusion is consistent with the few factually similar cases from other jurisdictions.see nw.mut.ins.bankers union life ins,no collapse of a part occurred when seven veneer panels fell from the building exterior walls because there was no structural change and loss of form baker whitley,s,no collapse of a part of
