this case at first glance concerns a private insurance dispute but,as we shall see,implicates important questions of national health policy for senior citizens.vencor,vencor,an operator of several hospital and nursing home facilities,is the of a medicare supplemental insurance contract between national states insurance company nsic and clarence rollins,a individual.in this diversity case,nsic paid vencor vencor hospital for rollins care,the amount that medicare would have paid.vencor argues that nsic did not pay it nearly enough.according to vencor,rollins supplemental policy obligated nsic to pay the full amount vencor would have charged a patient,so nsic failure to pay the charges constituted a breach of the contract.the district court,on summary judgment,held that there was no breach of contract.we affirm.
background 
medicare coverage and medigap insurance 
medicare part a provides limited inpatient hospital benefits to eligible citizens.during the first days of hospitalization,medicare pays for all covered services except for coinsurance and certain deductibles.a.a patient hospitalized for more than days may draw upon a lifetime reserve of days of additional medicare coverage.a.in exchange for receiving payments from medicare,providers agree to accept that payment,along with any coinsurance or deductible,as payment in full.a 
medicare beneficiaries who desire medical coverage in addition to the coverage provided by medicare can purchase medicare supplemental insurance policies,known as medigap polices.see id.g.these policies provide purchasers with supplementary hospitalization coverage,including coverage of hospitalization costs after the patient exhausts all the hospitalization days medicare will pay for.see id.g.
after the medicare program had been in effect for a while,congress became concerned that older citizens were being exploited by the sale of medigap policies that did not provide the coverage buyers thought they were purchasing.see social security disability amendments of,pub,a june,codified at f requiring evaluation of the effectiveness of state regulation of medigap policies in limiting marketing and agent abuse and assuring dissemination of sufficient information to enable informed choice.congress therefore amended the social security act to establish a voluntary certification program for medigap policies.through that program,private insurers could receive federal certification for medigap policies that met specific federal standards.id.codified as amended at.at congress request,the national association of insurance commissioners naic,an organization of state insurance commissioners,developed the federal standards.
in,congress went further in protecting medigap insurance consumers.instead of its former voluntary program,congress mandated that medigap insurers conform their plans to one of ten model medigap policies,to be developed by the naic omnibus budget reconciliation act of,codified as amended at p.as amended in,the medigap statute now provides that no medigap policy may be issued in a state unless that state has provided for the application and enforcement of the naic model regulation model regulation.social security act amendments of,codified at a a see also p a ii t he secretary may not provide for or permit the grouping of benefits or language or format with respect to such benefits under a medicare supplemental policy seeking approval by the secretary unless such grouping meets the naic model regulation.
arizona,as required,adopted the model regulation.ann.a.admin.code et.an arizona regulation now provides that medigap policies issued in the state must comply with a set of uniform standards identical to those in the naic model regulation.admin.code.under that regulation,all medigap policies must contain the basic set of core benefits provided for in the model regulation,known as package id.c see also fed.reg.at.
key to this case is the language insurers are required to use in describing the core medigap benefits provided.in language identical to the model regulation,arizona law requires that the core benefit package include the following coverage 
upon exhaustion of the medicare hospital inpatient coverage including the lifetime reserve days,coverage of the medicare part expenses for hospitalization paid at the diagnostic related group drg day outlier per diem or other appropriate standard of payment,subject to a lifetime maximum benefit of an additional days 
admin.code c see also fed.reg.at an arizona regulation,also in language prescribed by the model regulation,requires that all medigap policies solicited or issued for delivery in arizona contain certain definitions or terms.admin.code a.one of those definitions,central to this case,provides medicare eligible expenses shall be defined as expenses of the kinds covered by medicare,to the extent recognized as reasonable and medically necessary by medicare.id.a see also fed.reg.at.
further,in compliance with federal law and the model regulation,arizona law requires that insurers provide all applicants for medigap insurance with a guide that outlines the benefits provided.admin.code c app.b p b requiring medigap insurers to provide individuals,before the sale of the policy,an outline of coverage which describes the benefits under the policy on a standard form approved by the state regulatory program or the secretary as the case may be consistent with the naic model regulation fed.reg.at this outline of coverage outline must contain a chart explaining that,for an additional days of hospitalization after all lifetime reserve days are used,medicare pays,the medigap insurer pays of expenses,and the insured pays.admin.code c app.b see also fed.reg.at.in accordance with the model regulation,the arizona regulation requires that,beneath the heading read your policy very carefully,the outline caution

rollins insurance policy with nsic 
rollins was a patient at vencor hospital,a hospital,from november,until his death on april.the medigap policy rollins purchased from nsic covered rollins hospital stay after march,when his medicare coverage ran out.
during the time medicare covered rollins,vencor billed medicare directly for his care except for coinsurance and a deductible,which nsic paid.the bills listed charges based on vencor standard rates,but medicare reimbursed vencor for rollins hospitalization at a greatly discounted per diem rate,and vencor accepted this amount as payment in full id.a a.
after rollins exhausted his medicare hospitalization benefits,nsic paid for rollins hospital expenses until his death seven weeks later.vencor billed for this care,based on its standard rates nsic paid only,basing its payments on the same much lower per diem rate that medicare had been paying.as a result,of vencor billed charges for rollins care remains unpaid.vencor central claim in this case is that the medigap policy between rollins and nsic obligated nsic to pay that difference.
the question in this case therefore turns on the coverage provided in the medigap policy that rollins purchased from nsic.only the core benefits provision of that policy,common to all medigap policies,is here relevant.see.admin.code.
the nsic medigap policy describes rollins hospitalization coverage in language similar to that used in the arizona regulation,which incorporates the standards 
hospital will provide 
a coverage of part a expense for hospital confinement to the extent not covered by medicare,from the day through the day in any medicare benefit period.
b coverage of part a expense for hospital confinement to the extent not covered by medicare for each medicare lifetime inpatient reserve day used.
c upon exhaustion of the medicare hospital inpatient coverage including the lifetime reserve days,coverage of the medicare part a eligible expenses for hospital confinement to the same extent as would have been covered by medicare,subject to a lifetime maximum benefit of an additional days 
again as required by arizona law,the policy defines expense as expense of the kind covered by medicare,to the extent recognized as reasonable and medically necessary by medicare.
nsic also provided rollins the mandated outline of coverage.admin.code c,and the buyer guide,id.a,both of which described the hospitalization benefit as prescribed by the laws explained above.
these materials give rise to the present controversy nsic maintains that its commitment under these only commitment required by federal and state medigap insurance to pay rollins whatever medicare would have paid for his hospitalization.vencor insists,to the contrary,that the promise must have been to pay vencor charges,as the regulations do not expressly limit what vencor can charge yet mandate a representation that the covered patient will pay.in the end,of course,either the patient family or the insurance company will have to pay the billed amount,or the hospital will have to accept the much lower medicare rate.as will appear,however,it is not necessary in this case fully to determine all aspects of this tripartite financial relationship.
prior proceedings 
maintaining that it is not the hospital that should be left to absorb the difference between its billing rate and the amount medicare would have paid,vencor sued nsic,alleging breach of contract and subrogation and seeking payment of,the difference between vencor billed charges and the amount it collected from nsic.after discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.
the district court granted nsic motion for summary judgment,holding that no breach of contract occurred.the court ruled,first,that as a matter of arizona state contract and medigap law,rollins medigap policy obligated nsic to pay for rollins hospitalization charges at the same rate that medicare would have been required to pay to cover those charges had rollins not exhausted his medicare coverage.second,the district court indicated that the arizona state regulation governing medigap insurance,see.admin.code c,limits what a hospital can collect from patients who are covered by privately issued medigap insurance policies.
following an appeal to this court and a subsequent remand,the district court entertained vencor motion for relief from judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court denied the motion,declining to consider,as not new evidence,documents offered by vencor as demonstrating that arizona did not intend to restrict what hospitals could charge under medigap policies 
the court noted,however,that even if it had incorrectly ruled in its original decision that vencor could not charge more than the discounted medicare rate under rollins medigap policy,a reversal on this point would not alter its final judgment 
w hether or not providers are allowed to charge rates above those established by the medicare act does not change the court disposition of the ultimate question whether the medigap policy at issue obligated defendant to pay plaintiff at the rates higher than the medicare rates whether federal state legislative history lends support to the court finding that the legislative intent was to limit the rates to those approved by medicare does not change the court interpretation of the policy at issue under the arizona law.
on appeal,vencor challenges the district court interpretation of rollins medigap policy.it also maintains that we can not decide this case without determining whether the arizona medigap regulation limits what vencor can charge for services to patients who have exhausted their medicare coverage and challenges the district court original conclusion that arizona law does incorporate such a limit.
ii.discussion 
as is true of many puzzles,how one solves the conundrum presented by the intersection of state and federal medigap regulation,on the one hand,and the competing interests of nsic,vencor,and vencor customers,on the other,may depend largely on where one starts.as judges,however,we are not free to choose either our starting or our ending place.rather,we must start with the precise case before dispute between an insurance company and its beneficiary assignee regarding what benefits the policy obligates the insurer to pay.once we resolve that dispute,we have completed our task.as will appear,we can do so without setting out all the rights and responsibilities of the affected parties and therefore leave full solution of this regulatory and legislative puzzle for another day.
a.the policy 
despite the heavy overlay of federal and state medigap insurance regulation,our basic job here is to interpret the insurance policy that established the scope of rollins medigap coverage.we conclude that,read as a whole,the insurance policy provided by nsic unambiguously states that nsic will cover the costs of hospital expenses at the same rate as medicare would have covered these costs.see security ins.of hartford andersen,when an insurance policy is clear,a court may not invent ambiguity.
to repeat,the entire hospitalization coverage provision of the policy reads 
hospital will provide 
a coverage of part a expense for hospital confinement to the extent not covered by medicare,from the day through the day in any medicare benefit period.
b coverage of part a expense for hospital confinement to the extent not covered by medicare for each medicare lifetime inpatient reserve day used.
c upon exhaustion of the medicare hospital inpatient coverage including the lifetime reserve days,coverage of the medicare part a eligible expenses for hospital confinement to the same extent as would have been covered by medicare,subject to a lifetime maximum benefit of an additional days.
reading all three of these coverage provisions together,as we must,demonstrates that the to the extent covered language in the contract refers to the dollar amount that medicare pays for the same services.see state farm mutual automobile ins.arrington,citing nichols state farm fire cas,requiring courts to read the contract as a whole to give a reasonable and harmonious effect to all provisions.
hospitalization coverage provisions a and b use the term part a expense.in each case,the provision then goes on to say that coverage is to the extent not covered by medicare,plainly referring to an amount of money for the eligible service that medicare will not pay and that the insurance policy will pay instead.just as to the extent not covered by medicare in a and b refers to not reimbursed by medicare,so too must to the extent as would have been covered by medicare refer to the dollar amount medicare would pay if coverage had not been exhausted 
this conclusion is further supported by breaking coverage grant c into two parts medicare part a eligible expenses for hospital confinement and to the same extent as would have been covered by medicare.vencor maintains that the second part of the provision means the sort of services covered by medicare.but the policy,as required by law,defines expense to mean expense of the kind covered by medicare,to the extent recognized as reasonable and medically necessary by medicare.this phrase directly refers to the sort of expenses that medicare would cover.thus,if vencor argument regarding the second phrase is correct,then each part of the provision means the same thing the policy would cover the sort of services medicare covers to the extent that they are the sort of services that medicare covers.on the other hand,if the second part of the provision refers,as nsic contends,to the medicare rate,then the coverage grant makes sense it covers the sort of services covered by medicare up to the amount that medicare would have paid for them.
we therefore conclude that,reading only the language of the nsic insurance policy,the coverage provisions obligated nsic to reimburse vencor only at the rate medicare would have paid 
considerations external to the policy 
there are,however,two considerations external to the four corners of the policy that vencor maintains require us to interpret the policy otherwise 
provisions mandated by law 
the first such consideration we are asked to examine is the principle of arizona law specifying that even if an insurance policy does not contain a certain coverage provision,that provision is added to the policy if it is mandated by law insurance of north america superior court.vencor contention is that part of the arizona medigap regulation requires coverage of any amount the hospital chooses to bill.
the arizona regulation to which vencor ascribes this meaning is the one that requires insurers to offer the following hospitalization core benefit 
upon exhaustion of the medicare hospital inpatient coverage including the lifetime reserve days,coverage of the medicare part expenses for hospitalization paid at the drg day outlier per diem or other appropriate standard of payment,subject to a lifetime maximum benefit of an additional days 
admin.code c appropriate standard regulation.this language differs from the coverage provision in nsic policy,which,once again,states that the insurer will provide coverage of the medicare part expenses for hospital confinement to the same extent as would have been covered by medicare.but the rule requiring the importation of mandatory coverage provisions into insurance policies has no application here,because the substance of the regulation requirement and of the policy provision is the same.
the drg payment standard mentioned in the appropriate standard regulation refers to the manner in which medicare reimburses some hospitals,namely at a predetermined rate based upon the diagnostic related group classification of the patient illness at the time of admission see,supra d.the drg coverage standard does not apply to care provided by vencor and other hospitals.see e.instead,vencor and other acute care hospitals are reimbursed according to a reasonable cost reimbursement system at a per diem rate for each day that a patient is hospitalized.b,v b pt.
because the drg standard of payment refers to one of the two typical medicare reimbursement formulas for hospitals,under the maxim of ejusdem generis,it follows that other appropriate standard of payment refers to the other medicare reimbursement this case,the per diem rate for hospitals.see circuit city stores,adams,d under this rule of construction the residual clause should be read to give effect to the preceding terms,and should itself be controlled and defined by reference to the enumerated categories which are recited just before it norfolk western rwy.american train dispatchers ass n,d under the principle ejusdem generis,when a general term follows a specific one,the general term should be understood as a reference to subjects akin to the one with specific enumeration.
bolstering this conclusion is an arizona regulation that prohibits medigap insurers from providing for the payment of benefits based on standards described as usual and customary,reasonable and customary or words of similar import.admin.code a.for the purposes of reimbursement of hospitals,federal medigap regulations define customary charges as the regular rates that providers charge both beneficiaries and other paying patients for the services furnished to them.a.the federal regulations also provide criteria for determining whether a charge is reasonable.listing standards including the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person furnishing such services and the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services.
this additional restriction on what medigap policies can provide affirms that other appropriate standard of payment can not refer to the amount a medicare provider chooses to bill.if vague billing terms like customary can not be used to signify the provider rates,no other terms are provided,and the language indicates that there does exist an appropriate standard,emphasis added,then the necessary implication is that some external governing standard,not just the size of the provider bill,delimits the obligations of the policy.the obvious applicable standard,parallel to the drg rate specifically mentioned,is the appropriate medicare this case,the per diem rate medicare was paying before rollins exhausted his hospitalization coverage.and that rate,multiplied by the number of days rollins stayed in the hospital after his coverage had expired,is the exact amount which nsic has already paid vencor.
the upshot is that the arizona regulations require medigap coverage at the same reimbursement rate that medicare uses.that is exactly what the nsic policy provides.arizona medigap regulations therefore do not alter the unambiguous terms of nsic insurance contract with rollins.
outline of coverage 
vencor suggests,however,that the contents of the insurance policy and the arizona regulations are not the end of the story and asks us to take the prescribed outline of coverage into account as well.
although the actual insurance contract does not contain any promises regarding rollins possible expenses,the outline does the outline informed rollins that he would pay for up to days of hospital care and that nsic would pay of medicare eligible expenses.that provision of the outline,vencor argues,should be understood as incorporated into the policy and necessitates that the policy proper can not be read to mean what its plain terms would otherwise import.
an insurer,it is true,can not both promise that it will pay only part of an insured billed costs and still promise that the insured will pay nothing,unless the provider has agreed to accept the insurer partial payment as payment in vencor insists that there is no such agreement,explicit or implicit.whether this riddle posed by the outline of coverage is relevant to the narrow problem before us depends on whether the outline could modify the otherwise clear language of the insurance policy.it can not.instead,the policy must be read independently of the outline for three reasons the outline itself supports that conclusion the regulations mandating distribution of the outline support that conclusion and the reasonable expectations doctrine does not apply in this context to hold nsic liable for the representations of the outline 
first,the outline itself makes clear that it should not be construed as part of the insurance policy.on the second page of the outline,a message in large type warns read your policy very carefully.beneath this warning a message in standard sized type states this is only an outline,describing your policy most important features.the policy is your insurance contract.you must read the policy to understand all of the rights and duties of both you and your insurance company.it would be nonsensical to consider the outline to be a part of the contract when on its face and in a very conspicuous manner it declares that it is not.blue cross blue shield,d at.
second,the very regulation that mandates distribution of the outline requires that the outline contain this clear and conspicuous language stating that it is not part of the policy,that the terms are dictated by the policy,and that the insured should read the policy very carefully.thus,the language of the regulation establishes that requiring distribution of the outline was not intended to make the outline part of the policy.
third,the reasonable expectations doctrine does not require us to hold nsic liable for the full costs vencor incurred in providing rollins care.this important doctrine of arizona insurance law and the insurance law of many other states,see ostrager newman,handbook on insurance coverage disputes,b b ed.protects individuals from overreaching by insurance companies by hold ing the drafter to good faith and terms which are conscionable.darner motor sales,universal underwriters ins.the doctrine,essentially a relaxation of the rule barring parol evidence from being admitted to discern the intent of the parties to a contract,see id.at,can override even unambiguous contract provisions when an insured reasonably expected the provision to operate differently.gordinier aetna casualty surety.
vencor argues that,under the reasonable expectations doctrine,even if the outline is not considered part of the policy,its representations still require nsic to cover the charges for rollins hospitalization.we disagree.
as an initial matter,we note that the only way the reasonable expectations doctrine could alter the terms of the policy is if vencor is permitted to bill rollins at a rate higher than the medicare rate.if vencor can not legally charge medicare patients who have exhausted their medicare coverage a rate in excess of the medicare rate,then any reasonable expectation created by the outline would be entirely consistent with the unambiguous coverage terms of the policy nsic policy covers rollins expenses to the same extent as medicare,and rollins is left owing,as the outline states.if,on the other hand,vencor can charge its rates to rollins and other patients who have exhausted their medicare coverage,then our conclusion that nsic is liable only for what medicare would have paid creates a result seemingly contrary to the outline dictated by the medigap regulations vencor could balance bill the patients for the difference,leaving rollins and other medicare patients with substantial uninsured costs.
vencor understanding of its billing rights under the medigap regulations is quite debatable.another court of appeals has characterized the issue as one of whether the regulations impose price controls.vencor,physicians mutual ins.but,the issue is more properly understood,perhaps,as one of whether the promise medical care providers make in order to be reimbursed by medicare under a a i not to bill covered individuals with regard to items or services for which such individual is entitled to have payment made under this subchapter carries over to reimbursement for the same items or services under medigap insurance policies,whose terms are dictated by the naic model regulation directly incorporated in the same subchapter id.
that the medigap insurance regulations were drafted against background understandings that there is such a continuing agreement,that medigap insurance is intended to provide covered patients with the same protection they enjoyed under medicare,and that medical providers therefore may not balance bill patients covered by medigap policies,seems quite possible.otherwise,the representations made in the outline would make little sense.so,another way of looking at the same question would be to ask whether the state and federal medigap statutes and regulations,it is explicitly incorporated into those statutes and naic model regulation,give rise to an implicit agreement by medical providers,when they accept payment through medigap insurance,to charge the medicare rates with regard to items and services covered by that insurance.
at the same time,it is curious indeed that such an important matter as the billing rate of medical providers for medical services covered by medigap policies is left to interpretation,implication,or inference,even informed inference,rather than made explicit.one is left with the sense that,as is sometimes the case,a critical aspect of the contractual and regulatory scheme was left unstated precisely because it was so much a bedrock premise of the involved parties that the need for articulation escaped drafters such lapses of attention are unfortunate,as affected parties and courts are then left to trace the interpretive threads left behind.
we need not trace those threads to their ultimate destination in this case,however.the only issue before us is the amount vencor,as the assignee of rollins benefits,may collect from nsic.as no question concerning the amount vencor may collect from rollins estate is directly before us,we should shy from answering that question unless we have to blue cross blue shield,at declining,in a case similar to this one,to address the balance billing issue because it is an issue to be resolved,either amicably or in litigation,between vencor and the respective insureds.and,for the reasons that follow,we conclude that,even if vencor were right about its balance billing option,the reasonable expectations doctrine would not apply in this unusual insurance because so tightly overseen by federal and state regulation as to leave the insurer with little independent role in delineating the policy terms.
the reasonable expectations doctrine at its inception was intended largely to regulate overreaching by vendors and insurance companies who make oral or written representations that mislead potential purchasers.robert keeton,insurance law rights at variance with policy provisions,harv,see also darner,at.it does not apply to any circumstance in which an insurance policy is inconsistent with some other information an insured obtains concerning the coverage offered by that policy but only to those situations that come within the purposes of the doctrine.
gordinier lists a limited variety of situations in which arizona courts will apply the reasonable expectations doctrine to defeat unambiguous boilerplate insurance terms 
where the contract terms,although not ambiguous to the court,can not be understood by the reasonably intelligent consumer who might check on his or her rights,the court will interpret them in light of the objective,reasonable expectations of the average insured 
where the insured did not receive full and adequate notice of the term in question,and the provision is either unusual or unexpected,or one that emasculates apparent coverage 
where some activity which can be reasonably attributed to the insurer would create an objective impression of coverage in the mind of a reasonable insured 
where some activity reasonably attributable to the insurer has induced a particular insured reasonably to believe that he has coverage,although such coverage is expressly and unambiguously denied by the policy.
at citations and quotations omitted.see also philadelphia indem.ins.barerra,in gordinier,we confirmed that the darner methodology applies to a limited number of cases in which the boilerplate contract clauses are unambiguous but still operate oppressively.this case involves none of the four circumstances described in gordinier.
the coverage provision of the nsic policy is not worded in such a way that the reasonably intelligent consumer could not understand it as reaching the amount of money that medicare would pay for the same items and services.there is nothing particularly arcane or technical about the pertinent language.nor is there any evidence that rollins did not receive full and adequate notice of the coverage terms of his insurance contract with nsic.the pertinent language is contained in precisely the location where one would look for it,the basic coverage provision,not in a definitional section,small print addenda,or other part of the policy.there is no suggestion that rollins was not provided with the policy or could not,for some reason personal to him,understand it.
the third and fourth situations to which the reasonable expectations doctrine applies under gordinier require some activity which can be reasonably attributed to the insurer.at.nsic did not choose the language of the outline or circulate the outline for promotional purposes.rather,state law mandated the relevant language of the outline and required that insurers distribute the outline of coverage along with any medigap policy.admin.code c.furthermore,state law mandated the level at which nsic could cover rollins hospitalization costs.id.c.philadelphia indemnity,at holding an insurance company liable for an accident clearly outside the protection of the policy actual terms but that could reasonably have been expected to be covered based on a promotional brochure drafted and distributed by the insurer.if patients are being,as suggested above,it is far from clear that they are,as it is doubtful that vencor and other hospitals may balance bill cause is not some activity which can be reasonably attributed to the insurer,but confusion created by the federal and state statutes and regulations.
a related principle of arizona contract law confirms that the reasonable expectations doctrine can not alter the coverage conclusion we reached by reading the
