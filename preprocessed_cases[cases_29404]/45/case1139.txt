the plaintiff james hindall hindall appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to winterthur international winterthur and travelers indemnity of illinois travelers as well as the district court denial of his summary judgment motion.hindall was injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by the negligence of an underinsured driver.at the time of the accident,hindall was an employee of philips display,a subsidiary of philips electronics north america,which had contracted for insurance with both winterthur and travelers.hindall claims that he is an insured under these policies and is entitled to coverage under both of them.
the district court premised its grant of summary judgment to the defendants on its belief that philips display,hindall employer,was validly offered and had validly rejected coverage,and that the winterthur and travelers policies therefore did not cover the injuries hindall sustained.in light of the ohio supreme court recent decision in kemper michigan millers mutual insurance,ohio,however,we are bound to hold that the offer and rejection of coverage here were invalid,and that coverage therefore arises by operation of law under both the travelers and winterthur policies.we therefore reverse the district court grant of summary judgment to winterthur and travelers,vacate the district court denial of summary judgment to hindall,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
on may,hindall was involved in a motor vehicle accident in findlay,ohio,when a car driven by mandy klinger struck hindall motorcycle.although klinger insurance company paid hindall the limit of klinger liability policy,hindall damages exceeded the amount paid.
at the time of the accident,hindall was an employee of philips display components,philips display,in ottawa,ohio,a subsidiary of philips electronics north america philips electronics.philips electronics,at that time,was the named insured on two insurance policies.
the first of the policies was issued by travelers.the travelers policy provided primary commercial automobile liability coverage in the amount of million per accident or loss.the policy purported to cover subsidiaries of philips electronics,including philips display.the travelers policy was agreed upon for philips electronics by john esile,philips electronics risk manager.on december,esile filled out and signed a coverage form associated with the travelers policy.the form briefly summarized the nature of insurance,and then provided a series of boxes,which allowed esile either to accept or to reject coverage.esile checked the box rejecting coverage.esile was given the authority to waive coverage by thomas hassett,philips electronics director of risk management.however,while the form provided a brief description of coverage,it did not specify the premiums for coverage.moreover,although the form listed philips electronics as an insured,it did not mention philips display.lastly,there is no evidence in the record that esile and hassett both officers of philips electronics were given written authority by anyone within philips display to reject coverage on philip display behalf.
the second policy considered here is the commercial umbrella policy issued by winterthur to philips electronics.the winterthur policy,as an excess policy,provides an additional layer of insurance for occurrences resulting in losses exceeding the coverage limits of the travelers policy.the winterthur policy was also in effect at the time of hindall accident and had liability limits of million.the only discussion of coverage in the policy is a terse statement that coverage is provided only to the extent it is provided in the travelers policy.there is no evidence of a written offer or rejection of coverage with regard to the winterthur policy.this is consistent with the remarks of john esile,who testified in his deposition that he was not responsible for purchasing or rejecting umbrella or excess insurance,and that he was unaware of anyone specifically rejecting coverage under the winterthur policy.
on july,hindall filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio seeking coverage under the travelers and winterthur policies.all of the parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court issued an opinion denying hindall motion for summary judgment and granting winterthur and travelers motions.the district court concluded that esile written rejection of coverage with regard to the travelers policy was valid and sufficed to show that there was a valid offer of coverage as well.the district court therefore held that coverage did not arise by operation of law under the travelers policy.since the winterthur policy only provided coverage for liabilities covered by the travelers policy,the district court concluded that the winterthur policy also provided no coverage for hindall.hindall filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this diversity case pursuant to,because hindall citizenship is diverse from the insurance companies citizenships.see chubb group of ins,cir holding that federal courts have jurisdiction over actions by an insured against his or her own insurance company if the two are of diverse citizenship because such actions are not direct actions within the meaning of c.we have jurisdiction over the district court final judgment pursuant to.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.siempelkamp gmbh,cir.a district court decision to deny a party motion for summary judgment is usually considered an interlocutory order and thus not appealable,see phelps coy,cir,cert.denied,d,but when the appeal from a denial of summary judgment is presented together with an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we have jurisdiction to review the appropriateness of the district court denial,see thomas united states,cir.we review a district court denial of summary judgment based purely on legal grounds de novo.id.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
c.the travelers policy 
former ohio revised code required insurance companies,when they made an offer of motor vehicle liability insurance,also to offer coverage in an amount equal to the liability limits of the policy if an insurance company did not offer coverage in such an amount,coverage was deemed to arise by operation of law in the full amount of the policy limits.gyori johnston bottling group,ohio,ohio.ohio courts stressed that t he purpose of the requirement is to protect persons injured in automobile accidents from losses which,because of the lack of liability coverage,would otherwise go uncompensated,and therefore held that the statute should be construed liberally in order to effectuate this legislative purpose.id.at quotations omitted.as a result,rejection of um coverage had to be made expressly and knowingly,and it was the insurance companies that bore the burden of this showing.id.quotation omitted.
in order to minimize the problems of proof in these cases,the ohio supreme court in gyori interpreted the statute as it was written before it was amended in by to require both a written offer of coverage and a written rejection of that offer.id.at.in a later decision again interpreting the statute,the ohio supreme court expanded upon those requirements.see linko indem.ins.of,ohio.in linko,the court explained that the written offer of coverage had to include a brief description of the coverage,the premium for that coverage,and an express statement of the coverage limits.id.at.the linko court also made it clear that a parent corporation could only reject insurance on behalf of its separately incorporated subsidiary corporations if certain safeguards were met.the linko court required that s eparately incorporated named insureds must each be listed in a rejection form and that o nly with a subsidiary written authorization may a parent corporation reject coverage on the subsidiary behalf.id.at.the linko court also made clear that ex
