background 
khoury,a cardiologist employed by group health plan,group health was injured at work and suffered a partial disability.group health submitted a claim to reliastar,its disability insurer.reliastar approved the claim and agreed to pay khoury benefits.
under the disability insurance policy,reliastar agreed to pay residual disability benefits to a covered person who is able to perform at least one of the essential duties of his regular occupation on a or basis but is unable to perform all of the essential duties of his regular occupation on a basis,and is unable to earn more than of his basic monthly earnings.the policy set forth a formula for determining the amount of residual benefits to be provided,using the employee basic monthly earnings as a starting point.the policy defined the term basic monthly earnings as an employee monthly salary or wage on the day before the date he became disabled including commissions,bonuses,and contributions to a plan or section plan.an employee basic monthly earnings do not include overtime pay.under the terms of the insurance policy,reliastar has final discretionary authority to determine all questions of eligibility and status and to interpret and construe the terms of the policy of insurance.
khoury compensation agreement was set forth in his employment contract with group health.under the terms of the contract,khoury received base department compensation in an amount of per year.in order to receive this amount of base compensation,khoury was required to participate fully in the equal call schedule.doctors participating in the equal call schedule were expected to be one weekend every six weeks and two weekdays per month.doctors who were additional days,beyond those set forth in the equal call schedule,would be paid per day.the amount of money khoury actually earned from being on days beyond those required under the equal call schedule varied from year to year.in,khoury additional pay was.in,khoury earned an additional.
after reliastar approved khoury request for benefits,khoury questioned how reliastar determined the amount of benefits to be paid.khoury asserted he was required to work additional days,and as a result,reliastar should use his total annual income of as a starting point to calculate his basic monthly earnings.to support khoury position,group health sent reliastar a facsimile,consisting of one cover page one page of copied emails from group health manager of physician services and the manager responsible for the physician pay program first email or missing email and five pages of khoury employment contract.
reliastar responded by explaining khoury basic monthly earnings did not include the additional amounts he earned for being,but instead,khoury basic monthly earnings would be determined by using his base department compensation,which was per year.reliastar also informed khoury that he had the right to appeal its decision.
khoury appealed reliastar decision,claiming his base salary was,and attaching an email from group health in support of his position second email.a regions hospital vice president stated in the second email that khoury base pay plus call,both of which were required by the cardiology department,should be used in calculating his disability benefits.
reliastar appeals committee considered the appeal and requested khoury entire employment contract.after the appeals committee obtained and reviewed khoury entire employment contract,it denied the appeal,stating 
although khoury may have been required to perform additional c all shifts due to staffing issues,he received extra pay for the additional all shifts worked over and above his base pay.extra pay received for extra time worked is generally considered overtime and is certainly considered overtime by the insurance industry.it does matter whether this additional all time was required by khoury employer as the fact remains that he received extra pay over and above his base salary for the extra hours worked which is consistent with the industry definition of overtime.
based on a thorough review of khoury entire claim file,and taking into consideration the policy language,the committee uph e ld the claim department determination that khoury basic monthly earnings should be calculated using khoury annual base pay.the committee notified khoury of his right to file a suit under erisa.
khoury filed suit in minnesota state court,alleging,as relevant here,reliastar denied khoury disability benefits in breach of a fiduciary duty.reliastar removed the action to the united states district court for the district of minnesota,and moved for summary judgment.khoury opposed the motion for summary judgment,arguing reliastar had a conflict of interest,and the reliastar employee who made the initial determination to use the figure,instead of,to calculate khoury benefits,engaged in malfeasance by excluding the first email in support of khoury position from the administrative record.
the district court first considered whether relia s tar reasonably concluded that money earned for time should be omitted from khoury basic monthly earnings.the district court found reliastar interpretation of the language in the insurance policy and the employment contract was reasonable.the district court then considered khoury claims,and found,although khoury cited cases discussing the issue in erisa cases,khoury failed to explain how any conflict applies in this case.the district court recognized the matter of the missing email,and noted there was no evidence in the record indicating that the disappearance of this was anything other than a clerical error.the district court found khoury argument was largely irrelevant because relia s tar initial claim decision is not at issue here.rather,the decision before this court is relia s tar denial of khoury appeal,relia s tar final decision.the district court then held,even if khoury were correct that the went missing for nefarious reasons,the court analysis would not change,and granted reliastar motion for summary judgment 
khoury appeals the district court judgment,claiming the district court made inferences and found disputed facts against khoury,the party did not give sufficient weight to reliastar conflict of interest and erred in finding reliastar interpretation of the insurance contract was reasonable.
