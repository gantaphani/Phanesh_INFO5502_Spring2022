factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all persons who purchased california farm bureau members plan n health insurance policies from defendants between august,and approximately november.the predicate of the claim is that the plaintiff and members of the class were not told of impending material premium increases and benefit reductions under the policies before the policies went into effect.plaintiffs alleged,defendants withheld information from them concerning the impending imposition of substantial new deductibles requirements for new material increases in the amounts of existing material reductions in amounts paid for outpatient services and in amounts paid to physicians and other providers who are not included in defendants list or lists of ppo providers material reductions in prescription drug benefits and material increases in the premiums charged for the policies.
plaintiffs stated that they purchased their policies after receiving the defendants descriptions of the premiums,the lack of deductibles,and other policy benefits.on november,less than two months after their policies went into effect,plaintiffs were mailed notice of all the material changes to their policies.when they purchased their policies,plaintiff gave up coverage they had through another insurance company.at the time they bought their policies,plaintiffs are informed and believe,and thereon allege,defendants knew of the impending changes to the policies,changes that defendants did not communicate to policy holders until november.despite such knowledge,defendants did not disclose the changes to plaintiffs prior to the purchase by plaintiffs of their policies.italics added.
plaintiffs incorporated the above allegations within their first cause of action for unfair competition.plaintiffs alleged that they were not informed of the impending policy changes when they bought their policies,and instead were sent notices of the changes on or about november.plaintiffs alleged that defendants knew about the changes when they sold the policies to the plaintiffs.they also alleged that defendants failure to disclose these changes violated insurance code sections,and,and is an unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business act and practice in violation of business and professions code et.
in the second cause of action for fraud,plaintiffs incorporated all of the above allegations and further alleged that defendants intentionally withheld information regarding the policy changes from the plaintiff class with the intent to induce them to buy the policies.they also stated that each class member,a cting in ignorance of the impending changes,bought a policy from defendants,and had the class members known of the changes,they would not have done so.plaintiffs further alleged they incurred damages because of defendants behavior.
plaintiffs incorporated all of the prior allegations within the third cause of action for negligent failure to disclose.they alleged that defendants negligently withheld information known to them about the policy changes with the intent to induce plaintiffs to purchase the policies.plaintiffs further alleged that,not knowing about the changes,each class member bought a policy from the defendants.had they known of the changes they would not have done so.class members incurred damages as a result of defendants negligence.
defendants filed a demurrer to the complaint together with a motion to strike portions of the complaint and a request for judicial notice of plaintiffs insurance application and the policy.
defendants demurred on the grounds that the complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action for unfair competition,fraud,or negligence.they contended that since they complied with insurance code section,the statutory requirement of giving days notice of benefit changes and premium increases,the plaintiffs unfair competition claim is without any legal basis.according to defendants,plaintiffs fraud and negligence claims are invalid since plaintiffs failed to allege any duty to disclose benefit changes and premium increases before the statutory deadline for giving notice.defendants also pointed out that plaintiffs failed to allege a fiduciary relationship,a general requirement of a fraudulent concealment claim.
plaintiffs opposed the demurrer.they argued that insurance code section only applies to covered persons,employer units,or certificate holders,and not to prospective buyers of insurance.they explained that their claims are based upon the defendants acts performed before the plaintiffs bought the insurance,or before they became covered persons or certificate holders.plaintiffs further asserted that they properly alleged a violation of insurance code section.plaintiffs contended that the complaint states a fraud claim,since defendants knew about material facts which were not accessible to plaintiffs.finally,plaintiffs argued the negligent misrepresentation claim is valid because it is premised on the defendants statutory duty to disclose.
defendants filed a reply to the opposition to the demurrer.according to defendants,they did not violate insurance code section because they had no duty to tell insurance applicants about contemplated benefit changes.
defendants maintained that the notice provision is not unlawful,unfair,or deceptive under section of the business and professions code.they argued that the fraud claim is invalid because it is based on a nonexistent duty of disclosure.the plaintiffs can not validly assert that defendants have a duty of disclosure greater than that which plaintiffs agreed when they applied for coverage.defendants emphasized the dearth of cases supporting plaintiffs position.finally,defendants asserted there was no valid negligent misrepresentation claim because there is no duty to disclose.
the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.it also denied defendants motion to strike as moot and denied defendants request for judicial notice without prejudice for lack of foundation plaintiffs failed to amend their complaint and the trial court entered an order of dismissal.
this appeal followed.plaintiffs contend that,under insurance code sections,and,when there are impending material changes in a policy by raising premiums,diminishing benefits,and instituting deductibles where none existed before,an insurance company has a duty to disclose such impending changes to purchasers of insurance.plaintiffs further contend that failure to inform a purchaser of insurance of such impending changes constitutes unfair competition,fraudulent concealment,and negligent failure to disclose.
