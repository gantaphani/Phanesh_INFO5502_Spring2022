did homeowners benorad and brig prasad homeowners and property management company century real estate century collectively defendants owe a duty of care to allen soucy a guest of tenants,who drowned in the swimming pool of a house owned by homeowners and rented to tenants the trial court held no in a wrongful death negligence lawsuit brought by the child mother,plaintiff melina johnson.the trial court also found no triable issues of fact with respect to breach of any duty and causation.
we reverse the judgment as to the homeowners.we hold as a matter of law that the homeowners here,who knowingly rented a home with a maintained pool,owed a duty of reasonable care to the boy to protect him from drowning in the pool.we further hold there are triable issues of fact as to whether,one,the homeowners breached that duty by failing to install a fence around the perimeter of the pool or a or mechanism on the only door leading from the house to the pool and,two,whether any such breach was a substantial factor in bringing about the child death.
we affirm the judgment as to century.plaintiff only allegation in her complaint against the property management company was that it negligently failed to ensure that the premises met safety code prior to renting the premises to the public.and on appeal,plaintiff admits that defendants were exempt from complying with the only safety code anyone has identified because of the time the pool was built.
factual and procedural background 
the homeowners bought a house with an backyard swimming pool in.the pool was built in or and complied with state and local ordinances at that time.the homeowners did not alter the pool.around the perimeter of the property was a wooden fence that prevented access to the backyard.the only direct access from the house to the pool was through the kitchen.that access was through a sliding glass door with a security gate over it.the security gate did not have a mechanism.since,the house was managed for the homeowners by century.
in june,tomica johnson and her son brandon johnson both of whom are unrelated to plaintiff rented the property.
on june,allen grandmother michelle volpi,who was named as a defendant in the trial court and the grandmother husband took allen to a at the house.when they got there,allen father andre soucy,who was volpi son,and who was also named as a defendant in the trial court was already there,as were a number of other people,including children.they all went in the pool.eventually,everyone got out.the grandmother went inside the house and did not close the security gate or the sliding glass door behind her because others were still coming in.allen also went inside the house.at some point,the grandmother lost track of allen.as it turns out,allen had gone outside the house to the backyard.when he was discovered,he was at the bottom of the pool.allen was kept alive on a ventilator for days and then died.
allen mother filed a lawsuit for wrongful death,alleging the grandmother and father were negligent in supervising allen,the homeowners were negligent in failing to properly fence the pool or otherwise protect a child from accidently falling into the pool,and century was negligent in fail ing to ensure that the premises met safety code prior to renting the premises to the public.
the homeowners and century answered and later moved for summary judgment.as to century,defendants argued that the allegations that the swimming pool does not conform to the applicable swimming pool safety code provisions fail as a matter of law.the evidence is that the property and the swimming pool fully complied with the applicable statutes and ordinances.moreover,they argue they did not owe a duty to allen and his mother to exercise due care,they did not breach any duty because there was no dangerous condition on the property,and even if there was,they had no notice of a dangerous condition,and they did not cause the injury.
the trial court granted the summary judgment motion.the court reasoned that homeowners and century had no duty to inspect the premises there was no reason to expect children to be playing in the pool,the pool was not a nuisance or an unreasonably dangerous condition of property nothing these defendants did or failed to do created any type of dangerous condition or in any way contributed to this accident there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the conduct of the homeowners and century was a cause in fact of the drowning and e ven the security gate and sliding glass door could not have been involved in this accident,since they were left open on purpose.
the trial court then entered judgment in favor of homeowners and century.plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in defendants favor because defendants owed a duty of care to maintain the pool in a reasonably safe condition and because there were triable issues of fact as to whether defendants breached that duty and were a cause of injury here 
the elements of a cause of action for negligence are duty,breach,causation,and damages.melton boustred th.we consider the first three elements in turn,in view of plaintiff contentions above and the trial court finding that,as a matter of law,defendants owed no duty of care to allen,there was no breach of any duty toward him,and none of defendants actions caused injury to plaintiff.
in doing so,we keep in mind the following standard of review on appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.under california traditional rules,we determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff case,or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial,such that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.guz bechtel national,cal th.

here,the question we must answer as a matter of law is whether the homeowners owed allen a duty of reasonable care to protect him from drowning in a swimming pool at a house they rented to tenants.in determining a duty existence and scope,our precedents call for consideration of several factors t he foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,the policy of preventing future harm,the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach,and the availability,cost,and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.castaneda olsher cal th,quoting rowland,supra,cal d at.foreseeability and the extent of the burden to the defendant are ordinarily the crucial considerations,but in a given case one or more of the other rowland factors may be determinative of the duty analysis.castaneda,at.
