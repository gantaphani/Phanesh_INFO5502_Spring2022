in this insurance coverage action,plaintiff scottsdale indemnity company scottsdale and defendant national continental insurance company nci seek this court determination whether they are coprimary insurers or whether nci is an excess insurer for an underlying fatality involving a rig operated by manuel lainez.the trial court granted nci motion for a summary judgment,concluding that scottsdale was the primary insurer pursuant to california insurance code section,subdivisions d and h we agree that scottsdale is the primary insurer and nci is the excess insurer and affirm the judgment.
by january of manuel lainez had been independently driving commercial vehicles for eight and years.he owned his own truck,also known as a power unit or tractor,and his own business,lainez trucking.he had his own motor carrier permit and operating authority in the state of california.he purchased a trucker liability policy from scottsdale with a million liability limit.the policy specifically described and rated a freightliner tractor lainez had purchased about three years earlier and expressly covered any attached trailer.
lainz entered into a motor carrier agreement with western transportation services western transport,a corporation that contracts exclusively with and arranges for them to pick up and deliver loads to various customers in california and nevada.it does not own tractors or trailers,but contracts with or drivers.the agreement provided that lainez was an independent contractor and was responsible for all costs and expenses incidental to the performance of transportation services.he agreed to maintain liability insurance and to name western transport as an additional insured.
western transport,through the california automobile assigned risk plan caarp,purchased a commercial assigned risk policy from nci.the policy stated,named insured business trucker for hire excess and named lainez as a driver.it did not list,describe,or rate any vehicle.it was rated on an excess cost of hire basis at a premium that was to percent of the cost of a policy rated on a primary cost of hire basis.
both policies were in effect on january,when lainez,hauling goods for western transport in his freightliner tractor with an attached hyundai foot box trailer,was involved in a fatal collision with constancio acayayan barcenas.barcenas wife and children filed various wrongful death actions.on february,nci tendered the defense of western transport to scottsdale.scottsdale accepted the defense and indemnification,and the representative handling the claim stated,scottsdale coverage would be primary and that western transport policy with nci was excess to the scottsdale policy and would not have to make any payment unless the judgment or settlement exceeded the limits of the scottsdale policy.scottsdale exclusively handled the defense of both lainez and western transport and did not tender the defense of either defendant to nci.

discussion 
to minimize insurance coverage litigation when more than one insurance policy provides coverage,the legislature has created a series of conclusive presumptions.hartford accident indemnity sequoia ins.d.section contains a number of subdivisions designed to cover many common coverage dispute situations each addresses a different set of factual circumstances and identifies which policies will be deemed primary and which policies will be deemed excess.transport indemnity royal ins.d,transport indemnity.the trial court found that scottsdale provided primary coverage and nci provided excess coverage under two subdivisions of section d and h.
under section,a policy that specifically describes a vehicle involved in an accident is primary to a policy that does not describe any vehicle.subdivision d of section subdivision d provides in relevant part w here two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle or vehicles in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise,it shall be conclusively presumed that the insurance afforded by that policy in which the motor vehicle is described or rated as an owned automobile shall be primary and the insurance afforded by any other policy or policies shall be excess.
the trial court found that subdivision d was the more specific subdivision.the court explained i n this situation,subdivision d appears to be the more specific subdivision as it applies where two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle or vehicles in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise,it shall be conclusively presumed that the insurance afforded by that policy in which the motor vehicle is described or rated as an owned automobile shall be primary and the insurance afforded by any other policy shall be excess.emphasis added d.in the instant case,given that there is no dispute that the subject policies covered both the power unit and the trailer,two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle or vehicles id.further,it is undisputed that only scottsdale policy described or rated any vehicle.indeed,the scottsdale policy specifically described and rated the power unit.citation.a vehicle is described or rated when it is particularized in a policy.ohio casualty ins.aetna ins.d,given these undisputed facts,scottsdale policy is primary under insurance code section d and nci is excess.
we agree.the application of subdivision d is quite straightforward and determined by an answer to a simple question.whether section,subdivision d applies to an occurrence depends upon the existence of the simply stated condition.do two or more insurance policies cover the same motor vehicle in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise if the answer is yes,the statute applies.if the answer is no,the statute does not apply.wilshire ins,sentry select ins.th,wilshire.scottsdale and nci agreed that both policies applied to the rig.as a consequence,scottsdale policy is primary because it describes the freightliner rig.
scottsdale insists that section,subdivision h subdivision h was designed to either supersede or trump subdivision d in all cases involving a power unit and a trailer.in other words,scottsdale maintains that subdivision h,rather than subdivision d,is the more specific subdivision applicable to the instant facts.
subdivision h states notwithstanding subdivision b,when two or more policies affording valid and collectible automobile liability insurance apply to a power unit and an attached trailer or trailers in an occurrence out of which a liability loss shall arise,and one policy affords coverage to a named insured in the business of a trucker,defined as any person or organization engaged in the business of transporting property by auto for hire,then the following shall be conclusively presumed if at the time of loss,the power unit is being operated by any person in the business of a trucker,the insurance afforded by the policy to the person engaged in the business of a trucker shall be primary for both power unit and trailer or trailers,and the insurance afforded by the other policy shall be excess.because scottsdale policy describes the vehicle and nci does not,scottsdale is primary and nc
