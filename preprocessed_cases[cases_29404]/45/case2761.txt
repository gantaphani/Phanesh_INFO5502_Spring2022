introduction 
appellant radian guaranty,radian is authorized to transact mortgage guaranty insurance and is statutorily prohibited from transacting any other class of insurance,including title insurance.see,in this action,radian appeals from a denial of its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus code civ,by which it sought to reverse a cease and desist order issued by respondent john garamendi,insurance commissioner of the state of california the commissioner.the commissioner cease and desist order prohibits radian from selling the radian lien protection policy rlp,which provides lenders with protection from a borrower default for a range of losses,including coverage for a loss due to undisclosed liens.the commissioner determined that coverage for losses due to undisclosed property liens constitutes title insurance pursuant to section,and because radian does not possess the requisite certificate of authority to transact title insurance,it is not authorized to sell rlp in california or anywhere else in the united states.
radian urges that we reverse the superior court ruling denying its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus on the grounds that the cease and desist order was based on a misinterpretation of the coverage provided by the rlp and the applicable statutes controlling mortgage guaranty insurers,such as radian.we disagree,and find the cease and desist order was appropriately entered and should be permanently enforced.
statutory overview and procedural history 
the legislature has carved out three classes of insurance to cover land title insurance,mortgage insurance,and mortgage guaranty insurance.title insurance insures losses suffered by reason of a liens or encumbrances on property b invalidity or unenforceability of liens or encumbrances or c incorrectness of searches relating to the title.mortgage insurance insures the payment of authorized real estate securities,and mortgage guaranty insurance insures against financial losses by reason of nonpayment of principal,interest,and other sums agreed to be paid under the terms of any note secured by a mortgage,deed of trust,or other instrument constituting a first lien on real estate,subd.a.each class of insurance serves a different purpose,and together they protect california real estate marketplace.
most insurance companies are.in other words,these companies do not limit their underwritings to one particular line of insurance but instead write several or multiple lines of insurance.for example,a insurance company may write homeowners,automobile,fire,marine,liability,workers compensation,and professional malpractice policies.on the other hand,recognizing the potential volatility of the california real estate marketplace,title insurers,mortgage insurers,and mortgage guaranty insurers are permitted to write only a single line of insurance.as such,the legislature has expressly prohibited title insurers,mortgage insurers,and mortgage guaranty insurers from transacting any other class of insurance other than the one for which they have been authorized by their respective certificates of authority hence,they are known as monoline insurers.see title insurance mortgage insurance mortgage guaranty insurance.
radian is a monoline insurer and holds a certificate of authority issued by the commissioner to transact mortgage guaranty insurance in california mortgage guaranty insurers are governed by a separate chapter of the california insurance code,titled the mortgage guaranty insurance act.see stating that are to be known and cited as the mortgage guaranty insurance act.
radian began to market its new rlp in the fourth calendar quarter of as a faster,less expensive alternative to title insurance.radian the rlp as a mortgage guaranty pool insurance product sold only to sophisticated lenders seeking to purchase strategically limited mortgage guaranty insurance coverage for pools of refinanced home mortgages,second mortgages and home equity loans,usually in anticipation of selling such pools of mortgages to fannie mae,freddie mac or in the secondary market for such loans.to clarify,the rlp is not a substitute for owners title insurance,which owners are typically required to carry by lenders.in the event of a refinancing,home equity loan,or a second lien,an owner title insurance would continue to protect the owner from any risks relating to holding of the title.therefore,although the owner pays the premium for the rlp,the beneficiary of the policy is the lender.
in the event of a borrower default,the rlp provides coverage for losses segmented into the following two broad coverage types a undisclosed lien losses and b losses other than undisclosed lien losses.each of these coverage types is subject to a separate aggregate loss limit.the aggregate loss limit establishes a cap or policy limit for all losses arising from that coverage type for all loans resulting in claims in the insured pool 
radian claims it is the lone innovator of the type of coverage provided by the rlp,which tacitly acknowledges that the rlp is not a typical mortgage guaranty insurance policy.by way of comparison,the standard mortgage guaranty policy insures against loss suffered by a lender following the default of a borrower and foreclosure by the lender.while the rlp has one claims computation provision similar to that found in the standard mortgage guaranty insurance policy,the rlp also contains an additional claims computation provision,which we later describe,that is not in any standard mortgage guaranty insurance policy.this provision provides coverage for losses suffered due to undisclosed liens.furthermore,the standard mortgage guaranty insurance policy requires a lender to tender good and marketable title as a condition precedent to a claim.this requirement was omitted from the rlp because the rlp is designed to insure the lender lien position.
shortly after the rlp was being marketed and sold in california,an investigation was initiated to analyze the essential elements of the policy.on june,the commissioner ordered that radian immediately cease and desist from marketing,soliciting,negotiating,and selling insurance policies that provide coverage to lenders for undisclosed property liens.the commissioner concluded that the nature of the risk covered by the rlp included a title insurance risk,which radian could not lawfully sell.
radian appealed the commissioner cease and desist order to the office of administrative hearings.following extensive administrative proceedings,the administrative law judge affirmed the commissioner cease and desist order.once this determination was made,radian requested that the commissioner review the administrative law judge decision.on july,the commissioner issued his final order to radian to cease and desist selling the rlp 
radian then sought to challenge the cease and desist order by a petition for administrative mandamus.code civ.after the san francisco superior court denied its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus,this appeal followed.
discussiona.standard of review 
guided by the monoline restrictions and the applicable statutory definitions of mortgage guaranty and title insurance,the commissioner issued the challenged cease and desist order after concluding that radian rlp improperly combined title insurance and mortgage guaranty insurance in one policy,in violation of the statutory monoline restrictions.on appeal,radian contends that the commissioner cease and desist order is invalid.radian claims that its rlp is as a matter of law mortgage guaranty pool insurance and radian is licensed to sell mortgage guaranty pool insurance in california.consequently,the overriding issue in this appeal is whether the rlp,as examined in the administrative proceeding,constitutes mortgage guaranty insurance as defined by section,subdivision a,or title insurance as defined by section.
our review of radian appeal from a denial of its petition for a writ of administrative mandamus is de novo,because radian arguments involve only questions of undisputed fact and law.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.a trial court interpretation of a statute is reviewed de novo,and the application of a statutory standard to undisputed facts is reviewed de novo.harustak wilkins th,d.
is rlp mortgage guaranty insurance or title insurance 
we proceed to radian contention that f rom a statutory analysis,there is nothing in the rlp that makes it anything more,less or other than mortgage guaranty insurance.basically,radian is challenging the commissioner conclusion that coverages for losses due to undisclosed property liens constitute title insurance.
in the words of the statute,title insurance means insuring,guaranteeing or indemnifying owners of real or personal property or the holders of liens or encumbrances thereon or others interested therein against loss or damage suffered by reason of a liens or encumbrances on,or defects in the title to said property b invalidity or unenforceability of any liens or encumbrances thereon or c incorrectness of searches relating to the title to real or personal property.
title insurance has unique attributes not shared by other types of insurance.most types of insurance provide protection against loss from potential damage from future events,and usually apply to conduct of the insured within his or her control.the title policy indemnifies for conditions that exist on the date of the policy,does not insure against loss from future events,and does not represent that the event insured against will not occur.miller starr,cal.real estate ed,see also quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d,quelimane elysian investment group stewart title guaranty th,d.
t he function of title insurance is to protect against the possibility that liens and other items not found in the search or disclosed in the preliminary report exist.the records pertaining to real property are complex and encumbrances may be missed by even the most thorough search.title insurance is an acknowledgment that errors may have been made.siegel fidelity nat.title ins.th,d.consequently,t itle insurance is a contract for indemnity under which the insurer is obligated to indemnify the insured against losses sustained in the event that a specific contingency,the discovery of a lien or encumbrance affecting title,occurs.citations.cale transamerica title insurance d.the indemnifiable loss to an owner issued title insurance is the lost equity in the property,while the indemnifiable loss to a lender is measured by the extent to which the insured debt is not repaid because the value of the property is diminished or impaired by outstanding lien encumbrances or title defects covered by the title insurance.therefore,superior liens or title defects in claims may exist which reduce the market value of the security property the value to the owner yet result in no loss or damage to the insured lender because the effect of the title problems does not reduce the value of security property below the amount of an indebtedness secured.accord,karl commonwealth land title ins.th,d.
the rlp policy language providing coverage for undisclosed liens mirrors the foregoing statutory and case law definition of title insurance.the insuring clause in the rlp provides that it insures against loss sustained by reason of the default two distinct types of losses are theoretically contemplated under the rlp.as already noted,loss,as defined by the rlp,includes a traditional mortgage guaranty to the lender for financial loss due to default of the borrower on a mortgage lien secured by real estate.however,undisclosed lien loss is also included within the definition of loss.the rlp defines loss arising from an undisclosed lien as meaning any lien or similar encumbrance which i takes priority over the position of a mortgage agreement and ii was not disclosed on the ownership and legal description verification report with tax status report,the mortgage lien report,the borrower application or the borrower affidavit obtained by the insured prior to the consummation of such mortgage agreement and iii was not otherwise known to the insured prior to the consummation of such mortgage agreement.
in the administrative proceedings below,the department of insurance department presented documentary evidence and expert testimony to prove that the foregoing provisions defining the scope of coverage for an undisclosed lien loss are similar to provisions found in typical title insurance policies.the department also presented expert opinion that the rlp essentially functions as title insurance.thus,if a lender makes a claim against the rlp for an undisclosed lien that takes priority over the lender note,radian will insure the lender lien position by paying the loss incurred as a result of being in a different lien position from the one the lender thought it was in.thus,according to title insurance experts,by establishing a separate claims computation for undisclosed lien loss,radian has taken a standard mortgage guaranty pool policy,added an extensive layer of coverage for undisclosed liens,and created a policy that effectively insures a title risk.
the commissioner also presented expert testimony to prove that conventional mortgage guaranty insurance has never provided coverage for undisclosed liens.numerous experts provided similar testimony confirming that the loss covered by mortgage guaranty insurance is a credit risk that the borrower will default.in such case,the insurance covers the loss arising from the default.it does not cover loss from any other risk such as lien priority,other title insurance risks,or casualty risks.this testimony was supported by a review of the primary master policies from mortgage guaranty insurers operating in the united states.in those policies,the claims computation section lists unpaid principal lost interest advances necessary to preserve the property during foreclosure and expenses associated with foreclosure as the elements of loss.there are no provisions for reimbursement to the lender for expenses associated with clearing title to the property.rather,the policies all require that the lender tender good and merchantable title back to the mortgage guaranty insurer as a condition precedent to a claim.
consequently,it was overwhelmingly demonstrated in the underlying proceedings that the risks insured by mortgage guaranty insurance and title insurance are absolutely distinct and do not overlap.the risk insured by mortgage guaranty insurance is the risk of loss associated with default on the mortgage loan by the borrower.in contrast,the risk insured by title insurance includes the risk that losses will result from differences between the actual title and the record title as of the date title is insured.quelimane,supra,cal th at,d.as we have seen,the risk insured under the undisclosed lien component of the rlp is the risk of loss arising from the existence of an undisclosed lien senior to the insured mortgage.the statutes and case law clearly and unambiguously confirm that indemnifying against risk of loss caused by the existence of an unknown prior lien on a property senior to the insured deed of trust constitutes title insurance.
on this issue,however,radian gives short shrift to the policy language providing coverage for undisclosed liens,the statutory definition of title insurance,and other practical aspects of the mortgage guaranty business and title business as testified to by the expert witnesses.instead,radian asks that we myopically focus on the statutory definition of mortgage guaranty insurance and the insuring clause of the rlp.radian points out that section,subdivision a defines mortgage guaranty insurance in relevant part as i nsurance against financial loss by reason of nonpayment of principal,interest,and other sums agreed to be paid under the terms of any note or bond or other evidence of indebtedness secured by a mortgage,deed of trust,or other instrument constituting a first lien or charge on real estate italics added.radian argues that the coverage provided by the rlp mirrors the statutory definition of mortgage guaranty insurance in that radian agrees to pay to the insured the lender loss sustained by reason of the default in payments by a borrower on any mortga
