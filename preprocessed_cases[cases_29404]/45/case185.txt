this case requires us to decide whether a provision of a yacht insurance policy excluding coverage for any loss,damage or liability willfully,intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person is ambiguous as applied to an insured who was convicted of criminally negligent homicide after his involvement in a fatal boat collision,and,if not ambiguous,whether its enforcement would render coverage under the policy illusory.answering both questions in the negative,we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment to acadia insurance company acadia and denying summary judgment to daniel littlefield in littlefield action seeking a declaratory judgment of coverage under the yacht insurance policy.
on august,daniel littlefield was operating a motorized pleasure boat insured under an acadia yacht policy on lake winnipesaukee in new hampshire when it collided with another boat,killing one of that boat passengers,john hartman.in january littlefield was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of criminally negligent homicide under sections i and ii of the new hampshire criminal code also in january,the victim widow and executrix of his estate,karen hartman hartman,brought a wrongful death action against littlefield in new hampshire state court alleging negligence.on april,littlefield,in turn,sought a declaratory judgment in new hampshire state court that acadia was obligated under the terms of the yacht policy to provide him with insurance coverage,including a defense in hartman wrongful death suit 
acadia asserted that it had no such obligation under two separate provisions of the yacht policy,the first contained in section b of the policy,which governs protection and indemnity insurance,and the second contained in section g,which sets forth general conditions applicable to the entire policy.the provision in section b excludes from coverage any loss,damage or liability willfully,intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.the provision in section g excludes coverage for any loss,damage or expense arising out of or during any illegal activity on your part or on the part of anyone using the insured property with your permission.on may,acadia removed the case to federal district court,citing both diversity and possible admiralty jurisdiction.
on june,a belknap county superior court jury found littlefield not guilty on the indictment first count of negligently causing the death of another in the consequence of being under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating a boat on lake winnepesaukee,a class a felony,but guilty of the second count of negligently caus ing the death of another while operating a boat and fail ing to keep a proper lookout,a class b felony.citing principles of issue preclusion,acadia moved for summary judgment in this case on the ground that littlefield criminal conviction rendered his potential liability in hartman wrongful death action criminally caused or incurred,as well as arising out of or during illegal activity within the meaning of the policy exclusions.littlefield brought a for summary judgment,arguing that the language of the policy exclusion in section b of the policy is ambiguous and should be construed to provide coverage despite his criminal conviction.littlefield asserted that a reasonable insured would interpret willfully,intentionally or criminally caused or incurred liability or losses to refer only to those caused or incurred through the commission of willful or intentional crimes.under littlefield interpretation,liability incurred through the commission of unintentional crimes,including criminally negligent homicide,would not be excluded from coverage littlefield also argued that enforcement of either the exclusion provision in section b or section g of the policy would leave so few claims actually covered as to render coverage under the policy illusory in contravention of public policy favoring compensation of innocent victims unintentionally harmed by an insured.
on may,the federal district court granted acadia motion for summary judgment and denied littlefield for summary judgment,finding that coverage was excluded under the provision in section b regarding any loss,damage or liability willfully,intentionally or criminally caused or incurred by an insured person.the court stated 
it is well understood that negligence can be criminal when it results in death.the policy does not limit the exclusion to intentional crimes and the mere fact that the phrase is grouped with exclusions for willfully and intentionally caused acts would not cause a reasonably informed insured to read a limitation into the exclusion that it does not contain.
littlefield acadia ins,wl,dist.lexis,at may.the court also rejected littlefield argument that the exclusion provision is unenforceable as contrary to public policy.the court did not reach the applicability or enforceability of the exclusion provision in section littlefield and hartman appealed,and their cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal

choice of law 
we first identify the applicable law.the acadia yacht policy contains a provision this policy shall be governed by and construed under the general maritime law of the united states of america regardless of the venue or jurisdiction of the court or arbitration.the parties do not dispute the applicability of the provision,and federal maritime law is clearly applicable to the yacht policy at issue,acadia ins.mcneil,cir.even under federal maritime law,however,a maritime contract interpretation may so implicate local interests as to beckon interpretation by state law.norfolk ry.kirby,d.
to determine whether application of state law is appropriate under federal maritime law,we must first inquire whether any federal statute governs the interpretation of the policy provision at issue in this case,and we find none.see wilburn boat fireman fund ins.since congress has not taken over regulation of marine insurance contracts there is no possible question here of conflict between a state law and any federal statute.next,we ask whether there is a specific,federal,rule governing the interpretation of this policy,and we also find none.see,commercial union ins.flagship marine,cir finding no specific federal rule governing construction of maritime insurance contracts.instead,we note that general principles of contract law are used to interpret marine insurance policies.see see,ingersoll milling mach.bodena,cir noting that the principle that an ambiguous insurance contract will generally be construed against the insurer who drafted it in order to promote coverage for losses to which the policy relates applies to all types of insurance policies,including maritime policies.citations omitted kalmbach,ins.of the state of,cir w e can see no significant difference between construction of an ordinary insurance policy and one with marine insurance overtones.in general,each is to be construed against the insurance company.having discerned that there is no federal statute or federal rule governing the interpretation of the policy in this case,we lastly must inquire whether we should fashion such a rule,and conclude we should not.see wilburn boat,at.deciding,as congress has,to leave the regulation of marine insurance with the states mcneil,at favoring application of state law over the fashioning of new federal law where no conflict between state law and any applicable federal statute is presented internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,having found no federal statute or rule governing the interpretation of maritime insurance policies,and concluding that we should not fashion any such rule,we look to the state law of new hampshire,as do the parties in this case,to govern our interpretation 
new hampshire rules of construction 
in the absence of any new hampshire court decision addressing the precise policy exclusion at issue,we resolve the question before us in light of new hampshire state law governing the interpretation of insurance policies in general.see coakley me.bonding and cas.under that body of law,the fundamental inquiry in interpreting an insurance policy,as with other written contracts,centers on determining the intent of the parties at the time of the agreement.trombly blue shield of.to this end,a court examining the language of an insurance policy must take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy words in context and construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.brouillard prudential prop.cas.ins,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because insurance policies must be interpreted to protect the reasonable expectations of the policyholder,see cameron sod farms,cont l ins,a court must inquire whether the ordinary layman in the position of the insured could reasonably be expected to understand that certain exclusions qualif y the policy grant of coverage.ins.schofield,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
if,under this standard,an insurance policy provision is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,and an interpretation provides coverage,the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.fed.bake shop farmington cas,see also contoocook valley sch.dist.graphic arts mut.ins,we will deem a policy term ambiguous as to coverage when the parties may reasonably differ about their interpretation and will construe the ambiguity in favor of the insured.interpretation of an ambiguity to favor the insured as against the insurer is particularly applicable when ambiguities are found in an exclusionary clause.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.at the same time,while ambiguous terms may be construed to favor an insured,we may not find a term ambiguous merely because it eliminates coverage.see funai metro.prop.cas,while we construe insurance policies in favor of the insured when the policy is ambiguous,we will not force an ambiguity simply to resolve it against an insurance company.
application to the yacht policy 
the acadia yacht policy itself contains no definition of the word criminally.dictionary definitions,while not controlling,are of some value to the extent they inform us of the common understanding of terms.hudson farm family mut.ins,see coakley,at turning to dictionary t o determine the plain and ordinary meaning of a word as understood by a layperson of average intelligence.the american heritage dictionary of the english language ed defines the adjective criminal as,simply,o f,involving,or having the nature of crime.crime,in turn,is defined as a n act committed or omitted in violation of a law forbidding or commanding it and for which punishment is imposed upon conviction.id.whether or not a particular offense is a crime in common parlance thus depends on the existence of some legal duty or prohibition,not the mental state of the actor 
the exclusion provision thus unambiguously excludes coverage for liability incurred by an insured person,such as littlefield,through the commission of a crime for which he has been,a regard to the requisite mental state of the crime a reasonable layperson in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole,brouillard,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,would understand that proposition.because we can conceive of no other reasonable interpretation of the provision at issue,we find no ambiguity in the policy provision that warrants its being construed against the insurer.fed.bake shop,at.
nevertheless,in an effort to find ambiguity in the policy exclusion for willfully,intentionally or criminally caused or incurred loss or liability,littlefield first invokes the doctrine of ejusdem generis,which provides that where general words follow an enumeration of persons or things,by words of a particular and specific meaning,such general words are not to be construed in their widest extent,but are to be held as applying only to persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned.state beckert,quoting black law dictionary ed.in littlefield view,the first two words in the list in the section b exclusion provision,willfully and intentionally,are words of a particular and specific meaning because they require a higher level of intent than negligence.by contrast,the word criminally,which encompasses a broad spectrum of culpable states of mind,is a general word that should not be construed in its widest extent,but should be held as applying only to crimes of the same kind or class as the acts encompassed by the preceding two words.that is to say,criminally should be read as limited by the same high threshold of intent as the words willfully and intentionally.
we do not agree.criminally,when read after the words willfully and intentionally,is neither more general nor more specific than the two preceding words it is merely different.each of the three terms is general in the sense that each encompasses a broad range of specific acts.there is some overlap in the conduct excluded by these general terms.however,criminally encompasses both unintentional and intentional crimes,while willfully and intentionally encompass both and criminal acts.only criminally includes un intentional acts committed with a criminally culpable state of mind.criminal negligence is such an act under the new hampshire criminal code.ann.d.to read the word criminally to incorporate the limitations littlefield seeks would render the word extraneous.loss or liability caused through intentional crimes is already excluded as intentionally caused loss or liability.we decline to ignore the plain meaning of criminally in favor of a reading that would render the word superfluous.see restatement second of contracts a an interpretation which gives a reasonable,lawful,and effective meaning to all the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part unreasonable,unlawful,or of no effect lee russ,couch on insurance ed.since it must be assumed that each word contained in an insurance policy is intended to serve a purpose,every term will be given effect if that can be done by any reasonable construction.more importantly,where a policy provision is unambiguous and the contracting parties intent is thus clearly manifested in the plain language of that provision,resort to canons of interpretation is simply unwarranted.see eric mills holmes mark rhodes,holmes appleman on insurance ed courts may not resort to aids of construction where contract language is unambiguous.the intent of the parties and meaning of the contract are to be determined by the language alone.
as a effort,littlefield urges us to adopt the reasoning and result of young brown,so d,in which a louisiana appellate court interpreting a homeowner liability insurance policy held that criminally caused injury must be at least intentional or willful in order to be excluded from coverage.in that case,the insurance policy purported to exclude coverage for injury which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person.id.at.the young court stated that,
n estled between exclusions for injuries resulting from intentional acts and for intentionally inflicted injuries,a reasonable purchaser could have understood the basis of the exclusion to be intentional misconduct or intentional criminal acts,ther
