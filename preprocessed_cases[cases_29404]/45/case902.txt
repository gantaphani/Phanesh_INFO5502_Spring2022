for this b interlocutory appeal from a,where removal was premised on claimed fraudulent joinder,at issue is whether there is any reasonable basis for predicting the defendant could be liable under louisiana law and,therefore,not fraudulently joined.our court now refers to fraudulent joinder as improper joinder.see smallwood illinois central railroad,cir en banc.affirmed and remanded.
plaintiffs,all louisiana residents,individually and on behalf of a putative class of homeowner and automobile policyholders,filed this action in louisiana state court,primarily claiming defendants state farm and allstate violated louisiana law and the louisiana constitution in setting insurance rates using formulas that had a discriminatory impact based on race the economic condition of the area in which the property to be insured is located and resident defendant louisiana insurance rating commission lirc failed in its duty to regulate insurance rates by allowing state farm and allstate to use those formulas.allstate and state farm removed this action to federal court under,claiming complete diversity pursuant to because the sole defendant,lirc,is improperly joined.plaintiffs moved for remand to state court,claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction.following a hearing,the district court denied the motion,ruling plaintiffs did not establish the requisite possibility of liability for lirc.
for this b appeal,we review de novo the,erectors,infax,cir.the removing party has the burden of establishing improper joinder by showing plaintiffs inability to establish a claim under state law against the defendant or actual fraud in pleading jurisdictional facts.smallwood,at citing travis irby,cir.defendants do not claim the latter.therefore,at issue is whether defendants have established there is no reasonable basis plaintiffs might be able to recover under louisiana state law against the defendant,lirc.see id.contrary to the dissent,in making this determination for the claim against lirc,we do not consider the eleventh amendment or questions of jurisdiction that do not bear on whether a claim can be established under state law against lirc.obviously,to do otherwise would fly in the face of the purpose,and controlling law,for not allowing improper joinder to defeat federal jurisdiction.see b removal permitted if none of the parties in interest properly joined is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought emphasis added.as discussed below,only allstate and state farm were properly joined.
for this issue,two points bear on plaintiffs possible recovery whether,as required,they exhausted their administrative remedies provided by the louisiana insurance code and whether lirc is entitled to state law immunity for discretionary acts for the rate setting functions at issue here.for the latter point,plaintiffs assert that,even if lirc is entitled to immunity on damages,the immunity statute does not apply to claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.a review of the pleadings,however,reveals plaintiffs did not request injunctive or declaratory relief against lirc.in any event,for the reasons that follow,we need not decide whether lirc is entitled to immunity.the issue was properly raised obviously,contrary to the dissent,it was not necessary to assert it in state court and is the most definite basis for determining improper joinder.
for reasons stated on the record,the district court relied on discretionary immunity in denying plaintiffs remand motion.melder allstate,december.oral argument on the remand motion also included,inter alia,failure to exhaust administrative remedies.allstate also raised it in its rule b motion to dismiss.neither the district court certification for interlocutory appeal nor our court order granting it specify a controlling question.the failure to do so does not restrict the scope of our review,however,of the order.for an appeal under b,we may address any issue fairly included within the certified order because it is the order that is appealable,and not the controlling question identified by the district court.yamaha motor,calhoun,d internal quotation omitted first emphasis added second emphasis in original.therefore,because exhaustion of administrative remedies was raised in district court and state farm and allstate presented the point in their briefs here,we may consider it.
the louisiana constitution vests the louisiana commissioner of insurance with authority to regulate the business of insurance.const.art.iv.authority over insurance rates,regulations,and all other insurance matters is vested in the department of insurance under the commissioner.see.stat.et.the commissioner is charged with protection of the public interest in the realm of insurance.doerr mobil oil,so d,citing.const.art.iv.stat.
the louisiana administrative code provides a detailed administrative process through which parties may seek relief for violations of louisiana insurance statutes and regulations.see.admin.code tit,et.the practice and procedure rules,for example,provide for a hearing before the commissioner,following a written petition or complaint,at the hearing,parties may be represented by counsel,present evidence,and examine witnesses,the commissioner has the power to issue subpoenas to obtain witnesses or documentary evidence necessary for the hearing,within days following the hearing,the commissioner is to enter a written decision and order,and that decision is appealable to a designated state district court.the commissioner is also authorized,without petition or application by any insured,to investigate and punish unfair practices in the business of insurance,including unfair discrimination in setting rates.b.
the louisiana legislature established lirc,which is under the control and direction of the commissioner,who serves as its ex officio chairperson.lirc was created to promote the public welfare by regulating insurance rates to the end that they shall not be excessive,inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.emphasis added.insurance rates are discriminatory,of course,through risk factors such as age and gender.for example,it is common knowledge that,in general,automobile insurance rates for teenaged boys are higher than for women.accordingly,the statute mandates rates not being unfairly discriminatory.rates include the premium to be charged,including any related fees,or the elements and factors forming the basis for the determination of the premium.
insurers are required to file insurance rates with lirc it reviews them to determine whether they are reasonable and not unfairly discriminatory.id.insurers are prohibited from charging a rate other than one approved by the lirc.a.an insured may challenge a rate applicable to his home or automobile by filing a written complaint with the lirc,requesting a hearing.d.further,consistent with the earlier description of the commissioner authority,the commissioner may investigate rates at any time his authority is not circumscribed and limited to functions which do not affect rates.rates are the function and concern of both the lirc and the commissioner.union ins.bernard,so d.
plaintiffs allege they were charged automobile and homeowners insurance rates based on a formula that has a discriminatory impact.they assert that,because the formula includes credit scoring information,it has a discriminatory impact on the basis of race the economic condition of the area in which the property to be insured is located.because these allegations involve,they are within the area lirc was created to regulate.the record does not reflect that plaintiffs have filed a complaint with either the commissioner or the lirc.citing the louisiana insurance code,louisiana administrative procedures act,and case law,state farm and allstate contend louisiana provides an adequate administrative remedy and,because plaintiffs claims relate to,they can not seek judicial relief until after they have exhausted their administrative remedies.plaintiffs do not respond to the exhaustion issue,except to claim erroneously it is not properly before us.
steeg lawyers title insurance corporation,so d,provides that disputes as to matters within the administrative regulation and expertise should ordinarily first be addressed for determination to the administrative tribunals legislatively intended to decide them rather than to the courts.steeg concerned a challenge to rates charged by a title insurance company.because the administrative remedies were not shown to be inadequate,and plaintiffs failed to exhaust them,their complaint was dismissed.id.the steeg court was unwilling to hold that a judicial claim is necessarily available when an administrative action or rate is alleged to be invalid or illegal and an adequate administrative remedy is available.id.here,as in steeg,plaintiffs have an adequate administrative remedy for addressing grievances.as discussed,the louisiana administrative code provides a detailed procedure for petitioning the commissioner for review of alleged violations of regulations and for judicial review of the commissioner decision.lirc,under the direction of the commissioner,is charged with responsibility for preventing,and is uniquely qualified to regulate,unfair trade practices in rate making,including unfair discrimination in setting rates.see also,union,so d at.
given this administrative remedy,plaintiffs must exhaust it before seeking judicial review.steeg,so d at.admin.code tit.requiring plaintiffs to do so does not permanently deprive them of judicial review of lirc or the commissioner decisions.rather,it allows the administrative agency statutorily authorized,and best equipped,to address plaintiffs claims to do so before a court exercises jurisdiction.
because they have not exhausted the adequate administrative remedies provided by louisiana law,there is no reasonable basis plaintiffs might be able to recover in this action against the sole defendant,lirc.therefore,lirc is improperly joined and,accordingly,the remand motion was properly denied.
for the foregoing reasons,the is affirmed and this matter is remanded to district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
affirmed and remanded.
the primary question before this court is whether,looking at plaintiffs petition in state court,original federal jurisdiction exists to permit removal of this action.then,only if this primary question is answered in the affirmative should the court reach the question whether any reasonable basis exists for predicting that lirc could be liable to plaintiffs under louisiana law,such that lirc is improperly joined,federal removal diversity jurisdiction exists,and the district court opinion affirmed.see smallwood,at.i respectfully dissent because the majority relies upon a narrow question of administrative exhaustion,not evident from the pleadings in state court and not fully presented to or considered by the district court in so doing,the majority fails to address the fundamental problem in this matter,that is,whether the original federal jurisdiction that permits removal exists at all.
then,having more correctly framed the question before us,my analysis reaches a result different from that of the district court and the majority.i find the district court should have remanded the cause,under c,on the basis that it was never initially removable under and because of the eleventh amendment bar to federal jurisdiction.the district court order should accordingly,in my view,be reversed,with instructions to remand the cause to the courts of louisiana.
on july,plaintiffs sued the state of louisiana through the louisiana insurance rating commission,as well as defendant insurers,allstate and state farm.plaintiffs alleged violations of state law only and sought declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and damages.plaintiffs complained the defendant insurers used an undisclosed formula to discriminate against them and others similarly situated on the basis of race or the economic condition of the area in which the property sought to be insured is located.plaintiffs complained that lirc failed in its statutory duties and,in doing so,contributed to the disparate impact of the insurers practices.
all defendants were served.the defendant insurers alone removed the action on september,to the eastern district of louisiana under,claiming that diversity jurisdiction exists because defendant lirc was improperly joined.see jernigan ashland oil,cir,cert.denied,d.prior to this removal,lirc had filed no pleadings of any kind in state court.lirc did not join in the removal,but appeared in district court upon removal.plaintiffs filed a motion to remand in the district court,arguing that lirc joinder was proper and that federal courts lacked jurisdiction to hear their claim.
pending before the district court at the time it took up the motion to remand were additional rule motions,including lirc motion to challenge venue and lirc motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for lack of jurisdiction.in the motion regarding venue,lirc agreed with plaintiffs that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction over the complaint and argued that the only proper venue was the east baton rouge parish state court because that was the location of the performance of the state agency ministerial duties,the actions challenged by plaintiffs complaint.see.stat.ann.a.under rule,lirc challenged the district court jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs claim on the basis of eleventh amendment sovereign immunity and plaintiffs ability to state their claim,on the ground that louisiana statutory immunity for discretionary functions precluded lirc liability,see.ann.but the district court did not rule on these pending motions,even though it noted that lirc will never be in federal court because of the eleventh amendment.
at the hearing on december,the court took up the motion to remand and argument of improper joinder.no written order issued after this hearing.instead,the district court ruled orally from the bench,finding lirc improperly joined because,due to louisiana statutory immunity,no reasonable basis existed for predicting that plaintiffs could recover against lirc.for that precise reason,the court denied the motion to remand.then,the court indicated its inclination to grant a request for interlocutory appeal on the ruling accordingly,plaintiffs appealed,arguing the district court erred in ruling that no reasonable basis existed for predicting that plaintiffs could recover against lirc on their complaint.
this case presents a problem of federal subject matter jurisdiction that,although not addressed by the majority,must be considered.see ziegler champion mortgage,cir.plaintiffs complaint filed in state court alleged only state law claims and included as defendant,the state of louisiana through lirc,one of its agencies.
the law is settled that i n an action where a state is a party,there can be no federal jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship because a state is not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.texas dep t of hous.and cmty.affairs verex assurance,cir see also tradigrain,mississippi state port,cir batton georgia gulf,d,dalby.thus,where,as here,the absence of a federal question is undisputed and the state is joined as a defendant,the only possible ground for removal is the improper joinder of lirc that,once corrected,creates diversity jurisdiction.see verex,at.this district court so determined,but without considering that removal was precluded.
in my view,the fundamental question of original jurisdiction,as the basis for removal,ought to be resolved first by district courts.then,and only if the case were initially removable under,should the district courts reach the question of the propriety of joinder.this approach has the benefit of requiring the district courts to first address the limits of their article iii jurisdiction prior to passing on questions that require the court to consider the potential merits of a claim,as is required under our current framework for consideration of improper joinder.see smallwood,at.even if it can not be said that article iii jurisdiction is always an antecedent question to any other judicial review,the federal courts should issue rulings in an order that best prevents reaching substantive questions when jurisdiction is in doubt.steel citizens for a bet
