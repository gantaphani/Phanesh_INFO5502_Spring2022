petitioner,a professional property manager,hired an unlicensed and uninsured contractor to install rain gutters on a condominium building,and an employee of the contractor was seriously injured on the first day of the job.the workers compensation appeals board wcab concluded that petitioner was the employer liable for workers compensation.petitioner contends that the wcab erred because petitioner was instructed to hire the unlicensed contractor as the agent of the condominium homeowners association or the condominium owners,which were found not liable for workers compensation under the labor code 
we conclude that petitioner and the unlicensed contractor were dual employers that are jointly and severally liable for workers compensation.the unlicensed contractor employed the injured employee,and petitioner hired the unlicensed contractor as a professional property manager and the agent of the homeowners association.the homeowners association was not an owner or exempt employer under the labor code.even if petitioner was the agent of the condominium owners,an agent may be liable for performing an act authorized by the principal whose rights are not imputed to the agent.since liability for an agent authorized act is imputed to the principal and the homeowners association was a legal entity separate from the owners,we further conclude that the liability of petitioner as agent is imputed to the homeowners association as principal.
accordingly,the wcab decision is affirmed in part and annulled in part,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner,robert heiman,individually,and doing business as pegasus properties pegasus,a property management business,entered into a condominium management agreement agreement with montana villas homeowners association association,an unincorporated association of residential condominium owners.the agreement provided that pegasus as the agent of the association would manage the condominium property and arrange for repairs of the common area for a fee.the agreement further provided that employees hired by pegasus to maintain or repair the property would be employees of the association,although pegasus had responsibility to comply with labor laws.the agreement also provided that expenditures in excess of required approval by the association,and that pegasus would be reimbursed for any advances or costs.
at an association meeting,condominium owners agreed that new rain gutters should be installed on part of the condominium building as recommended by pegasus.pegasus hired mark hruby doing business as rube rain gutter service hruby,an unlicensed contractor that was also uninsured for workers compensation.the job contemplated was no more than two days and the cost was.
hruby hired freddy aguilera to perform some of the work at a day.on november,the first day of the job,a rain gutter contacted a high voltage electrical wire and aguilera was severely shocked and fell and was seriously injured.hruby completed the job and was paid by check.
aguilera filed for workers compensation naming hruby as the employer,and the uninsured employers benefits trust fund fund pegasus,the association and the individual condominium owners owners were joined as defendants.the parties proceeded to trial and hruby and aguilera testified.
the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj determined that hruby was the employer of aguilera and was liable for workers compensation including percent permanent disability.in the opinion,the wcj explained that even though hruby did not have the required contractor license and was not an independent contractor under section the owners were not employers under section d because aguilera had not worked sufficient hours under section h and cedillo workers comp.appeals bd.th,d cedillo in addition,aguilera did not have enough hours for casual employment under section b the wcj also reasoned that,the agents,whether the association or pegasus,would be entitled to the rights and liabilities of the owners and should,be deemed owners within labor code d and h.aguilera petitioned the wcab for reconsideration that he was permanently totally disabled,and agreed with the fund that the association may be liable.
the wcab granted reconsideration and determined that hruby did not possess a valid contractor license at the time of the injury and therefore is not the employer of applicant for purposes of liability for workers compensation benefits.the wcab determined further that hruby was hired by pegasus,a professional property management business and an agent for the homeowners association,and therefore under labor code section,became the employer of applicant,freddy aguilera.the wcab awarded aguilera workers compensation to be paid by pegasus.the wcab also ordered further development of the record by the wcj to determine whether aguilera was permanently totally disabled.
pegasus petitions for writ of review and contends that the wcj was correct that it was the agent of the association or owners and not liable under sections d,h and b.pegasus also claims that the association or owners selected hruby from three bids and paid for the rain gutter installation.
the fund answers that sections d and h do not apply since pegasus was not an owner,even if pegasus was the agent of the owners or the association.pegasus was the joint employer of aguilera under section since pegasus hired hruby,an unlicensed contractor,as expressly found by the wcj and wcab.in addition,all the defendants may have liability as employers under section b because aguilera labor cost was in excess of.
aguilera answers that he is permanently totally disabled and the association,which is a separate legal entity,may be liable because pegasus hired hruby on behalf of the association.this court requested further briefing from the parties regarding ownership of the property and liability under the principles of agency 
the wcab responds that hruby was hired by pegasus as agent of the association,which is indicated by the agreement and minutes from an association meeting.the wcab concludes that as the principal the homeowners association may also be held liable as a joint employer of the unlicensed contractor under labor code section.the association is not an exempt employer under sections d and h because it was not an owner and homeowner associations are separate and independent legal entities from the unit owners.even if the association was an owner,the wcab reasons,the unlicensed contractor work for the homeowners association was not personal because it was in the course of the association trade or business,management of the common areas of the condominium complex.
pegasus responds that it hired hruby as instructed by the directors of the association and in compliance with the agreement.it argues the association is not an owner according to the governing documents and civil code and is a liable employer unprotected by sections d and h therefore,pegasus and the directors are not liable.
the owners answer that the association should be deemed an owner under the labor code because homeowners associations have rights and liabilities of owners under the civil code otherwise,the owners contend,they would not receive the benefit of sections d and h as intended by the legislature.

standard of review.factual findings.
a decision by the wcab that is based on factual findings which are substantial evidence is generally affirmed by the reviewing court.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.however,the reviewing court is authorized to reject factual findings that are erroneous,unreasonable,illogical,improbable,or inequitable when viewed in light of the entire record and the overall statutory scheme.western growers,supra,th at,d bracken workers comp.appeals bd.d.

hruby was an unlicensed contractor.
a general or specialty contractor must be licensed to perform the contracted work.bus.et and et a contractor that selects,cuts,shapes,fabricates and installs sheet metal such as rain gutters is a specialty contractor who is required to have a class license.see of regulations,title.hruby testified at trial that he was hired to install rain gutters on the condominium building,and did not have the required class license on the date of aguilera injury.see zellers playa pacifica,th,d workers compensation exclusive remedy under where property owner hired licensed contractor whose license was expired when employee injured.this testimony was uncontradicted and unimpeached and is substantial evidence that supports the wcab finding that hruby was an unlicensed contractor.see garza workmen.bd.cal d,levesque workmen.bd.cal d.
legal consequences of hiring an unlicensed contractor.
among the legal consequences of hiring an unlicensed contractor who is injured or whose employee is injured performing the work is that different employment relationships may arise with respect to employer liability for workers compensation or tort damages.for example,in state compensation ins.fund.workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,state fund,the supreme court concluded that a homeowner,who hired an unlicensed contractor that fell from a scaffold,was required to assume the status of employer for workers compensation liability this is so because section requires an independent contractor to be licensed as a matter of law.in blew horner d.blew,a general contractor who hired an unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor was determined to be the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor injured employee,and workers compensation was the exclusive remedy against the general contractor.see also nick hagopian drywall workers comp.appeals bd.d.licensed and insured contractor employed unlicensed subcontractor injured employee who is not estopped for subcontractor misrepresentation he had license,which cites rinaldi workers comp.appeals bd.d.licensed and uninsured general contractor employed unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor injured employee,who is not estopped for subcontractor misrepresentation he had license.
however,the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling who hires an unlicensed contractor whose employee is injured may not be the employer liable for workers compensation under section or section d unless the employee worked sufficient hours under section h.cedillo,supra,th at,d see also furtado schriefer d.matter remanded to determine whether homeowner employed injured unlicensed painter under section h,which controls over section.nevertheless,a homeowner may be an employer liable in tort under section,and the unlicensed contractor who was also uninsured may be a dual employer with tort liability under section cedillo,supra,th at,d.since hruby was an unlicensed contractor when he contracted with pegasus and at the time aguilera was injured on the job,it is necessary for us to examine the potential employment relationships in order to determine liability.
hruby is a liable employer under division of the labor code.
the wcab determined that pegasus was the employer liable for workers compensation under section and the labor code.pegasus contends that the wcj correctly found that hruby was the liable employer.
generally,employment relationships that result in workers compensation liability are predicated more upon the definitions pertaining to employees under sections et than employers under sections et.supportive services workers comp.appeals bd.d.supportive services.the definitions are an outgrowth and expansion of common law employment concepts such as the employer right of control over service provided by the employee.id.at.in addition,the definitions are part of divisions of the labor code,which specifically addresses workers compensation.section is part of division of the labor code which supplements and does not override the division definitions of employers and employees.state fund,supra,cal d at,cedillo,supra,th at,d.
applying these principles,we conclude that hruby was a dual employer of aguilera and is liable for workers compensation under division of the labor code.it is undisputed that hruby hired aguilera to perform service within the meaning of sections and by rendering service,aguilera is presumed to be hruby employee under section aguilera rendered the service as an employee,and not as an independent contractor under sections and because hruby was in the business of rain gutter installation,contracted with pegasus,paid wages and controlled aguilera work and hours.see borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d.
in addition,section supplements and does not negate application of the division definitions of employer and employee to hruby.although the wcab determined that pegasus and not hruby was the employer solely liable for workers compensation,cedillo indicates that there may be dual employment of an injured employee by the unlicensed contractor under division of the labor code and the contractor hirer under section.cedillo,supra,th at,d.in cedillo,the unlicensed contractor contended that he could not be the employee of the homeowner under section and the employer of the injured employee at the same time.the court explained that a similar claim was rejected in hernandez chavez roofing,d,where the unlicensed and uninsured subcontractor was potentially liable in tort under section,even though the general contractor was licensed and insured for workers compensation cedillo,supra,th at,d.section is part of division of the labor code and subjects employers under the division to an action at law as if the division did not apply for failing to secure the payment of workers compensation.in addition to the civil action authorized by section,workers compensation is a cumulative remedy under section see le parc community workers comp.appeals bd.th,d le parc.
in this case,hruby admitted at trial that he was an unlicensed contractor and illegally uninsured for workers compensation when aguilera whom he had hired was injured on the job.consequently,hruby is liable to aguilera for workers compensation under section a and is potentially liable in tort under section.cedillo,supra,th at pages,d.
pegasus is a liable employer under section.
the wcab determined that pegasus is the liable employer for workers compensation under section,state fund and blew because pegasus hired hruby who was an unlicensed contractor when aguilera was injured.pegasus contends that the wcab erred because the association or owners selected hruby from three bids and instructed pegasus to hire hruby as indicated by the agreement and payment from the association account.the fund answers that the claimed bids and payment are not part of the record,and the wcab finding that pegasus hired hruby is based on substantial evidence and must be affirmed.
substantial evidence supports the finding that pegasus hired hruby.
only the invoice from hruby,which was billed to pegasus,is part of the record and the alleged bids and documentation of who actually paid for the work is not.however,the wcj reported that the owners agreed to the installation of new rain gutters at an association meeting,and the wcab indicates that pegasus was authorized to obtain bids based on the association minutes.we also note that the agreement provides that repairs in excess of must be approved by the association,and that pegasus was the association agent.the agreement further provides that pegasus was an independent contractor in the business of managing properties,which is undisputed.
nevertheless,there is no evidence that the association or owners received bids,instructed pegasus who to hire or had any direct involvement with hruby.in addition,hruby testified at trial that he agreed to install rain gutters on the condominium building with pegasus,and did not recall contact with the owners or whose check paid for the job.these facts confirm that the agreement for installation of the rain gutters was between hruby and pegasus,which was an independent contractor in the business of managing properties that was acting on behalf of the association.therefore,the wcab determination that hruby was hired by pegasus is supported by substantial evidence.since hruby was an unlicensed contractor when aguilera was injured on the job and when pegasus hired hruby,pegasus was an employer that is jointly and severally liable for workers compensation under section,state fund and blew.
pegasus was the association agent.
pegasus contends further that even if it hired hruby,the wcj was correct that it was the agent of the association or owners and should be deemed an owner and exempt employer under sections d and h and cedillo.however,the wcab determined that pegasus was the agent of the association and neither were owners.the fund argues that pegasus was not an owner regardless of agency status.although pegasus concedes it was not an owner,we shall address whether pegasus was the agent of the association or owners and should be deemed an owner within the meaning of sections d and h.
the agreement.
there is substantial evidence supporting the wcab finding that pegasus was the association agent when pegasus hired hruby.an agent generally represents the principal in dealings with third persons,may be authorized to do any act the principal may do,and receives authority either by prior agreement or ratification civil code.prior authority was clearly provided by the agreement and the association meeting.the agreement was between the association and pegasus,and was also executed by the association president and treasurer and pegasus.moreover,the agreement provides that pegasus is an independent contractor in the business of managing properties and the agent of the association.the agreement also states that pegasus is authorized to manage the condominium building and provide for repairs,including the hiring of others,with association oversight,approval of expenditures over and reimbursement for advances or costs.pursuant to the agreement and the association meeting,the rain gutter repair and installation was authorized and pegasus hired hruby,who completed the job and was paid.
the common interest development act.
the agency relationship between pegasus and the association under the agreement is also consistent with the statutory scheme under civil code section et,which specifically address common interest developments such as condominium projects and associations and is known as the common interest development act.see lamden la jolla shores clubdominium homeowners cal th,d,lamden property damage from unincorporated homeowners association spot treatment of termite infestation is subject to good faith business judgment rule and not personal injury negligence standard.under civil code section a,a common interest development shall be managed by an association that may be incorporated or unincorporated.in addition,the association is responsible for repairing,replacing,or maintaining the common areas under civil code section a.
it is also well established that a homeowners association is a separate legal entity apart from the owners,whether incorporated or not,with standing to sue or be sued even by a member.in white cox d.white,the court concluded that an unincorporated condominium association was a separate legal entity,which could be sued for negligence by a condominium owner.similarly,the supreme court in frances village green owners cal d,frances cited white with approval in concluding that an unincorporated condominium association has a separate legal existence,and could be held to a landlord duty of care to provide safety to its member.see also lamden,supra,cal th at pages,d,et.
civil code section also provides for a managing agent,which under subdivision f is defined as a person or entity,who for compensation,or in expectation of compensation,exercises control over the assets of the association and does not include a employee of the association.the statute further provides that the managing agent is authorized to receive funds belonging to the association for deposit into a trust fund account.see also,which was enacted in and provides except to the extent this title provides a specific rule,the general law of agency,including article commencing with section of chapter of title of,and title commencing with section of,part of division of the civil code,applies to an unincorporated association.
in this case,the association was unincorporated and a separate legal entity that delegated management and maintenance of the condominium building to pegasus as the managing agent under the agreement and the common interest development act.consistent with the civil code,the agreement further provided that pegasus was a paid independent contractor and not an employee,whose duties included collecting and depositing into the association account membership dues,fees,or assessments and preparing checks.
pegasus liability is unchanged by its agency status.
pegasus contends that as the agent of the association or owners,it has the same rights or legal status as its principal under civil code section and is an owner and exempt employer under sections d and h.we disagree.
civil code section plainly states that rights and liabilities accrue from the agent authorized acts to the principal.the statute does not state that the principal rights or defenses accrue to the agent.moreover,pegasus was the agent of the association,not the owners,as determined by the wcab.
it is also well established that an agent may be liable for his or her own acts on behalf of the principal whether or not the principal is liable.see frances,supra,cal d at.for example,in cowell industrial acc.com.cal d,cowell,a corporate cement business,which also managed the stockholders ranch and hired the ranch hand who was injured,was determined to be the agent and joint employer.and although liability of the county as the state agent was not addressed in supportive services,supra,d at pages,the state as principal was determined to be a dual employer because the county hired the injured employee and both had the right of supervision and control.
in this case,hruby was hired directly by pegasus as the managing agent on behalf of the association.since pegasus was also an independent contractor in the business of managing properties and hruby had no dealings with the association,pegasus was in the best position to make the determination whether the price of the contract reflected the cost of insurance for workers compensation purposes and whether hruby was properly licensed to perform the work as stated by the wcab.moreover,the agreement provided that pegasus had responsibility for labor laws even though employees hired to perform maintenance or repairs would be employees of the association.for these reasons,we conclude that pegasus is an employer liable for workers compensation under section,and is not exempted under sections d and h whether the agent of the association or the owners.civil code cowell,supra,cal d at,supportive services,supra,d at.
the association is liable as principal.
throughout the proceedings,aguilera,the fund,pegasus and the wcab have taken the position that the association is liable because hruby who was an unlicensed contractor was hired by pegasus as the agent of the association.as we have already noted,we have concluded that pegasus is an employer that is jointly and severally liable for workers compensation under section,state fund and blew.in addition,we have concluded that hruby was hired by pegasus as the agent of the association,which is the principal and a separate legal entity.we have also explained that liability for an agent authorized acts may be imputed from the agent to the principal pursuant to civil code section,cowell and supportive services even if the association was also the agent of the owners as reasoned by the wcj,the association may be liable for its own acts.see frances,supra,cal d at page.
the owners admit the agency relationship between pegasus and the association but contend,as determined by the wcj,that the association should be deemed an owner and exempt employer under sections d and h.otherwise the owners will not benefit from sections d and h as the legislature intended,since imposing liability on the homeowner association would necessarily impose liability on each individual homeowner.
however,we need not decide whether the association should be deemed an owner and an exempt employer since we agree with the wcab that the duties of hruby and aguilera were not personal and were in the trade or business of the association contrary to section d.the owners do not address this issue.
although under section d an employee is a person whose duties are incidental to the ownership,maintenance,or use of the dwelling,including the care and supervision of children,or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade,business,profession,or occupation of the owner or occupant emphasis added,the wcab interpretation that the language defining duties should be read together rather than separately is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.see boehm associates,supra,th at pages,d ralphs grocery,supra,th at page,d nunez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.we note that when the legislature added and revised section d and insurance code sections and so that homeowner liability policies would provide workers compensation coverage for residential employees coverage for duties performed in the business of the insured was expressly excluded.moreover,each statute contains language or references to the other statutes that indicate the legislature intended these statutes to be interrelated and read together therefore,the wcab interpretation of section d,that the language defining duties should be read together,is consistent with the statutory scheme 
in addition,the wcab determination that the rain gutter repair and installation was not personal and was in the trade or business of the association under section d is consistent with the record,the labor code and the common interest development act.the association managed the condominium building and provided for maintenance or repairs pursuant to the agreement and civil code section subdivision a the services provided by hruby and aguilera were also for maintenance or repairs within the meaning of section and management and maintenance by the association were provided on a regular basis under the agreement and section moreover,the association had corporate powers to finance,contract and conduct business under civil code section c and section the association performed these functions through its officers or directors and pegasus as the paid managing agent under the agreement and the civil code.consequently,the duties performed by hruby and aguilera were not personal and were in the trade,business of the association,and the association was not an owner and exempt employer under sections d and h therefore,the association is liable for workers compensation as the principal of pegasus.
the owners are not liable for workers compensation.
we agree with the wcj and the wcab that the owners are not liable for workers compensation as either an employer under section or an employer under section d because aguilera did not work sufficient hours under section h.cedillo,supra,th at,d.even if the association or pegasus is the agent of the owners as suggested by the wcj,employer liability for workers compensation is not imputed to the owners as principal because of the statutory immunity provided under the labor code.see ecc construction,ganson th,d condominium owners not personally liable under for construction contract with condominium association that was nonprofit mutual benefit corporation,although association may look to members for debt.nor are the owners an employer that is liable for workers compensation solely for being a member of the association since generally a member of an unincorporated association does not incur liability for acts of the association or acts of its members which he did not authorize or perform.see white,supra,d at page.orser george d,which is cited by white,and nat.bk.cooper d,national bank.therefore,the owners are not liable for workers compensation and thus benefit from sections d and h as the legislature intended.
disposition 
hruby and pegasus were dual employers of aguilera that are jointly and severally liable for workers compensation under the labor code.pegasus was also the agent of the association,which was a separate legal entity that is liable for workers compensation as the principal.pegasus and the association were not owners or exempt employers under sections d and h.the wcab decision awards aguilera workers compensation to be paid solely by pegasus.we reject that limited conclusion and hold that hruby is jointly and severely liable with pegasus and the association is also liable as pegasus principle.to the extent that wcab decision is inconsistent with our conclusion,it is annulled.the award will otherwise be affirmed.
the decision of the wcab is affirmed in part and annulled in part,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
all statutory reference is to the labor code unless otherwise stated.
the fund provides workers compensation in place of illegally uninsured employers,who may be subject to penalties,civil liability and reimbursement of the fund.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,dubois et.
section states in part there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker performing services for which a license is required pursuant to chapter commencing with section of division of the business and professions code,or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license is an employee rather than an independent contractor any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required shall hold a valid contractors license as a condition of having independent contractor status.for purposes of workers compensation law,this presumption is a supplement to the existing statutory definitions of employee and independent contractor,and is not intended to lessen the coverage of employees under division and division.
section states in part employee means every person in the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,whether lawfully or unlawfully employed,and includes d except as provided in subdivision h of section,any person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling whose duties are incidental to the ownership,maintenance,or use of the dwelling,including the care and supervision of children,or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade,business,profession,or occupation of the owner or occupant.

in cedillo,a homeowner hired an unlicensed and uninsured roofer whose employee was injured after about hours on the job.the court of appeal affirmed that the homeowner was not the employer liable for workers compensation even though the roofer was unlicensed under section,since neither the roofer nor the injured employee worked sufficien
