in a case involving an insurance claim for damages caused by the northridge earthquake,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit certified the following question to this court where an insured presents a timely claim to his insurer for property damage under a policy,and the insurer agent inspects the property but does not discover the full extent of covered damage,does california insurance code bar a claim brought by the insured more than one year after the damage was sustained but within one year of his discovery of the additional damage or,to put the matter differently,does neff new york life ins,cal d,remain good law vu prudential property cas.ins.cir.
in answering this question,we explain below that neff holding that an unconditional denial of coverage commences the running of the statute of limitation of insurance code section remains good law.on the facts of this case,however,prudential may be estopped to raise the statute of limitations defense if the insured can show that he refrained from bringing a timely action because he reasonably relied on the insurer factual misrepresentation that his damages were less than his policy deductible amount.we do not decide whether the federal district court erred in sustaining defendant insurer motion for summary judgment.that task remains for the united states court of appeals,aided,we hope,by the views expressed in this opinion.

the opinion of the ninth circuit succinctly summarized the facts and proceedings leading to its order of certification in this case 
peter vu was one of countless insureds who suffered damage to his home as a result of the infamous northridge earthquake of january.at the time of the earthquake,vu maintained a homeowner insurance policy with prudential property and casualty insurance company.the policy included an endorsement for earthquake damage,covering for his dwelling and for appurtenant structures.a separate deductible applied to each coverage.as required by california insurance code,vu policy contained a suit clause providing that n o action can be brought unless the action is started within one year after the date of loss.cal.no suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless commenced within months next after inception of the loss.within a few days of the earthquake,vu contacted prudential to report that his home had sustained observable damage,which included cracks in his walls and ceilings.an adjuster sent by prudential inspected vu home on january and informed him that he was entitled to for damage to appurtenant structures,but that the damage to his home was only,an amount significantly below the policy deductible.on january,prudential paid vu for the damage.
relying on prudential inspection and denial of his claim,vu took no further action until august when he discovered substantial additional damage that had been caused by the earthquake.in september,some twenty months after prudential had effectively denied vu claim for damage to his home,an appraiser hired by vu estimated that the earthquake damage to vu home far exceeded the deductible vu promptly informed prudential and requested coverage for this newly discovered damage.prudential declined on the ground that the statute of limitations on actions for recovery of claims had expired.
two and a half years after prudential had resolved vu original claim,but less than a year after vu discovered the additional damage,vu filed suit in federal district court.vu alleged that prudential was estopped from invoking the statute of limitations because his failure to bring an action within one year was the direct result of his reasonable reliance on prudential january inspection,and on prudential representation that the damage to his home fell below the deductible.the district court granted prudential motion for summary judgment,holding that the statute of limitations acted as a bar to vu claim and to his second claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.vu timely appealed.vu prudential property cas.ins,supra,at,italics omitted.
ii.the statute of limitations on insurance claims 
the ordinary statute of limitations for breach of a written contract is four years.code civ.insurance claims for property damage,however,have a limitation period.we explained the short statutory limitation period is the result of long insistence by insurance companies that they have additional protection against fraudulent proofs,which they could not meet if claims could be sued upon within four years as in the case of actions on other written instruments.code civ.originally,the shortened limitation periods were inserted into policies by insurers.some courts declared such provisions void as against public policy while other courts enforced them in order to protect freedom of contract.bollinger national fire ins.cal d.in,the california legislature intervened in favor of a shortened period of limitation by enacting the predecessor to insurance code section to impose a month limitation on claims under fire insurance policies.stats,ch.the statute was fashioned after a new york statute governing lawsuits on fire insurance policies.thereafter,as insurance coverage was expanded to cover more than fire,theft,lightning and other property damage the new york provision was broadened in by replacement of the phrase after the fire with after inception of the loss.com.insurance superior court cal d,quoting proc home ins.in,california insurance code section was amended to conform more closely to the new york law,shortening the limitation period to the period of that law.com.insurance superior court,supra,at.
for years,california cases debated whether the defense of the statute of limitations was a favored or disfavored defense.in,we resolved the matter t he affirmative defense based on the statute of limitations should not be characterized by courts as either favored or disfavored.the two public policies identified above the one for repose and the other for disposition on the merits are equally strong,the one being no less important or substantial than the other.norgart upjohn cal th,d.thus,we approach the issue of the statute of limitations defense in this case with no policy predisposition favoring either side.
