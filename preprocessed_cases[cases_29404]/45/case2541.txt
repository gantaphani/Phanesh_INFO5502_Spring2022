ggis insurance services,ggis,insuresuite,insuresuite,survival insurance,survival,and richard joseph acunto collectively petitioners commenced this action against capitol indemnity corporation capitol,alleging that it owed them a defense and indemnity in an action brought against them by the pennsylvania insurance commissioner.petitioners sought to stay this action on the ground any adjudication of facts in this proceeding could prejudice them in the underlying pennsylvania action.they challenge the trial court denial of their request for a stay.they also challenge the denial of their motion for summary adjudication of capitol claimed duty to defend.
we conclude that a policy exclusion precludes coverage for the claims alleged by the commissioner and that a stay is not warranted because the coverage issues can be decided as a matter of law.we therefore deny both petitions.

ggis is a california corporation that acts as a general agent in california for insurers.acunto is its chief executive officer and a director.insuresuite and survival worked together with ggis in some capacity.
ggis marketed,underwrote,and serviced automobile insurance policies in california on behalf of legion insurance company legion and villanova insurance company villanova,pursuant to a management agreement.acunto also was a party to the management agreement.the management agreement provided for ggis to collect premiums paid by policyholders,retain a portion of those funds as commissions for services rendered,and remit the remainder to legion and villanova.it provided that all premiums collected by ggis were the property of legion and villanova,and that ggis held those funds as a fiduciary.it stated further that ggis was responsible for collecting all earned premium and for paying those amounts to legion and villanova whether collected or not.the management agreement also provided for ggis to refund commissions on policy cancellations,reductions in premiums or any other return premiums at the same rate at which such commissions were originally retained.
the commonwealth court of pennsylvania issued orders of rehabilitation in march,appointing the pennsylvania insurance commissioner as rehabilitator of legion and villanova.the court ordered all persons in possession of those insurers assets not to dispose of the assets without the prior written consent of the commissioner.it also ordered all persons who had collected premiums on behalf of the insurers to account for all earned premiums and commissions and account for and pay all premiums and commissions unearned due to policies canceled in the normal course of business,directly to the rehabilitator.after it became aware of the rehabilitation orders,ggis ceased retaining commissions from the premiums collected and instead retained administrative fees in the amount of per week,beginning in april.ggis contends it collected those fees pursuant to an oral agreement with the commissioner.ggis stopped retaining administrative fees in december,when there were no more collected premiums.the pennsylvania court issued orders of liquidation in july,appointing the commissioner as liquidator of legion and villanova.
the insurance policy 
capitol issued an insurance agents and brokers professional liability policy to ggis,as the named insured,for a period beginning on december.the policy included insuring agreements a and b,providing up to million in coverage for losses and defense expenses arising from claims first made during the policy period.insuring agreement c provided limited coverage up to for defense expenses only,in certain circumstances.

the pennsylvania action,tender of claim,and payment of defense costs 
an attorney representing the pennsylvania insurance commissioner,diane koken,sent a letter to ggis and acunto in march,demanding remittance of over million in premiums collected by them on behalf of legion and villanova and purportedly retained improperly as administrative fees.the letter also stated that ggis had improperly paid to or for the benefit of reinsurers over million of premiums collected.the letter stated further that ggis and acunto had miscalculated the amounts of returned premium due to insureds upon the cancellation of certain policies and that the insureds received overpayments of returned premium or failed to pay premium owed because guardian did not perform the required short rate calculation,and demanded an accounting of those amounts.the letter demanded payment of over million to the commissioner and an accounting of all premium amounts for the canceled policies.
ggis filed a proof of claim in june or july in connection with the liquidation proceedings.ggis alleged that legion and villanova had committed fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract by failing to disclose their precarious financial condition,and sought million in damages.
the commissioner commenced an action against petitioners by filing a writ of summons in the commonwealth court of pennsylvania in july.ggis notified capitol of the action in september and requested a defense.capitol responded with a reservation of rights.capitol later agreed to pay ggis defense costs under insuring agreement c while reserving its rights to deny any right to coverage or a defense under the policy.
the commissioner filed a complaint against petitioners in december in pennsylvania.the commissioner alleged that she brought the action as liquidator of legion and villanova with the authority to collect the assets of and pursue all claims belonging to the insolvent insurers ggis and acunto marketed and sold insurance policies for legion and villanova pursuant to the management agreement and were required to remit to the insurers both collected and uncollected premiums pertaining to those policies all premiums collected by ggis and acunto were the sole property of the commissioner and were held in trust by ggis and acunto ggis and acunto improperly retained earned and unearned premium amounts that they unilaterally denominated as administrative fees the management agreement provided for ggis and acunto to bear their own administrative expense,and that the agreement could be modified only in writing the chief financial officer of ggis,noshir lackdawalla,acknowledged in august that ggis had requested payment of per week from the commissioner in addition to the compensation agreed under the management agreement,but that no agreement was reached and ggis proceeded to retain the additional compensation unilaterally and transferred some of those funds to acunto,survival,and insuresuite.
the commissioner alleged counts for breach of contract,against ggis and acunto return of premium trust funds capitalization omitted,against all petitioners breach of fiduciary duty,against ggis,acunto,and survival negligence,against ggis,acunto,and survival and an accounting,against all petitioners.
in her complaint,the commissioner alleged that ggis and acunto breached the management agreement by failing and refusing to account for and remit premiums owed to legion and villanova,and that the commissioner suffered damages as a result count one petitioners have improperly been in or are presently in possession of premium trust funds that belong to the liquidator,that they failed to remit premium trust funds to the commissioner,and that the commissioner suffered damages as a result count two ggis,acunto,and survival breached their fiduciary duties owed to legion,villanova,and the commissioner by failing to pay premiums,and improperly deducting credits and administrative fees from amounts due,and that the commissioner suffered damages as a result count three ggis,acunto,and survival breached their duty of care by failing to pay premiums,and improperly withdrawing credits and administrative fees from amounts due to legion,villanova,and the liquidator,and that the commissioner suffered damages as a result count four and the management agreement,rehabilitation orders,and liquidation orders impose a duty on petitioners to provide the information necessary to substantiate the amounts remitted to the insurers and the commissioner or retained from those remittances,and that an accounting is necessary and appropriate to determine the amounts owed by petitioners count five.

capitol terminated its payment of defense costs in march,after paying a total of in defense costs.
the complaint in the present action 
petitioners filed a complaint against capitol and darwin professional underwriters,darwin,in the present action in august.they alleged that ggis was the named insured under the policy,that acunto was insured as a principal,partner,officer,director,trustee employee of ggis,and that insuresuite and survival were insured as solicitors,subagents,independent contractors,or partners of ggis.petitioners alleged that they were entitled to payment of up to million in defense costs under insuring agreements a and b,and that capitol termination of their defense was unreasonable.they alleged counts against capitol and darwin for breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing declaratory relief,requesting a declaration that the defendants owe them a defense and indemnity and violation of the unfair competition law bus,et,seeking injunctive relief and restitution.
motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication and request to continue or stay the trial 
capitol and darwin moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication against each count alleged in petitioners complaint.they argued that the only potential coverage under the policy was under insuring agreement c,that capitol had paid the applicable limit,and that petitioners therefore could not establish liability under any of the counts alleged in the complaint.they also argued that exclusions g and m precluded any potential for coverage.darwin argued further that,as capitol claims manager,it was not a party to the insurance contract and therefore could not be liable under any of the counts alleged in the complaint.petitioners argued in opposition that there was a potential for coverage under insuring agreements a and b,that insuring agreement c and exclusions g and m were all inapplicable.
ggis and acunto moved for summary adjudication seeking to establish that capitol owed them a duty to defend.they argued that the pennsylvania action and the prior demand letter by the commissioner constituted a claim,as defined in the policy,for which there was potential coverage and a duty to defend under insuring agreements a and b.they argued that insuring agreement c applied only to regulatory proceedings and was inapplicable because the commissioner was prosecuting the action in her capacity as liquidator rather than as a regulator.capitol and darwin argued in opposition that insuring agreements a and b were inapplicable,that the only potential coverage was under insuring agreement c,and that exclusions g and m precluded coverage.
petitioners filed an ex parte application to continue the trial or stay the action on march,after the filing of the motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication but before the hearings on those motions.they requested,in the alternative,an order shortening time for a noticed motion seeking the same relief.they argued that the defendants sought to adjudicate in this action facts and issues that are substantially identical to material facts and issues to be adjudicated in the pennsylvania action,and that a continuance or stay was necessary to avoid prejudice to petitioners in the pennsylvania action.they argued that the issues that the defendants sought to adjudicate in this action included the nature of petitioners agreement with the insurance commissioner regarding administrative fees,when a dispute first arose concerning funds retained by petitioners pursuant to the agreement,and whether petitioners improperly paid to reinsurers and insureds funds that should have been paid to the commissioner as liquidator.the trial court denied the ex parte application.
the trial court ruled on the defendants motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication in a minute order dated april.the court determined that darwin was not a party to the insurance contract and granted summary judgment on the complaint in favor of darwin.the order stated with regard to the breach of contract count against capitol that there were triable issues of fact as to whether insuring agreement c applied.the order also stated that there were triable issues of fact concerning the application of exclusion g as to exclusion g,there are triable issues of fact as to the relationship of the exclusion to the general terms of the policy,whether the services are actuarial,and whether there are other services in addition to actuarial which would be covered by the policy.the trial court therefore denied capitol motion for summary adjudication of the count for breach of contract.the court concluded,however,that a genuine dispute as to capitol liability under the policy precluded liability for breach of the implied covenant,and therefore granted summary adjudication as to that count in capitol favor.the court also granted summary adjudication in favor of capitol as to the counts for declaratory relief and violation of the unfair competition law.
the court ruled on the motion for summary adjudication by ggis and acunto in a minute order dated may.regarding the question whether insuring agreement c applied,the order stated that the court had previously determined that there were triable issues of fact as to whether insuring agreement c applied.regarding the question whether exclusion g applied,the order referred to the court prior determination that there were triable issues of fact with regard to reasonable expectations.the court denied the motion by ggis and acunto.
further requests to stay the trial 
petitioners included in their trial brief filed on may,a request to stay the trial of the indemnity issues until after the conclusion of the pennsylvania action.petitioners also requested a stay at the final status conference on may.the court declined to stay the trial.
petitions for writ of mandate 
petitioners petitioned this court for a writ of mandate,challenging the denial of their requests to stay the trial no.we stayed all proceedings in the trial court pending further consideration of the peti
