b.the proceedings below 
state farm bank filed this action after the superintendent refused to exempt state farm bank exclusive agents from compliance with the ohio act,despite the ots opinion that federal law preempts application of the ohio act to the agents.after stipulating to the facts set forth above,the parties submitted the case to the district court on cross motions for summary judgment.the district court issued an opinion on october,rejecting state farm bank arguments and holding that its exclusive agents were required to comply with the ohio act.the district court declined to follow the analysis set forth by the united states district court for the district of connecticut in state farm bank,fsb burke,d.the burke court a virtually identical federal law preempted the application of connecticut mortgage broker law to state farm bank exclusive agents.unlike the burke court,which deferred to an opinion by ots that connecticut law was preempted,the district court here refused to defer to the ots conclusion that federal law preempts the application of the ohio act to state farm bank exclusive agents.the district court largely declined to defer because it viewed the ots opinion as a legislative rule subject to notice and comment under the administrative procedures act,d.the district court also independently reviewed applicable federal law and held that preemption was not warranted.state farm bank timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
a district court decision granting summary judgment on the issue of preemption is reviewed de novo.millsaps thompson,cir.
federal law preempts the application of the ohio act to state farm bank exclusive agents 
although the parties and the amici curiae have submitted voluminous briefs addressing a number of topics,the ultimate question in this case is relatively straightforward does federal law preempt the application of the ohio act to state farm bank exclusive agents the briefs submitted in this case devote a significant amount of discussion to the issue of whether this court should defer to the ots conclusion that the ohio act is preempted.this seems to us to be a rather circuitous route to answering the ultimate route that includes a detour through the muddied waters of administrative procedure and standards of judicial deference.this is a detour,however,that we need not take reviewing the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions de novo leads this court to the conclusion that preemption is appropriate here.we reach this conclusion because the ohio act application to state farm bank exclusive agents fits within the categories of state laws that are expressly preempted by ots regulations moreover,preemption is appropriate here because requiring state farm bank exclusive agents to comply with the ohio act would be inconsistent with congress intent that the powers of a federal savings association not be curtailed by state laws 
brief overview of the preemption doctrine 
the federal preemption doctrine has grown out of the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,which provides in part the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance of the constitution shall be the supreme law of the land,art.vi,cl.according to the supreme court,t he phrase laws of the united states encompasses both federal statutes themselves and federal regulations that are properly adopted in accordance with statutory authorization.city of new york fcc,d.federal law may preempt state law either expressly or impliedly.fidelity fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d.express preemption exists where either a federal statute or regulation contains explicit language indicating that a specific type of state law is preempted.see id.at.implied preemption has been subdivided into field preemption and conflict preemption.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d.field preemption exists where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it.id.internal quotations omitted.conflict preemption occurs where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.regardless of the type of preemption at issue,this court duty is to determine whether state regulation is consistent with the structure and purpose of applicable federal law.id.
the ots preemption regulation 
in this case,state farm bank argues,inter alia,that the ohio act,as applied to its exclusive agents,is expressly preempted by the ots preemption regulation.the district court disagreed,holding that does not expressly preempt state laws that govern the conduct of agents who perform lending and banking activities on behalf of a federal savings association.see state farm bank,reardon,d.thus,the court below drew a distinction between state regulation of a federal savings association,its employees,and subsidiaries who engage in lending and banking activities on behalf of an association and state regulation of exclusive agents who engage in the same conduct on behalf of an association.we agree with state farm bank that the district court approach was overly narrow.
in,congress passed the home owners loan act hola to govern the activities of federal savings associations.silvas e trade mortgage,cir.hola created what is now the ots for the purpose of administering the statute,and it provided the ots with plenary authority to promulgate regulations involving the operation of federal savings associations.de la cuesta,at.pursuant to hola,ots has promulgated regulations governing the powers and operations of every federal savings and loan association from its cradle to its corporate grave.id.at.internal quotations omitted.commenting on the expanse of the ots regulatory power,the supreme court has stated that i t would have been difficult for congress to give the ots a broader mandate.id.at.internal quotations omitted.
acting in accord with this broad mandate,the ots has promulgated two regulations that address preemption and.section is a more general regulation that expresses the principle that the ots has plenary and exclusive authority to regulate all aspects of the operations of federal savings associations and its authority is preemptive of any state law purporting to address the subject of the operations of a federal savings association.section provides more specific guidance on the types of state laws that are preempted.
section a states 
to enhance safety and soundness and to enable federal savings associations to conduct their operations in accordance with best practices by efficiently delivering credit to the public free from undue regulatory duplication and burden,ots hereby occupies the entire field of lending regulation for federal savings associations.ots intends to give federal savings associations maximum flexibility to exercise their lending powers in accordance with a uniform federal scheme of regulation.accordingly,federal savings associations may extend credit as authorized under federal law,including this part,without regard to state laws purporting to regulate or otherwise affect their credit activities for purposes of this section state law includes any state statute,regulation,ruling,order or judicial decision.
a emphases added.the regulation goes on to provide the following thirteen,examples of the types of state laws preempted by a 
licensing,registration,filings,or reports by creditors 
the ability of a creditor to require or obtain private mortgage insurance,insurance for other collateral,or other credit enhancements 
the terms of credit,including amortization of loans and the deferral and capitalization of interest and adjustments to the interest rate,balance,payments due,or term to maturity of the loan,including the circumstances under which a loan may be called due and payable upon the passage of time or a specified event external to the loan 
fees,including without limitation,initial charges,late charges,prepayment penalties,servicing fees,and overlimit fees 
escrow accounts,impound accounts,and similar accounts 
security property,including leaseholds 
access to and use of credit reports 
disclosure and advertising,including laws requiring specific statements,information,or other content to be included in credit application forms,credit solicitations,billing statements,credit contracts,or other documents and laws requiring creditors to supply copies of credit reports to borrowers or applicants 
processing,origination,servicing,sale or purchase of,or investment or participation in,mortgages 
disbursements and repayments 
usury and interest rate ceilings to the extent provided in and part of this chapter and g and of this part and 
clauses to the extent provided in and part of this chapter.
b emphases added.
immediately following this list of preempted laws,the regulation sets forth the types of state laws that it does not preempt.see c.the list in subsection c is prefaced with the statement that state laws of the following types are not preempted to the extent that they only incidentally affect the lending operations of federal savings associations or are otherwise consistent with the purposes of paragraph a of this section.id.emphasis added.the state laws generally excepted by c are 
contract and commercial law 
real property law 
homestead laws specified in f 
criminal law and 
any other law that ots,upon review,finds 
i furthers a vital state interest and 
ii either has only an incidental effect on lending operations or is not otherwise contrary to the purposes expressed in paragraph a of this section.
thus,a preempts state laws that have a direct impact on the banking and lending activities of a federal savings association,such as those listed in b,while c preserves state laws of general applicability that only incidentally affect the banking and lending activities of a federal savings association.
although this court has yet to address the preemptive effect of,both the first and ninth circuits have interpreted the regulation to preempt state laws that purport to regulate the conduct of federal savings associations.in silvas,the ninth circuit held that preempted a california law that purported to require e trade,a federal savings association,to refund mortgage to consumers.silvas,at.according to the silvas court,b preempted the california law because it purported to regulate a federal savings association fees and disclosures.see also haehl washington mut.bank,d,finding that indiana regulation of reconveyance fees charged by a federal savings association was preempted by.
similarly,in flagg yonkers sav.loan ass n,fa,cir,cert.denied,d,the first circuit affirmed the district court determination that preempted a new york statute purporting to require the payment of interest on mortgage escrow accounts.the flagg court extensively discussed the ots authority to promulgate,and concluded that the preemption regulation was well within hola broad grant of authority to the ots.id.at.according to the court in flagg,reflects congress goal of provid ing a consistent nationwide playing field while giving individual institutions a level of flexibility.id.at.as flagg makes clear,the ots possessed the authority to promulgate for the purpose of preempting state laws that the agency believes burden the ability of federal savings associations to exercise their powers free from burdensome state regulation.see id.at see also de la cuesta,at.recognizing that when an agency promulgates a regulation that is intended to preempt state law,the regulation should not be disturbed unless there is evidence that it is contrary to congressional intent.
a.the applicability of 
the superintendent contends that is irrelevant here because the ohio act applies directly to state farm bank exclusive agents,not state farm bank.essentially,the superintendent contends that while would preempt application of the ohio act to state farm bank,its employees,and its subsidiaries who engage in the solicitation and marketing of mortgage products,the regulation does not apply to state farm bank exclusive agents who perform the same tasks on behalf of the bank.see appellee br.at.this is so,says the superintendent,because does not specifically say that it preempts state laws that directly regulate the mortgage lending activities of a federal savings association exclusive agents.in our opinion,such a view of the preemptive effect of is incorrect.first,nothing in the text of indicates that it only preempts state laws that directly regulate federal savings associations.rather,the regulation provides that it preempts laws affecting the operations of federal savings associations,which indicates that the scope of the regulation is much broader than the superintendent would have it.second,the superintendent position is inconsistent with the supreme court decision in watters.
the court in watters recently rejected an argument similar to that advanced by the superintendent today.see watters.at.the precise issue in watters was whether the national banking act and regulations promulgated by the occ preempted state regulation of a national bank mortgage lending activities where those activities were performed by a bank operating subsidiary.id.at.the commissioner of insurance and financial services for the state of michigan argued in watters that wachovia mortgage,a wachovia bank operating subsidiary,was subject to michigan licensing and registration requirements.id.at.the commissioner reasoned that federal law did not preempt the application of the michigan requirements to wachovia mortgage because it was not a national bank.id.at.
the watters court was unpersuaded by the commissioner narrow interpretation of federal banking law,and we are likewise unpersuaded by the superintendent interpretation of in this case.according to the court in watters,federal banking law preempted the application of michigan requirements to wachovia mortgage because w e have never held that the preemptive reach of federal banking laws extends only to a national bank itself.rather,in analyzing whether state law hampers the federally permitted activities of a national bank,we have focused on the exercise of a national bank powers,not on its corporate structure.id.at.further illustrating that,for preemption purposes,it is the activity being regulated rather than the actor who is being regulated that matters,the court stated that federal law protects from state hindrance a national bank engagement in the business of banking whether conducted by the bank itself or by an operating subsidiary,empowered to do only what the bank itself could do.id.at.
continuing with the theme of interpreting things in an overly narrow fashion,the superintendent says watters is inapposite because the court opinion only addressed preemption of state laws that regulate operating subsidiaries of a national bank,not exclusive agents of a federal savings association.the superintendent is correct that watters involved an operating subsidiary soliciting and marketing mortgages on behalf of a national bank,and this case involves an exclusive agent soliciting and marketing mortgages on behalf of a federal savings association.the distinction,however,is one without a difference and fails to appreciate the principle set forth by the court in watters.properly understood,watters stands for the proposition that when considering whether a state law is preempted by federal banking law,the courts should focus on whether the state law is regulating the exercise of a national bank power not on whether the entity exercising that power is the bank itself.id.at.the superintendent urges us to do the inverse his argument focuses on the fact that the individuals being regulated are state farm bank exclusive agents while ignoring the fact that the power being exercised is clearly that of a federal savings association.
our interpretation of watters finds support in a recent first circuit decision dealing with the ability of a state to regulate the conduct of a bank agents.see spggc,llc ayotte,cir,cert.denied,d.in ayotte,bank,a national bank,and metabank,a federal savings to by the ayotte court as a federal thrift entered into a contract with simon,a shopping mall operator.id.at.pursuant to the contract,simon acted as the banks agent by selling giftcards issued by bank and metabank at its malls.id.the giftcards contained expiration dates and were subject to administrative fees.id.the attorney general for the state of new hampshire alleged that the presence of expiration dates and the act of charging administrative fees violated the new hampshire consumer protection act.id.simon filed an action in federal court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds of federal preemption.id.both metabank and bank intervened in the suit.id.at.
the first circuit affirmed the district court holding that federal banking law preempted the application of the new hampshire statute to simon.id.the ayotte court began its analysis by stating that both national banks and federal savings associations possess the authority under federal law to contract with agents for the purpose of marketing and selling giftcards.id.at.in an argument that mirrors the superintendent position in the instant case,the new hampshire attorney general argued that simon was subject to the state law because the law directly regulated the conduct of simon,a agent who was not governed by federal banking law.id.at.relying on watters,the first circuit opined that the attorney general argument was too formalistic because the question here is not whom the new hampshire statute regulates,but rather,against what activity it regulates.id.citing watters.at.the court in ayotte further explained that it would defeat the purpose of federal banking law to allow states to avoid preemption of their statutes by enacting laws that prevent agents from providing national banks with the resources to carry out
