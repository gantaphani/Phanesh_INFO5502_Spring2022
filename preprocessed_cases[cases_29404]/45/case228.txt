a.the policy 
the policy defines the term disability in two ways.a person is disabled if,because of injury or sickness 
the insured can not perform each of the material duties of his regular occupation or 
the insured,while unable to perform all of the material duties of his regular occupation on a basis,is 
performing at least one of the material duties of his regular occupation or another occupation on a or basis 
earning currently at least less per month than his indexed earnings due to that same injury or sickness.
policy at.the policy defines indexed earnings as the insured basic monthly earnings in effect just prior to the date his disability began,adjusted for inflation.id.at.basic monthly earnings are in turn defined as the insured average monthly earnings,calculated from the form received from the employer for the calendar year just prior to the date disability begins.id.at.hence,in order to be disabled within the meaning of the policy,an insured returning to work must earn on average,per month,no more than of what he earned on average,per month,in the calendar year immediately prior to the date the disability began,adjusted for inflation.when an insured returns to work,the policy thus defines disability not only in relation to an injury or illness,but also in relation to income.
the policy imposes a elimination period,beginning with the date on which the insured becomes disabled,during which no benefits are payable to the insured.id.at.the monthly benefit an insured receives after the elimination period is based on a formula that sets the benefit in proportion to the insured basic monthly earnings in the calendar year prior to the disability see id.at.the amount of the insured monthly earnings thus has consequences for the monthly benefit one receives upon disability,in addition to the determination of whether the insured continues to meet the income definition of disability in a given year.
the policy also defines a recurrent disability.a recurrent disability is a disability which is related to or due to the same cause s of a prior disability for which a monthly benefit was payable.id.at.a recurrent disability may be treated in one of two ways if the insured returns to work for six months or more,the recurrent disability is considered a new disability,with the insured subject to the same terms as a insured,including the completion of another elimination period.see id.on the other hand,if the insured returns to his regular occupation on a basis for less than six months and performs all the material duties of his occupation,the insured benefits for the recurrent disability are subject to the same terms as his prior disability.see id.
b.the policy as applied to dandurand case 
although unum initially determined that dandurand was eligible for benefits and paid such benefits between july,and august,in unum informed dandurand that,due to an error in its calculation of his earnings,it had overpaid him by almost seventy thousand dollars the claimed error,which was made by an unum employee and went undetected by at least three other unum employees,derived from the fact that unum had not included bonus income received by dandurand in when calculating his average monthly earnings for that year with the bonus income included,dandurand average monthly earnings for exceeded of his indexed earnings,as calculated from his earnings.dandurand was therefore not disabled in,according to the income definition of the policy.
having determined that dandurand was not disabled in,unum proceeded to analyze whether he was entitled to benefits in.unum did so by treating as a potential new disability period.unum thus compared dandurand average monthly earnings to his basic monthly earnings in,the calendar year immediately preceding the date of the potential new disability,and not to his earnings in.unum determined that dandurand was in fact disabled during that year,because his average monthly earnings for were less than of his average monthly earnings for.however,the fact that unum treated as a new period of disability had several adverse consequences.first,unum imposed a new elimination period on dandurand at the beginning of,during which he was not entitled to receive any benefits.second,because unum had established,instead of,as the benchmark because dandurand average monthly earnings had been lower in than in calculated that dandurand monthly benefit for would be lower than it had been in.third,and just as importantly,unum recalculation of dandurand indexed earnings based on the earnings resulted in a lower benchmark for comparing average monthly earnings in subsequent years.unum consequently determined that dandurand earnings had exceeded of his indexed earnings and that he therefore was not disabled in under the policy and not entitled to any benefits.comparing his average monthly earnings to his average monthly earnings,unum then also concluded that dandurand was not disabled in and not entitled to any benefits that year.finally,unum determined that,although dandurand was once again disabled under the policy in,when his earnings were compared to his earnings,unum could impose another elimination period at the beginning of the year and calculate dandurand benefits based on his earnings in,which were lower than both and.
having thus concluded that it had overpaid dandurand from to unum informed him that it would offset his future monthly benefits in their entirety until the overpayment had been recovered.dandurand consequently brought the present action under erisa,a b and a,seeking reinstatement of his monthly benefit,repayment of the benefits withheld,a ruling on the parties conflicting interpretations of how the monthly benefit should be calculated,and a ruling that unum should not be allowed to recover the overpayment.dandurand did not contest that he was not disabled in.instead,he objected to unum determination that and constituted new disability periods,with the consequences we have discussed.he argued that a reasonable interpretation of the policy would treat his disability in,and thereafter,as a recurring disability that was part of a prior disability and therefore not subject to a new elimination period or a recalculation of the indexed earnings.unum answered with a seeking recovery of the overpayment,to which dandurand raised the affirmative defense that it would be inequitable to allow recovery of any overpayment.
upon a motion by unum,the district court granted partial summary judgment on the question of the reasonableness of unum interpretation of the policy terms.dandurand unum life ins.of,d.hereinafter order.the court found that unum did not engage in an unreasonable application of the policy by regarding dandurand,and basic monthly earnings as his indexed earnings and that its decision to do so was a straightforward application of the policy express language.at this is the holding which is before us on appeal.
the district court subsequently held a bench trial on unum for recovery of the overpayment.the district court denied the on the basis that it was inequitable,ordered unum to cease deducting m
