in this suretyship case,the city of pine bluff,arkansas city,and pennsylvania national mutual casualty insurance company penn national the district court findings regarding the contours of equitable subrogation,suretyship,and municipal immunity in arkansas.we conclude that the city must reimburse penn national for the losses it suffered after the city released funds to a general contractor despite notice of the general contractor default and a request from the surety to withhold funds pending investigation.we therefore reverse and remand with directions to enter judgment for penn national.
after severe ice storms littered pine bluff with debris in december,the city applied for federal emergency management agency fema funds and hired general contractor david mitchell construction mitchell to clean up the aftermath.the contract required that the city withhold ten percent of any progress payments to mitchell as retainage and mitchell agreed to pass on payment to subcontractors working on the project within ten days of any progress payment from the city.acting as surety,penn national underwrote a combined performance and payment bond for the project in the penal sum of million 
as the work progressed,mitchell and the city began arguing over pricing and mitchell hauling of debris allegedly ineligible for fema reimbursement.on march,the city terminated its contract with mitchell and arranged for city employees to complete the penn national did not discover until approximately june.on that date,the city returned to penn national a completed status inquiry form indicating that the contract had been terminated and that the final contract price was disputed.the form also contained a notation that the city had received some million in claims from unpaid subcontractors supplying labor and materials on the project.
by letter dated june,penn national requested that the city not release any funds allocated to the project without penn national written consent.the letter stated that penn national was investigating unpaid subcontractor claims and asserted potential subrogation rights to contract funds.despite the letter,however,the pine bluff city council approved a settlement and release with mitchell a few days later,paying mitchell and mitchell creditors approximately million although the record does not indicate whether this amount included fema monies the city received prior to penn national june letter,the city later received fema payments totaling approximately million.dist.order of,at.
penn national brought suit against the city and others,originally seeking a declaratory judgment and a bill quia timet various unpaid subcontractors also intervened in the litigation or instituted separate suit against penn national on the payment bond.penn national then investigated the various subcontractor claims as litigation progressed.
penn national ultimately determined that two subcontractors,rental service corporation rental and cannon contracting cannon,possessed valid bond claims.penn national settled with each,albeit in different ways.rental originally alleged claims totaling,but accepted an unconditional payment of in full settlement.cannon originally claimed an unpaid balance of,but accepted an unconditional payment of plus an escrowed,the release of which is conditioned on penn national success in this lawsuit in return,both rental and cannon expressly assigned their rights to penn national.
penn national then sought to amend its complaint against the city to include requests for declaratory and equitable relief,including equitable subrogation.after consolidating related cases,the district court permitted amendment and simultaneously considered the parties motions for summary judgment.in sum,the district court rejected the city contention that it was immune from suit and concluded that equitable subrogation did not furnish penn national with actionable rights against the city.
we review the district court summary judgment rulings de novo,evergreen,llc fcl graphics,cir,and arkansas substantive law governs that inquiry.erie tompkins.united fire cas.ins.garvey,cir.before reaching the merits,however,we must consider two threshold arguments.
the city initially contends that penn national never requested damages and has therefore waived any request for monetary relief.we reject this argument because a liberal reading of the amended complaint and a survey of the parties arguments before the district court reveals that penn national was pursuing,inter alia,recovery from municipal pockets.see.a conley gibson,d.given that the city has consistently argued its immunity from damages,it is difficult to understand how the city can now claim lack of notice regarding penn national request or prejudice arising therefrom.
the city also mentions the rule,asserting that penn national request for a declaration of priority to contract funds and to recover the funds from others is necessarily repugnant to a recovery from city coffers.once again,we can not fathom why.designed to prevent double recovery for a single injury,smart sunshine potato flakes,cir,the rule applies when a party possesses two appropriate but inconsistent remedies and deliberately pursues one remedy to the other exclusion.van curen.prof l bail bondsman licensing.the rule does not prohibit assertion of multiple causes of action,sexton law firm,milligan,nor does it preclude pursuit of consistent remedies,even to final adjudication,so long as the plaintiff receives but one satisfaction.kapp bob sullivan chevrolet.here,the city contention that penn national elected only a declaratory remedy is misplaced because penn national also requested equitable subrogation and sought recovery of specified funds.seeking a declaration of priority to funds and pursuing judgment in an equal amount reflects no assertion of inconsistent remedies.to establish that the city paid the wrong party and should be liable,the court must first conclude that penn national was entitled to priority payment.
we next consider the contours of equitable subrogation in suretyship.equitable subrogation is one of a surety principal mechanisms for reducing loss.see prairie state bank united states.recognizing surety subrogation rights as elementary.arising by operation of law,the doctrine permits the surety to acquire and assert the rights of those parties whom the surety pays.welch foods,chicago title ins.
a prerequisite to equitable subrogation is the surety full satisfaction of any underlying debt or obligation.american sur.of new york westinghouse.paul fire marine ins.murray guard.the parties here dispute whether penn national settlement with cannon satisfies this requirement because the settlement involves a partially conditional payment.the district court thought the conditional payment presented a bootstrapping problem and concluded that penn national had not fully satisfied cannon claim,but we disagree.
as noted by justice cardozo,full satisfaction is necessary because,i f the holding were different,the surety would reduce the protection of the bond to the extent of its dividend in the assets of the debtor.american sur,at.full satisfaction also prevents competition between the rights of the surety and the original creditor to the original creditor detriment u ntil the creditor be wholly satisfied,there ought to and can be no interference with his rights or his securities which might,even by bare possibility,prejudice or embarrass him in any way in the collection of the residue of his claim.barton matthews,internal quotation omitted restatement third of suretyship and guaranty cmt.
in this case,the contract and associated bond created two relevant obligations removal of specified debris and payment for labor and materials.the city unilaterally removed the former obligation,so penn national was charged with satisfying the latter under its payment event which has occurred.mitchell and the city owe nothing to rental and cannon by virtue of the subcontractors settlement with penn national.despite cannon derivative interest in this lawsuit,cannon does not possess any remaining claim for residue against mitchell or the city and there is no risk
