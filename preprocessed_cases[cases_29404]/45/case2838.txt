plaintiff,ward general insurance services,and defendants,the employers fire insurance company and one beacon insurance,filed for summary adjudication seeking the court determination whether a first party insurance policy,issued by defendant to plaintiff,covered the loss of stored computer data not accompanied by the loss or destruction of the storage medium the court found plaintiff loss was not covered by the insurance policy because it was not a direct physical loss.plaintiff appeals the adverse judgment,contending its loss was a direct physical loss as a matter of law.we disagree with plaintiff argument and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff purchased a commercial insurance policy from defendant covering the policy period of february,to february.on november,while plaintiff was in the process of updating its oracle computer database,human error caused the database system to crash,resulting in the loss of plaintiff electronically stored data used to service its clients insurance policies.plaintiff hired consultants to restore the database,and data was manually inputted so that plaintiff could resume its normal business operations.plaintiff incurred extra expenses restoring its data,and also suffered the loss of business income because of the disruption.plaintiff quantified the loss in the amount of in extra expenses to restore the database,and in business income,losses of productivity,commissions and profits.plaintiff made a claim on its insurance policy,hoping to recover its losses.except for a small payment of,defendant denied the insurance claim,asserting other losses were not covered by the policy.
plaintiff argues its losses are covered under the policy building and personal property coverage form,and under certain policy endorsements.these endorsements are called valuable papers and records coverage form electronic equipment and software coverage electronic data processing coverage form and business income coverage form and extra expense actual loss sustained.defendant asserts coverage for the type of loss suffered by plaintiff is not available under any of these coverage forms because each requires a direct physical loss of or damage to property,and none of the loss or damage suffered by plaintiff was a direct physical loss.defendant also contends plaintiff losses are excluded from coverage under the various exclusions in the coverage forms.
procedurally,plaintiff complaint alleged causes of action against defendant for breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,reformation,and declaratory relief,and a cause of action against the insurance broker for negligence plaintiff moved for summary adjudication of issues on the first cause of action for breach of contract and the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief,seeking a declaration of coverage and recovery for breach of contract in the event the court found in plaintiff favor on the coverage issue.defendant moved for summary adjudication of issues on all causes of action and on the claim for punitive damages.
the court granted defendant motion for summary adjudication on the second bad faith and third reformation causes of action because plaintiff failed to submit a separate statement in response to defendant separate statement as required by section,subdivision b,of the code of civil procedure.with those matters resolved,the court adjudicated the remaining for summary adjudication of the first and fourth causes of action by granting defendant motion and denying plaintiff motion.in short,the court ruled there was no insurance coverage for plaintiff loss,and the breach of contract action necessarily failed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we independently review the court decision on a motion for summary adjudication,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.merrill navegar,cal th,d,see also certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d.further,to the extent our decision requires the interpretation of an insurance policy,we also conduct an independent review.bluehawk continental ins.th,d.here,the issues argued on appeal raise no factual dispute.the sole disagreement concerns the proper interpretation of the insurance policy.
principles of interpretation 
the principles by which insurance contracts are interpreted are well worn,but these bedrock principles bear repeating.while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.the clear and explicit meaning of contractual provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage citation,controls judicial interpretation.citation.thus,if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.aiu ins.superior court cal d.we must also infer the intent of the parties,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.
a policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions,both of which are reasonable.citation.but language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole,and in the circumstances of the case,and can not be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.citation.courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.the fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous,national union fire ins.cal th,d.if there is ambiguity,however,it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor,the insurer believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d.if an asserted ambiguity is not eliminated by the language and context of the policy,courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist,the insurer in order to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d.
plaintiff suggests public policy favors coverage in this case because of the importance to our economy of computers and the database systems they support.we decline to use public policy as an interpretive aid.an insurance policy is a contract,to be interpreted and enforced as such.the principles of contractual interpretation,as applied to insurance policies,are discussed,ante.these principles do not include using public policy to redefine the scope of coverage.aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d,the answer to coverage determinations is to be found solely in the language of the policies,not in public policy considerations.
losses claimed by plaintiff 
analysis of the coverage provided by the insurance policy must begin with an understanding of the claims made by plaintiff.plaintiff motion asserted that during the updating of its oracle database,the database system crash ed,resulting in the compromise,corruption loss of all electronically stored data relating to plaintiff business operations.as a result of this event,plaintiff incurred expenses,including data restoration costs,loss of net commission revenue,lost fees and loss of business income,in the amount of in extra expenses to restore the database,and in business income,losses of productivity,commissions and profits.plaintiff did not claim the replacement or repair cost for any item of hardware or the storage medium.instead,plaintiff limited its claim to the extra labor expenses incurred to recover from loss of the database as well as income lost during the period of recovery.
the policy provisions at issue 
as we will show,the provisions of the insurance policy relied upon by plaintiff do not provide coverage unless a direct physical loss to property covered by the policy has been suffered.the basic building and personal property coverage form bpp form provides coverage for direct physical loss of or damage to covered property at the premises caused by or resulting from any covered cause of loss.a covered cause of loss is defined in the causes of loss special form as risks of direct physical loss unless otherwise excluded or limited.
although plaintiff has not argued the point,we have considered whether the phrase direct physical loss of or damage to covered property should be interpreted to mean that coverage is afforded both for a direct physical loss of covered property and for damage to covered property,whether the damage is physical or nonphysical,direct or indirect.we do not adopt this interpretation,however,because it constitutes a strained and clumsy meaning,not an ordinary and popular meaning.most readers expect the first adjective in a series of nouns or phrases to modify each noun or phrase in the following series unless another adjective appears.for example,if a writer were to say,the orphanage relies on donors in the community to supply the children with used shirts,pants,dresses,and shoes,the reader expects the adjective used to modify each element in the series of nouns,shirts,pants,dresses,and shoes.the reader does not expect the writer to have meant that donors supply used shirts,but supply new articles of the other types of clothing.thus,we construe the words direct physical to modify both loss of and damage to.
even if we were to interpret the language in the bpp form to cover damage as well as physical loss,coverage is triggered only if the loss results from a risk of direct physical loss.the risk encountered in this case was a negligent computer operator,or,perhaps,a defective computer program.unless the harm suffered,the loss of electronically stored data without loss or damage of the storage media,is determined to be a physical loss,we can not say that the risk encountered in this case,a negligent operator,constitutes a risk of direct physical loss.we do not understand that a computer operator,sitting at a keyboard pressing keys or moving a mouse,presents any other relevant type of risk.thus,under either an ordinary or a strained interpretation of the phrase direct physical loss of or damage to covered property,coverage for plaintiff claim under the bpp form depends on whether the loss of electronically stored data,without loss or damage of the storage media,constitutes a direct physical loss.
we reach the same conclusion for each of the other provisions of the policy urged by plaintiff as providing coverage.the coverage form called business income coverage form and extra expense actual loss sustained provides coverage for the actual loss of business income sustained by the insured due to the necessary suspension of the insured operations during the period of restoration.but t he suspension must be caused by direct physical loss of or damage to property at the premises described in the declarations caused by or resulting from any covered cause of loss.the covered cause of loss is again defined in the causes of loss special form as all risks of direct physical loss unless otherwise excluded or limited.thus,although the damage covered,loss of income,is not itself a physical loss,the loss of income must be caused by a physical loss resulting from a risk of physical loss described in the same terms as in the bpp form.
the electronic equipment and software coverage form,which the parties agree was part of the policy,expressly modifies the bpp form.but the provision in the bpp form requiring a direct physical loss of or damage to covered property caused by or resulting from any covered loss is not modified.this form does amend the causes of loss special form,but only to narrow the exclusions.it does not modify or amend the basic requirement that the loss result from a risk of direct physical loss.
the coverage form called valuable papers and records form provides coverage for loss to covered property from any of the risks of direct physical loss except as excluded.the word loss in this coverage form is defined as accidental loss or damage.thus,although the loss covered by this form is not described as a physical loss,the loss is not covered unless it results from a risk of direct physical loss,just like the bpp form.
finally,the coverage form called electronic data processing coverage form provides coverage for loss to e lectronic data processing equipment,d ata processing data and media,and necessary extra expense the insured incur s in continuing the business after a loss to the insured data processing operation,from any covered causes of loss.the covered causes of loss are all risks of direct physical loss except as excluded 
thus,under each of the potentially relevant coverage forms of the insurance policy,the losses claimed by plaintiff are not covered by the policy unless we interpret a physical loss to include the loss of electronically stored data,without any loss or damage to the storage media or to any other property.as discussed below,we do not adopt this interpretation.
plaintiff loss was not a physical loss 
neither party submitted any evidence suggesting that the phrase direct physical loss has some technical meaning or special meaning given by usage.accordingly,we interpret these words in their ordinary and popular sense to determine whether they impart a clear and explicit meaning in the context of the losses claimed against the insurance policy.we conclude they do.
the word physical is defined,inter alia,as having material existence and perceptible esp.through the senses and subject to the laws of nature.collegiate dict.ed.material implies formation out of tangible matter.id.at.tangible means,inter alia,capable of being perceived esp.by the sense of touch.id.at.thus,relying on the ordinary and popular sense of the words,we say with confidence that the loss of plaintiff database does not qualify as a direct physical loss,unless the database has a material existence,formed out of tangible matter,and is perceptible to the sense of touch.
a database is a large collection of data organized esp.for rapid search and retrieval as by a computer.collegiate dict.ed.data is defined,quite simply,as factual or numerical information.ibid.thus,the loss of a database is the loss of organized information,in this case,the loss of client names,addresses,policy renewal dates.
we fail to see how information,qua information,can be said to have a material existence,be formed out of tangible matter,or be perceptible to the sense of touch.to be sure,information is stored in a physical medium,such as a magnetic disc or tape,or even as papers in binders or a file cabinet,but the information itself remains intangible.here,the loss suffered by plaintiff was a loss of information,the sequence of ones and zeroes stored by aligning small domains of magnetic material on the computer hard drive in a machine readable manner plaintiff did not lose the tangible material of the storage medium.rather,plaintiff lost the stored information.the sequence of ones and zeros can be altered,rearranged,or erased,without losing or damaging the tangible material of the storage medium.
we conclude the loss of the database,with its consequent economic loss,but with no loss of or damage to tangible property,was not a direct physical loss of or damage to covered property under the terms of the subject insurance policy,and,therefore,the loss is not covered.although counsel have cited no california cases addressing this issue,nor have we found any,our conclusion is consistent with cases decided on closely related issues.
