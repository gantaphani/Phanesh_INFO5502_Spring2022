introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants ortega rock quarry,jay hubbs,and john schmutz sometimes referred to collectively as ortega appeal from judgment following the trial court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and respondents golden eagle insurance corporation,liberty mutual insurance company,continental casualty company,and valley forge insurance company sometimes referred to collectively as the insurers.ortega made claims against the insurers for a defense and indemnity for an environmental protection agency epa order and corresponding civil lawsuit.the insurers relied on pollution exclusions in the policies to deny coverage,and ortega brought a lawsuit for breach of contract and other claims.the trial court granted summary judgment and summary adjudication in favor of the insurers,and ortega has appealed.ortega contends that the trial court erred in determining that the insurers had no duty to defend ortega because the epa proceedings were not a suit within the scope of the policies the pollution exclusion endorsements in the insurance policies excluded coverage for ortega claims and ortega acts were willful and therefore uninsurable.
ii.facts and procedural background 
underlying facts 
the underlying facts are essentially undisputed.plaintiff and appellant ortega rock quarry operated a rock quarry business in southern orange county hubbs and schmutz were principals of the corporation.defendant golden eagle insurance company,a subsidiary of liberty mutual insurance company collectively referred to as geic,had issued a general commercial liability policy and an excess insurance policy to ortega with policy dates of february to february.ortega was also insured under a general commercial liability policy issued by continental casualty company,provided through its company valley forge insurance company collectively referred to as cna,with policy dates of february to february.
lucas canyon creek,an intermittent water course,runs through the land that ortega rock quarry leased for its business.the lessor of the property was the santa margarita company.in february,el nino storms caused the creek to overflow and wash out an access road on the leased property.to maintain access to the quarry,ortega placed fill dirt from the quarry along the road throughout and.
epa administrative orders 
the environmental protection agency epa issued an administrative order to ortega in february,alleging that ortega placement of fill along the road had resulted in an unauthorized discharge of fill material into lucas canyon creek.the order required ortega to 
immediately cease discharge of fill material into lucas canyon creek except as authorized by permit 
submit an interim erosion control plan and site restoration plan 
submit an interim erosion control plan to curtail erosion of the fill materials into the creek and 
submit a restoration plan detailing the manner in which the impacted areas of the creek would be restored.
the order stated that on numerous days in,ortega had,without a permit,discharged fill material,consisting of dirt and rocks,along the northern embankment of lucas canyon creek,causing substantial portions of the creek to fill.the order alleged a violation of section a of title of the united states code,which makes it unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into any water of the united states without a permit.the order stated that the fill materials,consisting of dirt and rocks,that ortega placed into the creek bed are dredged and fill material,hence pollutants within the meaning of sections a and of the clean water act et.
in response to the order,ortega assisted in the development of a plan that was accepted by the epa in june.in october,the epa issued a second order to ortega directing it to implement and complete,by december,remedial acts outlined in the plan.
civil lawsuit 
in june,the santa margarita company,ortega lessor,filed a civil lawsuit against ortega alleging that ortega had damaged the creek and surrounding property.the lawsuit sought damages and a judicial determination that ortega owed the santa margarita company indemnity for any property damage that was subject to the clean water act.
policy provisions 
the insurers had issued general liability and excess coverage policies to ortega.
definition of suit 
both the geic and cna policies defined suit as follows suit means a civil proceeding in which damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes a.an arbitration proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured must submit or does submit with our consent or any other alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured submits with our consent.
pollution exclusion endorsements 
the geic policy contained a pollution exclusion endorsement that excluded from coverage 
bodily injury,property damage,or personal injury which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual,alleged or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release or escape of pollutants at any time.
any loss,cost or expense arising out of any 
request,demand or order that any insured or others test for,monitor,clean up,remove,contain,treat,detoxify,or neutralize,or in any way respond to,or assess the effects of pollutants or 
claim or suit by or on behalf of any authority for damages because of testing for,monitoring,cleaning up,removing,containing,treating,detoxifying or neutralizing,or in any way responding to,or assessing the effects of pollutants or 
payment related to the investigation or defense for any loss,injury or damage,or any cost,fine or penalty,or for any expense or claim or suit related to and and above.the cna policy included a substantially similar pollution exclusion endorsement.
under both the geic and cna policies,pollutants were defined as any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes materials to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
ortega submission of claims to insurers 
ortega submitted claims to the insurers to defend it in the epa administrative proceedings and in the civil lawsuit.the insurers summarily denied both claims,contending that coverage was barred under the pollution exclusions in the policies.the insurers also asserted that dirt and rocks were pollutants within the policy definitions and were thus subject to the pollution exclusion.
ortega lawsuit 
ortega filed suit against the insurers for breach of the insurance contracts and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for a declaration that its claims were covered under the insurance policies.
cna filed a motion for summary judgment summary adjudication.geic filed a motion for summary adjudication as to issues of duty and damages.
following additional briefing and a hearing,the trial court granted summary adjudication in favor of geic and summary judgment in favor of cna.the court held that the policy language did not trigger a duty to defend an epa action.the court further held that the pollution exclusions in the policies excluded coverage for ortega claims.finally,the court held that ortega acts were willful and therefore uninsurable.judgment was entered in favor of cna,and geic stipulated to judgment with the proviso that the stipulated judgment did not waive ortega right to appeal and that appeals against all the insurers could proceed together.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court applies a de novo standard of review to an appeal based on the granting of summary judgment when,as here,the underlying facts are undisputed and the sole issues involve interpretation or application of the terms of an insurance policy.county of san diego ace property casualty ins.cal th,d.in conducting our review,we apply settled rules governing the interpretation of an insurance policy 
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citations.the fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties.citation.such intent is to be inferred,if possible,solely from the written provisions of the contract.citation.if contractual language is clear and explicit,it governs.citation.citation.

determination that epa orders were not suits 
the trial court held that the insurers had no duty to defend because the epa administrative proceedings were not suits within the meaning of the policies.when the epa believes that an individual or entity has violated the clean water act,the epa may issue an administrative order to the alleged offender setting forth the epa claims.if the offender identified in the order does not comply with the epa demands,the epa may file a civil lawsuit in federal district court.
our supreme court has held that such administrative proceedings are not suits,national union fire ins.cal th,d,and that costs a company is required to pay as a result of such proceedings are not damages within the meaning of insurance policies certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,powerine.
in,the supreme court held that the defendant insurers had no duty to defend the plaintiff insured in proceedings originating from a determination and order from a department of the california environmental protection agency because those proceedings were not a suit.the policies at issue required the insurers to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of bodily injury or property damage,and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit,supra,cal th at,d.the court held that the use of the word suit in the policies meant a civil action commenced by the filing of a complaint.id.at,d.thus,the court held,the department order issued before the filing of a complaint did not initiate a suit within the meaning of the policies,and the insurers had no duty to defend.id.at,d.
later,in powerine,the supreme court expanded upon its holding in and held that the insurer duty to indemnify the insured for all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages is limited to money ordered by a court.powerine,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the court rejected the argument of insureds that they were entitled to indemnity under a standard comprehensive general liability policy for costs incurred in complying with orders issued during administrative environmental proceedings because the administratively imposed liabilities did not constitute money ordered by a court.id.at,d.
in powerine,the policy period in question was from to.the court noted that the standard comprehensive general liability policy was developed in and had evolved over the years.in,the standard cgl policies defined a suit as a civil proceeding,but the policy before the court did not contain any definition of suit.the court also noted that administrative proceedings such as those instituted by the epa and state environmental agencies were not in existence at the time the powerine policy was drafted and finally,the policy references to suit and damages indicated that damages were necessarily adjudged in a civil judicial proceeding.powerine,supra,cal th at,d.the court therefore held that indemnity coverage applied only to damages from a civil suit.id.at,d.
the court noted,however,that its holding applied to the policy under consideration.the court stated,the syllogism here is not predicated on any assumption that the absence of a duty to defend necessarily entails the absence of a duty to indemnify under some possible policy of comprehensive general liability insurance.it is predicated,instead,on the fact that the absence of a duty to defend actually entails the absence of a duty to indemnify under this individual policy of comprehensive general liability insurance.powerine,supra,cal th at,d,original italics.
ortega argues that and powerine are distinguishable because in that case,the policies at issue did not contain a definition of the word suit.see,supra,cal th at,d,powerine,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,the courts were required to make an independent determination of the term based on common usage.
in contrast,in the present case,the policies did contain a definition of the word suit that included alternative dispute resolution.specifically,the policies issued to ortega defined a suit as a civil proceeding in which damages because of property damage,to which this insurance applies are alleged.suit includes a.an arbitration proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured must submit or does submit with our consent or any other alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which the insured submits with our consent.ortega contends that the general negotiations and exchange of letters between it and the epa were a form of alternative dispute resolution within the coverage of the policies.
however,even if we were to accept ortega interpretation of the policies,ortega has not cited any evidence that it requested or obtained the insurers consent to submit to such proceedings.the policies definition of alternative dispute resolution proceedings unambiguously covers only such proceedings to which the insured submits with the insurer consent.thus,even accepting for purposes of argument that an epa administrative proceeding might be a form of alternative dispute resolution,ortega has not established that the epa administrative proceeding was a suit within the meaning of the policies.thus,the trial court did not err in determining that the insurers had no duty to defend ortega in the epa proceedings.
our conclusion,however,does not extend to the insurers duty to defend in the civil lawsuit filed by santa margarita.the trial court order was silent on that issue.thus,we turn to the trial court next conclusion,that ortega activities were excluded from coverage under the total pollution exclusions in the policies.
application of the total pollution exclusion 
the trial court also held that the total pollution exclusions in the policies precluded coverage for ortega activities in placing dirt and rocks in the creek bed.ortega raises several related challenges to this holding.first,ortega argues that the total pollution exclusion was ambiguous because it failed to adopt the definition of pollutants set forth in the clean water act or to unambiguously exclude coverage for any proceeding under state and federal statutes under any definition of pollutant identified in those statutes.second,ortega challenges the trial court reasoning that the fact that dirt and rocks occurred in nature did not mean they were not contaminants when dumped in a waterway.finally,ortega argues that under the doctrine of ejusdem generis,the use of the term including preceding a list of examples in the policies definition of pollutants means that all pollutants must be of the same general class as the listed examples.thus,ortega contends,this doctrine suggests that the only irritants or contaminants that are excluded from coverage are those that are enumerated after the word including,smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.ortega argues that the language of the pollution exclusion was thus ambiguous,and under established principles,any ambiguity must be construed in favor of the insured.
failure to incorporate statutory definitions of pollution 
the clean water act defines pollutants as dredged spoil,solid waste,incinerator residue,sewage,garbage,sewage sludge,munitions,chemical wastes,biological materials,radioactive materials,heat,wrecked or discarded equipment,rock,sand,cellar dirt and industrial,municipal,and agricultural waste discharged into water.ortega contends the total pollution exclusion was ambiguous because it failed to adopt the definition of pollutants as set forth in the clean water act or to provide that coverage was excluded for any proceeding under state or federal statutes under any statutory definition of pollutants.ortega notes that the golden eagle excess policy specifically excluded coverage for which the insured may be held liable under the united states longshoremen and harbor workers act and the jones act,and the policy could have stated an exclusion with the same clarity for claims arising under the clean water act.
we conclude,however,that state and federal environmental laws may provide insight into the scope of the policies definition of pollutants without being specifically incorporated in those definitions.see,garamendi golden eagle ins.th,d garamendi referring to,which identifies silica dust as an air contaminant in denying coverage for workers injuries see also mackinnon truck ins.exchange cal th,d,mackinnon stating that the pollution exclusion was adopted to address the enormous potential liability resulting from antipollution laws enacted between and.thus,the fact that the policies do not specifically incorporate statutory definitions does not make the language of the pollution exclusion ambiguous.
application of pollution exclusion to natural materials 
ortega next challenges the trial court statement that the fact that dirt and rocks occur in nature does not mean that they are not contaminants when dumped in a waterway,contending that this statement is overbroad and unreasonable.
however,natural dirt and rocks are pollutants within the meaning of the clean water act when placed in waters of the united states in violation of the clean water act.see gold fields am.aetna cas.sur,stating that the hazardous substances are not rendered by the fact that they are naturally occurring citation,since,in this case,the hazardous material is not found in its unaltered form because mining,an unnatural process,has altered its location see also space farm family mut.ins,natural organic fertilizer may be a pollutant within the meaning of a pollution exclusion when it leaches into ground water or contaminates water sources.thus,the trial court statement was not erroneous in the circumstances of the present case.
doctrine of ejusdem generis 
ortega argues that under the doctrine of ejusdem generis,the use of the term including preceding the list of examples in the total pollution exclusion means that all pollutants must be of the same general class as the listed examples.thus,ortega contends,the only irritants or contaminants that are excluded from coverage are those that are enumerated after the word including,smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.
under the principle of ejusdem generis,p articular expressions qualify those which are general.in an insurance policy,specific provisions rather than general provisions govern the insurance contract relating to a particular subject,even though the general provision,standing alone,would be broad enough to include the subject to which the more specific provision relates.furtado metropolitan life ins.d.
we first observe that the term including preceding a list of examples is not always used as a term of limitation.see,people ex rel.san francisco bay conservation.com.smith th,d we also agree with the attorney general observation that to use the doctrine of ejusdem generis as a limitation on the term structure as used in,rather than an illustration of expansive reach,arguably cramps the overall context of language defining fill as earth or any other substance or material,including structures floating and moored for extended periods,such as houseboats and floating docks citation.
t he word including in a statute is ordinarily a term of enlargement rather than limitation.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d,see people western air lines,cal d,the statutory definition of a thing as including certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.
we next note that courts in california and other jurisdictions have found no ambiguity in the language of total pollution exclusions identical or substantially similar to that in the policies we are presently considering.in garamendi,supra,th,d,an insurer refused the tender of defense by its insured on claims based on workers inhalation of silica dust arising from the insureds sandblasting operations.the insurer argued that the total pollution exclusion endorsement in the policy in language identical to that in the present case precluded coverage for the claims.the trial court agreed,and the appellate court affirmed.id.at,d.
the foundation for the court opinion in garamendi was the supreme court recent treatment of the interpretation of a total pollution exclusion in mackinnon,supra,cal th,d.in mackinnon,the court considered the meaning of an exclusionary clause in a comprehensive general liability policy that excluded injuries caused by the discharge,dispersal,release or escape of pollutants.specifically,the court was asked to determine whether that clause applied to exclude injury to a tenant resulting from the landlord use of pesticides on his property.the court concluded that the clause did not apply.id.at,d.
in doing so,the court noted that the passage of environmental laws over the past several decades had been the motivation for insurers to amend the pollution exclusion from qualified to absolute.the court stated,c ommentators have pointed as well to the passage of cercla in and the attendant expansion of liability for remediating hazardous wastes citation as motivation for amending the exclusion.t he available evidence most strongly suggests that the absolute pollution exclusion was designed to serve the twin purposes of eliminating coverage for gradual environmental degradation and cleanup such as superfund response cost reimbursement.mackinnon,supra,cal th at,d.the court limited the scope of the pollution exclusion to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution id.at,d.
the garamendi court stated its interpretation of mackinnon as follows 
in mackinnon,our supreme court considered at length the derivation and interpretation of a pollution exclusion provision that defined pollution in essentially the same language as contained in claimant golden eagle policy.recognizing that the policy definition of a pollutant as including any irritant or contaminant,read literally,leads to absurd results and ignores the familiar connotations of the words used in the exclusion,the court felt it far more reasonable that a policyholder would understand a pollutant as being limited to irritants and contaminants commonly thought of as pollution and not as applying to every possible irritant or contaminant imaginable.citation.the court therefore limited the scope of the pollution exclusion to injuries arising from events commonly thought of as pollution,environmental pollution.citation.
applying this standard,the court in mackinnon held that a landlord allegedly negligent use of a pesticide by spraying to eradicate yellow jackets around its apartment building did not come within the scope of the pollution exclusion because such activity would not comport with the common understanding of the word pollute.citation.garamendi,supra,th at,d.
paralleling the argument ortega raises in the present case,the insured in garamendi argued that silica was not a pollutant within the meaning of the policy definition because it was not smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals or waste,and it was found in many commonplace materials such as sand,glass,concrete,and computer chips.garamendi,supra,th at,d.the court rejected this argument,explaining,but even if silica is not one of the enumerated items listed in the policy definition of pollutants,that listing is not exclusive and silica dust nonetheless comes within the broad definition of any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant.id.at,d,italics added.thus,the court impliedly rejected the application of the ejusdem generis doctrine to the definition of pollution within the total pollution exclusion.
courts in other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions.in.mut.cas.ins.triangle paving.triangle paving,the court held that sedimentation from runoff at a construction site was a pollutant within the meaning of the pollution exclusion in insurance policies.the pollution exclusion in those policies was substantially similar to those we consider in the present case.id.at.
during construction activity,the defendant dislodged sediment that escaped from the construction site and contaminated downstream water sources on private property.the city where the construction was taking place issued notices of violation and directed the defendant to correct the problem,and the owner of water sources contaminated by the sediment complained to the defendant.the defendant insurer settled the property owners claims and then filed suit against the defendant seeking reimbursement.the defendant requested the plaintiff to defend and indemnify against the claim,and the plaintiff brought an action for a declaratory judgment to determine whether the underlying activity fell within the pollution exclusion.triangle paving,supra.at.
the plaintiff insurer argued that the inclusion of the explanatory term solid contaminant in the definition of pollutant encompasses the act of sedimentation,and that sedimentation contamination fell squarely within the plain language of the pollution exclusion.in contrast,the defendant insured argued that the enumerated list in the definition serves to limit pollutants to the specified examples.thus,the defendant argued,the court should restrict the definition to smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals or waste and possibly other related industrial or materials.triangle paving,supra.at.
the court noted that under north carolina law as under california law,any ambiguities in an insurance contract must be construed in favor of the insured.triangle paving,supra.at.the court concluded,however,that the definition of pollutants was not ambiguous.the court explained that defendant disregards the controlling term that precedes the list of examples.the definition clearly states that pollutants shall consist of any solid,liquid,gaseous,or thermal irritant or contaminant including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals and waste emphasis added.in context,the term including clearly signifies that the ensuing list is not one of limitation.ibid.
the defendant also argued that references to statutes or local ordinances were unrelated to the scope of the term pollutant as used in the insurance policies.the court rejected this argument,explaining,again,the standard in this case is how a reasonable person in the position of the insured would interpret the contract.the court does not interpret policy provisions in a vacuum but,instead,must give the common meaning to disputed terms.a review of the extensive state and local commentary on the topic helps to supply the common meaning or understanding.triangle paving,supra.at.
the court concluded,in a case such as this,where an insurer seeks to trigger a coverage exemption with respect to a matter of first impression,the court is cautious of relieving the insurer of duties for which the insured may have already paid.notwithstanding,the particular facts giving rise to this dispute persuade that,even under close scrutiny,the pollution exclusion is applicable.the plain language of the policy in conjunction with the regulatory backdrop compels a finding for plaintiff.defendant has failed to offer any concrete evidence rebutting plaintiff representations about the common categorization of sedimentation.without contrary evidence,when the north carolina legislature has spoken with such unequivocal clarity,the court must follow its guidance.because no genuine issue of material fact exists,summary judgment is appropriate.triangle paving,supra.at.the court therefore held that the term pollutant as it is used in plaintiff insurance policies includes sedimentation and,thus,plaintiff is under no obligation to defend or indemnify defendant for claims arising from sedimentation caused during the construction project,and the court granted the plaintiff motion for summary judgment.id.at.
other courts,considering the language of the total pollution exclusion under facts analogous to those before us,have likewise interpreted the total pollution exclusion in the same manner as the court in triangle paving.see monarch greenback,llc monticello ins.d,fn.holding that mine tailings consisting of sand,silt,clay,and trace metals were pollutants within the meaning of an insurance policy pollution exclusion substantially similar to that at issue in the present case and that the pollution exclusion was not ambiguous clarendon america ins.bay,d,holding that sand and gravel,among other substances,were pollutants within the meaning of an insurance policy pollution exclusion substantially similar to that at issue in the present case,and that the pollution exclusion was not ambiguous guilford industries,liberty mut.ins,affd.cir the total pollution exclusion defines pollutant quite clearly as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant and then gives examples.the doctrine of ejusdem generis does not apply when the context demonstrates a contrary intention,citation,and the intention that damages caused by discharged of any irritant or contaminant be excluded is manifest landshire fast foods of milwaukee,employers mut.cas,holding that the total pollution exclusion precluded coverage for bacterial contamination and rejecting the use of the ejusdem generis doctrine to limit the definition of pollution.
in one unpublished federal case,however,on which ortega relies,the court reached an opposite conclusion.tsakopoulos american manufacturers mut.ins.wl tsakopoulos in tsakopoulos,the plaintiff insured sued his insurers for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on the insurers declining to defend him in litigation with the epa or to indemnify him for a portion of the judgment entered in that litigation,at.between and,the plaintiff had caused extensive plowing to be done at his ranch to convert the land for use as vineyards.in,he initiated a federal civil action against the epa and others seeking a declaratory judgment that he was not required to obtain permits under the clean water act to engage in plowing activities at the ranch.the epa asserted a counterclaim alleging that his prior plowing operations had violated the clean water act by causing dredged or fill material to be discharged into waters of the united states.specifically,the epa alleged that the soil discharged into jurisdictional waters as a result of tsakopoulos plowing constituted a pollutant within
