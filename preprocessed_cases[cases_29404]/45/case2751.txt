under code of civil procedure section certain victims of the northridge earthquake whose insurance claims would otherwise have been barred by the limitations period in insurance code section received an additional period from january,to december,in which to file a claim or commence an action on the policy.the issue before us is whether,with the expiration of this additional period,the filing window is now permanently closed to all victims of the northridge quake or whether insurers may be equitably estopped from asserting the bar of the limitations period.
we hold the legislature did not supplant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel when it enacted section.
facts and proceedings below 
the following facts are undisputed.
at the time of the northridge earthquake,january,charlotte cordova had a homeowners policy with century insurance company that included earthquake coverage.shortly after the quake cordova submitted a claim of loss based on damage to block walls,cracks throughout her house and damage to personal property.in march,century determined cordova dwelling and personal property losses were less than the applicable deductibles but sent her a check for under her other structures coverage.in june cordova asked the company to reevaluate her claim.in august,following a reinspection of the property,century paid cordova an additional.in november cordova wrote to century stating she understood she could have her home inspected by a structural engineer at the insurance company expense.later the same month century responded to cordova letter advising her if the contractor making the repairs on her property suggested an inspection by a structural engineer the company would employ such a person to conduct the inspection.
there were no further communications between cordova and century regarding her earthquake claim until nearly eight years later when,in august,an attorney representing cordova wrote to the company and requested an adjuster contact him regarding her claim.a representative of century wrote back pointing out the period for filing a claim or initiating litigation arising out of the northridge quake had long since expired.cordova attorney responded he was requesting her claim be reopened under authority of the california supreme court decision in vu prudential property casualty ins.the record does not reflect any further communications between cordova or her counsel and century.
cordova filed suit against century in september.she alleged century unreasonably and unjustifiably failed to conduct a thorough investigation of her earthquake loss she was misinformed as to the extent of the damage to her property and the special statutory period for filing suit against century for losses sustained in the northridge earthquake had expired before she realized the true extent of her damage.
century moved for summary judgment on the ground there is no merit to this action since plaintiff did not timely pursue her claims and is barred by the provisions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.in support of its motion century submitted a separate statement of undisputed facts setting forth the facts discussed above.the points and authorities accompanying the motion argued cordova did not file this action until nine months after the expiration of the limitations period in section and therefore the instant complaint is barred by the limitations provisions of section,subdivision b and judgment should be entered in century favor.anticipating cordova would attempt to make an equitable estoppel argument under vu,century also argued section cut off any such equitable relief.
in response,cordova admitted she filed this lawsuit after the period in section had expired.she argued,however,the doctrine of equitable estoppel barred century from raising a statute of limitations defense based on section and nothing in that statute extinguished her equitable remedy.
the trial court granted century motion for summary judgment on two grounds.the court concluded section was the exclusive means for pursuing a previously claim against an insurer arising from the northridge earthquake and therefore cordova could not rely on the doctrine of equitable estoppel to avoid the limitations period in insurance code section.the court further held even if theoretically the doctrine of equitable estoppel could apply to northridge claims cordova failed to submit any evidence showing the doctrine applied in her case.
the court granted judgment to century and cordova filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
section does not preclude victims of the northridge earthquake from obtaining equitable relief from the statutory limitation period of insurance code section.
a.the statutory language.
insurance code section.
insurance code section states in relevant part no suit or action on a policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless commenced within months next after inception of the loss.
in vu prudential property casualty.our supreme court held if an insured fails to bring a lawsuit against the insurer within the statutory period because he reasonably relied on the insurer incorrect factual representations regarding the loss the insurer would be equitably estopped from raising the statute of limitations as a defense 
while vu was pending in the supreme court the legislature enacted section 
section,subdivision a states a notwithstanding any other provision of law or contract,any insurance claim for damages arising out of the northridge earthquake of which is barred as of the effective date of this section,january,solely because the applicable statute of limitations has or had expired is hereby revived and a cause of action thereon may be commenced provided that the action is commenced within one year of the effective date of this section,by january.this subdivision shall only apply to cases in which an insured contacted an insurer or an insurers representative prior to january,regarding potential northridge earthquake damage.
subdivision c of section provides nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section.
in determining the meaning of section we begin with its language because if the language is clear there is no need to look further 
both parties find language in the statute which supports their positions.
arguing section does not supplant the doctrine of equitable estoppel cordova points out there is nothing in the statute which specifically and expressly states the legal remedy it affords supersedes any equitable remedy.the absence of such a statement is significant,she argues,because the legislature has shown if it wants to bar plaintiffs from asserting equitable relief from statutes of limitation it knows how to say so.for example,section,subdivision a provides a limitation period for suing on causes of action which exist against a decedent at the time of death.subdivision b of the statute states the limitations period provided in this section for commencement of an action shall not be tolled or extended for any reason except as provided in the statute.italics added.in battuello battuello the court held that although the plain language of subdivision b precluded a plaintiff from relying on the doctrine of equitable tolling it did not prevent the court from applying the principles of equitable estoppel 
the doctrines of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are distinct,battuello explained,each arising under different circumstances,and having different rationales and different predicates equitable estoppel does not extend the statute of limitations but rather comes into play only after the limitations period has run and addresses itself to the circumstances in which a party will be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to an admittedly untimely action because his conduct has induced another into forbearing suit within the applicable limitations period.unlike the doctrine of equitable tolling,which takes its life from the statute of limitations itself,the doctrine of equitable estoppel takes its life from the equitable principle that no man will be permitted to profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.thus,the court found,while the language of the statute clearly showed the legislature intended the limitation period not be tolled or extended,the statute said nothing about equitable estoppel.in the absence of such language,or legislative history suggesting that was what the legislature intended we conclude the doctrine still applies.battuello was quoted with approval by our supreme court in lantzy centex 
in lantzy the court considered the interplay between statutes of limitation applicable to suits for latent construction defects.prior to suits to recover for construction defects were generally subject to limitation periods of three or four years depending on the theory of recovery these periods were extended,often significantly,by court decisions holding the statutes of limitations did not begin to run until the defects were or should have been discovered and the plaintiff time to sue was tolled while promises or attempts to repair were pending in response to contractors assertions this perpetual and never ending risk was imperiling the state construction industry the legislature enacted section section imposed an absolute requirement that a suit to recover damages for a latent construction defect be brought within years of the date of substantial completion of construction,regardless of the date of discovery of the defect.
the issue in lantzy was whether the absolute limitations period of section was subject to the doctrines of equitable tolling and equitable estoppel in an action filed years and nine months after substantial completion of the plaintiffs homes.the court acknowledged section did not specifically mention equitable tolling or equitable estoppel.nevertheless the court found applying the doctrine of equitable tolling to the statutory limitations period would contravene the legislative purpose of providing repose to potential defendants after the already lengthy period during which they were exposed to suit.the court further held,however,this same legislative purpose would not be contravened by allowing the plaintiffs to plead the doctrine of equitable estoppel in response to defendant statute of limitations defense 
other than noting equitable tolling and equitable estoppel are distinct doctrines lantzy did not explain why the latter should not suffer the same fate as the former under section.the explanation may lie in the court statement that to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel is to invoke the venerable principle that o ne can not justly or equitably lull his adversary into a false sense of security,and thereby cause his adversary to subject his claim to the bar of the statute of limitations,and then be permitted to plead the very delay caused by his course of conduct as a defense to the action when brought.citation.in other words the court may have based its distinction on a preference for a system of law based on justice and morality over one based on the commercial interests of any particular class.
cordova interpretation of the statute as not barring claims of equitable estoppel is also supported by the legislature language in subdivision c of the statute which provides the statute shall not be construed to alter the applicable limitations period of an action that is not time barred as of the effective date of this section.this language can certainly be construed as a recognition on the part of the legislature actions can be filed after january,if the defendant is equitably estopped from asserting a limitations defense.under this reading of the statute the claim,and the action based on the claim,is only if there is a valid defense under the limitations period.if such a defense can not properly be asserted because of the doctrine of equitable estoppel then the action is not and subdivision a does not apply.it is difficult to imagine any homeowner who suffered a loss in the january quake who could not have reasonably concluded her property had suffered a loss more than one year prior to the effective date of section.accordingly it is difficult to imagine a purpose for subdivision c other than to say,in effect,if you could have sued your insurer without the benefit of this statute nothing in this statute limits your right to do so.
century counters cordova argument that if the legislature had intended section to bar claims of equitable estoppel it would have said so with the argument if the legislature had not intended section to bar claims of equitable estoppel it would have said so.century notes for example another statute prescribing a limitations period,former section,subdivision l,stated nothing in the statute shall be construed to preclude the courts from applying equitable exceptions to the running of the applicable statutes of limitations,including exceptions relating to delayed discovery of injuries,with respect to actions commenced prior to january.the absence of such a savings clause,century argues,demonstrates section was intended to be the policyholders exclusive remedy for claims.
in addition century points out neither lantzy nor battuello held a statute must expressly exclude equitable remedies for them not to apply.on the contrary both cases recognized an intent to preclude equitable remedies can be found in the statute legislative history in this case,century maintains,the legislative history supports its interpretation of the statute 
finally,century argues the legislature intent to preclude further reliance on equitable estoppel after the enactment of section can be inferred from the statute broad and detailed scheme encompassing all the claims which could otherwise properly have been asserted under equitable estoppel century relies on another venerable principle equitable remedies do not apply when an adequate remedy exists at law 
the broad and detailed scheme rationale was applied to bar a defendant assertion of equitable estoppel in las tunas beach geologic hazard abatement dist.superior court hereafter las tunas.the city of malibu adopted a resolution forming a geologic hazard abatement district ghad.the resolution contained various conditions including one which permitted the city to dissolve the ghad if it found the ghad abatement plan was not feasible or would not serve the purposes of state law.but when the city attempted to dissolve the ghad on the basis of the conditions it had agreed to,the ghad objected and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent its dissolution.the ghad argued it could be dissolved only in accordance with the comprehensive procedures set forth in government code section et seq uitur.the trial court denied relief on the ground the ghad had convinced the city council at the time of its formation it would abide by the dissolution conditions in the formation resolution and therefore it was equitably estopped from asserting those conditions are invalid the court of appeal reversed.it found dissolution of ghad is governed by the extensive process set forth in government code section et.in view of the detailed statutory scheme pertaining to the formation and dissolution of a ghad,we reiterate,the legislature has occupied the field so as to bar any nonstatutory change of organization.therefore,the court held,the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme bars the city from invoking the equitable doctrine of estoppel to achieve dissolution of the ghad.
cordova and century each make cogent arguments as to the meaning of section.we conclude,however,the statutory language and the case authority favor cordova interpretation for the reasons discussed above.century argument that equitable remedies do not apply when an adequate remedy exists at law,although correct as a general principle,begs the question whether a limited revival statute such as section is so comprehensive as to preclude resort to the equitable remedy of estoppel 
to the extent there is any ambiguity in section,moreover,reference to the legislative history confirms our interpretation it was not intended to bar an insured from meeting a limitations defense with the well recognized doctrine of equitable estoppel.
b.the legislative history.
it is undisputed the january northridge earthquake resulted in billions of dollars in property damage,thereby exposing insurance companies to significant liability.
many of the claims for earthquake damage were settled to the policyholders satisfaction but many were not.claims which were not satisfactorily settled generally fell into two categories.in some cases the insurance companies adjusters misrepresented to the insureds their damage did not exceed their policy deductible.in other cases the insurance companies adjusters found the damage exceeded the policy deductibles but misrepresented the true extent of the damage caused by the quake.
policyholders whose claims were denied or often did not learn the true extent of their damage until more than a year after the earthquake.when they attempted to have their insurance company reopen their claims or sued for breach of their insurance contracts the insurers threw up the bar of the limitations period in insurance code section.the policyholders responded with various arguments as to why their claims were not barred by the statute of limitations,including the argument the insurers were equitably estopped from asserting the limitations period because it was their own factual representations which had led the policyholders not to further pursue their claims within the period.
the policyholders equitable estoppel arguments met with mixed results.
the argument succeeded in ward allstate ins.there the wards made an initial claim for earthquake damage within the statutory period.allstate adjustor inspected the damage and determined the loss to be.after applying the policy deductible allstate paid the wards approximately on their claim.in late the wards learned their home had suffered greater damage than allstate adjuster had led them to believe.they estimated this damage,including damage to the foundation,to be in the sum of approximately.the wards reported this newly discovered damage to allstate,which responded there is no coverage for your earthquake claim.the wards then brought an action against allstate for breach of contract and various torts.allstate moved for summary judgment on the ground the action was barred by the limitations provision.the court rejected this contention in part because,depending on facts yet to be developed,the doctrine of equitable estoppel would still allow this case to proceed.allstate,the court concluded,can not be allowed to lull the plaintiffs into sleeping on their rights,and then use the limitations period as a sword to cut down their claims.
the policyholder equitable estoppel claim was rejected by the federal district court in the first vu decision hereafter vu i the facts in vu were similar to those in ward.prudential adjuster told vu the damage to his home from the earthquake was only,an amount significantly below vu deductible.vu took no further action on his claim until august,when he discovered substantial additional earthquake damage to his property of approximately vu promptly informed prudential of this newly discovered damage and requested coverage.prudential denied vu request on the ground the limitation period had expired.vu filed suit against prudential in federal district court.he alleged prudential was estopped from invoking the limitations period because his failure to bring an action within one year was the direct result of his reasonable reliance on prudential january inspection and its representation the damage to his property fell below his policy deductible.the district court rejected vu argument and granted prudential motion for summary judgment 
upon vu appeal,the ninth circuit certified to the california supreme court the question whether insurance code section bars a claim brought by the insured more than one year after the damage was sustained but within one year of discovery of additional damage when the insured initially presented a timely claim to the insurer and the insurer agent inspects the property but does not discover the full extent of the covered damage 
in,while vu was pending in the courts,the california legislature took steps to bring needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake by enacting section 
the legislative record shows section was enacted in response to reports of rampant mishandling of insurance claims by insurers.the author of the legislation claimed following the devastation caused by the northridge quake many victims were devastated a second time when their insurance companies denied or their claims for compensation.and w hen homeowners complained to the department of insurance to obtain relief,the department afforded no help.the legislature received reports insurers engaged in a systematic program of misleading consumers about the nature and extent of damage to their homes and,when the deceived homeowners learned the true extent of their damage,the insurers simply refused to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.the legislation author was quoted as stating the statute of limitations that is current law under insurance code section has barred victims from being fairly compensated for their losses because they were misled about the extent of damage done as a result of the earthquake.a senate analysis of the legislation cited news accounts stating m any victims have received only partial settlements for their earthquake claims,and others have received no compensation at all,having been improperly told that the damage they suffered was below policy deductibles.in subsequent years,when the victims tried to present newly discovered evidence of damage to their insurers,insurers stonewalled claims,leaving homes,condominiums,and apartment buildings in shambles and homeowners without any recourse.
undisputedly,the intent of section was to provide such recourse 
in reviewing the legislative record of section we found its proponents and opponents were in agreement the effect of the legislation would be to grant certain insureds a new period in which to file claims or lawsuits for damage they believed was caused by the northridge quake.we did not find,however,any discussion of whether the doctrine of equitable estoppel might provide an alternative means for reopening claims which would otherwise be.nor did any of the statute supporters argue the legislation was necessary because claimants had been unable to use the doctrine of equitable estoppel to avoid having their claims barred by the limitations period in insurance code.if the legislature was aware of the controversy in the federal courts over the availability of equitable estoppel to victims of the northridge earthquake or of the pendency of the vu case in the california supreme court that knowledge is not reflected in the legislative history of section.
there is,however,evidence the legislature was aware of allegations of insurance company misconduct which,if established,could form the basis for a claim of equitable estoppel.this evidence consisted of reports insurers systematically misled policyholders about the nature and extent of the damage to their homes and improperly told them the damages they suffered was below their policy deductibles.
again,both parties contend the legislative history of section supports their position.
cordova maintains it is clear from the statute legislative history section was intended to benefit the victims of the northridge earthquake,not their insurance companies.it defies logic,she argues,to believe the lawmakers who enacted section to protect the earthquake victims intended the statute to be used against those victims by the very parties whose wrongdoing spurred its enactment.
furthermore,cordova argues,there is nothing illogical or inconsistent in affording a clear and definitive statutory exception to the statutory limitations period to those insureds who discovered the true extent of their damage between january and january while at the same time preserving the common law remedy of equitable estoppel for those few remaining earthquake victims who did not discover the true extent of their damage until after january if they can show they reasonably relied on their insurers initial misrepresentations as to their damage.there is some support for this argument in vu iv in which the ninth circuit observed with respect to vu equitable estoppel claim section may provide an alternative ground for deciding this case.
century counters with the following arguments.
although the text and legislative history of section do not expressly address equitable estoppel it is logical to assume the members and staff of the committees drafting the legislation were aware courts had rendered conflicting decisions about the availability of equitable estoppel in cases arising under insurance code section and the issue was pending in the california supreme court,and that they decided not to wait for the eventual outcome of the supreme court rather slow process which was by no means guaranteed to favor the insureds instead the legislature decided to the judicial process and deal with the issue directly through legislation.but even if the legislature was not aware of the recent litigation activity the result was the legislature decided for political reasons it,not the courts,would be the governmental institution which would get credit for bringing needed relief to the victims of the northridge earthquake.being a political institution,and facing strong opposition to such relief from the insurance industry,the legislature crafted a special form of relief available only for a limited time to a limited class of persons under specified circumstances in doing so it balanced the perceived need to provide a remedy to earthquake victims who had been unfairly treated by their insurance companies with the need to protect insurance companies from limitless exposure to liability on stale claims which would become more and more difficult to prove as the years went by.thus,century argues,it is only logical to conclude the legislature felt that,eight years after the northridge earthquake,enough is enough 
again,both sides have presented cogent arguments as to what the legislative history of section shows or does not show.
there is a certain appeal to cordova argument the legislature would not have taken the sword of insurance code section out of the insurers hands only to replace it with a canon in the form of section.and she is correct in pointing out there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate the legislature thought it would be inconsistent to allow section and equitable estoppel to operate as alternative remedies for earthquake victims whose original claims were not fairly settled.
on the other hand,as century points out,the legislature is a political animal and it is not unusual for it to enact statutes which embody a compromise between opposing organizations representing policyholders and organizations representing insurance companies.this would not be the first time the legislature replaced a equitable remedy with an exclusive legal remedy the suggestion in vu iv section and equitable estoppel might serve as alternative remedies was obiter dictum because it came from the parties,not the court 
we are not persuaded by century argument the legislature was responding to the insurers concern about being faced with stale claims which would be difficult to prove.this would be a problem for both the insured and the insurer but a greater problem for the insured because it is she who ultimately carries the burden of proving her claim.
century theory the legislature was attempting to reach a compromise between competing constituents is more plausible.according to this theory the lawmakers gave policyholders a statute which revived the limitations period on their claims,thereby obviating the need for them to satisfy the rigorous requirements of equitable estoppel,and gave insurance companies a definite time period after which they were assured they could no longer be exposed to liability on a claim.it could have happened that way,yet this does not mean it did happen that way or even that this is the most likely way it happened.
clearly the legislature intended to put a lid on the statutory revival of claims but neither we nor century has found one sentence in the legislative history suggesting this lid was intended to exclude equitable remedies for those who for some legitimate reason could not bring their claims within this period.
indeed it is the legislature expressive silence which most convinces us it did not intend section to supplant the doctrine of equitable estoppel with respect to claims for damages arising from the northridge quake.
equitable estoppel as we know it today originated in english courts of equity when the common law courts were too rigid in their reasoning to grant relief from grave injustices it is based on the fundamental principle no man may profit from his own wrongdoing in a court of justice.citation.and has been part of california legal tradition almost since statehood in fact the doctrine of equitable estoppel is so engrained in american law it is arguably part of the concept of fundamental fairness embodied in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and article,section of our state constitution 
surely the members and staff of the committees which considered senate bill,most of whom were lawyers,were aware of the doctrine of equitable estoppel even if they were not aware of the vu litigation specifically.if by enacting section the legislature intended to take away a remedy which has existed for hundreds of years one would expect to see discussion of such a step in the legislative history.but there is not a word in the legislative record about the doctrine of equitable estoppel.nowhere does any legislator or staff member say oh,by the way,we making another major change in the law here.we extinguishing the right of all northridge quake victims to obtain relief under the common law doctrine of equitable estoppel.it is not our role to speak for the legislature when the legislature has kept silent.
our conclusion section does not replace the doctrine of equitable estoppel is further supported by other extrinsic aids to statutory interpretation including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.
in enacting section the legislature object was to alleviate a broad and significant problem caused by the insurers conduct to help thousands of policyholders who were misled by the insurers into waiving their right to make claims in a timely manner.the evil to be remedied was the insurance companies rampant mishandling of northridge claims,their systematic program of misleading their policyholders,and their refus al to pay claims on the basis that the claims had become.the public policy reflected in the legislation was to enforce the insurance companies fiduciary duties to their policyholders and to advance the public interest in protecting insureds mistreated by their insurers at a time when the insureds were most vulnerable.the statutory scheme of which section is a part is the regulation of insurance policies including the time for bringing suit under the policy as set forth in insurance code section.we have found no extrinsic evidence suggesting section was intended to bar any new claims for earthquake damage after december.
finally,we are not won over by century argument that after the passage of a reasonable length of time legislatively determined in section to be eight years insurers should be free from the burden of disruptive and protracted liability and able to plan their affairs with a degree of certainty it is unreasonable to expose insurers to liability on claims made,or years after the northridge quake.
this argument was impliedly rejected in lantzy centex homes in which the court held the doctrine of equitable estoppel permits a plaintiff to bring an action for construction defects after the expiration of the absolute statute of limitations on such claims 
as we previously explained,the burden of a late claim falls more heavily on the insured than the insurer.the insured first has to overcome the statute of limitations by producing evidence which would equitably estop the insurer from asserting the limitations period.this means proving the insurer was apprised of the facts it intended its conduct be relied upon by the insured the insured was ignorant of the true facts and the insured reasonably relied on the insurer conduct to her injury if the insured clears this hurdle she must also be able to prove the damage she is claiming was caused by the quake and not some other event.for these reasons we reject century contention applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel to the remaining northridge earthquake cases will expose insurers to unknown but significant liability.
but as to those insureds who can establish the requisite grounds for estoppel,fairness and equity require the risk of loss be shifted from the innocent policyholder to the insurance company whose wrongful conduct induced the policyholder to postpone bringing suit.otherwise the courts wind up rewarding the insurer wrongdoing.even more disturbing,the biggest rewards would go to the insurance companies which best hid the truth from their insureds.
accordingly we hold section does not prevent cordova from contending century is estopped from defending her action on the ground the statute of limitations in insurance code section has expired.
ii.the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to century on the basis of cordova failure to present evidence supporting her claim of equitable estoppel.
as an alternative ground for granting century motion the trial court ruled that even assuming the doctrine of equitable estoppel could apply to actions covered by section cordova failed to submit any admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact with respect to a claim of equitable estoppel.cordova failure to produce evidence rebutting century affirmative defense based on the statute of limitations entitled century to a judgment as a matter of law 
we reverse the trial court ruling for two independent but related reasons.
although styled a motion for summary judgment,century motion was treated by century,cordova,and the trial court until it issued its decision as a nonstatutory,common law motion for judgment on the pleadings.the notice of motion and supporting points and authorities did not rest on the premise cordova could not establish a factual basis for asserting equitable estoppel against century,but on the grounds her complaint showed on its face it was not filed within the period provided by section and equitable relief from the limitation period in insurance code section is not available.furthermore,at oral argument in the trial court both parties agreed century motion presented purely a legal question as to whether section extinguished equitable remedies for failure to file within the statutory period.it has long been the rule in this state that when a defendant motion for summary judgment depends on the untenability of the plaintiff case as pleaded and not on extrinsic evidence negating an element or proving an affirmative defense it may be treated as a common law motion for judgment on the pleadings 
cordova failure to present evidence supporting a claim of equitable estoppel against century was raised for the first time in the trial court written decision on the motion.by proffering an alternative ground for its ruling which was never asserted by century the trial court violated the settled principle summary judgment may not be granted on a ground not asserted by the moving party without giving the opposing party an opportunity to respond.the leading case on this point,juge county of sacramento explains w hen the trial court grants a summary judgment motion on a ground of law not explicitly tendered by the moving party,due process of law requires that the party opposing the motion must be provided an opportunity to respond to the ground of law identified by the court and must be given a chance to show there is a triable issue of fact material to said ground of law.
century argues the general principle articulated in juge does not apply here because the record establishes cordova could not have shown a triable issue of material fact as to her entitlement to equitable estoppel even if century had raised the absence of such evidence in the trial court it also notes there is no case law holding the opposing party must be given notification and an opportunity to respond to a new ground for granting the motion prior to the trial court ruling.cordova had opportunities to provide the omitted evidence through a motion for reconsideration,a motion for new trial,or a motion for relief on the ground of surprise but failed to do so.
we do not agree cordova had a reasonable opportunity to present evidence supporting her claim of equitable estoppel after the trial court issued its ruling.an application for reconsideration may be based on new or different facts but here the facts supporting equitable estoppel would necessarily have been within cordova personal knowledge all along so it is difficult to categorize them as new or different.for the same reason a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence would be unsuccessful a motion for new trial or for relief from a judgment may be based on surprise again,however,it might have been difficult for cordova to convince the trial court she was surprised she had to comply with section,subdivision p by showing triable issues of fact existed with respect to century statute of limitations defense.mandatory relief based on an attorney declaration of fault is only available when there has been a judgment of dismissal or default.relief from summary judgment is within the discretion of the court 
for the reasons explained above,we conclude it was error for the trial court to grant century motion for summary judgment on the ground cordova failed to produce evidence supporting her claim of equitable estoppel.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.appellant is awarded her costs on appeal.
i respectfully dissent.i would affirm the judgment for the reasons hereafter set forth.
initially,i agree with the majority that the facts recited are not in dispute.however,i take issue with the majority as to the legal effect of the undisputed facts.
i note that cordova submitted no evidence showing a prima facie claim of equitable estoppel against century.i therefore would find no reason to reach the question whether plaintiff claim of equitable estoppel would otherwise be barred by code of civil procedure section.similarly,i find no merit to cordova contention century or the trial court misled her into not presenting evidence to support her entitlement to equitable relief.
section,subdivision c states a motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
section,subdivision p states in relevant part a defendant has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that defense 
century motion for summary judgment established a prima facie defense to this action by showing through undisputed admissible evidence the statutory period for bringing this action expired no later than january,and plaintiff did not file this action until september.this showing shifted to cordova the burden to show by admissible evidence a triable issue of fact existed as to the statute of limitations defense.cordova argued century was barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from raising a statute of limitations defense.she failed,however,to submit any admissible evidence raising a triable issue of fact with respect to her claim of equitable estoppel.without such evidence,a decision on the question of whether section precludes equitable claims would be merely an advisory opinion.california courts have no power to render advisory opinions.people ex rel.lynch superior court cal d.therefore,cordova failure to rebut century
