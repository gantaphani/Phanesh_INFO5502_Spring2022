introduction 
this appeal reaches us after the denial of a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the statute the complaint to which the motion was directed is for malicious prosecution brought by respondent richard slaney.named as defendants in the action are appellants ranger insurance company,the law officers of wasserman miller,and arthur wasserman,individually.
the underlying action giving rise to this claim resulted from ranger denial of a claim by its insureds for damages to an aircraft owned by the insureds.on behalf of the insureds,slaney prepared an estimate for repair of the aircraft in support of the claim.ranger denied the claim asserting that its insureds and slaney had presented a fraudulently excessive claim.the insureds sued ranger and others for bad faith,among other causes of action.ranger against its insureds and slaney,alleging fraud in connection with the claim.slaney initially moved unsuccessfully for summary judgment but successfully renewed the motion after discovery and was dismissed from the action.after a jury trial,the insureds prevailed and obtained an award of compensatory damages in excess of million for bad faith.the jury also concluded that ranger denial of the claim,based in part upon its assertion that the insureds and slaney were attempting to defraud it,was malicious.punitive damages in excess of million were assessed.
slaney filed this suit against appellants.wasserman and his law firm noticed the slapp motion,which was joined by ranger.they contended that when the trial court denied the original motion for summary judgment brought by slaney on the,it constituted a finding of probable cause,citing roberts sentry life insurance th,d.the trial court disagreed and concluded that slaney presented sufficient evidence to establish a probability of prevailing.
in the context of this action,we conclude that the original denial of the motion for summary judgment brought by slaney does not establish probable cause as a matter of law,as asserted by appellants.additionally,we conclude that the judgment rendered against ranger,which included a finding of malice and an award of punitive damages,and other evidence presented by slaney,demonstrates a potential for recovery in this action.accordingly,we affirm the trial court denial of the slapp motion.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying lawsuit 
sean and nadia roberts are principals of flight research,and national test pilot school.they insured a firecracker aircraft through ranger insurance company.the aircraft sustained extensive damage in an accident during a landing.the roberts made a claim to ranger for damage resulting from the accident.underwriters adjustment bureau,and others,were involved in adjusting the claim.
richard slaney was the prior owner of the firecracker and still owned the engineering design drawings and jigs for the aircraft the roberts attorney asked slaney to assist with the claim by inspecting the airplane and providing a repair estimate.slaney did so and provided an estimate of between and.
ranger obtained an independent repair estimate of between and.ranger agent,steve culbertson,also an insured of ranger,sought to rent the drawings and jigs from slaney to facilitate repair of the aircraft.slaney agreed to do so for.culbertson apparently refused to sign the rental agreement based upon ranger objections to a contractual indemnity provision.ranger then denied the roberts claim,contending that slaney was conspiring with the roberts to defraud ranger by submitting an inflated claim.
the roberts sued ranger,universal adjustment bureau,and the principal adjuster,paul leonard,for bad faith handling of their claim.
on behalf of ranger,appellant arthur wasserman filed the alleging various claims including the fourth cause of action for fraudulent conspiracy between slaney,the roberts,and others.following is the charging allegation of the fourth cause of action that alleges,based upon information and belief,that,richard slaney and roes,actively conspired with all remaining,and each of them,to inflate the cost of repairs to the subject firecracker aircraft and tamper with the value of the aircraft salvage in order to force into paying for a loss as a destroyed aircraft when the aircraft could have been reasonably repaired.as part and parcel of conduct of,and each of them,there was a misrepresentation of material facts with the intention to coerce,cheat and defraud ranger into paying more tha n was required under the aircraft insurance contract.
slaney sought summary judgment on the three separate times.in his initial motion,slaney contended that ranger would be unable to prove a conspiracy or that it relied on any representations made by him.slaney declared in support of his motion that he was the prior owner of the aircraft and that he had purchased the drawing and jigs along with the aircraft.after the accident he was contacted by counsel for the roberts and asked to help estimate the cost of repairs to the aircraft.he was not in the repair business and he was never interested in performing repairs on the aircraft.rather,he was primarily concerned that the aircraft be properly repaired for safety reasons.he agreed to rent his drawings and jigs so that new ones would not have to be made,but the rental agreement was never executed.he denied inflating the scope of the necessary repair work.
ranger opposed the motion.it contended that slaney and the roberts inflated the cost of repairs so that the aircraft would be declared a total loss,the roberts would be paid the full amount of the loss,and slaney would then be able to buy the wreckage cheaply.various declarations were referenced as being submitted in support of this theory,but the record on appeal does not contain the declarations 
this initial motion was denied.the trial court issued the following order a triable controversy exists with respect to whether or not,slaney and roberts,conspired to inflate the costs of repair in order to obtain a higher cost of repair,supporting claims of interference of bad faith and fraud.the evidentiary facts and inferences drawn from the declarations of paul leonard,steve culbertson,jim smith and ronnie powers,which are based on their expertise in the aviation insurance adjustment and aircraft repair business,include slaney conduct in assisting the roberts in frustrating all efforts and,ultimately,preventing the settlement of the roberts aircraft physical damage claim by substantially inflating the costs involved and their interest in having the aircraft considered a total loss.as further evidenced by the declarations,the conduct of slaney and the roberts included submission of an invalid repair estimate,inasmuch as slaney was not in the business of aircraft repair and was not an certified mechanic,as well as the insistence that the aircraft repair could only be conducted with the use of slaney plans and jigs,the required payment of for the use of said plans and jigs and the interest in obtaining the salvage.
the trial court denied slaney first renewed motion for summary judgment on procedural grounds.
slaney prevailed on his second renewed motion for summary judgment.he presented new evidence,developed through discovery,which,he argued,demonstrated no factual support for either ranger conspiracy theory or that ranger relied upon anything slaney represented in connection with the roberts claim.the trial court,a different judge from the one hearing the first two motions,agreed.the order granting summary judgment states 
on september,slaney motion for summary judgment came on for hearing.at the hearing,counsel for ranger referred the court for the first time to the decision in bagley trw,th,d.counsel relied upon bagley for the proposition that this court was without jurisdiction to hear slaney present motion because another judge of this court had previously denied a similar motion.at the hearing,the court indicated a desire to compare slaney former motion with the present motion in order to determine if bagley barred the court from hearing the present motion.in order to save the parties a return trip to the court,the court announced its ruling on slaney motion,f subject to such ruling being withdrawn if the court concluded the present motion was barred by bagley.
the court has now compared the present and former motions filed by slaney.the court observes that,in order for it to have jurisdiction to hear the current motion,it must be concluded that the motion presents newly discovered facts or circumstances or a change of law supporting the issues reasserted in the summary judgment motion.code civ.proc.f.
as stated,the court has reviewed slaney prior motion and the court ruling thereon.based on this review,the basis of the court denial of slaney earlier motion is not clear.the only evidence presented in the first motion relating to ranger lack of reliance consisted of a declaration of defendant nadia roberts and a letter from ranger adjuster,leonard.in this court view,this evidence was inconclusive to establish whether ranger relied on any estimate prepared by slaney.stated otherwise,this court believes the judge ruling on slaney first motion did not have sufficient evidence before him to justify a conclusion that ranger did not rely on slaney estimate.
since the ruling on slaney first motion,additional depositions have been taken.in these depositions,the testimony of ranger adjuster,leonard,conclusively demonstrates ranger did not rely on slaney estimate.this conclusive evidence constitutes newly discovered facts or circumstances since it greatly enhances the weight of slaney reliance argument.accordingly,the court affirms the ruling made in open court on september,granting slaney motion for summary judgment.
footnote the court granted slaney motion based on the facts the evidence presented by slaney shifted the burden to ranger and the latter failed to produce any evidence either that slaney conspired to defraud ranger or that ranger relied on any estimate prepared by slaney.italics added.
the roberts bad faith action against ranger went to trial.in a special verdict,the jury concluded that ranger owed for damage to the aircraft under the terms of the insurance policy.it also found that ranger was guilty of bad faith and awarded an additional for compensatory damages.the jury answered yes to the following two questions and assessed punitive damages of against ranger

this action 
in december,slaney filed his complaint.it alleges two causes of action the first for malicious prosecution,and the second for conspiracy to commit malicious prosecution.the primary charging allegations are contained in paragraph of the complaint.ranger alleged in its in the underlying action,and in the prosecution thereof,that the roberts wanted the firecracker declared a total loss rather than to have it repaired that in order to assist in having the firecracker declared a total loss,and for his own benefit,plaintiff slaney had purposely overstated his estimate of the costs of repairing the firecracker in an effort to have it declared a total loss so he could purchase the salvage at a bargain price that plaintiff bribed or attempted to bribe a company which had estimated the salvage value on the firecracker to withdraw its estimate so he could purchase the salvage instead,at a favorable price that plaintiff had misrepresented his interest in the plans and jigs for the firecracker and did not own the exclusive rights to them that plaintiff had attempted to conceal his large financial interest in the claim which existed because he still owed money on a loan he had obtained when he still owned the firecracker,and which was secured by it and that ranger had reasonably relied to its detriment upon plaintiff estimates and representations.those allegations were false,and known by ranger and lawyer defendants to be false,in that the roberts always wanted to have the firecracker repaired,not totaled plaintiff did not overstate his estimate of the costs of repairing the firecracker plaintiff did not desire to have the firecracker declared a total loss so he could purchase the salvage at a bargain price or for any other reasons plaintiff nether bribed nor attempted to bribe a company which had estimated the salvage value on the firecracker to withdraw its estimate plaintiff had not misrepresented his interest in the plans and jigs for the firecracker and did own the exclusive rights to them plaintiff did not owe anything on the loan he had obtained when he still owned the firecracker,having paid off the loan in full in or about and that ranger had not relied in any way upon plaintiff estimates and representations.the false allegations were based upon testimony from defendant leonard and others known by ranger and lawyer defendants to be false,or which they later learned to be false,such that the continued prosecution of the thereafter,by,among other things,the continued proffering of the false and perjurious testimony as evidence in opposition to plaintiff richard slaney motion for summary judgment on the,was actually malicious and without probable cause.
wasserman demurred to the complaint and filed two motions to strike,a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section,and a motion to strike pursuant to civil code section,subdivision a.ranger also demurred to the complaint and joined in wasserman special motion to strike 
wasserman raised two arguments in his special motion to strike.first,citing roberts sentry life insurance,supra,th,d,he argued that denial of the original motion for summary judgment established,as a matter of law,that the was prosecuted with probable cause.second,he argued that his actions in filing and prosecuting the were privileged pursuant to civil code section,subdivision b 
in opposition,slaney argued that probable cause and malice could be inferred from the results obtained in the underlying action that he ultimately obtained summary judgment in his favor on the that ranger was dismissed by the trial court for lack of factual and legal basis and because the jury found bad faith and malice in connection with denial of the claim.in support of his opposition,respondent proffered the declarations of clay robbins iii and mark didak.
clay robbins iii was trial counsel for the roberts in the underlying action.in his declaration he summarized his closing argument from the underlying trial one of the main theories i argued to the jury in support of my clients claim of bad faith,malice,oppression,and damages including punitive damages was that ranger,through paul leonard,had wrongfully denied my clients claim under the ranger policy for damage to their firecracker aircraft,and that in an effort to avoid liability on the roberts insurance claim it went so far as to knowingly and maliciously trump up the false claim that my clients and slaney had conspired to defraud ranger.as i also noted in my closing arguments,the false claim was ultimately the subject of the underlying against my clients and slaney which was drafted,at least in part,by paul leonard,and filed and prosecuted on ranger behalf by arthur wasserman and his law firm.this theory,like all the theories of liability i argued to the jury,was supported by substantial evidence presented at trial.that evidence is contained in the record on appeal of roberts
