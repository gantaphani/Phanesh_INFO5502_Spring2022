appellants twila prince and david smith,appeal from the judgment entered after demurrer was sustained to their complaint against respondent united national insurance company united national.the issue raised in this case is whether an insurance policy exclusion for injuries arising out of the use of an automobile precludes coverage for the deaths of two young children who were negligently left in a vehicle on a hot day by their foster mother.the trial court concluded that the exclusion applied,and sustained a demurrer in favor of respondent united national.we agree that the use of the automobile was a predominating cause substantial factor injuries to the children,and that the foster mother negligence was not independent from the use of the vehicle.we,therefore,affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the complaint 
appellants complaint against united national was filed in february.also named as defendants were fire insurance exchange and mercury casualty.according to the allegations of the complaint,appellants are the natural parents of dakota denzel and nehemaiha nate,who died while dependents of the los angeles county foster care system.leslie smoot had been appointed their foster mother.smoot was licensed by trinity children and family services trinity,to act as a foster parent and was with her husband of a child place preschool preschool located in lancaster,california.in july,smoot left the two children in vehicle for more than six hours outside the preschool,and both died.
appellants filed suit against the county,trinity,the smoots,and the preschool.american automobile insurance fund entered into a settlement agreement with appellants as one of the insurers for the smoots and the preschool,and,among other things,assigned them its right to contribution from united national and the other defendant insurers.trinity,insured by western insurance company,also settled with appellants and similarly assigned any right to contribution owed them.
the complaint alleged in the first and second causes of action that united national issued a foster parent liability policy to trinity to cover the acts of foster parents licensed or certified under its authority.the smoots or trinity allegedly tendered to united national a wrongful death claim brought by appellants,and united national was allegedly obligated to contribute towards the defense and settlement of the underlying claim,but refused to do so.instead,american automobile insurance fund and western insurance company handled the defense without contribution from respondent.similar allegations were made with respect to codefendants fire insurance exchange and mercury casualty in the third through sixth causes of action.
the policy 
the parties later incorporated by stipulation the policy issued to trinity by united national.part a of the policy provided coverage for bodily injury and property damage.the following exclusion appeared in part a this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any aircraft,auto or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.
the demurrer 
united national demurred to the complaint,contending that the exclusion in its policy precluded coverage for the injury to the children.the trial court sustained the demurrer.in its order,the court explained that t o find that an injury arose out of the use of a vehicle,the court must find that the use of the vehicle was a predominating factor in causing the injury.quoting american nat.property casualty julie th,d julie.referring to the long line of california decisions that have given use of a vehicle a broad,not restrictive,interpretation,the court found that the uses of the vehicle were parking the car and using the car to hold children,both readily understood uses of a vehicle.
the court further concluded that t he use of the vehicle was a substantial factor in the children deaths and the instrumentality of their deaths.the court distinguished this court decision in julie,that a rape occurring in a car was not covered by an automobile policy because the automobile was nothing more than the situs of the rape in this case,it can not be seriously argued that the vehicle was merely the situs of smoot negligence.had she abandoned the children in a house,or under a tree,they would not have died in five hours.they died because of the hot car.
the court considered whether smoot negligence was independent of the use of the vehicle.in this case,smoot liability simply can not be dissociated from the use of the vehicle.absent the hot car,the children would not have died,and smoot would not have faced any liability for negligence.because her liability necessarily arose out of her use of the it and leaving the children in was not independent of the use of the vehicle.
finally,in response to appellants contention that the vehicle use exclusion should not apply at all because the specific intent of the subject policy is to cover the negligent conduct of foster parents toward foster children,the court stated this argument would nullify the vehicle exclusion in the subject policy.appellants offer no authority to support such a result,which would be inconsistent with the basic principles of contract interpretation.
judgment was entered in favor of united national,and appellants noticed a timely appeal.
discussion 
the sole issue here is whether an insurance policy that excludes from its scope of coverage any bodily injury arising out of the use of an auto applies to injury to youngsters left in an overheated vehicle after it has come to rest.in the trial court,appellants argued that the exclusion did not apply because smoot negligence was unrelated to her use of the automobile.in their reply brief,appellants raise for the first time the contention that coverage was provided under part b of the policy which applies to personal injury liability and that the automobile exclusion found only in part to bodily injury does not apply.an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief need not be addressed.see brown boren th,d a litigant may not change his or her position on appeal and assert a new theory.to permit this change in strategy would be unfair to the trial court and the opposing litigant american drug stores,stroh th,d points raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered,because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.
moreover,we note that the term personal injury is given a specific definition by the policy that does not include bodily injury.it is instead limited to injury arising out of the torts of false arrest,malicious prosecution,wrongful eviction,slander and libel,and invasion of privacy.as none of these torts are involved here,the suggestion that part b provided coverage unaffected by the automobile use exclusion in part a does not assist appellants.
the leading authority in the interpretation of automobile use exclusions is state farm mut.auto.ins.partridge cal d,partridge.there,a passenger in a car was injured by the discharge of a firearm held by the driver,who was shooting at jackrabbits from an open window.the discharge occurred after the vehicle had driven off the road and hit a bump.the driver had previously modified the trigger of the gun to make it easier to fire.the insurance company that had issued both the automobile and homeowner policies brought a declaratory relief action seeking a determination which of its policies afforded coverage.the automobile policy stated that it afforded coverage for bodily injuries caused by accidents arising out of the use of the owned motor vehicle.id.at.the homeowner policy contained an exclusion for bodily injury arising out of the use of any motor vehicle.id.at.
the court initially noted that p ast california cases have established beyond contention that this language of arising out of the use,when utilized in a coverage or insuring clause of an insurance policy,has a broad and comprehensive application,and affords coverage for injuries bearing almost any causal relation with the vehicle.partridge,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.under this rule,there was no dispute that the role played by the car was sufficient to bring the accident within the automobile policy.the issue was whether the homeowner policy also provided coverage.pointing to the nearly identical language in the coverage clause and the exclusionary clause,the company argued that the policies were intended to be mutually exclusive and that no overlapping coverage can be permitted.id.at.the court disagreed,finding that because the driver had been negligent both in his driving of the vehicle and in modifying the trigger of the gun to make it fire more easily,coverage was provided by both policies.the court held that although the accident occurred in a vehicle,the insured negligent modification of the gun suffices,in itself,to render him fully liable for the resulting injuries inasmuch as the liability of the insured arises from his conduct,and exists independently of any use of his car,we believe the homeowner s policy covers that liability.id.at,italics added.
later courts have construed the above italicized language to require that in order for partridge to apply there must be two negligent acts or omissions of the insured,one of which,independently of the excluded cause,renders the insured liable for the resulting injuries.daggs foremost ins.d.in daggs,the plaintiff was injured while competing in a motocross race when his motorcycle collided with a chain link barrier fence.he argued that partridge applied because the negligence in the design and construction of the fence was independent of his participation in the race.the court disagreed the only reasonable interpretation of the allegation of plaintiff underlying complaint is that the insured failed to make the motorcycle course safe for the organized racing event in which plaintiff was participating.there is but one negligent act of the insured,not two as in partridge,and this cause of the injuries is not independent of the policy exclusion.ibid.
a similar result obtained in state farm fire cas.camara d.there,the insured transformed his volkswagen into a dune buggy,and a passenger was injured while riding in it.distinguishing partridge,the camara court concluded that the automobile exclusion of the homeowner policy precluded coverage as partridge held,the cause must be independent of the cause in order for the liability to be covered by the homeowner policy.although the operation or use of the dune buggy was not the sole cause of the accident,any contributing design cause was dependent upon such operation or use,such that any liability for negligent design necessarily arose out of the operation or use of the motor vehicle.state farm fire cas.camara,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
based on this understanding of partridge,courts have found negligence to be in a variety of situations that did not involve actual operation of the vehicle.in safeco ins.gilstrap d,where the conduct alleged was negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle to a minor,the court stated the separate and independent act in partridge giving rise to liability was a act,the filing of the gun trigger.that act had nothing to do with the use or operation of a vehicle.in contrast to partridge,the obligation of the insureds in this case did not arise from an act separate and independent from the use of the vehicle itself.d at.
other cases have addressed whether a parked vehicle is in use for purposes of coverage or exclusion.these cases make clear that a vehicle need not be moving or even running for injuries to arise out of its use.for example,in national indemnity farmers home mutual ins.d,the driver of an insured automobile,while taking her nephew home,stopped and parked her car on the opposite side of the street from where he lived.rushing to get home,the nephew jumped from the car and into the path of another vehicle.the trial court found that the injury arose out of the use of the aunt automobile,and the appellate court agreed an automobile can be in use even though at rest.citation.the presence of small children in an automobile imposes a particular duty of care and alertness upon the driver in selecting the place for and supervising the manner of discharging the children from the vehicle the process of unloading a child from a motor vehicle does not end the moment that the child feet touch the ground or when his or her body is entirely outside the vehicle.nothing in partridge provides any basis for exonerating the automobile insurance carrier on the present facts.d at.the court went on to say there is a complete absence of conduct on the part of the insured which is independent of and unrelated to the use of the vehicle.the conduct of the insured which contributed to the injury simply can not be dissociated from the use of the vehicle.nor did the injury,insofar as the insured is concerned,involve an instrumentality other than the vehicle itself.id.at.
the interpretation of use to include conduct relating to a vehicle at rest has not been limited to cases finding coverage.in national american ins.coburn d,the court found the automobile exclusion applied to preclude coverage for injuries sustained when a child entered a parked van in which the emergency brake had not been set and released the transmission,allowing the van to roll over a second child.the court expressly rejected the claim that the child death had not resulted from the use of the car,finding i t can not be seriously argued that the parking,leaving open and braking of a vehicle are anything other than aspects of the use of the vehicle.id.at.the court further found that any negligence on the part of the van owner in failing adequately to supervise the children can not be dissociated from the use of the vehicle itself id.at.
finally,it is clear that a vehicle need not even have been in operation for injuries to have arisen out of its use.in united services automobile united states fire ins.d,the insured,john chandler,was at a friend house,attempting to start the friend automobile by pouring gasoline into the carburetor.when the gasoline can ignited,chandler threw it toward the open garage door,where it struck and injured his friend.the issue presented was whether chandler automobile policy or homeowner policy covered the injury.this turned on whether chandler was using the friend automobile at the time of the accident and whether such use was an actual use.id.at.the court answered the questions affirmatively chandler actions in attempting to start the car constituted a physical relationship to it and was a present use performed for the purpose of making the vehicle operative.the resulting accident was proximately caused by that use ibid.moreover,the court found,while the activity involving the vehicle was peripheral,it was not an activity wholly disassociated from,independent of,and remote from its use.id.at.
no california case has resolved coverage issues under the specific facts presented here.the parties have brought to our attention cases from other jurisdictions involving children left in overheated vehicles although cases may be instructive in some instances,the interpretation of the term use as it relates to an automobile coverage provision or exclusion is not an issue that can be decided outside the context of applicable precedent.as the authorities discussed above make clear,california courts take an expansive view of the term and are disinclined to find overlapping coverage.see,allstate ins.jones,supra,d at.courts outside the jurisdiction do not necessarily follow the same approach 
the california cases most relied on by appellants are ohio casualty ins.hartford accident indemnity d.and this court decision in julie,supra,th at,d.in ohio casualty,a high school student,louise diepenbrock,was injured while on a outing to a lake.she dove from a boat owned and operated by geoffrey daly,and was run over by a boat being operated by another parent.daly was named a defendant and sought coverage under both his yacht policy and his homeowner policy.the homeowner policy contained an exclusion for use of a watercraft.the court held the negligent supervision was a separate and independent cause o
