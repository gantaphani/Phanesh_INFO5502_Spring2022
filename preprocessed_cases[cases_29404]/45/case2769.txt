at issue in this case is the validity of an insurance regulation promulgated in response to a perceived crisis in the availability of homeowners insurance due to the adoption of underwriting guidelines known as use it and lose it,under which insurance coverage was lost due to filing a claim or even making an inquiry about coverage.john garamendi,in his capacity as insurance commission of the state of california hereafter commissioner,and the california department of insurance hereafter cdi first sought to address the crisis by an advisory notice.when that notice was challenged as an underground regulation,the commissioner responded by adopting an emergency regulation.
petitioners,three insurance industry trade groups,petitioned for a peremptory writ of mandate to set aside and stop enforcement of the emergency regulation which sought to regulate the use of losses and loss exposure in residential property insurance rating and underwriting.the trial court found the regulation conflicted with the insurance code and granted the petition.
the commissioner and cdi appeal,contending the regulation was within the commissioner authority and consistent with various provisions of the insurance code.we disagree.the insurance code provides no express authority for regulating the underwriting of homeowners insurance,nor can such expansive authority be implied.unlike automobile insurance,homeowners insurance is subject to only a few restrictions,all clearly set forth in the insurance code.reading the insurance code to give the commissioner broad authority to regulate underwriting beyond these specific provisions is inconsistent with the legislative scheme as a whole.accordingly,the regulation is invalid.
factual and procedural background 
in,the commissioner perceived a crisis in the availability of homeowners insurance.the perceived crisis centered around the cancellation and nonrenewal of homeowners policies and the lack of availability of homeowners insurance due to previous claims or inquiries about coverage.cdi had experienced an increase in consumer complaints about cancellation,nonrenewal and availability of homeowners insurance.the commissioner believed that many of these problems could be traced to the use of loss databases compiled by various organizations.in the commissioner view much of this data was imperfect and flawed and therefore reliance on it resulted in unfair and discriminatory treatment of policyholders and applicants.further,the commissioner believed insurers were foregoing the underwriting evaluations in violation of california law requiring that underwriting decisions not be based solely on the content of these databases,but only after further information is gathered from other sources.california law also requires insurers to evaluate the risk of future loss in making underwriting decisions.
in particular,the commissioner was concerned about the use of the comprehensive loss underwriting exchange clue database and credit scoring in underwriting decisions.whenever an insured filed a claim or even made an inquiry,it was reported to the clue national database.the commissioner concern was twofold.first,the databases often contained inaccurate information.and second,insurance was denied due to prior claims when the prior claims had no substantial relationship to an increased risk of loss.numerous news reports documented the crisis in homeowners insurance as insureds lost their coverage through cancellation or nonrenewal,and had difficulty in obtaining new homeowners insurance because they had made claims,particularly claims for water damage which raised the specter of mold problems.
the commissioner originally sought to address this problem by issuing an advisory notice in april.the advisory notice began the purpose of this advisory notice is to direct your attention to those laws concerning the appropriate use of loss history information in the rating and underwriting of residential property insurance in california.the cdi has received numerous complaints from homeowners and tenants who have been treated unfairly by insurance companies,particularly in the gathering and use of loss information in the underwriting process.
the advisory notice warned that not every loss is related to the current loss exposure and that insurers choosing to include losses as an eligibility criterion must demonstrate that each loss bears a substantial relationship to risk of future loss.each loss must be evaluated and losses that have been fully remedied or otherwise resolved so that they no longer present an increased risk of loss do not have a substantial relationship to the insured loss exposure.inquiries regarding coverage are not relevant to underwriting unless an actual loss or exposure to loss is identified and determined to have a substantial relationship to loss exposure loss history data bases compiled by organizations do not distinguish between losses that bear a substantial relationship to loss exposure and those that do not.loss information must be evaluated before it can be used as a basis for an adverse underwriting decision.the advisory notice cautioned insurers to review their eligibility guidelines and practices to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.complaints regarding these provisions would receive priority.
after the advisory notice was issued,cdi notified insurers that complaints against them for nonrenewal or denial of a policy due to prior claim activity or loss history were justified.regulations required an insurer to maintain eligibility guidelines for each line of insurance that were specific and objective factors that have a substantial relationship to an insured loss exposure,tit,subd.b.cdi took the position that prior claims or a loss history did not necessarily have a substantial relationship to an insured loss exposure.
petitioners american insurance association,association of california insurance companies,and personal insurance federation of california hereafter petitioners petitioned for a peremptory writ of mandate to invalidate the advisory notice,arguing it was an illegal underground regulation and it conflicted with existing law.petitioners argued that loss history data was an objective factor related to the risk of future loss because statistical and actuarial analyzes using loss history indicated an applicant with prior losses presents an increased risk of loss,in terms of both frequency and size of loss.the trial court found the advisory notice was likely a regulation and stayed enforcement of it.
in july,the commissioner adopted,on an emergency basis,a new regulation.the parties stipulated that the regulation superseded the advisory notice.petitioners filed an amended petition,which sought to invalidate the regulation on the basis there was no emergency,the regulation exceeded the scope of the commissioner authority,and the regulation was inconsistent with statutory law.the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the causes of action relating to the advisory notice.
the new regulation addressed the same issues as the advisory notice.it added section to title of california code of regulations regulation.regulation is entitled consideration of losses and loss exposure in residential property insurance rating and underwriting and provides as follows 
a this section applies to residential property risks subject to california insurance code section.
b for purposes of this section,the following definitions apply when an insurer considers losses or loss exposure in residential property insurance rating and underwriting 
substantial relationship to loss exposure a substantial relationship to loss exposure exists when a hazard,physical condition,or liability exposure creates a material and identifiable effect on the likelihood of a covered loss 
increased risk of loss an increased risk of loss exists when a property or liability hazard or physical condition is identified or discovered which both bears a substantial relationship to the loss exposure and presents a greater likelihood of future loss than if the hazard or condition did not exist 
fully remedied or otherwise resolved a fully remedied or otherwise resolved loss or loss exposure exists when 
i the property has been returned to a state of repair that is equal or superior to the condition existing prior to the occurrence or condition which created the increased risk of loss,or 
ii the liability hazard insured against has been reduced to equal or below the level existing prior to the loss or loss exposure,or 
iii the increased risk of loss has been entirely eliminated because the property is no longer owned by the insured,the liability hazard is no longer the responsibility of the insured,the policy no longer provides coverage for that exposure,or the condition that caused the increased risk of loss has been removed.
adverse underwriting decision an adverse underwriting decision is as defined in california insurance code section.
c an adverse underwriting decision based on losses or loss exposure,when otherwise allowed by law,shall be based upon conditions of the individual risk which bear a substantial relationship to the loss exposure and which present an increased risk of loss when compared to other risks eligible for coverage under the insurer underwriting guidelines.an insurer shall not base,in whole or in part,an adverse underwriting decision on losses or loss exposures that have been fully remedied or otherwise resolved.losses or loss exposures that have been fully remedied or otherwise resolved are no longer substantially related to the risk of loss.
d an insurer shall not base an adverse underwriting decision,in whole or in part,on an inquiry regarding coverage,unless a hazard or condition is identified which both bears a substantial relationship to loss exposure and presents an increased risk of loss.
e an insurer shall gather adequate information to determine that an increased risk of loss exists before a loss,loss exposure,or an inquiry with respect to coverage can be used as grounds for an adverse underwriting decision.in accordance with california insurance code section,an insurer can not rely solely on information obtained from an organization.if the information is from an insurance,the insurer shall obtain further relevant information in addition to the material obtained from the organization.sources for this information may include the insurance application or supplemental application,telephone inquiry,written inquiry,and physical inspection.
f an insurer making an adverse underwriting decision shall maintain documentation detailing the hazards or physical conditions which created an increased risk of loss and how this information was considered in policy rating or underwriting.this documentation shall be maintained during the time in which the policy is in force and otherwise as required by law,tit.
regulation cites to the following provisions of the insurance code as authority for the regulation sections,and,tit.
the trial court found the commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating this regulation because it is inconsistent with the governing statutes.the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the commissioner and cdi to cease,desist,and decline from enforcing the regulation.

the commissioner has broad discretion to adopt regulations as necessary to promote the public welfare.calfarm ins.deukmejian cal d.the commissioner powers are not limited to those expressly conferred by statute,but also include such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient administration of powers expressly granted by statute,or as may fairly be implied from the statute granting the powers.citation.century ins.garamendi cal th,d,century italics in original.

the trial court found the commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating regulation because the regulation is inconsistent with the insurance code.specifically,the trial court found that regulation conflicts with section.this section is part of the insurance information and privacy protection act et.the purpose of this article is to establish standards for the collection,use and disclosure of information gathered in connection with insurance transactions by insurance institutions,agents or organizations to maintain a balance between the need for information by those conducting the business of insurance and the public need for fairness in insurance information practices,including the need to minimize intrusiveness to establish a regulatory mechanism to enable natural persons to ascertain what information is being or has been collected about them in connection with insurance transactions and to have access to such information for the purpose of verifying or disputing its accuracy to limit the disclosure of information collected in connection with insurance transactions and to enable insurance applicants and policyholders to obtain the reasons for any adverse underwriting decision.
an a dverse underwriting decision includes the declination or termination of insurance coverage,subd.a,and thus includes an insurer decision to refuse to insure or to renew due to the loss history of the applicant or insured.section sets forth prohibited grounds for an adverse underwriting decision.subdivision a prohibits an adverse underwriting decision based on a previous adverse underwriting decision or the previous obtaining of insurance through a residual market mechanism,and new subdivision c prohibits an adverse underwriting decision based on an inquiry that does not lead to a claim.the most pertinent prohibition is subdivision b,which prohibits basing an adverse underwriting decision on personal information received from an organization whose primary source of information is insurance institutions provided,however,an insurance institution or agent may base an adverse underwriting decision on further personal information obtained as the result of information received from an organization,subd.b.
personal information is defined as any individually identifiable information gathered in connection with an insurance transaction from which judgments can be made about an individual character,habits,avocations,finances,occupation,general reputation,credit,health,or any other personal characteristics.personal information includes an individual name and address and medical record information but does not include privileged information,subd.s.privileged information includes any individually identifiable information that relates to a claim for insurance benefits and is collected in connection with or in reasonable anticipation of a claim for insurance benefits,subd.v.
the parties dispute whether loss history information is personal information or privileged information under section.the commissioner contends loss history information is personal information and therefore basing an adverse underwriting decision on loss history information from a clue report or similar data base is prohibited.he contends personal information does not become privileged information until the pendency of a lawsuit and urges that privileged information should be understood in the context of work product privilege.the commissioner argues that if loss history information is classified as privileged information,then the provisions of the insurance information and privacy protection act permitting an insured access to and the ability to correct information collected about him would not apply because such provisions apply only to personal information.if prior claims information is classified as privileged information,an insured would have no statutory right to review and correct a clue report.
below petitioners argued regulation was unnecessary to prevent underwriting decisions based on inaccurate information because the insured had the right to review and correct such information.petitioners do not explain how sections and apply to a clue report if the information is privileged information rather than personal information.in response to the amicus brief,petitioners suggest that loss history information may be corrected under the provisions of the federal fair credit reporting act et.it seems odd that in an area as heavily subject to state regulation as insurance,a consumer remedy would be limited to that provided by a federal statute.
petitioners contend loss history information is privileged information because it directly relates to a claim.as privileged information,it may be disclosed to an organization under section and there are no restrictions on its use under section.because regulation restricts the use of this privileged information,petitioners contend,it conflicts with section.
the trial court found loss history information appeared to fall within the definition of privileged information and its use in making an adverse underwriting decision was not prohibited by section.
categorizing loss history information as either personal information or privileged information does not itself answer whether the commissioner had authority to promulgate regulation.regulation goes far beyond the protection of personal information,which is the purpose of the insurance information and privacy protection act.regulation attempts to regulate the use of prior claims regardless of where the information came from,even if it was obtained from the insurer own files.further,regulation prohibits a remedied or resolved claim from ever being used in adverse underwriting decisions.thus,section neither authorizes nor prohibits regulation.indeed,on appeal the commissioner does not rely on section as authority for regulation.
the commissioner devotes much of his opening brief to arguing that the commissioner has authority to regulate underwriting in the area of homeowners insurance.he bases his argument primarily on the provisions of proposition which added article to the insurance code.prior to the passage of proposition,california had a open competition system of regulation,under which rates were set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by the commissioner.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.among other things,proposition requires that all rate increases be approved by the commissioner and permits public participation in the administrative ratesetting process.ibid.
summarized,the commissioner argument is this proposition gave the commissioner authority over insurance rates.under insurance code section no rate shall be approved if it is excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of this chapter.this provision applies to homeowners insurance,all further statutory references are to the insurance code unless otherwise specified.underwriting affects rates.underwriting is a label commonly applied to the process,fundamental to the concept of insurance,of deciding which risks to insure and which to reject in order to spread losses over risks in an economically feasible way.citations.a n underwriting rule is properly characterized as a rule followed or adopted by an insurer or a rating organization which either limits the conditions under which a policy will be issued or impacts the rates that will be charged for that policy.smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d italics in original.if the underwriting is not actuarially sound,the rates may be unfairly discriminatory.therefore,the commissioner must have authority to regulate underwriting to avoid unfairly discriminatory rates.the authority to regulate underwriting is necessarily implied from the authority to regulate rates.
petitioners contend this expansive reading of the commissioner power as to underwriting broadens and conflicts with the statutory scheme.they contend proposition,and section,is limited in application to rates and does not apply to underwriting.the california supreme court recently rejected such a narrow view of proposition.as part of proposition,article stated purpose was to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace,to provide for an accountable insurance commissioner,and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians.citation.to this end,article gives the commissioner broad authority over insurance rates citation,and expressly precludes him from approving rates that are excessive,inadequate,unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of chapter of the insurance code citation.through insurance code section,subdivision a,the article also subjects the business of insurance to laws prohibiting discriminatory and unfair business practices.thus,article is not limited in scope to rate regulation.it also addresses the underlying factors that may impermissibly affect rates charged by insurers and lead to insurance that is unfair,unavailable,and unaffordable.state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi,supra,cal th,d.
the commissioner contends that the use of loss history that has no substantial relationship to future risk may impermissibly affect rates charged by insurers and lead to insurance that is unfair,unavailable,and unaffordable.the commissioner believes he has the authority to determine,by regulation,when loss history has no substantial relationship to future risk.the commissioner points to no express statutory authority for this regulatory power.in this regard,regulation is distinguishable from the rate regulations at issue in century,supra,cal th,d,which implemented the rate rollback provisions of section.instead,the commissioner contends the authority to regulate underwriting in general and the use of loss history in particular is necessarily implied from the statutory scheme.
petitioners contend proposition did not give the commissioner authority to regulate the underwriting of homeowners insurance.at issue in state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi,supra,cal th,d,was whether the commissioner exceeded his authority in promulgating a regulation requiring disclosure of certain information concerning the insurer business in california,organized by zip code.noting the purpose of proposition,quoted above,the supreme court concluded as such,the commissioner undoubtedly has the authority under article to gather any information necessary for determining whether these factors are impermissibly affecting the fairness,availability,and affordability of insurance.id.at,d.petitioners contend the authority to gather information does not include the authority to regulate underwriting.
petitioners contend the legislature placed few restrictions on an insured ability to choose what risks to
