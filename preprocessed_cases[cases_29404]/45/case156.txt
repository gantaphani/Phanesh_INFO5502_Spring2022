this case arises from a failed attempt by hpsc,hpsc to recover an embezzlement loss under an executive protection insurance policy issued by federal insurance federal.federal brought this declaratory judgment action against hpsc seeking rescission of the policy based on a misrepresentation made by hpsc in its insurance renewal application.hpsc counterclaimed,seeking recovery under the policy and damages for unfair and deceptive trade practices.judgment was entered in favor of hpsc on all claims.federal appeals,claiming that the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality of hpsc misrepresentation and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims.after carefully reviewing the record,we affirm.
relevant facts 
on may,hpsc reported to its insurer,federal,that an officer of its lending subsidiary american commercial finance acfc,kevin morrison,had embezzled million over the previous five years.hpsc submitted proof of loss to federal on july,pursuant to its executive protection policy,which provided for of employee theft coverage,subject to a deductible.with its claim,hpsc included an investigative report by pricewaterhousecoopers the pwc report indicating that the theft occurred due to morrison unsegregated control over account activities.the pwc report stated that morrison exercised sole control over the factoring of accounts receivable business at acfc and had full authority to disburse funds,collect payments,reconcile accounts and report financial performance.as a result,acfc had insufficient segregation of duties in the factoring operation.
the investigation of hpsc claim was assigned to federal claims examiner anna mackay.upon reading the pwc report,mackay concluded that morrison both reconciled bank statements and signed checks on the same acfc accounts,which contradicted information provided by hpsc on its april,renewal application.specifically,hpsc had answered no to question of the application,do the employees who reconcile the monthly bank statements also either sign checks handle deposits or have access to check signing machines or signature plates mackay related her findings up the ladder to her superiors at federal,who proceeded on the same assumptions as mackay.mackay also engaged outside coverage counsel,who reviewed hpsc file and issued an opinion letter.
meanwhile,hpsc remained in contact with federal regarding the status of its claim.finally,on september,hpsc issued an ultimatum to federal if federal did not pay the claim,hpsc would file suit by september.
ii.relevant proceedings 
without further investigation,federal responded to hpsc ultimatum by filing a diversity suit seeking rescission of the policy for fraud and misrepresentation.hpsc counterclaimed for recovery under the policy and for damages under.laws ch.for unfair and deceptive trade practices based on federal delay in investigating and paying the claim.
two weeks after the initial case management conference,hpsc informed federal that mackay had misread the pwc report in fact,it was not morrison,but his subordinate,sylvia maguire,who reconciled the bank statements on acfc fifteen operating accounts.maguire did not sign checks or handle deposits,and acfc had no check signing machine or signature plate.all transactions on these fifteen accounts were accomplished through wire transfers.the only account for which morrison both reconciled statements and signed checks was an imprest petty cash account,which was capped at and could only be replenished each month after hpsc reviewed acfc disbursements.
federal then shifted its theory of the case,relying on morrison authority over all sixteen of the acfc accounts.federal also contended that morrison authority over wire transfers was the equivalent of signing checks for the purposes of question on the renewal application.
both sides filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied both motions,concluding that hpsc response to question was truthful as to the fifteen operating accounts,given that the question did not ask about an employee unexercised authority or about wire transfer authority.the district court found that the only misrepresentation made by hpsc involved morrison control over the petty cash account but that given the relatively small size of that account compared to the fifteen operating accounts,the materiality of the misrepresentation was a question of fact for the jury.the district judge noted,however,that if he were the factfinder,he would most likely agree that the misrepresentation was a material one.
prior to trial,federal moved in limine to exclude any evidence regarding federal past underwriting practices on the basis that such evidence was irrelevant to the materiality of hpsc misrepresentation.the district court denied the motions.
at trial,federal underwriter,yalonda mason,testified that had she known the truth about morrison unsegregated duties,she still would have written the policy,but with a larger deductible or higher premium because of the increased risk.federal also called a risk management expert,dean felton,who testified that the lack of segregation between reconciliation and duties increased the risk of loss from theft.felton further indicated that if hpsc answer to question had been truthful,he would have either increased the deductible,increased the premium,or excluded the checking account from coverage.
hpsc expert,michael bracken,testified that in his opinion the imprest petty cash account did not present a materially elevated risk of loss to hpsc or federal.bracken also concluded that had hpsc answered yes to question,it would have made no difference in federal decision to underwrite hpsc policy.he explained that he had reviewed hpsc past applications to federal,and that federal had not followed up on any of hpsc past no answers or even questioned its yes answer to question in.bracken claimed that this question was important and that,as an underwriter,he would have investigated an affirmative answer.
at the conclusion of the evidence,federal moved for a directed verdict under rule a,but the district court denied the motion.the district court instructed the jury that federal was not obligated to pay hpsc claim if hpsc misrepresentation was material,meaning that if federal had known the truth,it would have declined to issue the policy or charged a higher rate or premium in light of the increased risk.the jury found in favor of hpsc,concluding that its misrepresentation was not material.
the district court then held a bench trial on the chapter claim.at the close of hpsc case,federal filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.after federal presented its case,the court found that federal initial determination regarding hpsc misrepresentation was made in good faith,but that federal had violated two statutory duties under.laws ch,federal decision to seek rescission without inquiring into the facts or giving hpsc a chance to respond breached its duty under subsection d to conduct a reasonable investigation before rejecting a claim,and its failure to make a reasonable settlement offer upon learning of its mistaken conclusion regarding morrison reconciliation and duties on the fifteen operating accounts violated its duty under subsection f to effectuate prompt,fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.the court concluded that the two statutory violations constituted unfair business practices within the meaning of chapter,and that federal conduct after learning of its flawed assumptions was a breach of its duty of good faith,which merited doubling the damages incurred thereafter.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,federal argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the rescission claim because hpsc misrepresentation objectively increased the risk of loss,or alternatively to a new trial because the district court admitted irrelevant and prejudicial evidence on the materiality issue.federal also contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the unfair trade practices claim because it had a reasonable,plausible basis for denying hpsc claim,even after it learned of its original mistaken conclusion.
preservation of the issues 
as a preliminary matter,hpsc asserts that federal failed to preserve any issues on appeal because it did not renew its rule a motion and it did not make any evidentiary objections at trial.
judgment as a matter of law 
it is now settled that an appellate court can not review the denial of a rule a motion based on the sufficiency of the evidence when the party appealing the verdict failed to renew its sufficiency challenge in the district court pursuant to rule b,cir citing unitherm food,d.despite our previous case law establishing a strict dearth of evidentiary support standard of review when a party failed to comply with the strictures of rule,see,surprenant rivas,cir,the supreme court made it abundantly clear in unitherm food systems,that in the absence of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b,we are utterly without power to direct the district court to enter judgment contrary to the one it had permitted to stand.at quoting cone.pulp paper.
federal failed to renew its rule a motion after the jury verdict,and accordingly we have no power to review the district court denial of judgment as a matter of law on the rescission claim.
the strictures of rule,however,do not apply in trials.specifying the requirements for judgment as a matter of law in jury trials see also colonial penn ins.market planners ins.agency,cir in a jury trial,of course,a party must make and renew at the trial conclusion a rule a motion for judgment as a matter of law in order to preserve sufficiency of the evidence for appellate review.but nothing indicates that a similar rule applies to an appeal of the sufficiency of evidence to support findings or sufficiency of findings to support a judgment following a bench trial.citations omitted.rather,we treat motions for judgment as a matter of law made during bench trials as motions for judgment on partial findings under rule c.see ne.drilling,inner space,cir see also mullin town of fairhaven,cir.federal made such a motion at the close of hpsc case,but then proceeded to put on evidence,thus waiving its right to appeal the denial of that motion.ne.drilling,at.consequently,we treat the arguments federal makes on appeal under the heading of motion for judgment as a matter of law simply as challenges to the factual and legal sufficiency of the district court determinations based on all the evidence,id.emphasis omitted,challenges which federal may raise for the first time on appeal,colonial penn,at we see no reason why a party,following a bench trial,can not argue now for the first time on appeal that the court findings were clearly erroneous or that they can not support the judgment.footnote omitted.
improper admission of evidence 
hpsc also argues that federal did not preserve its right to seek a new trial on the basis of improperly admitted evidence because it did not object to the introduction of the evidence at trial nor file a motion for a new trial under rule b.
while federal did not object to the introduction of any evidence at trial,it did file motions in limine before trial seeking to bar evidence concerning its past underwriting practices.motions in limine preserve evidentiary issues for appeal if the district court made a final and unconditional ruling on the motion no further steps,such as filing a rule b motion are necessary.crowe bolduc,cir.
of course,to preserve the issue,the motion in limine must raise the same evidentiary error raised on appeal.hpsc alternatively argues that federal motion objected to the introduction of evidence regarding prior applications and policies on the ground that such evidence was irrelevant to the narrow issue at trial,that is,whether the misrepresentation on the policy application regarding the petty cash account was material,whereas on appeal federal argues that the evidence was irrelevant because it went to the underwriter subjective state of mind.we fail to see the difference in federal arguments as framed by hpsc,given that federal position on appeal is that the materiality inquiry is an objective one,rather than a subjective one,hence that the underwriter subjective state of mind is irrelevant to the issue of materiality.
evidentiary issue 
having determined that federal preserved the evidentiary issue,we turn to the substance of that issue.we review a district court ruling on the admission of evidence for abuse of discretion.pelletier main street textiles,lp,cir.
federal objects to the district court admission of evidence concerning federal past underwriting of hpsc policies on the ground that such evidence permits a subjective inquiry into what the underwriter would have done had she known the truth,which is irrelevant to the objective standard of whether the misrepresentation increased the insurer risk of loss.we disagree with federal premise 
federal right to rescind hpsc policy is governed by.laws ch,which provides 
no oral or written misrepresentation or warranty made in the negotiation of a policy of insurance by the insured or in his behalf shall be deemed material or defeat or avoid the policy or prevent its attaching unless such misrepresentation or warranty is made with actual intent to deceive,or unless the matter misrepresented or made a warranty increased the risk of loss.
with respect to the materiality of a misrepresentation in an insurance application,a material fact,measured by an objective standard,is one which would naturally influence the judgment of an underwriter in making the contract at all,or in estimating the degree and character of the risk,or in fixing the rate of the premium.chesterton.insurers insolvency fund,second alteration in original quoting employers liab.assur.vella.
thus,the materiality of a misrepresentation depends on what a reasonable underwriter would have done differently had she known the truth behind the misrepresentation.see boston mut.ins.islanders hockey club,cir.there are,as a matter of common sense,a variety of ways to objectively prove what an underwriter would do in a given situation.the parties could offer the testimony of various underwriters or other risk management experts as to what they would have done in the same situation,as both sides did in this case.see hanover ins.leeds,basing a finding of materiality on the testimony of the insurer underwriter.or the parties could provide evidence of what underwriters have in fact done in the past in similar situations.similarly,it makes sense that an insurer might wish to establish what it would do in a particular situation by presenting evidence of its own policies and past practices.see boston mut.ins,at t he statute does not go so far as to require proof by the insurer that it would have acted differently although such proof certainly tends to establish materiality.citing barnstable county ins.gale,tig ins.blacker,basing a finding of materiality on evidence of the insurer own standards.
if federal could present evidence of its own past underwriting practices to establish materiality,it follows that hpsc could do the same to establish immateriality.thus,it is clear that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of federal actions on past applications,including hpsc,since such evidence provides relevant insight into how specific information would influence a reasonable underwriter decisions regarding a particular policy.
chapter claim 
federal also argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on hpsc unfair and deceptive trade practices claim.as explained above,we treat this argument as a challenge to the factual and legal sufficiency of the district court conclusions.following a bench trial on a chapter claim,we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its underlying factual findings for clear error.commercial union ins.seven provinces ins,cir.we also review the district court evaluative judgment s,when applying a legal standard to a particular set of facts,for clear error.roland concord sch,cir.the determination of whether certain conduct is unfair or deceptive is a question of fact,but whether that c
