the general counsel of the national labor relations board brought an unfair labor practice charge against posadas de puerto rico associates,for having unilaterally discontinued certain group insurance policies it had obtained for its employees.posadas now petitions this court for review of a decision and order in which the board concluded that posadas had committed an unfair labor practice.the general counsel has,in turn,to enforce the order.the board found that posadas engaged in an unfair labor practice in violation of sections a and of the national labor relations act,a and,when it unilaterally discontinued a group cancer and life insurance policy that had been in effect for years without first bargaining to impasse with the union.because the board order is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,we deny posadas petition for review,and grant the board to enforce its order.
background 
posadas operates the condado plaza hotel and casino,a hotel in san juan,puerto rico.some of the casino employees are represented by the asociaci√≥n de empleados de casino the union.in april,posadas took out a cancer and life insurance policy with maccabees mutual life insurance company to enable its employees to obtain life and cancer insurance at group rates for almost years,posadas made payroll deductions from its unit employees paychecks to cover premium payments,and remitted the total amount to maccabees and to the other insurance companies.
on april,posadas notified the insurance companies that it would no longer make payroll deductions for the life and cancer policy premiums as of may,and asked the companies to make the necessary arrangements to invoice the employees directly.the next day,april,posadas notified its employees of the decision.shortly thereafter,union president victor villalba contacted eddie ortiz,posadas personnel director,to discuss the matter and explore plausible alternatives.ortiz replied that the matter was out of his hands,and told villalba that the decision to discontinue the group policies had been made higher up.
on april,a week after posadas notified its employees about the decision,kenneth krans of adolfo krans associates,a general insurance agency representing several of the insurance companies that extended group coverage to posadas,wrote a letter replying to posadas april,letter.krans stated that the group coverage was provided through a bonafide group contract,and added that such a contract was applied for and issued under the representation that it was an benefit.krans further stated that his company had no knowledge about any internal agreement between posadas and its employees regarding payment of the policy premiums.
krans told posadas that his company could arrange for individual coverage as of may,but warned that such a change would not be as simple as posadas might have believed,given that the employees previously covered under the group policy would now be subject to individual insurability and rates.krans suggested that posadas extend the policy cancellation date to allow covered employees sufficient time to secure individual coverage.posadas declined to follow krans suggestion,however,and discontinued its withholding thereby cancelled all group cancer and life insurance may.
the union filed an unfair labor practice charge,and the board general counsel filed a complaint against posadas shortly thereafter.on may,the administrative law judge found that posadas actions constituted an unfair labor practice in violation of sections a and of the act,and ordered posadas to resume,upon written request from the union,its past practice of making payroll deductions for the group cancer and life insurance policies,to use best efforts to restore those policies,and to make union employees whole for any losses incurred as a result of the unilateral change.both the general counsel and posadas filed exceptions to the alj findings and conclusions.
on february,the board upheld the alj findings and conclusion that posadas had violated sections a and by unilaterally terminating the payroll deductions for the insurance premiums for the group life and cancer insurance policies without bargaining with the union over the change.the board modified the remedies decreed by the alj and ordered posadas to restore the status quo ante by resuming its past practice of making payroll deductions for the group cancer and life insurance policies,restoring the policies for previously covered unit employees,and making the employees whole for any losses they may have suffered as a result of the unilateral change.additionally,the board ordered posadas to bargain with the union in the future over any changes in the group cancer and life insurance policies that affect unit employees.

we review the board conclusion of law de novo,nlrb beverly,cir,and take the board findings of fact to be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.see also e.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.beverly,at.moreover,the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.id.in particular,the credibility determinations of the administrative law judge who heard and saw the witnesses are entitled to great weight.nlrb hospital san pablo,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
an employer commits an unfair labor practice if,without bargaining to impasse,it effects a unilateral change in an existing term or condition of employment.visiting nurse servs.nlrb,cir,cert.denied,d litton financial printing div.nlrb,d.the board has the primary responsibility of marking out the scope of the statutory language and of the statutory duty to bargain.ford motor nlrb,d.particularly with respect to determinations that fall within the board special expertise,such as whether an issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining,the board is entitled to considerable deference,and its determination must be upheld if reasonable and consistent with the policies of the act.id.at.see also beverly,at.
we have long held that an insurance benefit is a mandatory subject of bargaining and that unilateral actions regarding such subjects are proscribed by the act.allied chem.alkali workers of am.pittsburgh plate glass,d citing cross nlrb,cir.insurance benefits have been typically regarded as mandatory subjects of bargaining because they provide direct and immediate economic benefits from the employment relationship,and because they provide a financial cushion in the event of illness or injury at less cost than such a cushion could be obtained through contracts or insurance negotiated individually.cross,at.
posadas principal argument is that the withholding practice was neither a benefit nor a term or condition of employment,but rather a mere internal mechanism that it was free to eliminate unilaterally when it so chose.posadas contends that it was not required to bargain to impasse before making the unilateral change because it did not contribute to the premium payments,but merely collected the premiums and remitted them to the insurance companies.posadas concedes,as it must,that an insurance benefit is vital to employees and is a mandatory subject of bargaining,but argues that the impact of its decision on the group insurance policies was merely incidental.
posadas attempt to frame its actions as having to do only with an internal company mechanism is disingenuous.the record plainly shows that the withholding practice and the group insurance policy were inextricably intertwined.the april exchange of letters between posadas and krans reveals that the unilateral decision that posadas was contemplating would have had the effect of eliminating the group insurance policy altogether.a corollary of that decision,therefore,would be that previously covered employees would be forced to secure individual coverage at individual policy rates.thus,by eliminating the withholding practice,posadas did much more than eliminate an int
