after plaintiff hyundai motor america hyundai placed certain features on its website,a third party sued hyundai for patent infringement.hyundai sought a defense from its liability insurers,defendants national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh and american home assurance company.because the alleged patent infringement concerned one of hyundai advertising methods,hyundai concluded that the suit alleged an advertising injury,as that term is defined in the insurance policy.defendants disagreed and declined to defend hyundai,which defended itself.hyundai later sued defendants in this diversity action,seeking to recover its defense costs in the earlier action.the district court agreed with defendants that the alleged patent infringement did not constitute an advertising injury under the insurance policy and granted summary judgment to defendants.on de novo review,fleming yuma reg l med,cir,we reverse and remand.
factual and procedural history 
like most if not all major corporations,hyundai maintains a website.at issue here are two features of the website a build your own vehicle byo feature and a parts catalogue feature.the byo feature allowed users to navigate through a series of questions on a menu to select,for example,colors,engine and transmission types,and options.in response to the user input,the byo feature displayed customized vehicle images and pricing information.the parts catalogue feature similarly allowed users to navigate through a series of menus to choose,for example,a model,engine system,and and displayed customized parts images and pricing information.
orion ip,llc orion,a company,holds the rights to two patents that are relevant here.patent number patent concerns a method of generating customized product proposals for potential customers of an automobile dealer.the patent explains that preprinted brochures used by car dealerships are,because they can show pictures of only a few combinations of cars,despite the many different options available.at the same time,a preprinted brochure is,because it contains a complicated pricing matrix,much of which is not of interest to a particular customer,since the customer will typically be interested in the price for a single,or relatively few,combinations of options for the car.in containing all of this varied and generic information in an attempt to be all things to every customer,the preprinted brochures actually are of limited value to any particular customer.the patent description also notes that these brochures become quickly out of date because of price changes and unavailable models.the present invention solves these problems by utilizing a system to dynamically create customized,printed proposals for potential purchasers of a product.the patent abstract states that the invention is a n electronic system for creating customized product proposals that stores a plurality of pictures and text segments to be used as building blocks in creating the proposal.the system queries a user to determine a customer needs and interests.based upon the answers to the queries,the system selects the appropriate picture and text building blocks to fill in proposal templates.based upon the customer answers to the queries,the system links product pictures,environment pictures,and textual descriptions together in a customized proposal.since each proposal is customized for a particular customer,each proposal will have a much more persuasive effect in selling the product.
patent number patent concerns a similar method,but is aimed at the sale of parts.the patent is aimed at aiding parts salespersons and works much the same way as the patent.
in,orion sued hyundai and nineteen other car companies for patent infringement.orion alleged that hyundai byo feature infringed the patent and that its sales parts catalogue infringed the patent.specifically,in two paragraphs that,except for the patent number,are worded identically,orion alleged 
defendant hyundai has been and now is directly infringing,and indirectly infringing by way of inducing infringement contributing to the infringement of the patent or patent in the state of texas,in this judicial district,and elsewhere in the united states by,among other things,methods practiced on its various websites including but not limited to making and using supply chain methods,sales methods,sales systems,marketing methods,marketing systems and inventory systems covered by one or more claims of the patent or patent to the injury of orion.
hyundai sought a defense from its insurers,defendants.defendants had issued an insurance policy to hyundai with the following pertinent provisions 
coverage personal and advertising injury liability 
insuring agreement 
we defendants will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages caused by,among other things,advertising injury.
b.this insurance applies to 
advertising injury caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods,products or services 
advertising injury means injury arising out of one or more of the following offenses 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services 
oral or written publication of material that violates a person right of privacy 
misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing business or 
infringement of copyright,title,or slogan.
emphasis added.
hyundai asserted that defendants had a duty to defend hyundai because orion claims constituted allegations of,among other things,m isappropriation of advertising ideas.defendants disputed that interpretation of the coverage and declined to defend hyundai.hyundai thereafter defended itself in the orion action.a jury found against hyundai and awarded the million in damages.
hyundai then filed this action against defendants in federal district court.hyundai alleges four claims,all of which proceed from the premise that the insurance policy obligated defendants to defend hyundai in the action.hyundai seeks declaratory relief and its reasonable costs of defense but does not seek to recover the amount of the jury verdict.
the district court granted summary judgment to defendants.the court held that patent infringement is not an advertising injury.the court also held,as an alternative basis for granting summary judgment,that hyundai was unable to demonstrate a causal connection between its advertising and orion alleged injury.the court did not reach the question whether the byo feature and the online parts catalogue constitute advertising as defined by the relevant california authority.
hyundai timely appeals.
discussion 
hyundai argues that the orion action constituted a lawsuit alleging an advertising injury under the duty to defend clause in the insurance policy.more specifically,hyundai argues that the patent infringement claims in the orion action were claims alleging the misappropriation of advertising ideas.
california law governs in this diversity action.travelers prop.cas.of am.conocophillips,cir see generally vestar dev.ii,llc dynamics,cir describing the method for determining questions of state law.under california law,interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law.hameid fire ins.of hartford,cal th,d.
an insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured.as with all contracts,the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation.the parties intent is inferred from the clear and explicit meaning of these provisions,interpreted in their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.thus,if the meaning a lay person would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous,we apply that meaning.
id.citation,ellipses,and some internal quotation marks omitted.
the general principles governing duty to defend clauses are well settled.liability insurers owe a duty to defend their insureds for claims that potentially fall within the policy coverage provisions.the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the obligation to defend can be excused only when the third party complaint can by no conceivable theory raise a single issue which could bring it within the policy coverage.lebas fashion imps.of usa,itt hartford ins.group,th,d,emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.this presumption in favor of the insured applies to factual disputes,but not legal disputes.id.any doubt as to whether the facts give rise to a duty to defend is resolved in the insured favor.id.but it is settled that a potential for coverage can not be based on an unresolved legal dispute concerning policy interpretation which is ultimately resolved in favor of the insurer.id.in other words,if the unresolved legal dispute ultimately is resolved in a way showing that the insurer had no duty to defend,then the insurer has no liability to the insured.otherwise the insurer is liable to the insured.we turn,then,to the legal question whether defendants had a duty to defend hyundai.
determination of the duty to defend depends,in the first instance,on a comparison between the allegations of the complaint and the terms of the policy.but the duty also exists where extrinsic facts known to the insurer suggest that the claim may be covered.moreover,that the precise causes of action pled by the complaint may fall outside policy coverage does not excuse the duty to defend where,under the facts alleged,reasonably inferable,or otherwise known,the complaint could fairly be amended to state a covered liability.

the california supreme court has specified three required elements to establish a duty to defend for an advertising injury 
i n order for hyundai to have a reasonable expectation of coverage under defendants policy for advertising injury it must show that it was engaged in advertising during the policy period when the alleged advertising injury occurred orion allegations created a potential for liability under one of the covered offenses,misappropriation of advertising ideas and a causal connection existed between the alleged injury and the advertising.
hameid,d,at.the parties dispute all three elements.
advertising 
the term advertising means widespread promotional activities usually directed to the public at large,but it does not encompass solicitation.id.at.plaintiff argues that it placed the byo on its website to promote its products a website is plainly directed to the public at large therefore,the byo feature constitutes advertising.defendants respond that,because the byo feature creates customized proposals specific to an individual user,the byo feature effectively is solicitation.the district court did not reach this issue,because it held that hyundai can not meet the other two requirements.
as noted above,d etermination of the duty to defend depends,in the first instance,on a comparison between the allegations of the complaint and the terms of the policy.scottsdale,d,at.the reason for this rule is that,when the insurer is presented with the opportunity to defend,the insurer has,at a minimum,a copy of the complaint.rombe allied ins,th,d.here,orion alleged that hyundai byo feature constituted making and using supply chain methods,sales methods,sales systems,marketing methods,marketing systems and inventory systems.emphasis added.orion evidently viewed the byo feature as,at least in part,marketing methods or marketing systems and described the feature as such in its complaint.the description in the complaint marketing methods or marketing systems fits squarely within the definition of advertising widespread promotional activities usually directed to the public at large,hameid,d,at.comparing the complaint with the insurance policy,as the california supreme court requires,scottsdale,d,at,we conclude that orion complaint alleged advertising activities.
in some circumstances,however,we also may consider extrinsic facts known to the insurer.id.here,it is safe to assume that defendants had access to hyundai website and could view the byo feature in making their determination whether to defend relying on the california supreme court decision in hameid,defendants argue that each user invocation of the byo feature constitutes an individualized solicitation.
in hameid,the plaintiff hairdresser left his employer and started a new beauty parlor.d,at.the former employer sued hameid for stealing its customer list and soliciting its customers.id.the court addressed hameid argument that advertising should be interpreted to include solicitation.id.at.the court surveyed the existing case law and sided with the majority approach,which requires widespread distribution of promotional material to the public at large.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.applied to the case at hand,the court held that hameid agents 
made telephone calls and sent mailers to the former employer customers advising them of their new location and of hameid lower prices.these activities strongly resemble the solicitations of a competitor customers in one case the recruiting letters to a competitor employees in another case and the subcontractor submission of bids in a third case all of which were held to be solicitation,not advertising.
id.at see also rombe,d at holding that an breakfast meeting with clients constitutes solicitation and not advertising under hameid hayward centennial ins,cir holding that a claim for wrongful solicitation absolved the insurer of the duty to defend because,under hameid,solicitation is not advertising.
defendants correctly observe that the byo feature has some similarities to solicitation.after all,the byo feature does little,if anything,until the user inputs some personal preferences.the patent raison is to create customized proposals,specific to an individual user.in this way,each invocation of the byo feature by a given user is somewhat similar to an individualized solicitation like the ones discussed in hameid.
but defendants attempt to fit the byo feature into the framework of hameid ultimately is unpersuasive.the court in hameid focused on the fact that the solicitations were limited to a discrete number of known potential customers.it rejected a characterization of that form of solicitation as advertising,because it was not widely distributed to the public at large.here,the byo feature is widely distributed to the public at large,to millions of unknown potential customers,even if the precise information conveyed to each user varies with user input.all the users are still using the same byo feature.
an analogy to a hypothetical invention in the age helps to illustrate why the byo feature advertises cars to the general public.instead of the,internet version of the byo feature,imagine a more crude,version.the invention includes tabbed sliders and plastic overlays the user chooses various options and follows directions to assemble the various physical parts.the resulting composite display shows the user choices,along with pricing information displayed in a window.and imagine that hyundai included one of these crude forms of the byo feature as an insert in a newspaper.it seems clear that this invention would constitute advertising,even though the individual newspaper readers might each select different options and arrive at entirely different final displays.hyundai byo feature is much more akin to that example than it is to the individualized solicitations sent to a specified,extant customer list discussed in hameid,or to the other individualized solicitations discussed in that case.
we conclude that the byo feature constituted advertising.
patent infringement as misappropriation of advertising ideas 
hyundai next must establish that orion patent infringement claim constituted a misappropriation of advertising ideas.in mez industries,pacific national insurance,th,d,the california court of appeal explained that a contextual reasonableness analysis applies to that question.we must determine,in the context of the case and in light of common sense,whether a lay person reasonably would read the phrase misappropriation of advertising ideas to include the patent infringement claim at issue.id.more preci
