discussion 
a.the foreign affairs doctrine and field preemption 
the constitution gives the federal government the exclusive authority to administer foreign affairs.see,united states pink,power over external affairs is not shared by the states it is vested in the national government exclusively.hines davidowitz,the federal government,representing as it does the collective interests of the states,is entrusted with full and exclusive responsibility for the conduct of affairs with foreign sovereignties our system of government is such that the interest of the cities,counties and states,no less than the interest of the people of the whole nation,imperatively requires that federal power in the field affecting foreign relations be left entirely free from local interference.
under the foreign affairs doctrine,state laws that intrude on this exclusively federal power are preempted.foreign affairs preemption encompasses two related,but distinct,doctrines conflict preemption and field preemption.am.ins.ass garamendi.under conflict preemption,a state law must yield when it conflicts with an express federal foreign policy.see id.at the exercise of the federal executive authority means that state law must give way where,as here,there is evidence of clear conflict between the policies adopted by the two.von saher norton simon museum of art at pasadena,cir the supreme court has declared state laws unconstitutional under the foreign affairs doctrine when the state law conflicts with a federal action such as a treaty,federal statute,or express executive branch policy,cert.denied.
but the supreme court has made clear that,even in the absence of any express federal policy,a state law still may be preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine if it intrudes on the field of foreign affairs without addressing a traditional state responsibility.this concept is known as field preemption or dormant foreign affairs preemption.deutsch turner,cir.
in pink,at,and hines,at,the supreme court recognized that the constitution implicitly grants to the federal government a broad foreign affairs power.see also deutsch,at because the constitution mentions no general foreign affairs power,and because only a few specified powers related to foreign affairs are expressly denied the states,one might assume that,with certain exceptions,states are free to pursue their own foreign policies.this is not,however,the case.to the contrary,the supreme court has long viewed the foreign affairs powers specified in the text of the constitution as reflections of a generally applicable constitutional principle that power over foreign affairs is reserved to the federal government.the existence of this general foreign affairs power implies that,even when the federal government has taken no action on a particular foreign policy issue,the state generally is not free to make its own foreign policy on that subject.
for example,in zschernig miller,the supreme court recognized that,even in the absence of any treaty,federal statute,or executive order,a state law may be unconstitutional if it disturb s foreign relations or establish es its own foreign policy.there,the court considered the constitutionality of an oregon probate law that imposed conditions under which aliens could receive oregon property by succession or testamentary disposition.id.at.the state statute provided for escheat unless the nonresident alien could demonstrate that the foreign country from which the alien came granted various reciprocal rights to united states citizens.id.
the oregon statute conflicted with no express policy of the federal government.id.at.indeed,the federal government amicus curiae brief stated the government does not contend that the application of the oregon escheat statute in the circumstances of this case unduly interferes with the united states conduct of foreign relations.id.at internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
but the absence of a conflict did not settle the question of preemption.instead,the court analyzed the purpose and operation of the oregon statute to determine whether it constituted an intrusion by the state into the field of foreign affairs which the constitution entrusts to the president and the congress.id.at.in order for field preemption to apply,the oregon law had to have more than some incidental or indirect effect in foreign countries.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the court concluded that application of the oregon law invited courts to conduct detailed inquiries into the political systems and conduct of foreign nations.id.at.in applying the statute,
the probate courts of various states have launched inquiries into the type of governments that obtain in particular foreign nations whether aliens under their law have enforceable rights,whether the rights are merely dispensations turning upon the whim or caprice of government officials,whether the representation of consuls,ambassadors,and other representatives of foreign nations is credible or made in good faith,whether there is in the actual administration in the particular foreign system of law any element of confiscation.
id.at.the application of the law therefore required judgments about the actions and policies of foreign nations and the credibility of foreign representatives.as one reads the oregon decisions,it seems that foreign policy attitudes,the freezing or thawing of the cold war,and the like are the real desiderata.yet they of course are matters for the federal government,not for local probate courts.id.at footnote omitted.the court also noted that s uch attitudes are not confined to the oregon courts,citing a number of decisions from other states expressing a desire to keep united states money out of the grasp of communist or authoritarian nations.id.at.
although the oregon probate statute conflicted with no federal law and appeared,at first blush,simply to regulate property a traditional area of state responsibility the supreme court held that the law was preempted under the foreign affairs doctrine.id.at.the statute as construed seems to make unavoidable judicial criticism of nations established on a more authoritarian basis than our own.it seems inescapable that the type of probate law that oregon enforces affects international relations in a persistent and subtle way.id.at.
more than three decades later,in garamendi,the supreme court clarified when the application of the field preemption doctrine might be appropriate.there,the court addressed the constitutionality of california holocaust victim insurance relief act of hvira,which required any insurer doing business in california to disclose information about all policies it sold in europe between and.garamendi,at.although the court ultimately concluded that hvira was preempted because of a direct conflict with express federal policy,the court also provided valuable insight into the doctrine of field preemption.the court explained 
the two positions conflict preemption and field preemption can be seen as complementary.if a state were simply to take a position on a matter of foreign policy with no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility,field preemption might be the appropriate doctrine,whether the national government had acted and,if it had,without reference to the degree of any conflict,the principle having been established that the constitution entrusts foreign policy exclusively to the national government.where,however,a state has acted within what justice harlan called its traditional competence,but in a way that affects foreign relations,it might make good sense to require a conflict,of a clarity or substantiality that would vary with the strength or the traditional importance of the state concern asserted.
id.at citations omitted.with respect to hvira,the court rejected the contention that the statute concerned a traditional state responsibility merely because it involved insurance.noting the narrow scope of the statute and the nature of the legislative findings accompanying it,the court observed that there is no serious doubt that the state interest actually underlying hvira is concern for the several thousand holocaust survivors said to be living in the state.id.at.thus,garamendi suggests that,under a field preemption analysis,when a state law has no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility and intrudes on the federal government foreign affairs power,the supremacy clause prevents the state statute from taking effect.
in von saher,we applied those principles to a california statute that extended the statute of limitations for civil actions to recover looted artwork.after concluding that the statute,did not conflict directly with any express federal foreign policy,we conducted a thorough field preemption analysis and held the statute unconstitutional.
first,we addressed the question whether section concerned an area of traditional state responsibility.von saher,at.we acknowledged that the general subject area of the statute,the regulation of stolen property,is traditionally an area of state responsibility.id.at.but we did not stop there.instead,we inquired into the real purpose of the statute to determine whether it concerned an area of traditional state responsibility 
property,of course,is traditionally regulated by the state.but can not be fairly categorized as a garden variety property regulation.section does not apply to all claims of stolen art,or even all claims of art looted in war.the statute addresses only the claims of holocaust victims and their heirs.section b.
courts have consistently struck down state laws which purport to regulate an area of traditional state competence,but in fact,affect foreign affairs.see,garamendi,at rejecting purported state interest in regulating insurance business and blue sky laws crosby foreign trade council,rejecting purported state interest in taxing and spending zschernig miller,rejecting purported state interest in regulating descent of property deutsch,at rejecting purported state interest in procedural rules.
the garamendi court in dicta rejected the traditional state interests advanced by california in support of hvira,finding instead that the real purpose of the state law was the concern for the several thousand holocaust survivors said to be living in the state.garamendi,at.though purports to regulate property,an area traditionally left to the states,like hvira,real purpose is to provide relief to holocaust victims and their heirs.
von saher,at parallel citations omitted.we concluded that,although the statute goal of providing relief to holocaust victims was laudable,i n so doing,california can make no serious claim to be addressing a traditional state responsibility.id.at quoting garamendi,at.
we then turned to the question whether section intruded on a power expressly or impliedly reserved by the constitution to the federal government.id.at.section attempted to provide redress for wartime wrongs,and t he legislative findings accompanying the statute repeatedly reference the nazi regime,nazi persecution,and the many atroci
