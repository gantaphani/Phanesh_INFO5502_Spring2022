opinion of the court 
acceptance insurance acceptance brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment to resolve its rights and duties under an insurance policy issued to mon valley steel mon valley.the policy in question was a general liability policy for the clyde mine,located in western pennsylvania.acceptance potential liability arose as a result of an action against mon valley brought by the parents of joelene bowers,who was pushed to her death through an open shaft in the clyde mine.acceptance sought to establish that the clyde mine insurance policy was effectively terminated prior to joelene bowers death and,thus,that acceptance is not obligated to provide a defense for mon valley or to pay for any recovery.
the district court entered summary judgment against acceptance,holding that under regulations of the pennsylvania department of environmental protection dep,the clyde mine policy could not effectively be canceled until the dep was notified.the district court further held that no reasonable jury could find from the undisputed facts that acceptance had notified the dep of its cancellation of the clyde mine policy and that therefore the policy was still in effect at the time of joelene bowers death.we hold that,under the applicable dep regulations,notification was not a necessary precondition of cancellation.we therefore reverse.
in,mon valley contacted independent insurance broker phillip harvey of phillip harvey,pjh to obtain general liability insurance for mining operations at the clyde mine.harvey contacted brokers to locate a policy.through tri city brokerage agreement with acceptance risk managers,acceptance underwriters,acceptance issued a policy to mon valley.
on february,acceptance issued a certificate of insurance to mon valley for a general liability policy covering the clyde mine.the policy coverage was to be effective from december,through december,and was subsequently extended through january.the insurance policy contained no provision requiring acceptance to notify the dep before canceling the policy.
mon valley last valid permit to operate the clyde mine had expired on october,and mon valley had ceased all mining operations on approximately that date.harvey,acting on mon valley behalf,submitted the certificate of insurance to the dep as proof of the requisite insurance coverage in support of mon valley application for a renewal of its expired mining permit.on march,and again on may,the dep notified mon valley that its application for a mining license could not be processed because of several deficiencies in the application and the accompanying proof of insurance.because mon valley did not make the necessary corrections or request an informal hearing,the dep denied the license application on november.
mon valley,which financed the policy through first premium services,first premium,never actually made a premium payment on the policy.on march,first premium used its power of attorney pursuant to an agreement with mon valley to notify acceptance to cancel the policy for nonpayment of premiums.although it is not clear on what date acceptance actually canceled the policy,it is undisputed that acceptance took actions which,absent a statutory or regulatory bar,would have terminated the policy by july,at the latest.
pjh had a general business practice of sending notices of cancellation to both certificate holders and state administrative agencies.harvey testified that a notice of cancellation addressed to the dep was present in pjh files.however,harvey could not testify from personal knowledge concerning the actual preparation or mailing of the notice.moreover,the dep file on mon valley did not contain a copy of the notice.
in march,the bowerses commenced an action in the court of common pleas of greene county,pennsylvania,captioned bowers mon valley steel,et,case no.the greene county suit,to recover damages relating to the murder of joelene bowers at the clyde mine on january or.acceptance then brought the instant action,seeking a declaratory judgment that the clyde mine policy was effectively canceled prior to joelene bowers death and that acceptance therefore had no duty to defend or indemnify mon valley in connection with the greene county suit.
following discovery,acceptance moved for summary judgment,arguing that the undisputed facts showed that the clyde mine policy had been effectively terminated prior to joelene bowers death.acceptance argued that it had no duty to notify the dep prior to cancellation because no contractual provision,statute,or regulation specifically so required.in the alternative,acceptance argued that,by application of the pennsylvania mailbox rule,the undisputed facts gave rise to a presumption that a notice of cancellation had been received by the dep and that there was insufficient evidence in the record to rebut that presumption.
the bowerses and utica also moved for summary judgment,arguing that the applicable dep regulations mandated that acceptance notify the dep before its attempted cancellation became effective.the bowerses and utica also argued that acceptance had not provided sufficient evidence to trigger the mailbox rule.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,concluding that the dep coal mining regulations establish a strict administrative scheme which unequivocally prohibits an insurer from cancelling a policy without first providing notification to the agency.at,app.at.in reaching this conclusion,the magistrate judge relied on d,which outlines the requirements for insurance policies submitted with a permit application.the magistrate judge also concluded that acceptance had not adduced sufficient evidence to show that notice had been given to the dep.the magistrate judge wrote that acceptance c ould not overcome this significant and undisputed fact the dep license file for mon valley does not contain a cancellation notice.at,app.at.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted to utica and the bowerses.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation,and acceptance then took this appeal.our standard of review with respect to the grant of summary judgment is plenary.waldorf shuta,cir.the appellees in this appeal are utica mutual insurance utica,the surety on reclamation and subsidence bonds posted on behalf of mon valley,and the bowerses.
acceptance raises two issues on appeal.the first is whether the district court erred in concluding that the dep regulations require that a surface and underground coal mining general liability insurance carrier notify the dep prior to canceling an insurance policy.the second issue is whether the district court erred in concluding that the undisputed facts did not allow acceptance to benefit from the presumption of receipt accorded to items placed in the mail under the pennsylvania mailbox rule.we hold that acceptance had no duty to notify the dep before canceling the policy,and we therefore need not reach the question whether acceptance adduced sufficient evidence to take advantage of the pennsylvania mailbox rule.
pursuant to the authority granted by the pennsylvania surface mining conservation and reclamation act of may,as amended.ann,the dep has issued regulations governing surface and underground coal mining and reclamation activities.see et.under these regulations,it is illegal to operate a coal mine in pennsylvania without a permit from the dep.see.furthermore,provides that an applicant for a coal mining permit must provide proof of adequate insurance
