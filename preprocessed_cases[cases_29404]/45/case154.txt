the principal issue in this appeal is whether the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,provides a covered employer and its insurance carrier with a statutory right to seek damages against an injured employee attorneys for legal malpractice in pursuing the employee claims against a responsible third party.we hold the lhwca provides no such right.
edgar colón was an employee of plaintiff itt federal services itt,stationed at a united states naval installation in puerto rico.he was injured when a navy pilot errantly dropped two bombs near the control tower where colón was working as a target control specialist.colón suffered serious injuries.as a result,colón,through his attorneys,defendants harry anduze montaño and noelma colón cordovés,filed an administrative compensation claim against itt and its insurance carrier claim administrator.itt insurance carrier is plaintiff pacific employers insurance pei.colón sought benefits under the defense base act,which by its terms incorporates the lhwca.see id.colón eventually settled his compensation claim with itt and pei in exchange for a total benefit package exceeding.
prior to the aforementioned settlement,defendant attorneys also filed suit in federal district court on colón behalf under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,b.the complaint,which sought million in damages,named the united states department of the navy and itt as defendants.the district court dismissed the tort claims against the navy because the ftca precludes suits against military departments.see id,a.rather,the united states is the only proper party defendant to a ftca suit.see id.b.the district court dismissed the pendent tort claims against itt because the lhwca provided colón an exclusive remedy as against his employer for his injuries see a.in the meantime,colón had settled his administrative claim with itt and pei.presumably satisfied with his settlement,colón did not seek to amend his complaint to name the united states as a party defendant or to appeal the district court judgment.that judgment became final after the ftca two year statute of limitations had expired.see b.
over in the hole,plaintiffs itt and pei subsequently filed the present suit alleging they had a statutory right under the lhwca to seek damages against defendants for legal malpractice in pursuing colón ftca action against the government relying on our decision in moores greenberg,cir,the district court dismissed plaintiffs claim pursuant to.b,and plaintiffs appealed.our review is de novo.see isla nena air,cessna aircraft,cir.
subsection b of the lhwca,as amended,provides a limited right of subrogation to the employer where its employee recovers under the lhwca for injuries proximately caused by a third person 
acceptance of compensation under an award in a compensation order filed by a deputy commissioner,an administrative law judge,or the benefits review board shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all rights of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person unless such person shall commence an action against such third person within six months after such acceptance.
b.if the employee commences an action against the third person as provided in the lhwca,a corresponding judicially created lien attaches in favor of the employer for benefits paid up to the amount of the employee recovery.see edmonds compagnie generale transatlantique,d hartford accident indem.oceancarrier shipholding,cir.if the employee does not institute suit within the six month period,the employer then has ninety days to institute its own suit against the third person.b.if the ninety days elapses without the employer having filed suit,the right of action against the third person reverts to the employee.id.where an employer insurance carrier has paid the compensation due under the lhwca,the act subrogates the employer rights to the carrier.id.h.
according to plaintiffs,b creates a subrogation lien in their favor on any legal malpractice claim colón might have against defendants unfortunately for plaintiffs,neither narrow language nor our precedent construing it supports their position section is entitled compensation for injuries where third persons are liable.the lhwca defines the term injury as an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment id.see also id.the singular includes the plural.subsection a of speaks of third person liability on account of a disability for which compensation is payable under this chapter id.a.subsection b provides under specified circumstances an assignment to the employer of all rights of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person id.b.
the only injury addresses is the harm colón sustained in the course of employment that is,the harm caused by the navy pilot errant bombing of colón position in the control tower.the third person liability addresses is the liability of the person or entity causing the disability for which compensation is payable under the is,the liability of the united states under the ftca for the navy pilot negligence.simply put,the injury,if any,for which colón attorneys,defendants,are responsible in no sense occurred in the course of colón employment.nor in any sense did defendants purported misfeasance entitle colón to compensation under the lhwca.thus,b limited assignment of rights to an employer does not encompass plaintiffs present claim against defendants.
the result we reach is consistent with first circuit precedent.albeit in a factually different context,we reasoned in moores,at,that a maritime employer compensation lien for benefits paid an employee under the lhwca died of natural causes when the supposedly culpable third parties were exonerated in a third party action.id.in upholding an instruction directing the jury to reduce any malpractice award by the amount of compensation benefits paid the employee an instruction designed to prevent double recovery,we rejected the argument that the employee might take a double dip from his exchequer because,according to the employee,such lien would attach to the proceeds of the employee award against his former attorney.id.we explained that a physical injury arising in the course of a covered worker employment is separate and distinct from a legal injury arising out of an attorney misfeasance in pursuing a third party tortfeasor responsible for such injury.id.consistent with b narrow language,we concluded the employer right to reimbursement for compensation paid extends only to damages recovered for the injury sustained in the course of employment and no further.id.
to be sure,two recognized purposes of are to protect employers who incur absolute liability under the lhwca and to place ultimate responsibility upon the tortfeasor whose negligence directly resulted in such liability.see louviere shell oil,cir wisdom,that our decision might ostensibly frustrate these purposes,however,is insufficient reason to ignore the language of and our prior precedent.prior to the dismissal of colón ftca suit,to which plaintiff itt was a party,itt could have sought to protect its interests in a number of ways.among the alternatives available under the rules of procedure,plaintiffs could have filed a third party complaint against the united states,filed a cross complaint against the navy and then moved to substitute the united states as the proper defendant,or asked the court to join the united states as a defendant and realign the parties to reflect their real interests.at the same time,to protect its interest,plaintiff pei could have sought to intervene in colón suit and accompany itt in its pursuit of the united states.that plaintiffs chose not to protect their interests in one or more of these ways but instead chose to sue colón attorneys does not provide us license to reach the result they desire 
plaintiffs further alleged defendants breached a legal duty owed to them under puerto rico law in pursuing colón ftca action against the united states.we,like the district court,reject any suggestion that defendants owed plaintiffs such a duty under the circumstances o
