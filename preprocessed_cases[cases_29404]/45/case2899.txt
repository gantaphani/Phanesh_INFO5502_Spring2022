a law firm sustained water damage that had the effect of reducing the number of hours billed to clients during the week after the flood.the firm made a claim under its business interruption insurance policy,asserting that,during the period,its attorneys billed less than usual.the insurer offered to settle the claim on terms that the firm rejected.this lawsuit followed.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer.we conclude that summary judgment was proper because the law firm did not suspend operations within the meaning of the policy.rather,it continued to operate,albeit at reduced capacity.
background 
buxbaum chakmak is a law corporation with offices in claremont and newport beach,california.on the weekend of saturday,february,a water pipe broke at the claremont office,flooding the premises.monday,february,was washington birthday,and the office was closed.when employees arrived for work on tuesday,february,they found that most of the floor was covered by two inches of water,the carpet was ruined,the walls and wallpaper were soaked,the furniture was wet,and the computer system had crashed due to moisture.
the law firm had a insurance policy with aetna services.the policy also provided coverage for loss of business income,commonly called business interruption insurance.on february,the firm submitted a property damage claim under the policy and,within a few months,aetna paid the firm on the claim 
on june,john chakmak,one of the firm principals,wrote to aetna,making a claim under the business interruption coverage for t ime lost by attorneys due to water damage because of flooded office and necessary damage repair.on the firm letterhead were the two office addresses and the names of seven attorneys.attached to the letter was a list containing the names of three attorneys,the number of hours they had lost due to the flood,their hourly billing rates,and the total dollar amount of the loss.the list made no reference to the firm other attorneys,and the record is silent as to their work.
the business interruption coverage provided that the insurer will pay for the actual loss of business income the insured sustain s due to the necessary suspension of its operations during the period of restoration.operations was defined as the insured business activities occurring at the described premises.the coverage applied to the premises at both of the law firm locations.but,unlike the claremont office,the newport beach office apparently did not suffer any type of damage,and business continued there as usual.on appeal,the parties focus on whether there was a loss of business income at the claremont office.consistent with that approach,we use the terms law firm and firm to refer to the claremont office only.
by letter dated july,matthew tait,an aetna claims representative,informed chakmak that y our policy provides coverage for business income loss which is net income net profit or loss before income taxes that would have been earned or incurred.the policy does not provide for lost time continuing normal operating expenses is an element to be considered when evaluating your business income loss.please provide us with documentation to support your net income loss.
during the next several months,chakmak and tait discussed the policy provisions and the information aetna needed to process the firm claims.on the property damage claim,tait visited the firm claremont office on january,and learned that certain items,including the ruined wallpaper and paint damage,had not yet been repaired.within two weeks,tait completed his estimate to finish the repairs.on february,aetna paid the firm.in total,aetna paid on the property damage claim.
on the business interruption claim,tait retained campos stratis,an accounting firm,for assistance.robert salata,a forensic accountant,was assigned to the matter.by letter to chakmak dated january,salata requested the daily time sheets from january through march for the three attorneys claiming a loss of time.salata also requested a profit and loss statement for the calendar year.
on may,chakmak informed tait by letter that,in order to preserve the confidential and privileged information of the firm clients,certain information would have to be redacted from the time sheets,namely,the clients names and the description of the services rendered.the following day,chakmak mailed the redacted time sheets and the profit and lost statement to salata.over the next few months,campos stratis contacted chakmak with questions and obtained additional information.
in calculating lost income,campos stratis first determined the average number of hours worked per day before the flood.those figures were then compared to the actual number of hours worked after the flood.as it turned out,the time worked by each of the attorneys after the flood was close to or exceeded the average time worked in the weeks before the flood.campos stratis concluded that the law firm had sustained a loss of income in the amount of.
on september,campos stratis sent its report,which included various schedules of data,to tait,who in turn forwarded the report to chakmak.on march,chakmak wrote to tait,describing the report as completely erroneous because campos stratis had categorized several hours of work as time chargeable to a client billable time when it was actually spent on tasks such as cleaning up the office.of course,the campos stratis report was based on the law firm redacted time sheets,which did not provide a description of the work performed.
to assist campos stratis in reevaluating the business interruption claim,chakmak submitted a new set of time sheets that,while not disclosing any client information,did provide a description of the services rendered.for example,the time sheets showed that on the wednesday following the flood,one of the attorneys spent four hours on problems and about five hours on billable matters.in general,the time sheets reflected that kind of daily mix for all three attorneys.
with the more detailed time sheets,campos stratis prepared a second report with revised schedules,showing a loss of business income totaling.in a transmittal letter to tait,campos stratis stated p lease be advised that we believe there are the following issues that need to be considered and evaluated regarding the actual loss sustained a did the insured really lose the time b a firm does not collect of the amount billed.what percentage of the amounts billed are actually collected that amount should be applied to the calculated fees lost.
on may,tait sent chakmak the revised schedules.on may,they spoke by telephone,discussing the firm claim for lost income.tait offered to settle the matter for.
by letter dated june,chakmak informed tait that the firm disagreed with aetna interpretation of the insurance policy.on june,tait sent chakmak a letter,stating there has been and continues to be some question regarding the actual business loss sustained.nevertheless,in good faith,we have attempted to adjust this portion of your claim based on information and documentation you have provided us.the most we have been able to estimate owing for your loss of business income,giving your claim every reasonable benefit of the doubt is enclosed is a check reflecting this amount as payment for this portion of your claim.on august,chakmak returned the check by mail.
tait wrote to chakmak again on october,stating a s you previously have been advised,aetna reserves all rights and defenses that it has or that may arise under the insurance policy california law.neither the writing of this letter,nor any actions taken by aetna its authorized representatives in connection with the policy,shall constitute or be deemed to be a waiver of any of the rights and defenses it may have chakmak quickly responded with a letter of his own,reserving all rights and claims on behalf of buxbaum chakmak.finally,on november,tait sent chakmak a replacement check for,assuring chakmak that it could be cashed without prejudice to the law firm rights.the check was not returned.
on july,buxbaum,chakmak,and the firm collectively the law firm or the firm filed this action against aetna and tait collectively aetna,alleging two causes of action breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and violation of the california unfair competition law bus.after a series of demurrers,the firm filed a third amended complaint on september,alleging the same two causes of action.
on february,aetna filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,for summary adjudication of issues,arguing that it did not withhold benefits due under the policy,and,even if it did,there was a reasonable basis for doing so.on march,the law firm filed a motion for summary adjudication,asserting that it was entitled to in lost business income,not the offered.the parties filed opposition papers and reply briefs on the.
on july,the trial court heard argument.by signed order dated december,the court granted aetna summary judgment motion and denied the firm motion for summary adjudication.judgment was entered accordingly.the firm filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
based on the principles governing summary judgment and the substantive law applicable to the law firm claims,we conclude that the business interruption coverage did not apply because the firm did not suspend operations,that is,it never ceased all business activities at its premises.we also conclude that the claim under the california unfair competition law is without merit.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.

as pertinent here,the policy provides the insurer will pay for the actual loss of business income the insured sustain s due to the necessary suspension of its operations during the period of restoration.the suspension must be caused by direct physical loss of or damage to property at the premises described in the declarations caused by or resulting from any covered cause of loss.italics added.

the policy further states that i n the event of loss under this coverage the insured must resume all or part of its operations as quickly as possible and i f it do es not resume operations,or do es not resume operations as quickly as possible,we will pay based on the length of time it would have taken to resume operations as quickly as possible.finally,the insurer will reduce the amount of the insured business income loss to the extent the insured can resume its operations,in whole or in part,by using damaged or undamaged property at the described premises or elsewhere.

in home indem.hyplains beef,a case involving a business interruption policy virtually identical to the one before us,the court explained in order for business income coverage to apply,the policy requires that there be a necessary suspension of operations.this term is not defined in the policy webster third new international dictionary defines suspension as the act of suspending or the state or period of being suspended,interrupted,or abrogated.suspended is defined as temporarily debarred,inactive,inoperative.these definitions comport with what appears to be the common understanding of the term suspension,that is,that it connotes a temporary,but complete,cessation of activity.thus,if one were to apply the plain,ordinary meaning to the use of the phrase necessary suspension within the policy,in order for a claim to fall within the coverage provision it would require that any direct physical loss of or damage to property result in the cessation of the insured operations.further,in looking at the policy as a whole,the court does not find any other provisions that would indicate that the use of the phrase necessary suspension in the coverage provision should be given anything other than its common,ordinary meaning.
t he policy does not provide coverage for a slowdown or reduction in operations,rather it requires a necessary suspension of operations.the insured in this case does not controvert the fact that its operations continued throughout the period that the physical loss existed,albeit at a reduced level of efficiency from what normal operations would have been 
the court holding here,that a complete cessation of the insured business was required to trigger coverage under the business income coverage provision,is consistent with the vast majority of cases from other jurisdictions that have examined the question of what constitutes a suspension or interruption of operations for the purposes of business interruption insurance.citations.home indem.hyplains beef,supra.at,italics added.another court has described the term necessary suspension as unqualified language that unambiguously refers to a total cessation of the insured business activities.american states ins.creative walking,d,italics added,affd.mem.cir.
as one of our own court recognized some time ago t he purpose and nature of business interruption insurance is to indemnify the insured for any loss sustained by the insured because of his inability to continue to use specified premises,that is,for loss caused by the interruption of a going business consequent upon the destruction of the building,plant,or parts thereof pacific coast engineering paul fire marine ins.d,citation omitted,italics added.
the aetna policy provides that i n the event of loss under this coverage the insured must resume all or part of its operations as quickly as possible.t he plain meaning of the word resumption in the policy indicates that for the provision to apply there must have necessarily been a stoppage of operations from which it was necessary to begin anew.home indem.hyplains beef,supra.at.t here could be no resumption if the insured never stopped doing business.quality oilfield pro.michigan mut.ins.by requiring the insured to mitigate the loss and resume operations as soon as possible,the policy implies that a business interruption loss has forced the insured to cease business operations.keetch mutual of enumclaw ins.
we think it helpful to examine how courts have applied business interruption insurance in various circumstances.for instance,in one case,the theft of engineering drawings,computer discs,and design information from a manufacturer of oilfield equipment did not cause a suspension of operations because,while the theft adversely impacted production,the company remained open and continued to do business at a rate of eighty percent of its previous level of capacity quality oilfield pro.michigan mut,supra,at.

water damage did not result in a suspension of operations where one of several stores in a retail clothing chain was damaged,the damaged store remained open,clothing from two other stores was diverted to the damaged store,and sales there actually increased,though at a rate lower than projected.as the court explained here there was no actual suspension of business operations,but rather an alleged adverse effect on continuing sales not only at the store suffering the physical damage but at two other stores from which merchandise allegedly intended,was diverted to the damaged store.no basis is shown for including any loss allegedly sustained in the two other stores.a business judgment was made to divert the merchandise intended for those stores.plainly the policy was not intended to include business interruption,if any,to these other stores where no physical damage occurred.the store where the damage occurred,had an increase in sales.howard stores foremost ins,citation omitted,affd.mem.

turning to the facts of the present case,the law firm claims a loss of income for the week following the flood.the claim is limited to the work of three attorneys,whom we shall designate by their initials.the firm submitted the time sheets of attorney clz for three days february,and,attorney dab for one day february,and attorney jph for four days february,and march.as noted,seven attorneys were listed on the firm letterhead.the record contains nothing about the work of the other four attorneys,including chakmak,so our analysis does not include them.

as to attorney dab,on february,he spent six hours on problems and five hours on client matters.
finally,as to attorney jph,on february,he spent six hours on problems and two hours minutes on client matters on february,he did not work at all on february,he spent four hours on problems and three and hours on client matters and on march,he spent minutes on problems and seven hours minutes on client matters.
we know that the law firm measures income by billable hours and that attorneys clz,dab,and jph devoted some of their time during the week after the flood to nonbillable,tasks.the firm is engaged in the business of providing legal services to clients,and,notwithstanding the flood,it did so without interruption.for instance,all three attorneys billed time on february,the first business day after the weekend flood.and although attorney jph did not bill any time on february,attorney clz had seven billable hours that day.
