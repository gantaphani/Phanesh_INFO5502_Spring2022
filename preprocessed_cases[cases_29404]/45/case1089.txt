the plaintiff,wanda glenn,filed this erisa action against defendant metropolitan life insurance,the plan administrator for sears,roebuck and,after metlife terminated the disability benefits that glenn had been receiving as a former sears employee,on the ground that her condition had improved to the point that she was no longer totally disabled.the district court upheld metlife determination,finding that the decision was not arbitrary and capricious,and granted summary judgment to the defendants.for the reasons set out below,we conclude that the record does not support the conclusion that metlife denial of glenn claim was the result of a deliberative process or that it was based on substantial evidence.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the plaintiff,wanda glenn,worked for sears,roebuck from until april,at which point she took a medical leave of absence and has not since returned to work.glenn final position with sears was as sales manager in the women department,which entailed a workweek of hours per week and the training and direct supervision of sales associates.the description of her job,prepared by sears,indicated that the job required sitting up to percent of the workday,standing for percent of the workday,and some climbing,reaching,stooping,and lifting.glenn was responsible for supervising other employees,ensuring that her department was properly stocked with merchandise,satisfying the needs and demands of customers,and identifying and solving various problems as they arose.she reported to the store general manager.
glenn submitted a disability claim under sears disability plan on june,attaching a letter from her treating physician,rajendera patel,dated april,indicating that glenn had been diagnosed with severe dilated cardiomyopathy,a disease of the heart muscle that causes the heart to become enlarged and,for that reason,to pump inadequately.her symptoms included general fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion.patel further stated,from my standpoint,this patient can not return to any kind of job that would require any significant physical or psychological stress.
the sears disability plan for which glenn applied covered two distinct stages of total disability.the first provided that a participant was totally disabled when she was completely and continuously unable to perform each of the material duties of her regular job.the second category became relevant after the first months of benefits and required that the participant be completely and continuously unable to perform the duties of any gainful work or service for which she is reasonably qualified taking into consideration her training,education,experience,and past earning.emphasis added.glenn claim was approved,and she began receiving disability benefits following the completion of the elimination period mandated in the plan.
two months later,in august,glenn filed for social security disability benefits at the direction of plan administrators,who steered glenn to kennedy associates,a law firm specializing in obtaining such benefits.the social security administration initially denied glenn claim,but an administrative law judge eventually issued a decision finding that glenn was totally disabled as of april,and was entitled to benefits retroactive to october.as a result,metlife demanded reimbursement for its overpayment of benefits,based on the amount of glenn newly awarded social security benefits,and collected from her.
on may,metlife sent a letter advising glenn that if she wished to continue receiving disability benefits,she was required to demonstrate that she met the second definition for total disability,that she was incapable of performing the material duties of any gainful occupation as defined by the plan.the letter further advised that,in making a claim determination,metlife would review glenn vocational information,medical information and glenn specific restrictions and limitations that are supported by objective medical evidence.
glenn medical information was provided largely by patel,the cardiologist who oversaw glenn care both before and during the period relevant to this appeal.the record indicates that glenn had developed hypertension in the early and had been treated with therapy since at least.in,she experienced sudden cardiac death but was resuscitated and implanted with a defibrillator system.diagnosed with left ventricular dysfunction,glenn was hospitalized twice again in the,once before and once after she began work at sears.in,she began experiencing prolonged chest tightness,shortness of breath,increasing fatigue by the end of the day,and edema in her legs from prolonged standing at work.because of her progressive ventricular dysfunction,at one point patel referred glenn to carl leier at ohio state university hospital to consider the possibility of a heart transplant.in march,patel ordered an angiogram,from which he diagnosed glenn with severe dilated cardiomyopathy.in a letter dated april,patel indicated that his patient main problem now is stress at work.she works in a sears store and does have physical as well as psychological stress.considering her low ejection fraction,i feel that she may not be able to continue to work in any kind of environment that would cause any significant physical or psychological stress and demands.glenn took medical leave from sears at the end of that month.
glenn underwent significant treatment during the next several months,taking as many as seven or eight prescription medications for her heart condition.patel noted that,almost three months after ceasing to work at sears,glenn was doing clinically well.he observed that some of her improvement is from the reduction of stress and strain of work.she still has good and bad days and in fact there are periods where she feels extremely tired and fatigued and runs out of steam.in november,however,patel notified metlife that glenn was totally disabled from undertaking any occupation and that he did not expect her to be able to return to work.
in march,glenn underwent a further evaluation of her cardiomyopathy that found her ejection fraction found to be mildly reduced and reported some improvement in her lv left ventricular function.through a walking regime,glenn had been able to increase her exercise tolerance,but patel noted that she still gets fatigued out and short of breath,particularly if she is under any kind of significant psychologic stress.patel also reported,from overall evaluation,wanda seems to be clinically stable and i have advised her to continue her current regimen including lasix,potassium,lanoxim,norvasc,aspirin,calcium,normodyne and diovan.in march,a year later,when patel filled out a metlife benefits evaluation form,he indicated that glenn could lift and carry up to pounds occasionally,had the ability to perform bilateral repetitive foot and hand movements,and could sit eight hours of the day,stand four,and walk two.he also checked yes when asked on the form whether she was able to work in a sedentary physical exertion level occupation.although the evaluation form was intended to assess capacity for work,patel signed it without indicating whether he was releasing glenn to return to work or what restrictions might apply if she did go back to work.in a later evaluation,patel answers were consistent with his earlier responses,except that he added,no emotional heavy exertion.patel filled out that form on june.
however,just six days later,patel sent a progress report to glenn internist indicating that glenn was back in our office earlier than expected,complaining of fatigue,shortness of breath on moderate exertion,and significant anxiety regarding the disability and having to return to work.patel concluded,from my standpoint,again,considering her cardiomyopathy,i do not believe she will handle any kind of stress well at her work and she would be better off being on disability rather than returning to her job.patel reiterated his opinion that glenn should not return to work in a letter dated july,
glenn has dilated cardiomyopathy as well as a history of ventricular tachycardia requiring an implantable defibrillator device.the patient has been on multiple medications for her dilated cardiomyopathy.the patient continues to have significant difficulty with exertional shortness of breath on any kind of moderate exertion.she also continues to have significant difficulty in returning to even any kind of sedentary job because any kind of psychologic stress at work causes significant problems with her cardiovascular condition and she decompensates fast.this has happened on multiple occasions in the past.the patient has tried to return to work in the past with exacerbation of her symptoms as well as exacerbation of her condition.
at the present time,i do not believe wanda should be forced to return to any kind of even sedentary work particularly because it is the psychologic stress of work that really exacerbates her cardiovascular condition and.the patient basically should be considered completely disabled from her dilated cardiomyopathy as well as history of ventricular tachycardia.
on august,metlife notified glenn that her benefits would be terminated on september,based on the administrative decision that t here is no supportive medical documentation of the exacerbation of your cardiac condition and symptomology,due to subjective complaints of stress.the notice concluded that records submitted for review do not support cardiovascular impairment that would prevent you from performing full time sedentary work and pointed primarily to medical information showing that patel had found her to be clinically stable with a better exercise tolerance on november,on a check mark on metlife evaluation to return to work on march.metlife letter did not address patel letter of july,in which he stated that glenn should not return to work.
glenn appealed the denial of disability benefits.while the appeal was pending,patel submitted a letter dated february,in which he reiterated his opinion that glenn could not return to work 
previous reports filled out by me state that the patient was fit for sedentary work,however based on her clinical condition and her symptomology,there was never a time where i felt that this patient would be able to return to employment.i strongly believe that employment would put significant stress on her overall system,and she may decompensate.glenn does not have any emotional condition that causes her cardiac problem.she has a cardiac problem that is exacerbated by any kind of stress.
my position is that she should be considered completely disabled,mainly from her cardiomyopathy and associated symptoms from her lv dysfunction.
in response,metlife referred the case to an independent physician consultant board.there,chandrakant pujara reviewed glenn medical records and offered an opinion based on a review of glenn file.in a letter dated may,he noted that glenn ejection fraction indeed has improved with medical therapy and probably with biventricular pacing as well but concluded that glenn was unable to do any exertional physical activity.pujara prognosis was,at best,ambiguous 
the actual impact of any form of real or perceived emotional stress on cardiac arrhythmias,or cardiomyopathy is difficult to gauge in an individual patient.however,based on patel own physical capacity evaluation on june,the patient seems to be a reasonable candidate to try one of the sedentary job classes at least on a trial basis.if the job environment entails a significant degree of emotional stress,and the patient is not able to cope with that,then certainly permanent disability can be considered.
despite the equivocal nature of this report,metlife issued a final denial of disability benefits to glenn on may.the notice of denial relied on the same information as in the prior termination notice,notably patel june evaluation form,as well as pujara assessment.although metlife acknowledged patel letter of february,in which he clarified his position regarding glenn ability to return to work,metlife concluded that documentation on file does not support a disability that would prevent glenn from performing any occupation,as defined in the plan.as before,however,no mention was made of patel july letter,in which he rendered essentially the same opinion as in his letter of february.
having exhausted her administrative remedies under the plan,glenn brought a civil action pursuant to section a of the employee retirement income security act of,as amended,erisa.the district court denied her motion for judgment on the administrative record and,instead,granted metlife.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo the decision of a district court granting judgment in an erisa disability benefit action based on an administrative record,see wilkins baptist healthcare,cir,and apply the same legal standard as did the district court.see whitaker hartford life accident ins,cir.in this case,the district court appropriately reviewed the record under the arbitrary and capricious standard,because the plan at issue granted the plan administrator discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the plan and to determine benefits.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d mcdonald life ins,cir.indeed,the plaintiff conceded that review for arbitrariness was the correct standard of review here.
under that standard,we will uphold the administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir.despite this deferential standard,however,our review is no mere formality.the standard does not require us merely to rubber stamp the administrator decision.jones metro.life ins,cir citation omitted.instead,we are required to review the quality and quantity of the medical evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.mcdonald,at.
moreover,as discussed below,we are entitled to take into account the existence of a conflict of interest that results when,as in this case,the plan administrator who decides whether an employee is eligible for benefits is also obligated to pay those benefits and to factor in the plan administrator failure to give consideration to the social security administration determination that glenn was totally disabled.
conflict of interest 
in the instant case,metlife is authorized both to decide whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits.this dual function creates an apparent conflict of interest.see darland fortis benefits ins,cir,overruled on other grounds by black decker disability plan nord,d holding that plan administrators do not owe special deference to the opinion of a treating physician.in discussing the applicable standard of review,the district court identified this conflict of interest as a relevant factor in determining whether an abuse of discretion had taken place.see glenn metropolitan life ins,wl at,june,citing firestone tire rubber,at.i f a benefit plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest,that conflict must be weighed as a facto r in determining whether there is an abuse of discretion.internal citation omitted.however,the court analysis of the plan administrator basis for terminating benefits does not include any discussion of the role that metlife conflict of interest may have played in its decision nor appear to give that conflict any weight.it appears to us,as a result,that this factor did not receive appropriate consideration by the district court.
social security disability determination 
there is yet another factor that the district court appears to have given inadequate consideration.the plaintiff contends that the plan administrator was arbitrary in failing to consider the award of disability benefits that she secured from the social security administration.the record reflects that metlife notified her that payments for disability were subject to a discount for amounts received from other sources and steered her to a law firm specializing in securing disability benefits from the social security administration.after the firm secured an award of benefits for her based on a claim of total disability,metlife deducted the amount of those government benefits from the disability payments that it was obliged to pay and demanded a refund from glenn in the amount of.and,yet,in making the decision to terminate payments under the metlife policy,the plan administrator gave no weight whatever to the social security administration determination of total disability.hence,glenn posits that metlife took blatantly inconsistent on the finding by the social security administrative law judge that she was totally disabled but contending that she was capable of performing sedentary work in denying her erisa benefits.
the district court recognized this inconsistency but declined to invoke the doctrine of estoppel.although we conclude that this ruling was technically correct,the fact that metlife and the social security administration reached contrary conclusions regarding glenn disability status has two ramifications for this appeal.the first stems from the fact that metlife assisted glenn in obtaining social security benefits and reaped a financial benefit of its own when that assistance was successful.the second issue relates to the fact that,in denying glenn continuation of her benefits,metlife failed to address social security contrary determination of glenn status.it is obvious that both factors are relevant in determining whether metlife decision was arbitrary and capricious.
the courts have recognized that a disability determination by the social security administration is relevant in an action to determine the arbitrariness of a decision to terminate benefits under an erisa plan.in ladd itt,cir,for example,the seventh circuit overturned a plan administrator denial of disability benefits after finding that the insurance company had encouraged and assisted the plaintiff in applying for social security benefits,which were granted after an administrative law judge found that the plaintiff was totally disabled.writing for the court,judge posner noted that the concept of judicial estoppel was not technically applicable but,nevertheless,he concluded that the inconsistency in litigation positions had to be factored into a review of the plan administrator determination for arbitrariness 
the grant of social security disability benefits brings the case within the penumbra of the doctrine of judicial if a party wins a suit on one ground,it ca turn around and in further litigation with the same opponent repudiate the ground in order to win a further victory.the doctrine is technically not applicable here,because metlife and itt,the defendants in this suit,were not parties to the proceeding before the social security administration.yet they prevailed there in a practical sense because the grant of social security benefits to ladd reduced the amount of her claim against the employee welfare plan.if we reflect on the purpose of the doctrine,which is to reduce fraud in the legal process by forcing a modicum of consistency on a repeating litigant,we see that its spirit is applicable here.to lighten the cost to the employee welfare plan of ladd disability,the defendants encouraged and supported her effort to demonstrate total disability to the social security administration,going so far as to provide her with legal representation.to further lighten that cost,it then turned around and denied that ladd was totally disabled,even though her condition had meanwhile deteriorated.in effect,having won once the defendants repudiated the basis of their first victory in order to win a second victory.this sequence casts additional doubt on the adequacy of their evaluation of ladd claim,even if it does not provide an independent basis for rejecting that evaluation.
id.at citations omitted.
we adopted the seventh circuit penumbra rationale in darland fortis benefits insurance,a case in which the erisa plan administrator had,as here,requested that darland apply for social security disability benefits so as to reduce the amount of monthly disability payments that it paid darland under the plan and then demanded reimbursement for overpayment of insurance benefits at the same time it sought to terminate darland benefits on the ground that he was no longer disabled.darland,at.we concluded that a plan administrator decision denying disability benefits where the social security administration has determined that the applicant was totally disabled can be considered arbitrary and capricious,id.at,especially where it is plainly evident that the social security standard for a disability determination is much more stringent than that required by the defendant insurance policy.id.at.the latter observation not only pertains in this case to the language of the policy but is all the more relevant in the wake of the supreme court subsequent ruling that the special deference extended to the opinion of a treating physician in a social security dispute is not applicable in erisa cases.see black decker disability plan,at.
the district court in this case recognized that metlife had encouraged and assisted wanda glenn in obtaining social security disability benefits,just as metlife had in ladd,but found glenn case to be distinguishable in two respects.first,the district court noted,correctly,that the record before the administrative law judge did not include the report,signed on the same day that the administrative judge decision was made,in which patel answered yes to metlife question,do you believe glenn is able to work in a sedentary physical exertion level occupation however,the relative significance of this omission in the record is undercut by the existence of patel subsequent clarification of july,in which he indicated that he had never considered his patient capable of resuming work,and by the fact that there is no indication in the record that glenn government benefits have ever been discontinued.second,the district court found,incorrectly,that it was unclear whether or not metlife had actually benefitted from the plaintiff receipt of social security benefits.we find it abundantly clear on the record that glenn reimbursed metlife for overpayment of benefits,based on her receipt of social security benefits.
having benefitted financially from the government determination that glenn was totally disabled,metlife obviously should have given appropriate weight to that determination.as we held in calvert firstar finance,cir,a case with several parallels to this one,an erisa plan administrator failure to address the social security administration finding that the claimant was totally disabled is yet another factor that can render the denial of further disability benefits arbitrary and capricious.in calvert,as here,the plan administrator relied almost exclusively on the recommendation of a physician,hired by the administrator,who conducted a file review but not a physical examination of the claimant.see id.we held that such a review was clearly inadequate,given that in reaching the determination to deny benefits,the plan administrator not only overlooked surgical reports,and ct scans that documented the claimant disability,but also failed to mention the social security administration determination,not even to discount or disagree with it,which indicates that he may not even have been aware of it.id.at.
here,there is no possibility that the plan administrator failed to discuss the social security award for lack of awareness.and,the s ocial s ecurity a dministration determination,though certainly not binding,is far from meaningless.id.at.that metlife apparently failed to consider the social security administration finding of disability in reaching its own determination of disability does not render the decision arbitrary per se,but it is obviously a significant factor to be considered upon review.
d.the medical evidence 
even more perplexing than the plan administrator failure to consider the award of social security benefits is the persistent failure to give any weight to patel letters of july,and february,in which he clearly stated that he did not believe glenn was capable of returning to work,sedentary or otherwise.this omission stands in stark contrast to the heavy reliance metlife placed in its brief on the physical capacity assessment form that metlife provided to patel and that he filled in and signed on march.on the form,patel indicated that his patient could sit for eight hours a day,stand for four hours,and walk for two hours.he also checked yes when asked,do you believe glenn is able to work in a sedentary physical exertion level occupation that information is so inconsistent with other medical evidence and detailed reports supplied by patel over a period of three years that it can best be described as aberrational.
nevertheless,metlife can not be faulted for its initial reliance on the opinion that glenn could work at a sedentary physical exertion level occupation in consulting a transferable skills analyst,who then compiled a list of clerical jobs account information clerk,attendance clerk,classified ad clerk that would be available to someone with the physical limitations listed on the physical assessment form.there is no indication in the record,however,that the transferable skills analyst considered the medical evidence in the record or patel reasons for concluding that his patient should not return to work of any kind.nevertheless,the plan administrator,relying only on the vocational assessment,the information on the metlife form supplied by patel on march,and certain other technical information that seems to have been almost randomly selected from his reports one paragraph reads in its entirety,without further explanation your june,examination showed an ejection fraction of to,declined to grant further benefits in a letter dated august.nowhere in the notice of denial does the plan administrator mention the decision of the social security administration finding that glenn was totally disabled.
perhaps most curious is the plan administrator treatment of patel recent assessments of his patient condition.the plan administrator emphasized the content of yet another physical capacities evaluation dated june,that indicated by information consistent with that on the march form sit for eight hours,stand for four hours,walk for to hours.but the june form does not recommend that glenn return to work,nor does it release her to return to work.furthermore,the notice from the plan administrator made no mention whatever of the letter patel sent on july,which,as described above,noted that glenn continues to have significant difficulty with exertional shortness of breath on any kind of moderate exertion and significant difficulty in returning to even any kind of sedentary job because any kind of psychologic stress at work causes significant problems with her cardiovascular condition and she decompensates fast.patel concluded 
at the present time,i do not believe wanda should be forced to return to any kind of even sedentary work particularly because it is the psychologic stress of work that really exacerbates her cardiovascular condition and symptomatololgy.the patient basically should be considered completely disabled from her dilated cardiomyopathy as well as history of ventricular tachycardia.
this letter to metlife is consistent with a report a month earlier that patel sent to glenn internist,rhee,in which he concluded from my standpoint,again,considering her cardiomyopathy,i do not believe she will handle any kind of stress well at her work and she would be better off being on disability.
based on patel assessment of her condition,glenn appealed metlife decision to terminate her benefits,and the decision was reviewed internally by metlife.in a letter dated may,the plan administrator once again denied benefits,this time based on the evaluation form signed by patel in june,the transferable skills analysis from july,and two items that had not been part of the earlier review a letter from patel dated february,and the report from the outside consultant,pujara,dated may.once again,there is no mention of patel july letter stating unequivocally that his patient was not able to return to work.
the appeal decision does indicate that patel letter noted that his previous reports indicated that ms glenn was fit for sedentary work but that based on her clinical condition and symptomatology,patel never felt that glenn could return to employment and that she should be considered completely disabled from her cardiomyopathy and associated symptoms from her lv dysfunction.on the other hand,there is no explanation in the notice for the failure to give any weight to this report.
the summary of pujara report reiterated the information that he found in the medical files submitted by.pujara did not conduct an examination of glenn but merely undertook a file concluded the consultant noted that based on the medical information glenn has achieved a relatively stable cardiac status.what the summary omits is any indication that the consultant thought that she could return to work.in fact,pujara noted that given the information in her file,the patient certainly is not able to do any exertional physical activity and,with regard to the possibility of sedentary activity,concluded that i f the job environment entails a significant degree of emotional stress,and the patient is not able to cope with that,then certainly permanent disability can be considered.although it appears that metlife forwarded the june evaluation form to,there is no indication that he was provided with copies of patel letters of july and february,in which patel concluded that glenn was not able to undertake sedentary work because any degree of stress caused her medical condition to decompensate.
the plan provides that w hile a claim is pending,we,at our expense,have the right to have you examined by doctors of our choice when and as often as we reasonably choose.metlife instead opted to have a file review,a decision that does not render its denial of benefits arbitrary per se.however,it is yet another factor to be considered in the overall assessment of its process.see calvert,at.moreover,as noted above,it appears that the physician charged with conducting the independent file review was not provided with patel letters of july and february.
as a result,patel is the only physician to have personally treated and observed glenn over the entire course of her dispute with metlife.as noted above,the plan administrator need not accord special deference to the opinion of a treating physician.by the same token,it may not arbitrarily repudiate or refuse to consider the opinions of a treating physician.see black decker disability plan,at.in its final rejection of glenn claim,however,metlife did not indicate that it had considered patel letter of february,nor did it provide a reason for rejecting it it also did not indicate whether or not it had considered patel letter of july,which was consistent with the february letter advising that glenn could not return to work.
in the absence of an explanation from metlife,the district court provided its own,noting that because patel expressly acknowledged that he had stated that plaintiff was fit for sedentary work metlife did not abuse its discretion by viewing patel recantation with skepticism.in support of this conclusion,the district court invoked united states willis,cir,for the proposition that affidavits recanting trial testimony are viewed with extreme suspicion.the court reliance on willis is misplaced,however,because that case addresses the full recantation of a witness testimony in a criminal trial,a situation which is hardly equivalent to patel letters,which were consistent with his earlier assessments of glenn ability to work and which are more aptly described as clarifications,rather than recantations.indeed,the concept of recantation has little application outside the unique context of the criminal case,and any presumption regarding the credibility of inconsistent testimony should be limited to that context.
we conclude that the only fair inference from the record would actually undercut patel and his brief assessment on the functional capacity form dated march,because that information was in direct conflict both with his earlier assessments and with every detailed written explanation that he gave concerning glenn disability clearly
