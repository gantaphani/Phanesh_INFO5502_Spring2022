this breach of contract action was brought by a group of thirteen insurance companies who provide federal crop insurance,alleging that the federal crop insurance corporation fcic breached two provisions of the standard reinsurance agreement sra.the fcic moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,and the district court granted the motion on that ground,but ruled in the alternative that dismissal was also warranted because the insurers had neither exhausted their administrative remedies nor established any exception to the exhaustion requirement.the insurers appeal,and we affirm on the alternate ground.
the federal crop insurance act fcia,established a federal crop insurance program in to be administered and regulated by the fcic.originally the fcic directly provided crop insurance coverage to eligible farmers,but in congress revised the fcia to require the fcic to contract with private companies for insurance to the maximum extent possible.c.the fcic was to reimburse such companies for their administrative and program expenses,and provide reinsurance to the maximum extent practicable to cover catastrophic loss.k,b.the fcic now offers most federal crop insurance through private insurers which it then reinsures.
the federal reinsurance program is governed by a contract between the fcic and participating insurance providers entitled standard reinsurance agreement sra.the sra is renewed annually,and a company may terminate the agreement by not submitting a plan of operation for the next reinsurance year by the date specified in the sra.the fcic may only terminate the sra by giving notice at least days prior to the date of renewal of its intent to terminate.
at issue between the fcic and these insurers are two provisions of the sra which provide catastrophic risk protection cat coverage.the administrative fee provision in the sra allowed insurers to retain a portion of the administrative fee charged by the fcia,and the loss adjustment expenses lae provision permitted insurers to recoup of an imputed premium for each cat policy provided to a farmer.these provisions were affected by congressional action in.in that year congress enacted the agricultural research extension and education reform act areera,stat,which eliminated the right of private insurance companies to retain any administrative fees and capped lae reimbursement at.then in congress enacted the agricultural risk protection act arpa,stat,further lowering the lae cap to.
the fcic amended the sra to implement areera and arpa.amendment was effective at the start of the fiscal year,and it eliminated the right of private insurers to retain any administrative fees and capped lae reimbursement at.amendment was effective at the start of fiscal year,and it reduced the lae cap to.when the fcic notified the insurers of each amendment,it informed them that their sra would be terminated if they failed to execute either amendment within days of receipt.appellants all executed the amendments,but they reserved the right to sue the fcic for damages.
disputes regarding the sra are governed by the federal crop insurance reform and department of agriculture act of,reorganization act,which created a mandatory administrative appeals process for sra matters.under the reorganization act,a party who believes that its sra rights have been violated may request a final agency determination,which can then be appealed to the department of agriculture board of contract appeals the board.although the act grants exclusive jurisdiction to federal district courts,d,parties are to exhaust their administrative remedies before pursuing a claim in federal court.e.
in february the insurers brought an action against the united states in the court of federal claims for breach of contract,duress,and unjust enrichment resulting from the implementation of areera and arpa.the government moved to dismiss,arguing that under e exhaustion of administrative remedies was a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction,and alternatively that d required complaints to be filed in federal district court.the insurers responded that neither d nor the exhaustion requirements contained in the sra were binding they did not directly address e because their suit was against the united states rather than the fcic.in march the court of federal claims dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction under e because the insurers had not exhausted their administrative remedies,and alternatively because d grants federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over suits against the fcic.ace property cas.ins.united states.its decision was affirmed by the federal circuit on june,on the ground that the case had been properly dismissed since d provides for exclusive jurisdiction in the federal district courts and that there was therefore no reason to revisit the court superfluous finding regarding exhaustion of administrative remedies.ace property cas.ins.united states.
after the federal circuit decision,the insurers sought a final administrative determination from the fcic.the fcic declined because their request had not been made within days after notice of the disputed action.see a.the insurers then appealed to the board,which did not issue its decision until shortly before oral argument on the appeal in this court.
while their appeal was still pending before the federal circuit,the insurers filed this action against the fcic in the southern district of iowa seeking damages for the breach of the sra.the fcic moved to dismiss,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under e because appellants had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.the insurers responded that the statute did not deprive the federal district court of jurisdiction and that exhaustion should not be required because it would be futile since neither the fcic nor the board has the authority to award the relief sought and the issues involved are legal questions better resolved by courts than agencies.the district court dismissed their complaint in february,holding that it had no jurisdiction over the dispute because the insurers had not exhausted their administrative remedies as required by e.alternatively the court held that even if it had jurisdiction,their failure to exhaust was not excused under the traditional exceptions.the insurers now appeal,arguing that e is not a jurisdictional statute and that exhaustion is not required because in this case it would be futile and because the complaint raises only legal issues unsuitable for administrative resolution.
subsequently on december,the board rendered its decision on the insurers administrative appeal.ace property cas.ins,agbca,wl december.the board found that it had jurisdiction over the dispute and possessed the authority to issue whatever relief might be necessary to remedy any breach of contract,including the power to award money damages.it also gave examples of instances in the past where it had awarded such relief.although it upheld the day rule for bringing administrative claims,it decided that the rule should not have been applied retroactively.thus it affirmed the agency determination that the insurers claims for the and reinsurance years were time barred for failing to bring them within days of notice of the disputed action,but it remanded the claims for the and reinsurance years for further administrative proceedings.
on their appeal from the dismissal of their action,the insurers complain that the district court erred in concluding that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a prerequisite to subject matter jurisdiction.the fcic responds that the language of e is jurisdictional when considered within the context of the statutory scheme so appellants failure to exhaust administrative remedies means there is no subject matter jurisdiction over this action.
the supreme court has indicated that a statute requiring plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before coming into federal court may be either jurisdictional in nature or non jurisdictional,depending on the intent of congress as evinced by the language used.see weinberger salfi,d.under a jurisdictional statute,exhaustion of administrative remedies can not be excused or waived and the failure by a party to exhaust is a jurisdictional bar.in contrast,a non jurisdictional statute codifies the common law exhaustion principle under which exhaustion of administrative remedies is favored,but may be excused by a limited number of exceptions to the general rule.id.at.
in salfi,the court addressed an appeal dealing with h and g of the social security act.the court first considered the third sentence of h,which provides that n o action shall be brought under section of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.h.since the language used by congress was more than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion and was sweeping and direct,the district court had lacked federal question jurisdiction over the case before it.salfi,at.the court then discussed g,which provides in pertinent part that a ny individual,after any final decision of the secretary made after a hearing to which he was a party may obtain a review by a civil action g.the court concluded that the term final decision was a statutorily specified jurisdictional prerequisite and something more than simply a codification of the judicially developed doctrine of exhaustion.the district court had therefore erred by concluding that futility could excuse the need to exhaust.salfi,at.
under salfi the language of a statute must be sweeping and direct for it to be considered jurisdictional.id.at.the language must indicate either that there is no federal jurisdiction prior to exhaustion or that exhaustion is an element of the underlying claim.chelette harris,cir.exhaustion is presumed to be non jurisdictional unless congress states in clear,unequivocal terms that the judiciary is barred from hearing an action until the administrative agency has come to a decision.avocados plus veneman,internal citations omitted.we review de novo the district court interpretation of e.alpharma,pennfield oil,cir.
the question of whether e is jurisdictional in nature has never been addressed by the supreme court,and it presents a question of first impression for this court.section e provides that 
n otwithstanding any other provision of law,a person shall exhaust all administrative appeal procedures established by the secretary or required by law before the person may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the secretary the department or an agency,office,officer,or employee of the department.
other circuits that have addressed the issue are split.in mcbride cotton cattle veneman,the ninth circuit held that the exhaustion requirement of e is not jurisdictional because it contains no language expressly conditioning federal question jurisdiction on exhaustion of administrative remedies,cir.in contrast,the second circuit in bastek fed.crop ins,held that the statutory provision mandating exhaustion in e is explicit and the plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived them of the opportunity to obtain relief in the district court,cir.the lower courts are also split as to whether e is jurisdictional.compare kuster veneman,d,implicitly finding e non jurisdictional rain hail ins.service,fed.crop ins,d,same in re cottrell,rejecting the claim that e is jurisdictional with in re sugar beet crop ins,d,explicitly finding e to be jurisdictional am.growers ins.fcic,d,implies e is jurisdictional.farmers home,d,same utah shared access alliance wagner,d,failure to exhaust remedies deprives court of subject matter jurisdiction.
we begin our inquiry with the language of e.see united states mickelson,cir.although the language requires exhaustion,nothing in the text indicates that exhaustion was intended as a jurisdictional bar and the fcic has not pointed to any legislative history evidencing such an intent.section e is directed at a person and provides that the person shall exhaust administrative remedies before bringing an action in federal district court against the fcic.there is no language directed at courts or limiting federal district court jurisdiction.
our court has examined similar language in the prison litigation reform act plra and held that it does not contain the sort of sweeping and direct language necessary to impose a jurisdictional requirement,but only governs the timing of the action.chelette,at internal citations omitted.section a of the plra provides that n o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a emphasis added.every circuit which has considered whether a is jurisdictional in nature has concluded that it is not.see anderson xyz correctional health services,cir richardson goord,cir steele fed.bureau of prisons,cir ali dist.of columbia,casanova dubois,cir wright hollingsworth,cir curry scott,cir nyhuis reno,cir rumbles hill,cir massey helman,cir.
the language used by congress in the immigration and nationality act ina provides a useful contrast.in of the ina,congress provided that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d emphasis added.here,the exhaustion requirement explicitly limits subject matter jurisdiction,and d has consistently been treated as a jurisdictional statute and an integral part of the statute.see barron ashcroft,cir theodoropoulos,cir abdulrahman ashcroft,cir attorney general of the united states,cir singh reno,cir witter,cir.
the language in e of the reorganization act resembles that used in the plra.its directive is addressed to the individual litigant rather than the court,and it pertains to the time when an action may be brought in federal district court.like the language of the plra and in contrast to the language of the ina and the social security act,n othing in e mentions,defines or limits federal jurisdiction,mcbride,at,and its language can not be considered sweeping and direct under salfi.
the fcic contends that appellants reliance on chelette,and its interpretation of plra a,is misplaced due to the supreme court intervening decision in booth churner,d.in booth the court dismissed a prisoner action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies,but it did not consider whether a was jurisdictional or not.its decision turned instead on its interpretation of available remedies under a.id.at.moreover,all circuits which have ruled on the jurisdictional issue since booth have continued to treat a as non jurisdictional.see anderson,at richardson,at steele,at ali,at.
the fcic reliance on the second circuit decision in bastek is also not persuasive.bastek concluded that exhaustion of administrative remedies was a statutory mandate under e precluding the normal exercise of judicial discretion in balancing the individual interest in access to a federal judicial forum against the institutional interests favoring exhaustion.bastek.at.as the ninth circuit has pointed out,however,not all statutory exhaustion requirements are created equal.only statutory exhaustion requirements containing sweeping and direct language deprive a federal court of jurisdiction.mcbride,at citing anderson babbitt,cir rumbles,at see also cottrell,exhaustion of administrative remedies not a jurisdictional prerequisite to court consideration of chapter debtor claim even though exhaustion required by statute.in bastek the court did not address whether the language of e was sweeping and direct,but merely stated that e was explicit.however,the language in e is no more explicit than that in a of the plra which no circuit considers jurisdictional.a contrary interpretation would make virtually all statutory exhaustion provisions jurisdictional,regardless of whether they contain sweeping and direct jurisdictional language.such a rule can not be squared with the supreme court decision in salfi.
after reviewing the cases and comparing e to other statutes we conclude that e is nothing more than a codified requirement of administrative exhaustion and is thus not jurisdictional.salfi,at.see also mcbride,at.sec
