this case concerns a claim for disability benefits under the home protection plan of life and disability coverage for purchasers hereafter the home protection plan established by respondent department of veterans affairs of the state of california hereafter the department under the veterans farm and home purchase act of mil,et,hereafter sometimes the act,commonly called the program.we granted review to address the question whether disability coverage under the home protection plan is insurance that is subject to mandatory provisions of the insurance code.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the answer is negative.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
this matter involves a dispute concerning whether the insurance code governs the terms of disability coverage under the home protection plan.
the program has been described as follows.the veterans farm and home purchase act of was enacted to provide veterans with the opportunity to acquire farms and homes.mil.under the act,the department is empowered to buy farms and homes from their owners and sell the properties back to eligible veterans under installment contracts at a low rate of interest.since the sale is by installments,the department retains legal title to a property until the price has been paid in full.citation.funds for the department purchases are provided by the public through general obligation bonds.department of veterans affairs duerksen d,fns.omitted.the act is a carefully controlled program designed to assist veterans in acquiring residences.duerksen,at.
as part of the program,the department requires loan applicants to submit an application for the home protection plan,which provides coverage for loss of life and for permanent total disability.to be eligible for life coverage,applicants must agree to submit satisfactory evidence of insurability and pay monthly premiums.to be eligible for disability coverage,they must qualify for life coverage and,in addition,must be under years of age,be regularly employed outside the home for at least hours a week,and show satisfactory evidence of insurability.
the home protection plan is administered under a master agreement with the department by pacific mutual group life insurance company hereafter pacific mutual,which reviews,approves,and monitors applications for coverage.pacific mutual provides administrative services only it neither insures nor underwrites any liability of the department or any obligation under the home protection plan.coverages under the plan are a form of benefits as between the department and each participant.
pacific mutual annually calculates the contribution necessary to fund the home protection plan and the department deposits that amount into one of two bank accounts constituting the fund.participants premiums are also deposited into the accounts.the funds are invested by pacific mutual.if the accounts become insufficient,the department may make an additional contribution to the account.pacific mutual investigates and approves claims,and pays approved claims to the department from the funds in the account.specifically,under the disability coverage,if a participant is totally disabled for more than three months,pacific mutual pays an amount equal to the monthly loan installment to the department from the account.
as provided in the master agreement,basic death coverage shall be incontestable after it has been in force during the lifetime of the participant for two years.there is no similar limit on contestability of disability claims the master agreement states that n o benefits shall be payable for permanent and total disability if such disability resulted from a condition the date of loan approval by the department.
the department of insurance has taken the position that the home protection plan is not insurance subject to the provisions of the insurance code.if a participant in the program submits a complaint or inquiry to the department of insurance regarding disability coverage under the home protection plan,it refers the matter to the department and issues a form letter sent to the participant,and copied to the department stating that such inquiry does not relate to a matter within the jurisdiction of this department.
in,appellant bruce sweatman iii,a veteran,obtained a loan to purchase a home in riverside county under the program.under the loan contract,he agreed,as required by the department,to maintain various forms of insurance,including disability insurance payable to the department,as added security for performance of the contract.he applied for disability coverage under the home protection plan,submitting an application including information concerning his medical history.
in his application,sweatman answered affirmatively the question whether he had been examined in the past five years by a doctor,physician,psychiatrist,or chiropractor.he provided the following details in may,he had been tested for hiv before being married in march,he had been treated for a pulled muscle in his left shoulder his personal physician was ron pepitone.he answered negatively the question whether he had been in a hospital,sanitarium,or other institution for observation,rest,diagnosis,or treatment in the last years.he also answered negatively questions as to whether he had ever had symptoms of,or been examined or treated for,any of a variety of conditions,including disorder.
the application included a signed declaration by sweatman to the effect that all of the statements contained in the application were true and correct and that no material information has been withheld or omitted concerning the past and present state of my health,and acknowledging that any willful misstatements shall make any coverage based on this application void at the option of the administrator.
in fact,sweatman had been hospitalized for two weeks in july with a diagnosis of major depression.he was treated by a psychiatrist,edmond whiteley,until early for that condition,with a consideration of a diagnosis of bipolar disease and posttraumatic stress disorder.
sweatman application for life and disability coverage was approved,subject to a rider excluding coverage for injury to or disease of the left shoulder.the rider stated that it form s part of the supplemental disability benefit documents under the homeowners plan funded by the department of veteran affairs.he received a pamphlet entitled home protection plan of life and disability coverage for purchasers,describing coverage under the plan.the pamphlet summarized the policy provisions concerning claims limitations,including the limitation that total disability was not covered if it was the direct result of a condition,bodily injury or disease which existed at the date of the underwriting decision.he did not receive a certificate of coverage,nor was his application endorsed upon or attached to the policy.
in,sweatman submitted a claim for disability benefits.he described the disability as bipolar ii.he listed a hospital confinement at oceanside hospital for treatment in july.after an investigation,which included review of medical records,pacific mutual declined the claim and rescinded the life and disability coverage on the ground that sweatman had misrepresented his medical history his loan contract would be credited for premiums paid for the coverage.it subsequently reinstated the life coverage due to the contract language which states that the coverage can not be rescinded after it has been in force for two years disability premiums charged before the denial of coverage for disability were credited to his account and his monthly installment for life coverage,and interest was adjusted accordingly.
sweatman brought this action against the department and pacific mutual for breach of contract.he contended,as pertinent herein,that the disability coverage constituted insurance,and hence was incontestable under insurance code section.summary judgment was granted in favor of pacific mutual on the ground that it was only the administrative agent for the department.
trial commenced in february.the superior court denied the department motions in limine for a ruling that the home protection plan was not insurance.it subsequently denied a motion for a directed verdict in which sweatman contended that the home protection plan was insurance and that it was therefore regulated by the insurance code.
the jury returned a special verdict,finding that the department did not breach its contract with sweatman under the home protection plan by rescinding his disability benefits.sweatman moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,contending that the home protection plan constituted insurance subject to the mandatory provisions of the insurance code,including the requirement that disability insurance include an incontestability clause.the superior court denied the motion,stating that the legal basis supporting the jury verdict was the law governing contracts,rescission,and false representation.it thus impliedly rejected the claim that the disability plan constituted insurance.
sweatman appealed from the order denying the motion.he contended that the home protection plan was insurance that must be construed to comply with the insurance code,under the provisions of which he could not be denied disability benefits.
the court of appeal affirmed.it concluded that although the home protection plan involved the functions of shifting and distributing a risk of loss,the disability coverage,like the collision damage waiver offered by car rental companies in truta avis rent a car system,d,was merely an optional and incidental element of the overall transaction between sweatman and the department,the principal object and purpose of which were financing the purchase of a home.as a matter of law,it was not insurance subject to the provisions of the insurance code.
we granted review we now affirm.
sweatman appealed from the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.a trial court must render judgment notwithstanding the verdict whenever a motion for a directed verdict for the aggrieved party should have been granted.code civ.a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted only if it appears from the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the party securing the verdict,that there is no substantial evidence in support.hauter zogarts cal d.
the moving party may appeal from the judgment or from the order denying the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,or both.code civ,subd.a making such an order appealable.as in the trial court,the standard of review is whether any substantial or the jury conclusion.hauter zogarts,supra,cal d at.
sweatman does not dispute that there was substantial evidence that his application for coverage under the home protection plan did not disclose his history of depression,and that the master agreement excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and permits rescission for misstatements in the application.rather,he contends that his claim for benefits was incontestable as a matter of law,under mandatory provisions of the insurance code.the jury herein was not asked to resolve any factual questions bearing on the question whether the life and disability plan constituted insurance.nor do the parties offer conflicting evidence on this point.
the sole question before us,then,is one of law was the disability coverage offered by the department under the program a form of insurance subject to the insurance code,including the requirement that disability insurance policies include an incontestability clause we accordingly address the issue under a de novo standard of review 
the insurance code includes numerous compulsory requirements for policies of disability insurance,et specifying compulsory standard provisions for disability policies.thus,as pertinent herein,insurance code section mandates that a disability policy must contain an incontestable clause,providing that n o claim for disability as defined in the policy commencing after two years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.the insurance code further requires,in section,that t he insured shall not be bound by any statement made in an application for a policy unless a copy of such application is attached to or endorsed on the policy when issued as a part thereof.other compulsory standard provisions relate to changes in the policy,time limits on certain defenses,grace periods,reinstatement of the policy,notice of claim,claim forms,proof of loss,time for payment of claim,payment of claims,physical examinations,limitations of actions,and change of beneficiary.policies that do not contain the required provisions are enforceable as if they did.
