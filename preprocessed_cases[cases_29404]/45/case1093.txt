the ultimate question in this appeal is whether an insurance company that was both the administrator of a disability benefits plan under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,et,and the issuer of the disability insurance policy thereunder,justifiably terminated disability benefits based on its determination that the disability had ended.the answer turns principally on the meaning of the insured own occupation as used in the disability insurance policy.the district court upheld the insurance company application of that term.we affirm.
in the appellant bruce osborne was the chairman of the board and president of insurex agency,inc,and insurex benefits administrators,collectively insurex,which his brief describes as a small insurance agency and administrative company.insurex was a subsidiary of tpi restaurants,which operates the shoney chain of restaurants.osborne was a participant in shoney erisa plan,which included disability insurance.the appellee hartford life and accident insurance hartford was both the administrator of the erisa plan and the issuer of the disability insurance policy.the disability policy provided coverage if osborne became totally disabled,defined under the plan as prevented by disability from doing all the material and substantial duties of your own occupation on a full time basis.
according to the job description,osborne had the following duties as president of insurex 
responsible for the sales and marketing of new clients that entails extensive traveling.negotiating with insurance companies on quotes for proposals and renewal rates.providing customer service and assistance to the existing clients.meeting with brokers to discuss prospective clients and existing clients.oversee the internal functions of the company,staff and production issues.
in,osborne suffered a severe heart attack.he resigned as president of insurex in that month,but continued as chairman of the board.hartford began disability payments to him.prior to,osborne had travelled approximately two weeks out of the month.in the last year of his employment,osborne curtailed traveling to approximately one week every other month.
following preliminary and more detailed investigations,hartford concluded in that osborne was no longer disabled and terminated his benefit payments.the preliminary investigation had indicated that osborne was playing golf and cards at his country club.during the investigation osborne had told hartford that he played rounds of golf a year.he also had been seen on three occasions playing cards at the country club for several hours.
hartford wrote osborne that it intended to terminate his disability benefits based on policy language and all the documents contained in osborne claim file hartford stated that it had determined that under the united states department of labor dictionary of occupational titles the dictionary,osborne former position with insurex was classifiable as president,financial institution,which was a sedentary position whose work osborne could perform.
osborne administratively appealed that decision within hartford.hartford then had vita,a cardiologist,review osborne file.vita concluded that osborne could perform the sedentary work that hartford had concluded osborne position involved.vita conclusion was contrary to that given by osborne treating physician,newman.hartford adhered to its decision that osborne no longer was disabled.
osborne filed the present suit challenging hartford decision in a tennessee state court.hartford removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of tennessee pursuant to erisa complete preemption provision,a.
the district court granted hartford motion for judgment on the record and dismissed the case.it ruled that hartford reliance upon the dictionary as a basis for determining the meaning of own occupation in the insurance policy was not arbitrary or capricious,and that hartford determination that osborne no longer was disabled was reasonable.
hartford termination of osborne disability he was once again able to perform the duties of his position and therefore no longer was on the following rulings the basis for determining his occupation was the dictionary under the dictionary his occupation was president,financial institution and this was a sedentary position whose duties he could perform.hartford determination that osborne could perform those duties rested on its resolution of conflicting medical opinions.
osborne principal contention in this appeal is that hartford improperly relied on the dictionary in determining his occupation.he contends that instead hartford should have looked to the actual work he performed at insurex which,he contends,involved substantial travel and required mobility by the performer.
resolution of this issue implicates erisa,the erisa plan and the hartford disability insurance contract that was part of that plan.
erisa itself provides no light on the point.it defines employee welfare benefit plan and welfare plan to include any plan providing for its participants through the purchase of insurance benefits in the event of disability.an insurance company that issues an insurance policy under an erisa plan may serve as the administrator of the plan,see kalish liberty life assur.of boston,cir,which is a fiduciary position,see.
the erisa plan provides for disability insurance coverage.pursuant to this plan,hartford issued a group insurance disability policy.the policy provides for payment of benefits during the time an employee is totally disabled.v.benefits will be paid until the employee is no longer disabled.id.
section i of the policy defines totally disabled to mean that 
you are prevented by disability from doing all the material and substantial duties of your own occupation on a full time basis.
the insurance policy also provides that hartford has full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe and interpret all of its terms and provisions.id.the policy,however,does not state the basis upon which hartford will determine disability,whether an employee is unable to perform the duties of the employee own occupation.
in light of the insurance policy provisions relating to hartford making disability determinations,we conclude that the policy contemplates that hartford will have broad discretion in determining what is an employee own occupation,including the basis for making that determination.
as the district court stated and as osborne recognized,the erisa plan in this case,which gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits,is reviewed to determine whether hartford action is arbitrary and capricious.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.this standard applies to hartford decision to use the dictionary to determine osborne own occupation.here,as the district court ruled,the policy in this action grants hartford full discretion and authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms of the plan.the district court correctly recognized that t he arbitrary or capricious standard is a highly deferential standard of review.yeager reliance standard life ins,cir.
we agree with the district court that hartford use of the dictionary to determine osborne own occupation was not arbitrary and capricious,but on the contrary was reasonable.the word occupation is sufficiently general and flexible to justify determining a particular employee occupation in light of the position descriptions in the dictionary rather than examining in detail the specific duties the employee performed.occupation is a more general term that seemingly refers to categories of work than narrower employment terms like position,job,or work,which are more related to a particular employee individual duties.although reasonable persons may disagree over the most appropriate methodology for determining a particular employee occupation,we can not say that hartford transgressed the boundaries of its broad discretion under its insurance policy and the erisa plan to make disability determinations.gallagher reliance std.life ins,cir stating that use of a dictionary job descripti
