defendant old dominion freight lines,old dominion,appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,gerard lynch,judge,ordering it to pay in damages and prejudgment interest to plaintiff security insurance company of hartford security as subrogee of the shipper of goods carried by old dominion that were stolen prior to delivery to their final destination.the district court,in an opinion and order dated august,district court opinion,granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiff,ruling,inter alia,that,under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,carmack amendment,old dominion was strictly liable for the loss of the goods and that plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence as to the quality and quantity of the goods delivered to old dominion for carriage.the court also rejected old dominion contention that the present suit was not timely.on appeal,old dominion contends principally that the district court erred in rejecting its untimeliness argument,in ruling that old dominion was subject to strict liability,rather than to a negligence standard,and granting summary judgment despite the presence of genuine issues of fact to be tried as to the contents and condition of the shipment when delivered to old dominion.we reject old dominion first two contentions substantially for the reasons stated in the district court opinion at.we find merit in the third contention for the reasons that follow.
background 
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.old dominion,a trucking company,and rj reynolds tobacco company rjr were parties to a contract for the carriage of goods from rjr central distribution center in,north carolina rjr distribution center or distribution center.pursuant to the contract,on july,a shipment of winston cigarettes and camel light cigarettes was loaded onto an old dominion truck at the distribution center and was to be transported to rjr consignee,in montreal,canada the july shipment.through a subcontractor,old dominion transported the cigarettes to the canadian border there the shipment was stopped by canadian customs officials,who ordered it detained until it received clearance.pending customs approval of its release,the cargo was placed in a bonded warehouse.the cargo was stolen,by persons unknown,from the warehouse.
when the july shipment failed to arrive at its final destination,investigated and reported the theft to the montreal police.the canadian mounties ultimately recovered some of the cargo however,due to concerns about the quality of the recovered cigarettes,those cigarettes were destroyed.
rjr filed a claim with old dominion seeking compensation for the stolen cargo,and filed an insurance claim with its insurer,security.security eventually paid for the loss and brought the present suit as subrogee of rjr claim against old dominion,requesting in damages,plus interest,costs,and attorneys fees.
security motion for summary judgment 
security moved for summary judgment on its claim,submitting,to the extent pertinent to the merits,an affirmation by its attorney michael slevin and an affidavit by walter nowicki,who in july was a distribution manager at the rjr distribution center.thereafter,security also submitted the affidavit of robert mcmaster,who in was director of taxation and insurance of the formerly called.the slevin affirmation,dated january,slevin aff,briefly summarized the events and attached the bill of lading for the july shipment,a chronology of the events surrounding that shipment,which slevin described as having been prepared by unidentified employees,the contract between old dominion and rjr,and correspondence between old dominion and rjr with respect to old dominion rejection of rjr claim.
the nowicki affidavit described procedures generally used at the rjr distribution center to prepare shipments for transport 
the process used to retrieve and ship cigarettes is as follows 
when the carrier truck arrives,an order is activated in our central distribution management system and our automated retrieval system begins to send the product through a series of conveyor systems directly to the truck loading dock at which the carrier truck is parked.
the movement of the product is monitored until it is confirmed arrived at the loading dock.
the product is then removed from the storage pallet and loaded on the floor of the truck.
once the truck is loaded,the order is confirmed as being complete,closed out and shipped in the central distribution management system.at this point the bill of lading is printed.an order can not be closed out or confirmed shipped unless of the required product has been delivered to the appropriate truck dock.
once the order is confirmed shipped in the central distribution management system,our inventory records are decremented sic by the amount loaded and shipped.this is confirmed through our inventory reconciliation process.our inventories are reconciled to the book inventory daily as required by the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms.
when the bill of lading is printed,it is presented to the carrier for a signature and date and becomes our proof of shipment.the truck is then released to the carrier driver.
affidavit of walter nowicki dated january,nowicki aff.
as to the july shipment in particular,nowicki stated only that the shipment 
was tendered to old dominion freight lines odfl for carriage from,nc to the premises of in montreal,quebec,canada.invoice was a made to order invoice.the two items shipped on this invoice were unique to this order and produced to a specific quantity.a true copy of the bill of lading for this shipment is attached hereto as exhibit a.a representative of odfl,presumably the driver of the truck,signed this document on july.
nowicki aff.although nowicki stated that he was familiar with these procedures see id,he did not state that he had any personal knowledge as to the july shipment.
the mcmaster affidavit indicated that mcmaster had no personal knowledge with respect to the july shipment a different employee had been responsible for filing claims with the trucker and the insurer,and mcmaster had subsequently assumed that employee duties mcmaster stated that he had reviewed business records with respect to that shipment.affidavit of robert mcmaster dated december,mcmaster aff.in addition to the bill of lading,the documents attached to the mcmaster affidavit were the first page of the rjr invoice for the shipment bearing the number,a canadian customs invoice for taxes due,and a copy of check to customs.the rjr invoice indicated that the shipment contained cases of winston box and cases of camel mcmaster aff.exh.according to the packing details section of that invoice,the gross weight of the cases was pounds.the weight of the cases of camel lights was not shown the bottom of the page bore a notion that the packing details were continued on next page id,but no other pages were attached to the affidavit or otherwise made part of the district court record.the customs invoice showed the assessment of tax on a shipment containing winston cigarettes and camel cigarettes.mcmaster aff.exh.mcmaster stated that had filed a claim with security for the loss of the july shipment and that security had paid it for that loss.see mcmaster aff.
the bill of lading,dated july,which was attached as exhibit a to the nowicki and mcmaster affidavits and the slevin affirmation and which will henceforth be cited simply as exhibit a,referred to invoice number and listed the contents of the shipment as cases of camel light cigarettes weighing the unit unspecified,and cases of winston box cigarettes weighing unit unspecified.see exhibit a at.the bill of lading also bore the notations shipper load and unload id.at and seal id.at id.at.
in opposition to security summary judgment motion,old dominion proffered no affidavits but noted that security had not submitted a statement of undisputed material facts,as required by local rule,and argued that the presence of several genuine issues of material fact was apparent from security own submissions.old dominion argued that one such issue was whether the cargo was delivered to old dominion in good condition.old dominion contended that the nowicki affidavit suggested that the cargo had been loaded and sealed by rjr and if the cargo were sealed prior to its receipt by old dominion,the bill of lading would not constitute prima facie evidence of the cargo delivery in good condition.
in reply,security argued that the nowicki affidavit sufficed to establish the condition and contents of the july shipment because it showed that shipments are generally loaded into a carrier truck in the presence of the carrier employee and that,in the present case,old dominion employee had initialed the bill of lading.
b.the decision of the district court 
the district court granted security motion for summary judgment.the court noted that in order to make a prima facie case of carrier liability under the carmack amendment,security was required to show that the cargo was delivered to the carrier in good condition,that it arrived at the destination in damaged condition or failed to arrive at all,and that security suffered damages.district court opinion at.the court stated that because old dominion conceded that the cargo was stolen from the canadian warehouse and thus was never delivered to,the second element is met and plaintiff need only present evidence of the first and third elements of the prima facie case.id.
as to the first element,the court noted that a clean bill of lading is ordinarily prima facie evidence of delivery to the carrier in good condition,but that old dominion argued that security had failed to present evidence that the cargo was delivered in good condition to the carrier,because the cigarettes were in sealed packages and the carrier could not inspect the condition or quantity of cargo upon receipt.id.at.the court acknowledged that 
a clean bill of lading does not constitute prima facie evidence of the condition of goods shipped in sealed packages where the carrier is prevented from observing the damaged condition had it existed when the goods were loaded.bally,zim america,cir,quoting caemint food,brasileiro,cir.in the case of a sealed container,the shipper must present other evidence to show that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good order.see bally,at.the question here is whether plaintiff has presented evidence that the cigarettes were provided to old dominion in good condition in the amounts specified.
district court opinion at.the court answered that question in the affirmative,despite noting that the nowicki affidavit is unclear about the nature of the cargo packaging,and that old dominion raised an issue of fact as to the packaging.id.at.the court stated that 
e ven assuming that the cargo was packaged in such a way that prevented inspection,there is sufficient other evidence of quantity and quality demonstrating delivery in good order to the carrier,and old dominion has failed to present any evidence creating a contested issue of material fact concerning the condition of cargo upon receipt.
as to quantity,the consignee sic invoice and the bill of lading state the number of boxes of cigarettes and their weight.old dominion does not dispute the weight of the shipment upon delivery or thereafter,or suggest that the cargo weighed less than what that amount of cigarettes should weigh.since the carrier had a contractual duty to weigh the cargo contract d,its failure to contest that the weight of the cargo conformed to the purported number of boxes in the shipment confirms that the cargo contained the number of cigarettes indicated on the bill of lading.
as to quality,the nowicki affidavit provides detailed information on the retrieval system at the rjr facility.the multiple checks on inventory and the precise system described,in addition to the highly regulated nature of the cargo,provide ample basis for a factfinder to infer that the cargo was received in good condition.once again,old dominion presents no evidence from which a factfinder could draw any other conclusion.in any event,the issue of quality is something of a red herring.this is not a case in which goods were delivered to the consignee in poor condition,and the question is whether they were originally shipped that way or the damage occurred during carriage.here,the goods were never delivered,and there is no dispute that they were stolen during carriage.under these circumstances,the issue of quality could at most bear on damages,and not on the carrier liability.
district court opinion at emphasis added.
judgment was eventually entered awarding security a total of,comprising in damages and in prejudgment interest.for the reasons that follow,we disagree with the district court conclusion that security established its prima facie case as a matter of law,and we thus vacate and remand for further proceedings.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see,pierre dyer,cir.if,as to the issue on which summary judgment is sought,there is any evidence in the record from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the opposing party,summary judgment is improper.gummo village of depew,cir,cert.denied,d chambers trm copy centers,cir see anderson liberty lobby,d summary judgment is proper only when there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.the burden of showing that no genuine factual dispute exists rests on the party seeking summary judgment,see,adickes kress,d,and in assessing the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to a material fact,the court is required to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought,see,liberty lobby,at.stern trustees of columbia university,cir.
a summary judgment motion may be made with or without supporting affidavits,see.a however,to the extent that affidavits are relied on,they shall be made on personal knowledge,shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.e emphases added.if the summary judgment motion is not made and supported as provided in rule,the rule does not impose on the party opposing summary judgment an obligation to come forward with affidavits or other admissible evidence of his own.pierre dyer,at.indeed,w here the evidentiary matter in support of the motion does not establish the absence of a genuine issue,summary judgment must be denied even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented.adickes,at.quoting.advisory committee note emphasis in adickes see also giannullo city of new york,cir where the movant fail s to fulfill its initial burden of providing admissible evidence of the material facts entitling it to summary judgment,summary judgment must be denied,even if no opposing evidentiary matter is presented,for the is not required to rebut an insufficient showing internal quotation marks omitted.
in reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment,we review the record de novo,drawing all factual inferences and resolving all ambiguities in favor of the nonmoving party.see,harris provident life accident insurance,cir gummo village of depew,at.
as discussed by the district court,a shipper burden of proving that the goods were delivered to the carrier in good condition may be satisfied by the proffer of a clean bill of lading for the shipment,provided that the cargo was packaged in a way that permitted its inspection by the carrier.see generally madow liberty exporter,cir.however,where the contents of a shipment are not visible or open for inspection,as may be the case when cargo is transferred to the carrier in a sealed container,a clean bill of lading is not sufficient to establish delivery of the goods in good condition.bally,zim america,cir clean bill of lading is prima facie evidence of delivery of the goods to the carrier in good condition under the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa for unsealed,bu
