an insurance company and its insured dispute the meaning and scope of a term in the company insurance policy.the insured filed suit in the district court for a declaratory judgment that the policy means what the insured contends.in response,the insurance company moved to compel arbitration,pursuant to an arbitration provision contained not in the insurance policy,but in an ancillary agreement between the parties governing the insured obligations and responsibilities in making various payments to the insurance company.the district court denied the motion,ruling that the arbitration provision does not cover the particular dispute.alticor,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,pa,order.we affirm.
a.the basic facts are undisputed.for some years the appellant,national union fire insurance of pittsburgh,pa national union,has issued general liability insurance policies to the appellee alticor,alticor.the policy limits national union liability for each occurrence to million.the policy also contains a deductible of million per occurrence and states that national union obligation to pay damages applies only to the amount of damages in excess of any deductible amounts and the limits of insurance applicable to each occurrence for such coverages will be reduced by the amount of such deductible.
under this insurance policy,national union appears to have no liability,because its million liability limit has a million deductible and its liability is thus reduced to zero by the deductible.at oral argument,however,alticor explained that the function of the policy is to provide insurance coverage for its legal expenses incurred in defending litigation.the insurance policy itself does not contain any arbitration provisions.
in addition to the insurance policy itself,national union and alticor also entered into a separate premium payment agreement that dealt in detail with various aspects of payments by each party.under this agreement,alticor agrees to pay national union the deductible portions of all losses that national union pay s on alticor behalf under such policies as are subject to deductible or loss reimbursement terms.the premium payment agreement includes an arbitration provision stating all unresolved disputes or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement will be submitted to arbitration.the premium payment agreement also details the mechanics of the arbitration process,and refers to the arbitration provision in a section stating that i f you alticor disagree with us national union about any amount that we have asked you to pay,within the time allowed for payment you will.give us written particulars about the items you disagree with and.pay those items you do not disagree with we national union may deem disputed items not resolved by agreement within days after our response to your written particulars to be in default unless arbitration has been commenced in accordance with the arbitration provision.
b.the present case stems from three suits filed against alticor under its former name,amway corporation in texas state courts.under the insurance policy,national union was responsible for paying alticor defense costs in these cases.a dispute arose between national union and alticor over the amount of alticor deductible,which is million per occurrence.alticor contended that because the three texas suits arose out of the same set of facts and circumstances,they constituted a single occurrence and therefore alticor maximum deductible was only million.national union contended that each suit constituted a separate occurrence and that alticor therefore had a total deductible of million.
alticor filed a diversity suit against national union in the united states district court for the western district of michigan,seeking a declaratory judgment that the claims set forth in the texas state court actions constitute one occurrence,offense,or common cause under the terms of the policies and applicable law.in response,national union moved pursuant to the federal arbitration act,to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration under the arbitration clause in the premium payment agreement.
the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,denied national union motion.it ruled that the arbitration clause in the premium payment agreement did not cover the dispute over whether the three texas state suits constituted a single occurrence under the insurance policy.that order is appealable under a a.
the arbitration provision of the premium payment agreement states,in pertinent part 
all unresolved disputes or differences arising out of or relating to this agreement will be submitted to the decision of three arbitrators.
t his agreement is the premium payment agreement.the issue,therefore,is whether the dispute over the meaning of occurrence in the insurance policy aris es out of or relat es to the premium payment agreement.we agree with the district court that it does not.
it is the insurance policy,not the premium payment agreement,that defines the parties substantive rights and duties under the policy.it is the policy that creates and defines alticor liability for the deductible of a specific amount per occurrence.indeed,the policy,but not the premium payment agreement,contains various detailed definitions sections for different endorsements.the policy definition of occurrence states occurrence means an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.although this and other extensive definition sections of the policy appear to shed little,if any,light on the substantive dispute here involved,they do indicate that the dispute aris es out of or relat es to the policy itself,and not the premium payment agreement.the latter agreement deals with the mechanics and formalities of premium payment,not the substantive rights of the parties under the insurance policy.
national union contends,however,that the dispute here aris es out of,and certainly relat es to,the premium payment agreement because of the provision in that agreement by which alticor agree d to pay national union the deductible portions of all losses that we pay on your behalf under such policies as are subject to deductible or loss reimbursement terms.according to national union,this provision requires alticor to reimburse national union up to a total of million for the amounts that national union pays in defending the three texas suits,based on national union position that each suit is a separate occurrence under the deductability provision of the insurance policy.national union contends that alticor,by refusing to repay amounts in excess of million,thereby violated its contractual obligations under the premium payment agreement,and that the agreement therefore covers the dispute between the parties and makes it arbitrable.
alticor obligation to repay national union for disbursements made on alticor behalf,however,covers only the deductible amounts set forth in the insurance policy.alticor does not question its general obligation to reimburse national union for the deductible portions of the money national union has paid for alticor.the question in the declaratory judgment suit is what constitutes the deductible portions,and the answer depends upon the meaning of the term occurrence in the policy.alticor requirement under the premium payment agreement to make payments to national union does not convert the determination of the amount of such issue arising under the insurance a dispute relating to or arising under the premium payment agreement.the provision on which national union relies specifies the procedure that alticor is to follow in reimbursing national union,but does not determine the scope of alticor reimbursement obligations.the insurance policy determines that issue.
national union position is not supported by the provision in the premium payment agreement that national union may treat any disputed amount not resolved by agreement after a certain time as in default unless arbitration has been commenced in accordance with the arbitration clause of the premium payment agreement.although that provision recognizes that
