the issue in this insurance subrogation case is whether the equitable made whole rule that an insurer is not entitled to subrogation of medical benefits unless the insured has been made whole trumps an insurer subrogation right.
after respondent vanessa cantu sued multiple parties for severe injuries she sustained in an auto accident,her medical insurer,petitioner fortis benefits,intervened,claiming a subrogation right under the policy.the various defendants settled with cantu,and fortis looked only to cantu for its recovery.a divided court of appeals upheld a trial court finding that because cantu medical expenses exceeded the settlement amount plus the benefits fortis had paid,fortis subrogation claim was barred by the equitable made whole doctrine.we hold that the made whole doctrine must yield to fortis right to contractual subrogation under the plain terms of the insurance policy.
background 
cantu suffered severe injuries in a car wreck and later sued the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding,his employer,the vehicle seller,and the vehicle manufacturer ford.fortis intervened and asserted contractual subrogation and reimbursement rights to recoup from cantu tort recovery the amount of medical benefits it had paid under the policy.at a pretrial conference,fortis agreed with all parties on the record that fortis was excused from participating in the pretrial and trial proceedings and that fortis at the phase would look only to cantu to resolve its subrogation and reimbursement claims.
cantu settled her claims with the defendants before trial for million.cantu and fortis disputed what portion of the settlement proceeds,if any,should go to fortis,and cantu moved for summary judgment,arguing she had not been made whole by the settlement.cantu past medical expenses totaled of which fortis claimed to have paid,and her summary judgment evidence included two life care plans estimating her future medical expenses at roughly million and million.she argued that her past and future medical expenses,exclusive of other amounts like pain and suffering,exceeded the amount of the settlement plus what fortis had already paid.cantu argued that the made whole doctrine precluded fortis contractual claims of subrogation and reimbursement.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of cantu,and a divided court of appeals affirmed 
ii.subrogation and the made whole doctrine 
this court recognized the made whole doctrine years ago in ortiz great southern fire casualty insurance the ortiz family had a fire insurance policy from great southern on their home,but not the contents a fire caused damages of to the home and to personal property,and great southern paid for home repairs the ortizes then sued,alleging that one of its employees negligently started the fire.great southern intervened,claiming a right of equitable subrogation after the ortizes settled with for,the trial court awarded,and the court of appeals affirmed,of that settlement to great southern 
we reversed,holding,an insurer is not entitled to subrogation if the insured loss is in excess of the amounts recovered from the insurer and the third party causing the loss.we reasoned that one justification for equitable subrogation is to prevent the insured from receiving a double recovery,first from the insurer,then from the third party we also recognized,however,that if the insured total recovery is less than his or her losses,equity cuts the other way when either the insurer or the insured must to some extent go unpaid,the loss should be borne by the insurer for that is a risk the insured has paid it to assume.because the settlement in ortiz encompassed both covered and noncovered items,we remanded for a determination of how much of the related to house damage 
ortiz would govern if fortis were merely asserting a claim for equitable subrogation.but fortis is not citing principles of equity to recover its money its policy with cantu conferred on fortis two separate contractual rights of recovery,one styled subrogation and one styled reimbursement.fortis argues that these provisions authorize recovery from cantu million settlement with the defendants,and that neither provision is displaced by the made whole doctrine.we agree.
equitable subrogation contractual subrogation 
our ortiz decision addressed the made whole doctrine in the context of equitable subrogation,but it did not discuss how the doctrine applies,if at all,to contractual subrogation.other courts,however,have discussed whether the doctrine applies in the face of a contract that grants the insurer greater subrogation rights.for example,in oss united services automobile ass n the fifth circuit,applying texas law in a diversity case,was confronted with facts similar to those in this case.the insured was not made whole by the settlement following a car wreck,yet insurer usaa sought enforcement of its contractual subrogation rights under the policy like fortis,usaa urged the fifth circuit to reject the made whole doctrine by distinguishing ortiz as involving equitable rather than contractual subrogation the fifth circuit,relying on the el paso court of appeals decision in means united fidelity life insurance,refused because it believed that,in texas,the same principles govern both equitable and contractual subrogation.
in means,the insureds had challenged the validity of united fidelity contractual subrogation right to foreclose on their property the court noted,whether we have a purely equitable subrogation or,as here,a purely contractual one where both and means agreed to the subrogation,the principles are the same,and the rights of united fidelity life insurance company after the payment were superior to the homestead rights of and means.read in context,the court discussion in means does little more than affirm a subrogee basic rights,whether they arise via contract or equity.moreover,means nowhere addressed the made whole doctrine that we first articulated in ortiz,nor could it have,since ortiz was decided three years later.when the el paso court of appeals declared in means that the principles are the same in contractual and equitable subrogation,it did so against a legal landscape that did not yet include the made whole doctrine for this reason,means is not particularly instructive,nor is oss,which relies predominantly on means.
other texas courts of appeals have addressed the difference between equitable and contractual subrogation.for example,the austin court of appeals in lexington insurance gray recognized the distinction between legal and conventional subrogation the former is governed by equity the latter by contract the court observed that texas courts have given substance to the distinction,noted the unusually hospitable treatment that the right of subrogation has historically received in texas,especially express subrogation agreements,which are given considerable weight and are governed by general contract law principles and cited several cases holding that a subrogee invoking contractual subrogation can recover without regard to the relative equities of the parties.lexington did not specifically involve the made whole doctrine we had adopted a decade earlier in ortiz,but it suggested that this equitable defense would not apply in the face of an express agreement whereby the parties agree in advance that the matter will be governed by contract principles rather than equitable principles.where the policy terms govern subrogation,the court added,there is no reason for the equitable principles usually found in subrogation cases to come into play.
a few years later,however,in esparza scott white health plan the austin court of appeals backed away from this interpretation.the esparzas settled for an amount that did not make them whole,and scott and white sought subrogation under an express provision in the parties insurance contract,citing lexington as holding that the made whole doctrine should apply only to equitable subrogation and not to contractual subrogation the court of appeals disagreed,stating 
the distinction we drew between legal and conventional subrogation in lexington simply means that under conventional
