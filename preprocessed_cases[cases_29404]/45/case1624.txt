highwoods properties,appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of executive risk indemnity,asserting that the district court erred in concluding that highwoods was not entitled to coverage under its insurance policy with executive risk for its losses as a result of a lawsuit filed against it as an entity.we affirm.
this case involves the interpretation of two insurance policies and the determination of which policy applies in light of two filed in state court prior to the completion of a corporate takeover,and the other filed in federal court after the takeover.highwoods first purchased a policy in to insure its directors and officers in the event that claims were filed against them.the policy did not include coverage for the company as an entity,covering only claims made against individuals in covered positions within the company during the policy period from june,to june.highwoods insurance policy policy.
highwoods arranged a merger with nichols company,a missouri real estate company,that was to occur july.in january,dennis wright,a nichols shareholder,filed a lawsuit on behalf of himself and a potential class of shareholders never certified against nichols,nichols officers,and highwoods,claiming breach of fiduciary duty and seeking to enjoin the merger.class action complaint,wright hoskins,no.highwoods filed a motion to dismiss,contending that it did not at that time have a fiduciary obligation to nichols shareholders.the state court granted the motion and dismissed wright claims against highwoods.
soon after wright was filed,highwoods notified executive risk that a claim had been filed against it and sought coverage.executive risk denied coverage,stating that t here is no coverage for the corporate entity other than for its obligation to indemnify insured persons it is our understanding that no such proceeding has been commenced against any insured person.therefore,there is at this time no claim as defined in the policy.joint appendix ja.highwoods negotiated a new insurance policy in having a policy period from june,to june.highwoods insurance policy policy.although it was also a policy,it included entity coverage for company securities claims in addition to coverage for highwoods directors and officers.

highwoods notified executive risk when flake was filed in federal court and sought coverage under the policy.executive risk again rejected coverage,stating that flake was not a claim made within the policy period of the policy because a previous purported class action wright relating to the merger was brought against the same defendants and related claims are treated as having been made when the first claim was made.ja.flake was therefore considered to be a claim made within the policy period of the policy.id.because the policy did not provide entity coverage,executive risk would not provide coverage for flake.
highwoods filed suit against executive risk in missouri state court to recover its unreimbursed losses executive risk removed the case to the united states district court for the western district of missouri based on diversity,and both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment for executive risk,finding that wright was a prior claim that barred coverage for flake under the policy related claims provision.see policy ii k.it concluded that flake was related to wright because it involved a related series of facts,circumstances,situations,transactions or events.order of oct,at declining to find ambiguity and stating that liability is clearly precluded under the phrase related series of facts because the flake claim is best described as the wright claim successor.the court concluded that no objectively reasonable insured operating under the policy could have expected that the flake federal claim would be covered.id.at.
the outcome of this case turns on two inquiries whether wright falls within the definition of claim in the policy,and whether flake is a related claim that is therefore considered to be the same claim as wright,which was made outside the relevant policy period.the parties do not dispute that the policy did not include entity coverage or that the policy did include such coverage.they disagree,however,over whether the loss for flake is covered by the terms of the policy.highwoods argues that flake is an independent claim made during the policy period of the policy and that it is thus a covered claim based on the entity coverage included in the policy.it asserts that wright did not qualify as a claim under either policy and,alternatively,that it could not be considered a related claim to flake because flake was grounded in different facts and distinct legal theories.executive risk argues that flake and wright are related claims under the policy because both claims arose out of the merger between nichols and highwoods,included similar allegations,and involved both the same putative class of plaintiffs and the same defendants.
