joel drum drum appeals from orders of the trial court imposing amounts of monetary sanctions upon him as the result of his repeated failure to appear at order to show cause hearings.he claims that the trial judge was biased and that his orders are therefore void,and in the alternative claims that the trial judge abused his discretion in imposing multiple sanctions orders against him.on our own motion we find that this appeal is untimely and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to hollister convalescent,rico cal d,hollister see also laraway pasadena unified school dist.th,d.in reaching this determination we disagree with the holding in lim silverton th supp,d lim.however,we also find that this case,because it involves uncertainty in the law with respect to the appealability of the monetary sanctions orders in question,presents special circumstances meriting treatment of the late appeal as a petition for an extraordinary writ.we deny the writ petition.
facts and procedural history 
drum filed a complaint for subrogation on behalf of plaintiff california casualty insurance company ccic on january,against the defendant owner and defendant driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.the alleged negligence of those defendants caused ccic to pay a claim to its insured as the result of an accident.the complaint sought damages in the amount of,which brought the matter into the jurisdiction of the limited civil court.code civ.judgment was entered on behalf of ccic and against both defendants on november.
nearly one year later the defendants filed a motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction.after a hearing,that motion was granted as to the defendant owner of the uninsured vehicle.at that time a status hearing was set for march.drum failed to appear at that hearing and the trial court issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed or the matter dismissed for that failure.the status conference was continued to the same date.drum again failed to appear so that on april,the trial court ordered sanctions against him in the amount of.it continued the status conference and issued another order to show cause regarding sanctions or dismissal and an order to show cause why unserved defendants should not be dismissed.on may,sanctions in the amount of were ordered for drum failure to appear,and the hearing was again continued.further,drum was ordered to appear on may,to show cause why the case should not be dismissed and was told that if he did not appear the case would be dismissed and sanctions imposed.again drum did not appear.the trial court ordered sanctions against him in the amount of,continued the hearing again and reported him to the state bar.drum failed to appear on june,and on november,at which times sanctions in the amount of and,respectively,were ordered against him.
status conferences were held on additional dates but no sanctions were ordered for drum continued failure to appear.then,on august,drum was sanctioned for his failure to appear and was again ordered to be present in court.on february,the trial court imposed sanctions in the amount of.another hearing passed at which no further sanctions were ordered.then,on february,the trial court imposed additional sanctions in the amount of for drum failure to appear on that date.further sanctions of were ordered for drum failure to appear on march.on september,the trial court ordered sanctions of,stayed to march.although the record does not so reflect,drum notice of appeal indicates that the action was ordered dismissed on september.
the appeal was properly made to the appellate division of the superior court in that this is a limited civil case.because drum failed to file a change of address during the time that he was ignoring the orders of the trial court to appear,the appellate division mailed its request for additional briefing on the issue of the timeliness of the appeal and its ultimate opinion to an incorrect address.the appellate division filed its opinion,certified for publication,on october.thereafter,on its own motion,this court ordered the appeal transferred to it under the authority provided in california rules of court,rules and a in order to secure uniformity of decision and to settle an important question of law.this court determined that drum had not had an opportunity to brief the issue of the timeliness of his appeal and allowed him to file a supplemental brief.
discussion 
drum urges as grounds for reversal of the trial court sanctions orders that the trial court was prejudiced against him as defined in section,subdivision a a iii and a b,and the orders were therefore void,and that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing monetary sanctions against him.however,because the timeliness of an appeal poses a jurisdictional issue,we must raise the point sua sponte and must consider that question first.
a.the appeal is untimely 
preliminarily,in his supplemental brief,drum urges that government code section requires that we transfer this case back to the appellate division with directions that it vacate its opinion,allow him to file a brief on the issue of the timeliness of his appeal,and then rehear the matter.the appeal is considered de novo before this court and we have provided drum with the chance to file a supplemental brief addressing the issues raised by the appellate division opinion.he availed himself of that opportunity.the purpose of government code section having been served,we see no reason to consume additional time and court resources by insisting on further briefing and hearing of this matter below.
california rules of court,rule a provides,with exceptions that do not apply here,that a notice of appeal in a limited civil case must be filed within days after mailing or service of notice of entry of a judgment or an appealable order,or within days after the entry of judgment.each of the orders imposing monetary sanctions from which drum purports to appeal was entered more than days prior to his filing a notice of appeal on october.thus,if those were appealable orders,his appeal is not timely.
historically,appeals from both limited and unlimited civil cases have been restricted by statute.with certain listed exceptions,an appeal may be taken only from a judgment,other than an interlocutory judgment.this is more commonly known as the one final judgment rule.in addition to the statutory exceptions,the common law has developed its own rules governing appeals from orders that do not finally dispose of all issues before the trial court.one of those rules,extant since at least,holds that an appeal is allowed if the order is essentially a final judgment against a party growing out of a matter collateral to the main proceeding,which either directs the appellant to pay money or directs some action be taken by or against the appellant.sjoberg hastorf cal d.the collateral judgment or collateral order rule remains a viable exception to the one final judgment rule.see san diego unified port dist.douglas barnhart,th,fn,d and marsh mountain zephyr,th,d.
under this collateral order rule,monetary sanctions orders had been held directly appealable as final judgments directing the payment of money.weinrot,supra,cal d at,cseh d.in,the legislature amended section expressly to state that an appeal could be taken f rom a superior court judgment directing payment of monetary sanctions by a party or an attorney for a party only if the amount exceeds seven hundred fifty dollars.lesser sanction judgments against a party or an attorney for a party may be reviewed on an appeal by that party after entry of final judgment in the main action,or,at the discretion of the court of appeal,may be reviewed upon petition for an extraordinary writ,supra,th at,d.no similar amendment was made to section providing for appeals from limited civil cases.
in,section was again amended to add subsections and to subdivision a,which provide that an appeal may be taken directly from either an interlocutory judgment or an order directing the payment of monetary sanctions if the amount exceeds.once again,the legislature did not make any changes to section.the
