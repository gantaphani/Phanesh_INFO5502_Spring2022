background 
cumbre,including its wholly owned subsidiary coachella valley insurance service,is an insurance brokerage focusing on workers compensation insurance.the scif is a public enterprise fund and a state agency under the department of industrial relations.scif provides employers with workers compensation insurance,operating as a business.scif was required to provide a market for employers who needed workers compensation insurance.scif was a direct writer of insurance for most of its existence,but began working with brokers in.in,cumbre applied for and obtained certification to submit business as a broker for scif.
brokerage contracts with scif were agreements,with commissions paid monthly.the standard contract,in effect in,included a provision permitting scif to modify commissions in its discretion,and that it would remain in effect until december,unless revised,suspended or terminated before that date.the agreement further set out the commissions to be paid and provided it was terminable by either party after not less than sixty days prior written notice,among other things.brokers,like cumbre,whose premium volume met certain criteria,were also eligible for override commissions,as preferred brokers,based on volume,retention,and quality.
between and,there was significant increase in loss costs for workers compensation benefits affecting all carriers who wrote insurance in california,causing many insurers to go bankrupt or be liquidated.this had an adverse impact on scif financial condition,because,as the insurer of last resort,it was required by law to provide insurance to any employer requesting workers compensation insurance.
because the amount of business written between and grew more than the amount of surplus available to pay claims,scif was deemed to have reached regulatory action level,requiring scif to submit a capital plan to the department of insurance to reduce the amount of business it wrote and to increase the surplus.in,officers of scif met with the department of insurance to discuss various ways to reduce the loss ratios,which were below industry levels.among several other components of the capital plan,scif was urged to terminate agents producing unprofitable business.unprofitability was determined to mean that the broker exceeded an percent loss ratio for the preceding period.loss ratio refers to the difference between the amount incurred to cover losses in claims compared with the amount of premium earned.the criteria for the broker termination program also included a stop loss per claim and the accumulated account size had to be greater than for the period of,and.
between and,scif financial problems got worse.by december,scif had reached the mandatory control level according to the department of insurance guidelines.this level is the most severe level,at which the department of insurance has authority to take control over a company and replace management.in january,scif was informed by the insurance commissioner that scif needed to continue to work on its inadequate capital position and was asked to take action to improve its financial position and develop a plan to address those issues.scif drafted the risk based capital plan the following month,to increase capital through additional retained earnings,increasing premium rates and reducing commissions to brokers.the department of insurance now required scif to escalate the broker termination program,and made further demands.
after reviewing broker records for the preceding period,it was determined that cumbre met the unprofitable broker criteria,and,in april,scif notified cumbre that its brokerage agreement would be terminated,effective in august.the notice informed cumbre that it could appeal the termination and seek reinstatement.cumbre did so,pointing out to scif that the calculation of the loss ratio failed to include some policies that met the criteria,included policies that should have been excluded,as well as accounts that were no longer clients.
using revised criteria,cumbre argued its loss ratio was just under percent.unfortunately,to reach cumbre calculation,a substantial percentage of its book of business would have to be disregarded approximately percent,and even so,cumbre loss ratio was consistently higher than most other brokers.additionally,the loss ratio was only one of five criteria that compelled cumbre termination under the program,where other brokers only had two or three factors working against them.even after correcting the loss ratio to account for a math error,bringing the loss ratio down to percent,scif opinion about the profitability of cumbre was unchanged.to insure fairness,scif reviewed cumbre appeal twice.
cumbre appeal was therefore unsuccessful.notwithstanding the broker termination program,scif continued to pay commissions for the book of business cumbre brought in even after august,and permitted cumbre to submit policy renewals to scif.cumbre claimed it lost for its preferred broker commissions,and its business valuation expert estimated that cumbre lost as a result of the loss of its workers compensation business,for the loss of other lines of business,for total lost profits of 
the defense experts disputed this estimate,pointing out that the brokerage contract gave scif the right to terminate at any time upon days notice,so any damage estimate was based on a speculative assumption.it also ignored the effect of insurance code section which provides policyholders with continued coverage and representation by a broker,allowing cumbre to continue to place its clients business with scif for up to a year after termination.
further,scif expert noted that of cumbre damage claim related to lines of business other than workers compensation insurance.cumbre damage estimates did not take into account the fluctuations of the stock market,or the fact that cumbre could place its workers compensation business with other carriers,maintaining its broker relationships with employers,and erroneously assumed that some employers would remain insured by scif indefinitely,where the actual analysis showed that out of policies,would be lost for nonpayment of premiums,cancellation for noncompliance with policy terms,or other reasons having nothing to do with the broker termination program.and,contrary to cumbre assertion that it was damaged,its income increased from million in,to million after the termination of the brokerage contract.
in july,cumbre filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief and damages arising from the termination of its brokerage agreement with scif.in march,scif offered reinstatement to all terminated brokers,effective in.the offer of reinstatement provided that brokerages engaged in litigation arising out of the broker termination program were ineligible for reinstatement.because cumbre had instituted legal action,it did not seek reinstatement.
the fifth amended complaint was filed in.it alleged causes of action for violation of the duty of fair procedure,interference with prospective economic advantage,and unfair competition bus,et on december,upon for summary adjudication and summary judgment,the trial court issued a statement of decision denying cumbre motion and granting scif motion for summary judgment.this judgment was appealed in cumbre,state compensation insurance fund,supra,where we affirmed the orders sustaining the demurrers but reversed the summary judgment on the ground there were triable issues of fact.
following the remittitur,the matter proceeded to trial by jury on the remaining causes of action.on march,the jury returned special verdicts finding the termination of cumbre broker status had a significant effect on its substantial economic interest scif creation of the broker termination program was substantively rational scif decision to terminate cumbre broker status was substantively rational and scif provided cumbre with adequate notice of the reasons for termination of its broker status and a reasonable opportunity to respond.judgment in favor of scif was filed on june,from which cumbre appeals.
discussion 
there is substantial evidence to support the judgment on the common law claim for violation of fair procedure.
cumbre argues that the undisputed facts prove that scif termination process was procedurally unfair,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict.we disagree.

discussion 
in making its argument,cumbre focuses on the procedures established by scif to appeal from the decision to terminate a broker.cumbre asserts scif failure to give the criteria used to determine which policies to exclude in determining loss ratio,and any termination based on the percentage of book of business removed in calculating that loss ratio,violated fair procedure.the record shows that scif gave adequate notice of the information needed to assist brokers in making their appeals.

cumbre has not cited any authority to support its contention that scif was required to inform terminated brokers what policies to exclude in determining loss ratio in the appeal.however,it appears from the evidence adduced at trial that scif considered multiple alternative calculations of cumbre loss ratio,at cumbre request,based on the exclusion or inclusion of various policies,until cumbre found a formula that would bring its loss ratio down to just less than percent.this was not persuasive because it required scif to ignore percent of cumbre book of business,and did not take into account the other criteria considered in making the decision to terminate cumbre.to insure fairness,scif reviewed cumbre appeal twice.
the notice informed terminated brokers that the appeal should clearly outline your reasons why this action should be rescinded considering that cumbre was able to provide a binder of data in support of its appeal,the notice provided cumbre with a fair opportunity to present its position.
cumbre argues that if its appeal was denied on the basis of minor calculations,fair procedure was violated.there is nothing in the record to support an inference that cumbre appeal was denied on the basis of minor calculations.
cumbre also argues that fair procedure prohibits termination based on vague,undefined concepts such as unprofitable.cumbre never sought a clarification or definition of the term in the trial court so that objection was forfeited.farmer.franchise tax bd.th,a party on appeal can not successfully complain because the trial court failed to do something it was not asked to do.finally,cumbre argues that scif violated fair procedure by failing to provide cumbre with the evidence relied on by scif in denying the appeal,it conducted proceedings in secret,and it did not give cumbre the opportunity to contest the charges against it.the record shows that the notice of termination informed cumbre that the decision was based on the fact that the brokerage had a combined average loss ratio in excess of percent for the,and policy years,and that a loss limitation of per occurrence was applied to the total incurred losses in the determination of the loss ratio.this adequately informed cumbre of the charges against it.cumbre submitted a binder to scif in connection with its appeal,and its appeal was reviewed twice.
there is substantial evidence to support the judgment.
the jury instructions and special verdict form pertaining to the claim for violation of fair procedure were correct.
cumbre argues that the jury instructions and the special verdict form did not correctly state the law as to procedural fairness.we disagree.
we begin by noting that there are no published decisions discussing the propriety of instructions in actions for violation of fair procedure,and there are no patterned jury instructions.none of the published decisions addressing the common law right to fair procedure discuss the issue of whether a party claiming a violation of that right is entitled to a jury trial.we observe that review of fair procedure violations in the medical peer review context is limited to review by way of extraordinary writ petition.bus.writ review has been utilized in other situations where an organization acts as a gatekeeper over the right to practice a lawful trade or profession.see dougherty haag th.this may be because the logical remedy for an unfair procedure or hearing is a new and fair hearing,or an injunction prohibiting the gatekeeper from enforcing the penalty or exclusion.see pinsker pacific coast society of orthodontists cal d,pinsker i.
