joan amadeo filed this suit after principal mutual life insurance company principal denied her benefits under her disability income insurance policy.principal based its denial on its contention that amadeo regular occupation just prior to her disability was unemployed,despite amadeo year career in the securities industry before she became unemployed during a period of severe depression.the district court granted partial summary adjudication against amadeo on her claim that principal breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing bad faith claim because it found that principal denial of benefits was reasonable as a matter of law.
first,as a matter of our jurisdiction,we hold that amadeo voluntary dismissal of her breach of contract claim does not preclude her from pursuing her appeal of the district court ruling on the bad faith claim.second,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on the bad faith claim.amadeo presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that principal denial of benefits to amadeo was based on a bad faith interpretation of its policy and an inadequate investigation into the basis of amadeo claim.
background 
amadeo began working in the securities industry in the mid,rising to the position of a securities compliance officer in.in she purchased a disability income insurance policy from principal the policy.amadeo continued to be employed in the field of securities compliance for the next seven years,including as vice president of compliance for liberty securities corporation between and and as vice president for compliance at griffin securities corporation in.
in or,amadeo began treatment with a therapist,cassel,for depression.cassel attributed amadeo condition to the jailing of her grandson vinny,who had been in amadeo custody since being removed by court order from her daughter who abused drugs.amadeo condition worsened in,when vinny was charged with first degree murder for killing a prison guard.that year,amadeo told griffin securities about the charges against vinny and the president allegedly told her that we do need people like you around,after which amadeo left her job.
amadeo continued to consult with cassel through march,when cassel recommended that,due to the increasing severity of amadeo depression,she see a psychiatrist for a medical consultation.in january,amadeo began treatment with lovelace,a psychiatrist,and klemp,a therapist.lovelace recorded that amadeo was suffering from symptoms including sadness,insomnia,lethargy,panic attacks,headaches,poor concentration,and flashbacks that first appeared in a milder form in.he diagnosed her as suffering from severe post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and depression.in his recommended treatment plan,he stated that work is not appropriate but noted that amadeo was experiencing a delusion that she was able to work.
klemp notes reflect that amadeo began a job training program in but was unable to stay because of headaches,nausea and episodes of unexpected,irrational crying.in part as a result of klemp interventions in therapy,amadeo admitted to herself that she could not return to employment in the securities industry and applied for disability benefits under her insurance policy and through the social security administration in june.the social security administration granted amadeo disability benefits dating back to january.
amadeo disability income insurance policy provided that a monthly premium would be paid to amadeo if,s olely due to injury or sickness,you are unable to perform the substantial and material duties of your regular occupation in which you were engaged just prior to the disability.gallagher,principal reviewing psychiatrist,examined amadeo application,including the records of her treatment,several times.in his first memorandum to principal claims adjusters,he reported that it appears amadeo has a past history of depression or panic attacks some years ago,approximately or.he indicated that t here are a great number of stressors at this time,the most obvious of which is her grandson being charged with attempted murder.he also noted that amadeo was subjected to physical abuse by her husband for many years,thus,the origin of the diagnosis of ptsd,and was apparently being stalked by the son of the man that vinny is accused of murdering.finally,he stated that the symptoms listed by lovelace would suggest that this patient was not able to work at the time.
after more complete records were received,gallagher reviewed amadeo application a second time.apparently at the instruction of one of principal claims adjusters,he conducted this review solely on the assumption that her regular occupation under the policy was an unemployed person.he concluded that,reviewing the file more fully and from the vantage point of an unemployed person,it would seem that,although distressed,she was capable of carrying on her activities of daily living and therefore was not evidently disabled from her occupation as an unemployed person.principal thereupon denied amadeo claim for payment of benefits because we must consider your regular occupation as that of an unemployed person and you have been able to continue many of your daily activities as an unemployed person.
gallagher reviewed the file again when amadeo appealed principal initial decision.at that time,amadeo submitted additional evaluations from lovelace and klemp and the social security administration grant of disability benefits.gallagher recorded that i t is clearly stated in klemp letter that this woman is incapable of working which,given the symptoms and global assessment of functioning of,seems to be so.however,i do know that this information changes our original opinion about her disability status as an unemployed person.on june,principal rejected amadeo appeal based on its continued position that she was not too disabled to perform the substantial duties of her regular occupation of unemployment.
amadeo filed this action against principal in california state court for tortious bad faith and breach of contract.principal removed the action to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and filed a motion for partial summary adjudication of amadeo bad faith claim and prayer for punitive damages.the district court granted principal motion,finding as a matter of law that principal denial of disability benefits to amadeo was not unreasonable.the parties then stipulated to a dismissal with prejudice of the remaining breach of contract claim in order to pursue this appeal 
ii.jurisdiction 
principal argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the voluntary dismissal of amadeo breach of contract claim had the effect of barring her bad faith claim.we disagree.
there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract that neither party will do anything which will injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.this principle is applicable to policies of insurance.comunale traders general ins,cal d,citation omitted accord kransco am.empire surplus lines ins,cal th,d,egan mutual of omaha ins,cal d.the responsibility of the insurer to act in good faith is not the requirement mandated by the terms of the policy itself but is imposed by law,breach of which sounds in tort notwithstanding that the denial of benefits may also constitute breach of the contract.gruenberg aetna ins,cal d.thus,when an insurer acts in bad faith to withhold benefits due under the policy,the plaintiff will ordinarily have freedom of election between an action of tort and one of contract.crisci security ins,cal d,quoting comunale,at see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.the plaintiff may elect to sue either in contract or in tort,to gain whatever substantive or procedural advantages the election may give.
amadeo initially brought this action alleging both breach of contract and tortious bad faith.principal argues that because the parties agreed to dismiss amadeo breach of contract claim with prejudice under rule a,we must proceed as if a finding was rendered that amadeo insurance contract did not require the payment of disability benefits to her,and therefore principal denial of benefits could not have been in bad faith.this argument has no merit.
principal is correct that the precise nature and extent of the duty imposed by the implied promise will depend on the contractual purposes,egan,at,and therefore if there is no potential for coverage under the policy,a claim for bad faith can not be brought.waller truck ins,cal th,d,see id.at explaining that the complaint,liberally construed,did not assert a risk potentially covered under the policy schwartz state farm fire and cas,th,d,discussing cases.principal is not correct,however,that we must consider the voluntary dismissal of amadeo breach of contract claim as the equivalent of a binding determination that there was no potential for coverage of amadeo claim under the policy.
principal does not distinguish between claim and issue preclusion or explain which of the two categories it believes applies in this case.it appears that principal argument is best considered as a request for application of issue preclusion.principal argues that the dismissal of amadeo breach of contract claim necessarily decided,adversely to amadeo,the issue of potential for coverage of amadeo claim under the policy.issue preclusion,also known as collateral estoppel,attaches only w hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment.arizona california,d quoting restatement second of judgments accord pool water products olin,cir see also allen mccurry,d explaining that collateral estoppel has no application when the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue.principal moved for summary judgment only on the bad faith claim and the prayer for punitive damages.there was no actual litigation of any issue related to the breach of contract claim.a voluntary dismissal of a claim prior to any adjudication and without any stipulated findings of fact does not actually litigate any issue.see lawlor national screen serv.holding that judgment dismissing previous suit unaccompanied by findings did not bind the parties on any issue pelletier zweifel,cir the preclusive effect of a dismissal with prejudice,an unlitigated matter,is examined under the requirements for claim preclusion.since such a judgment is not accompanied by findings,it does not,however,collaterally estop the plaintiff from raising issues that might have been litigated if the case had proceeded to trial.engelhardt bell howell,cir explaining that h ere,as in lawlor,collateral estoppel is not applicable to the voluntary dismissal with prejudice as the case was never tried and hence no findings of fact were made which the parties are precluded from challenging arizona,at.explaining that consent judgments ordinarily occasion no issue preclusion unless it is clear that the parties intend their agreement to have such an effect restatement second of judgments cmt.e in the case of a judgment entered by confession,consent,or default,none of the issues is actually litigated.thus,issue preclusion can not attach to amadeo voluntary dismissal of her breach of contract claim.
claim preclusion,or res judicata,bars successive litigation of the very same claim following a final adjudication on the merits involving the same parties or their privies.new hampshire maine,d accord parklane hosiery shore,d under the doctrine of res judicata,a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.first pacific bancorp helfer,cir goddard security title ins.guarantee,cal d.the dismissal of alternative claims in a pending suit does not adjudicate the entire cause of action,see charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure explaining that cause of action refers to all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction out of which the action arose quoting restatement second of judgments,and therefore a plaintiff who sets forth alternative remedies in separate counts in his complaint may abandon or dismiss one count without prejudice to his right to proceed on the other.steele litton,d.the dismissal of alternative remedies does not constitute a dismissal of plaintiff entire cause of action.id.thus,as we explained in concha,when the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses claims with prejudice in order to appeal an otherwise partial judgment,if the plaintiff is unsuccessful in challenging the district court action,then the dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits and the litigation is terminated the plaintiff is precluded from bringing another action for the same cause,thus forfeiting any possibility of ever obtaining a favorable determination on the merits.at emphasis added.principal is not seeking to preclude another action by amadeo,and therefore claim preclusion does not apply here.
there are important policy reasons why a court should not apply preclusion doctrine to bar the appeal of claims after alternative claims are dismissed.preclusion doctrine is intended to promote judicial efficiency and the finality of judgments by requiring that all related claims be brought together or forfeited claim preclusion and by prohibiting any party from litigating an issue that has been fully litigated previously issue preclusion.as the fourth circuit explained in itco michelin tire,cir,those purposes are not served by applying preclusion doctrine to the dismissal of alternative claims in a single suit to facilitate an appeal.in that case,itco advanced alternative claims against michelin under a north carolina statute and federal antitrust legislation sherman act,but dismissed the latter claim to appeal summary adjudication of the state claim.michelin argued that the dismissal of the federal claim barred itco from advancing,under the guise of the north carolina act,what in essence is the sherman act claim already dismissed voluntarily.id.at.the fourth circuit rejected that argument,explaining that itco decision to dismiss its sherman act claim appears to have been in furtherance of preclusion doctrine purpose in curbing needless litigation.id.
had itco not dismissed its federal claim and not sought an appeal,but,instead,taken its sherman act claim to trial,the prospect of wastefully duplicitous litigation would have arisen.suppose,for instance,that the factfinder at that hypothesized trial were to reject itco allegation of a conspiracy entitling michelin to a judgment in its favor itco,on an ensuing appeal,would be free to challenge the correctness of the summary judgment granted michelin on the state law claim a reversal,a remand,and a second trial in its entirety could thus be required.
id.thus,the court concluded that o nly an application of res judicata in a fashion which has lost sight of that doctrine underlying principles and purposes could prevent itco from pursuing its theory on remand as a legitimate theory of liability id.at.such an application of res judicata would defeat the very purposes the doctrine is intended to serve.id.at.
applying preclusion doctrine to the dismissal of one alternative claim in a single lawsuit to bar another claim in the same suit would impede judicial efficiency,forcing litigants to adjudicate claims of secondary importance to their interests only to preserve an appeal.we agree with the fourth circuit that such an application of preclusion doctrine would defeat the very purpose the doctrine is intended to serve.
because applying either claim or issue preclusion in this case would be contrary to both the doctrinal elements and the policies of preclusion doctrine,we reject principal argument.the dismissal of alternative claims in a single suit does not bar the appeal of other claims in the same suit.courts may properly exercise appellate jurisdiction under when a partial summary judgment is followed by a dismissal of all remaining claims,even if those claims are dismissed with prejudice.we therefore proceed to the merits of the grant of summary judgment,which we review de nov
