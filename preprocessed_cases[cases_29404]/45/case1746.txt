callahan,circuit judge 
in diamond heights homeowners association national american insurance,cal.app,a california appellate court ruled that an excess liability insurer has three options when presented with a proposed settlement of a covered claim that has met the approval of the insured and the primary insurer.the excess insurer must approve the proposed settlement,reject it and take over the defense,or reject it,decline to take over the defense,and face a potential lawsuit by the insured seeking contribution toward the settlement.id.at.under diamond heights,the insured is entitled to reimbursement if the excess insurer was given a reasonable opportunity to evaluate the proposed settlement,and the settlement was reasonable and not the product of collusion.
this diversity case presents such a contribution action.the insured,lma north america,lma sued its excess insurance carrier,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pa national union,in connection with national union refusal to either contribute million toward the settlement of claims brought by a third party or take over the defense.we must decide whether the district court erred in applying the diamond heights rule,instructing the jury,denying national union motion for judgment as a matter of law,and awarding fees and costs.we affirm.
lma insurance policies 
lma had two general liability insurance policies covering claims that lma disparaged other companies a primary policy issued by transcontinental insurance company called cna with a million limit,and an excess policy issued by national union with a million limit.
the national union policy contained a no voluntary payments provision stating that n o insureds will,except at their own cost,voluntarily make a payment,assume any obligation,or incur any expense,other than for first aid,without national union consent.the policy also contained a no action clause stating in relevant part that t here will be no right of action against us under this insurance unless t he amount you owe has been determined with our consent or by actual trial and final judgment.the policy also recognized national union right to participate in the defense of a claim and,following exhaustion of coverage by the primary insurer,a duty to defend the claim.
b.the underlying ambu litigation 
lma and its competitor ambu distribute competing laryngeal mask airway products.in,lma brought a patent infringement suit in federal district court against ambu related to certain laryngeal masks.ambu filed trade disparagement and false advertising counterclaims,demanding million.the counterclaims were premised on allegedly false,disparaging statements in lma advertising regarding ambu products.cna agreed to defend lma on the counterclaims.national union does not dispute that the counterclaims were covered by its insurance policy.
in,the district court granted summary judgment in ambu favor on the patent claims and denied lma summary judgment on the counterclaims.the district court stayed the counterclaims pending resolution of lma appeal.in,the federal circuit reversed dismissal of the patent claims.laryngeal mask ambu,fed.cir.
the parties then held a mediation on january.national union did not attend the mediation,but cna did.lma counsel,stephen marzen,updated national union each day.on the second day,lma and ambu reached a conditional settlement agreement,under which ambu would pay lma million for the patent claims while lma would pay ambu million for the disparagement claims.the settlement was conditioned on lma ability to obtain approval and funding from cna and national union.
while cna committed its full million limit,national union was reluctant to recognize that ambu counterclaims could invade its coverage layer.on february,national union requested an updated analysis of liability and damages from marzen.marzen had previously provided national union with information regarding the counterclaims,including copies of pleadings and discovery,verbal reports,access to other information,and a january,case report assessing potential liability.the case report explained that,if the counterclaims went to trial,ambu could support its damages claim by using internal lma emails that suggested knowledge of a false advertising campaign.the report concluded that lma possible liability ranged up to million,excluding potential treble damages.
on march,lma provided the updated analysis requested by national union.the analysis concluded that,considering the risk of a damages award substantially in excess of million,and not counting the substantial defense costs to defend against the product disparagement counterclaims through trial,and possible appeal,million is a fair and reasonable settlement of ambu product disparagement counterclaims.lma also informed national union that cna had approved the settlement and committed its policy limit.lma requested a prompt reply,explaining that time is scarce.
on march,lma repeated its request for a response.two days later,lma again requested a response and clarified that national union options were to accept the settlement,reject the settlement and take over the defense,or reject the settlement and refuse to undertake the defense,leaving lma the option of pursuing reimbursement in a subsequent action.
on march,national union sent a list of questions to marzen about the proposed settlement.marzen replied four days later,and followed up with a conference call during which he again stated national union three options.national union promised to respond by april,but later committed to wednesday april at the latest.
on april,national union declined to consent to the proposed settlement without offering to take up the defense.on april and,lma again requested that national union take up the defense if it chose to reject the settlement.lma stated that,absent a prompt response,lma would finalize the settlement.
having still not heard from national union regarding taking over the defense,lma finalized the settlement with ambu on april.lma promptly notified national union.on april,national union advised that it would assume the defense of the underlying suit if lma could undo the settlement.lma promptly responded that the executed settlement could not be undone.lma further stated that national union had acted in bad faith in handling the matter,including by waiting until after the settlement to state a willingness to take on the defense,which lma considered to be an attempt to manufacture a defense that lma failed to gain national union consent to the settlement.
c.the insurance coverage litigation 
following execution of the settlement,lma sued national union for breach of contract and bad faith.lma sought contract damages,interest,attorney fees and costs,and punitive damages.after discovery,national union moved for summary judgment,arguing that it had the absolute right to veto the settlement under the policy no voluntary payments and no action clauses.
the district court denied national union motion for summary judgment.lma,union fire ins.of pittsburgh,supp,cal.the district court ruled that the state appellate court decision in diamond heights provided the applicable rule an excess insurer may waive its rights under a no action clause if it rejects a reasonable settlement and at the same time fails to offer to undertake the defense.id.at.the district court disagreed with national union positions that diamond heights had been overruled and was factually distinguishable.id.at.the court also denied summary judgment on lma bad faith claim,ruling that a reasonable jury could conclude that national union acted unreasonably in delaying its response to lma request that national union fund the contingent settlement or take over defense of the c ounterclaims.id.at.
the case proceeded to trial and the jury unanimously found for lma on both the breach of contract and bad faith claims,but decided not to award punitive damages.on april,the district court entered judgment in lma favor for,including in contract damages in attorney fees,expert fees and costs and prejudgment interest of.finally,the court denied national union motion for a new trial judgment to be entered in its favor.
national union timely appealed and we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,national union argues that the district court erred in applying the diamond heights rule to this case instructing the jury on both the breach of contract and bad faith claims denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the bad faith claim and awarding in fees and costs.
lma breach of contract claim based on diamond heights 
national union leading argument requires us to decide whether the district court erred in applying the rule announced by a california appellate court in diamond heights.
california substantive law governs this diversity insurance coverage action,including the question of whether excess insurers have an absolute right to veto a settlement under a policy no action and no voluntary payments clauses.hyundai motor am.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir.see also erie tompkins.as we have explained 
when interpreting state law,federal courts are bound by decisions of the state highest court.in the absence of such a decision,a federal court must predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions,decisions from other jurisdictions,statutes,treatises,and restatements as guidance.however,where there is no convincing evidence that the state supreme court would decide differently,a federal court is obligated to follow the decisions of the state intermediate appellate courts.
vestar dev.ii,llc dynamics,cir.quoting lewis.employees credit union,cir.in other words,when,as here,there is relevant precedent from the state intermediate appellate court,the federal court must follow the state intermediate appellate court decision unless the federal court finds convincing evidence that the state supreme court likely would not follow it.ryman sears,roebuck,cir.
according to national union,the district court should not have applied the diamond heights rule because the california supreme court has effectively overruled the decision or,alternatively,would not apply the diamond heights rule to this case facts.national union also argues that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the burden an insured must carry to prevail on a claim based on diamond heights.we first describe the diamond heights decision in greater detail and then explain that the district court appropriately followed it.
the diamond heights rule 
in diamond heights,a condominium developer sued its excess insurer,central,seeking contribution toward the settlement of construction defects claims covered by the excess insurance policy.cal.app.at.the developer and its primary insurer notified central that the plaintiffs settlement demand exceeded the primary coverage layer and that it was likely the primary policy limits would be exhausted.the excess insurer sent a reservation of rights letter and stayed out of the defense.though central offered to contribute a relatively small sum toward settlement,the matter settled on the first day of trial,without central contribution and over its objection.under a provision of california law that is not at issue here,the trial court reviewed the settlement and found it to be reasonable and not the product of collusion.id.at.
the developer then sued central,seeking contribution toward the settlement.central moved for summary judgment on the ground that the settlement was entered without its consent and therefore violated the policy no action clause.the trial court granted summary judgment in central favor,but the court of appeal reversed.id.at.the appellate court ruled that,subject to certain conditions,a primary insurer may negotiate a good faith settlement of a claim in an amount which invades excess coverage,and enter into such settlement binding upon the excess insurer without the excess insurer consent,notwithstanding the no action clause.id.at.specifically,the excess insurer may waive its rights under that clause if it rejects a reasonable settlement and at the same time fails to offer to undertake the defense.id.at.
the court explained in detail t he legal basis and policy considerations which support its conclusion.id.at.in terms of legal basis,the court grounded its rule in the duty of good faith owed between insured and insurer,and between insurers 
consistent with its good faith duty,the excess insurer does not have the absolute right to veto arbitrarily a reasonable settlement and force the primary insurer to proceed to trial,bearing the full costs of defense.a contrary rule would impose the same unnecessary burdens upon the primary insurer and the parties to the action,among others,as does the primary insurer breach of its good faith duty to settle.
id.at.the court noted,in a somewhat analogous situation,when a primary insurer wrongfully denies coverage,unreasonably delays processing a claim,or refuses to defend an action against the insured as required by the policy,the insured is entitled to make a reasonable settlement of the claim in good faith and then sue for reimbursement,even though the policy prohibits settlements without the consent of the insurer.id.at collecting cases.
the court cited several policy considerations supporting its rule that the excess insurer does not have an absolute right to veto a reasonable settlement.a contrary rule would imperil the public and judicial interests in fair and reasonable settlement of lawsuits.id.citation omitted.similarly,a contrary rule would have inequitable consequences for the insured in cases where liability may exceed excess limits,as well for primary insurers in cases where liability does not.such a rule would effectively allow excess insurers to get a free ride at the expense of the primary insurer to the detriment of all other parties involved.id.at.finally,the court explained that its rule is not unfair for excess insurers because they are not without a means of avoiding a proposed settlement or challenging a final settlement.id.an excess insurer may agree to undertake the defense and either conduct its own settlement negotiations or take the action to trial.id.the excess insurer may also challenge the settlement on the ground of unreasonableness or that it is a product of collusion between primary insurer and insured.id.
applying its rule,the appellate court in diamond heights reversed the trial court summary judgment in favor of central.the court remanded because material factual issues related to the developer reimbursement claim remained,including the issue of whether central was afforded a reasonable opportunity to undertake the defense prior to the settlement.id.at.
national union has not presented convincing evidence that the california supreme court would not follow diamond heights.
we review the district court determination of state law de novo.salve regina college russell.national union argues that the district court should not have followed diamond heights because the case is inconsistent with the california supreme court subsequent decision in waller truck insurance exchange,cal.waller rejected the automatic waiver rule announced in dictum in mclaughlin connecticut general life ins,supp.cal.waller,cal.at.t he mclaughlin court held that an insurance company which relies on specified grounds for denying a claim thereby waives the right to rely in a subsequent litigation on any other grounds which a reasonable investigation would have uncovered.id.at.in rejecting this waiver rule,the california supreme court explained 
case law is clear that waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right after knowledge of the facts.the burden is on the party claiming a waiver of a right to prove it by clear and convincing evidence that does not leave the matter to speculation,and doubtful cases will be decided against a waiver.the waiver may be either express,based on the words of the waiving party,or implied,based on conduct indicating an intent to relinquish the right.
id.at alteration and citations omitted.
national union asserts that waller rule that an insurer waives a policy defense only upon an intentional relinquishment of a known right is irreconcilable with the diamond heights rule,which does not require the intentional relinquishment of an excess insurer rights under a no action clause.we disagree for several reasons.
first,as the district court noted,waller did not mention diamond heights and only reiterated waiver principles that existed before diamond heights.lma,supp.at.
second,california appellate courts have relied on diamond heights after waller.risely interinsurance exch.of auto.club,cal.app,executive risk,jones,cal.app,insulation highlands ins,cal.app,as modified on denial of reh g.
and risely represent two endorsements of the diamond heights rule by two other districts of the california court of appeal.provides the strongest endorsement.in that case,the appellate court concluded that an approved bankruptcy plan resolving claims is a settlement that was binding on excess insurers,even though the insurers did not consent to the settlement as required by the insurance policy,cal.app.at.however,in opposing a contribution action by the insured,the excess insurers may challenge the plan for fairness,reasonableness and lack of fraud or collusion.id.at.in so holding,the court agreed with t he rationale of diamond heights 
it would impose an unnecessary burden on primary insurers and parties to an underlying action to hold that an excess insurer has an absolute right to withhold its consent to a settlement,while at the same time decline to participate in the action.allowing the insured to enter into a global settlement in the bankruptcy court without the excess insurers participation,while permitting the excess insurers to challenge the plan for fairness,reasonableness and lack of fraud or collusion in the instant action,does no violence to the policy language requiring the excess insurers consent.diamond heights,cal.app.at.we do not believe that the policies can be read to permit an excess insurer to hover in the background of critical settlement negotiations and thereafter resist all responsibility on the basis of lack of consent.
risely involved a dispute against a primary insurer,but the risely court also quoted diamond heights in holding that an insurer is deemed to have waived its rights under the no action clause by such conduct constituting a breach of its obligations under the policy.risely,cal.app.at.
we note that diamond heights has been criticized by other courts.see,hartford accident indem.superior court,cal.app,pac.estates,superior court,cal.app.but as the court explained,this criticism revolves around its further conclusion that central was bound by the good faith settlement determination as a.cal.app.at.subsequent cases have clarified that an excess insurer is not conclusively bound by a good faith settlement determination in underlying litigation in which it did not participate.id.this part of diamond heights has no bearing here because there is no argument that the settlement between lma and ambu had preclusive effect on national union in this action for reimbursement.
third,diamond heights and waller are reconcilable.waller stands for the proposition that a insurer does not waive a right under an insurance policy simply by failing to mention it in a claim letter.cal.at.by contrast,diamond heights is about how an insurance policy should be read in order to reconcile an excess insurer contractual rights under no action and no voluntary payments clauses with the insured rights under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in other words,notwithstanding the court use of the word waiver in diamond heights,the rule is not so much about the waiver of an insurer contractual right than it is about an insurer breach of a contractual obligation.whereas waller prevents a policy from being expanded beyond the contracting parties intent,the covenant of good faith underlying diamond heights is grounded on honoring the reasonable expectations created by the autonomous expressions of the contracting parties.tymshare,covell,cir.scalia.
the wisdom of the diamond heights rule may not be beyond reasonable debate.but for the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the rule would be contrary to the language of the no action and no voluntary payments provisions.the rule thus arguably gives the insured and primary insurers more than was bargained for,at least if excess insurers have not raised their rates to accommodate for additional costs imposed by the rule.national union notes that primary insurers charge a premium for the duty to defend,while excess insurers do not,as they generally may rely on defense funded by primary insurers.
however,as noted,the rule is fairly supported by other insurance principles and policy considerations.indeed,the underlying notion that no action and no voluntary payment clauses do not create absolute rights to veto settlements is long established.many courts have held that when a primary insurer wrongfully denies coverage,unreasonably delays processing a claim,or refuses to defend an action against the insured as required by the policy,the insured is entitled to make a reasonable settlement of the claim in good faith and then sue for reimbursement,even though the policy prohibits settlements without the consent of the insurer.diamond heights,cal.app.at collecting cases.
we hold that national union has failed to show that the district court erred in follow ing the state intermediate appellate court decision,because national union has not proffered convincing evidence that the state supreme court likely would not follow it.see ryman,at 
diamond heights is not distinguishable on its facts.
national union also argues that the district court wrongly extended diamond heights in applying it to this case different facts.national union distinguishes this case from diamond heights because cna million limit was not exhausted cna never withdrew its defense lma liability for the ambu dispara
