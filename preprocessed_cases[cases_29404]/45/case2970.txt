factual and procedural summary 
background 
in,california code of regulations,title section was promulgated regulation.since it was last amended in,this section has required every insurance company with more than million dollars of sales annually in a specific line of insurance to file a community service statement css with the commissioner.reg,subd.a.the information required by the css is reported separately for each zip code in california and includes what is referred to as record a data.
each reporting insurance company includes in its record a report for each zip code in california the total earned exposures,the total earned premiums,the total number of new exposures,the total number of exposures which were cancelled,and the total number of exposures which were not renewed.reg,subd.b.this information must be reported separately for the following lines of insurance private passenger automobile liability,private passenger automobile physical damage,homeowners multiple peril,commercial multiple peril,commercial automobile liability,commercial automobile physical damage,fire,and liability other than automobile.reg,subd.b a h.
in addition to the record a data,the css includes the number of offices maintained by the insurance company in every zip code including the type of service offered reg,subd.b,the number of independent,captive,or employed agents and claims adjusters for the insurance company located in each zip code in which the insurer maintains an office reg,subd.b,the number of direct mail or telephone solicitations for new insurance for every zip code for direct solicitation insurers reg,subd.b,the number of agents and claims adjusters maintaining offices in each zip code who are conversant in a language other than english reg,subd.b,the gender and race for each person who applied to the insurance company for insurance reg,subd.b the number of applications received for each line of insurance by zip code reg,subd.b,and the number of applications declined for each line of coverage by zip code reg,subd.b.the disclosure of this additional information is not an issue here.
this appeal arises from a trial court interpretation of regulation,subdivision c which provides that all the data submitted by the insurers is subject to california insurance code section this section states that all information provided pursuant to article,chapter,part of division of the insurance code article shall be made available to the public.
in november,the consumer groups requested the commissioner disclose the css data submitted by the top five insurers pursuant to regulation for the years,and.the commissioner wrote the insurers,told them of the request and the commissioner intention to disclose the information.
b.the farmer action 
in response to the commissioner letter,farmers filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in fresno county superior court naming the insurance commissioner and the department of insurance as defendants.the thrust of the action was to prevent disclosure of the record a information.farmers applied for a temporary restraining order and moved for a preliminary injunction.the trial court granted the temporary restraining order and issued an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.the commissioner filed papers opposing the motion for preliminary injunction.
the parties stipulated,and the trial court ordered,that usaa,fireman fund,safeco,allstate,and the consumer groups could intervene in the action.complaints in intervention were filed.the insurance interveners joined in the motion for a preliminary injunction,while the consumer groups opposed it.
the trial court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction finding that section required disclosure of the documents.the trial court did not consider whether the information was a trade secret.the order dissolved the temporary restraining order.
c.the usaa action 
on the same date that farmers filed its action,usaa filed a complaint for misappropriation of trade secrets in fresno county superior court,also seeking to prevent disclosure of the css data.usaa also applied for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.the trial court issued the temporary restraining order and issued an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.
it does not appear the trial court consolidated the farmers action and the usaa action.however,the stipulation to intervene was signed by the parties in both actions and referred to both actions.papers apparently were filed only one time,but were utilized in both actions.the order denying the application for the preliminary injunction referred to both actions.
writ of supersedeas 
each insurer filed a notice of appeal and also filed a petition for a writ of supersedeas in this court seeking a stay of the trial court order to the extent that it allowed the commissioner to publish the record a data.after receiving informal opposition,the requested writ was issued by this court staying the trial court order and enjoining the commissioner and interveners from disclosing the data pending further order or determination of the merits of the action.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the commissioner asserts that government code section,subdivision c does not allow an appeal from an order concerning disclosure of public records,and that the public records act pra,et.does not permit actions to prevent disclosure of public records.accordingly,the commissioner argues insurers do not have standing,and consequently,this court does not have jurisdiction,to consider the merits of this appeal.
the commissioner reliance on government code section is misplaced.this section authorizes one whose request to disclose a record has been denied by a public official to file a petition with the superior court seeking an order compelling disclosure of the record.the trial court order compelling production of the record,or affirming that the record need not be produced,may be reviewed by the appellate court only through a writ of mandate.
this section is inapplicable because the order being reviewed by this court is one denying a motion for a preliminary injunction,not an order compelling disclosure of a public record.orders denying a preliminary injunction are directly appealable.code civ,subd.a department of fish game irrigation district th,d.
the cases cited by the commissioner,times mirror superior court cal d,and powers city of richmond cal th,d,are inapposite since they address government code section,which,as we have explained,is inapplicable to this issue.
ii.standard of review 
the rules governing our review of an order denying a preliminary injunction are well settled.the decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.it county of imperial cal d.a trial court abuses its discretion only when it has exceeded the bounds of reason or contravened the uncontradicted evidence.ibid.the burden rests with the party challenging the court ruling to establish an abuse of discretion.ibid.
t rial courts should evaluate two interrelated factors when deciding whether or not to issue a preliminary injunction.the first is the likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial.the second is the interim harm that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.citations.it county of imperial,supra,cal d at.
w hen a trial court denies an application for a preliminary injunction,it implicitly determines that the plaintiffs have failed to satisfy either or both of the interim harm and likelihood of prevailing on the merits factors.on appeal,the question becomes whether the trial court abused its discretion in ruling on both factors.even if the appellate court finds that the trial court abused its discretion as to one of the factors,it nevertheless may affirm the trial court order if it finds no abuse of discretion as to the other.citation.hilb,rogal hamilton ins.services robb th,d.
iii.regulation and article 
the first issue addressed by the parties is whether regulation was promulgated pursuant to article.the issue arises because regulation,subdivision c states in part 
the community service statement shall be subject to california insurance code section 
section requires information provided to the commissioner pursuant to article must be made available to the public therefore,if the record a data is provided to the commissioner pursuant to article,section requires the data be made available to the public unless it is otherwise exempt from disclosure.
insurers assert that the record a data is not promulgated pursuant to article because article is primarily concerned with rate regulation and regulation is not a rate regulation.insurers point out that regulation is intended to ensure insurance company compliance with sections and,neither of which is located in article.finally,insurers argue that regulation was not promulgated pursuant to the provisions of article.insurers assert that these provisions are limited in scope,or that article does not incorporate other statutes,or the commissioner does not have any right to enforce the other statutes.
commissioner argues that regulation is a rate regulation and,even if it is not a rate regulation,the scope of article exceeds ratemaking.
we agree with insurers that regulation was not promulgated to regulate rates.rate regulation is covered extensively in article.see,and.the data obtained pursuant to regulation is not adequate to allow rate review,nor does it include the rates the insurers are charging in any community.as insurers point out,this information is obtained by the commissioner,and made available to the public,through other regulations.the commissioner has not presented any compelling arguments that convince us that this data is necessary or useful in determining rates.
however,our conclusion that regulation is not related to rate regulation does not compel the conclusion that regulation is not promulgated pursuant to article.in addition to rate regulation,article specifically provides that insurers are subject to all laws applicable to other businesses,including the unruh civil rights act,and the antitrust and unfair business practices laws,parts commencing with and commencing with section of division of the business and professions code,subd.a.
the unruh civil rights act prohibits discrimination in providing services based,among other categories,on race,sex or religion,subd.b.regulation seeks information from the largest insurers in the state to determine if they are refusing to sell insurance to certain communities.if one race,one sex,or one religion dominates a community,this data could help locate a potential violation of the unruh civil rights act.
also relevant is the law dealing with unfair business practices codified in business and professions code section.this section defines as unfair competition any unfair or fraudulent business acts or practices.virtually any state,federal or local law can serve as the predicate act to constitute an unfair business practice.podolsky first healthcare th,d.therefore,any violation of the statutory prohibitions against discrimination in the sales of insurance would constitute an unfair business practice.
the data gathered by regulation could assist the commissioner in detecting violations of the unruh civil rights act or identifying unfair business practices in the form of discrimination in the sales of insurance.accordingly,regulation,and the data gathered thereby,were promulgated pursuant to section,and consequently,article.
insurer assertion that the commissioner is unable to prosecute a violation of the unruh civil rights act is unavailing.the attorney general can enforce such violations,subd.c.the attorney general and the commissioner are both part of the executive branch of our state government.cal,art.iii,cal,art.v,subd.f.we attach no significance to the fact that violations discovered by the commissioner would be prosecuted by the attorney general.insurers also ignore the private right to seek injunctive relief for unfair business practices available to the commissioner.bus,saunders superior court th,d.therefore,if it was necessary for the commissioner to have the right to enforce a violation of regulation to bring it within article,a requirement we find does not exist,the right to enjoin unfair business practices would satisfy this requirement.
having found that regulation was promulgated pursuant to article,we next turn to the interrelation between section and the pra.
iv.section and the pra 
the pra provides that anyone may inspect public records during normal office hours of the local or state agency that has the requested record.public records are defined in part as any writing containing information relating to the conduct of the public business prepared,owned,used,or retained by any state or local agency,subd.d.the pra provides various exemptions from disclosure in government code section.
section mandates disclosure of all information provided to the commissioner pursuant to article and specifically states that the exemption from disclosure found in government code section,subdivision d will not prohibit disclosure of such records 
the parties agree that the record a data is a public record,and the insurers concede,impliedly if not explicitly,that section effectively eliminates the government code section,subdivision d exemption from disclosure.however,the parties dispute the effect section has on the remaining exemptions from disclosure found in government code section,specifically subdivision k which exempts records that are privileged under evidence code section 
the commissioner argues that section means that all data provided to the commissioner pursuant to article must be disclosed,and the reference to the two exemptions in section are merely examples of the type of exemptions that are eliminated by the section.
insurers argue that if section was meant to eliminate all of the exemptions found in government code section,it would have so stated without referring only to subsection d.by expres
