question when an insurance company issues a liability policy,agreeing to indemnify its insured against a third party claim for damages covered under the policy,and to defend the insured against any such claim,does the insurer have a duty to defend the insured against a third party lawsuit seeking injunctive relief but no compensatory damages answer no.the third party failure to seek compensatory damages against the insured means the dispute is not a claim for damages under the policy.the insurer defense obligation requires it to provide the insured with a defense against a claim seeking damages potentially payable under the policy,not to defend the insured honor or otherwise assist it in resolving a nonmonetary dispute.
here,appellants san miguel community association and william beggs sued state farm general insurance company,alleging it breached obligations to them under a liability insurance policy by refusing to reimburse them for the cost of defending the early stages of a lawsuit in which the plaintiffs had initially sought only injunctive relief to enforce parking restrictions within the community,plus an award of punitive damages.when the third party plaintiffs later amended their pleading to include a claim for recovery of compensatory damages,state farm agreed to assume appellants defense,but refused to reimburse it for any defense costs incurred prior to the amendment.the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of state farm.
appellants challenge the judgment,arguing state farm had an obligation to provide them with a defense even in absence of any express claim for damages in the earlier versions of the third party complaint,because those earlier versions implied the third parties had suffered compensable damages as a result of appellants wrongdoing and thus demonstrated appellants had potential liability for damages covered under the policy.we affirm.
in the abstract,it is irrelevant that the third party might have suffered harm that could give rise to a claim for damages covered under the insured policy.what matters is whether the third party has sought to recover damages from the insured.it is only when the third party does that,that it has it made a claim which triggers even potential coverage under a liability policy.that did not occur here until the third party plaintiffs amended their pleading to include a claim for compensatory damages.finally,because coverage is triggered by a third party claim for damages,the allegation that state farm also misrepresented that the attorney for the third parties had denied they sustained damages adds nothing to the cause of action.whether or not those third parties believed they had sustained damages,the record demonstrates they made no effort to recover any from appellants until their second amended complaint.
san miguel,a nonprofit residential community association,is the named insured under the state farm policy at issue in this case and beggs is the president of san miguel board of directors.state farm policy provided san miguel with comprehensive business liability coverage.under that coverage,state farm agreed to pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury caused by an occurrence.
the policy defined an occurrence as either an accident which result s in bodily injury or property damage,or the commission of an offense,or a series of similar or related offenses,which results in personal injury or advertising injury.and the policy defined property damage as physical injury to or destruction of tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property and loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured or destroyed,provided such loss of use is caused by physical injury to or destruction of other tangible property 
the policy also offered optional coverage for directors and officers liability,which was defined as those sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of wrongful acts committed by an insured solely in the conduct of their management responsibilities for the.wrongful acts was defined as any negligent acts,errors,omissions or breach of duty directly related to the operations of the.however,the directors and officers liability coverage did not apply to any dishonest,fraudulent,criminal or malicious act,including fines or penalties resulting from these acts did not apply to bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury liability or damages other than monetary damages.
additionally,state farm agreed to defend any claim or suit seeking damages payable under this policy even though the allegations of the suit may be groundless.italics added.a suit is defined as a civil proceeding in a court of law in which damages to which this insurance applies are alleged,and includes an arbitration proceeding in which such damages are claimed and any other alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which such damages are claimed and to which you submit with our consent.italics added.
the underlying suit arose out of a dispute regarding enforcement of parking restrictions within the san miguel community.the third party plaintiffs are two san miguel residents who briefly served as members of its board of directors.during their tenure on the board,these plaintiffs sought enforcement of parking restrictions within the community,and promulgated new policies governing parking.they were later recalled from the board in an election which also resulted in beggs becoming a board member.the newly comprised board of directors rescinded the parking policies.
in late,the third party plaintiffs began complaining at board meetings that san miguel was not enforcing the parking restrictions contained in the community governing declarations,conditions,covenants and reservation of easements cc r and that the failure to do so was causing the plaintiffs distress and affecting their property values.the plaintiffs also alleged they had incurred costs in the form of copying costs and fees as part of their effort to persuade the board to enforce the cc r.
san miguel rejected the plaintiff complaints,and in december,the plaintiffs made a demand for nonbinding mediation of the dispute concerning enforcement of the cc r.the notice identified several issues to be addressed in the mediation,but did not identify any damages allegedly suffered by plaintiffs,or demand compensation.after receipt of the plaintiff alternate dispute resolution adr demand,san miguel tendered its defense to state farm.
the plaintiffs attorney testified in deposition that if he had been asked in december about damages,he would have said that the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint would have been to fix the wrongs that were occurring.while he had done an analysis of money damages stemming from san miguel violation of the cc r,and concluded there were damages and postage damages,he concluded they were not of a significant amount.he stated that my clients were actually looking for a payout on those monetary damages as much as they were looking for the injunctive relief to correct the problems that were occurring.italics added.
upon receipt of the adr demand,a state farm representative noted in the claim file that it was u nclear if the demand for mediation seeks either bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury under cov.l or money damages under optional directors and officers.the allegations are vague as to resulting damages or prayer for relief.the representative also noted that a letter from the plaintiffs attorney outlining their claims includes no mention of money damages.a state farm supervisor suggested to the claims representative that he find out what other information san miguel has about this matter that could shed some light on the nature of the damages claim.you may also need to talk with the plaintiff attorney about this.
according to the state farm claim file,the representative spoke to the plaintiffs attorney on january.the file reflects that in addition to providing other information about the claim,the attorney indicated the plaintiffs have not suffered any personal injury at this time or out of pocket expense.the plaintiffs attorney testified he did not recall that first conversation with the state farm representative in january,although he did not specifically deny it occurred.he did note it was his usual practice not to take calls from insurance company representatives who were not attorneys.
on january,state farm sent san miguel a letter stating it was continuing to investigate the claim and was reserving its rights to deny coverage.on march,state farm claim representative recommended denial of the claim,based on the fact the plaintiffs had asserted no claim for damages covered by the policy,and on march,state farm formally denied the claim on that basis.the letter explained there was no coverage under the business liability policy because the claimants allegations involve alleged failure of the association to enforce parking regulations,replace fire signage,or the association failure to provide notice of election results.such claims do not qualify as bodily injury,property damage,personal injury or advertising injury as for coverage under the optional directors and officers coverage,the letter noted the claims do not seek recovery of money damages.
the nonbinding mediation did not resolve the matter,and in april the plaintiffs filed their initial complaint against beggs only,alleging causes of action for breach of the cc r and nuisance,and seeking injunctive relief.although the cause of action for nuisance included an allegation that beggs conduct was intentional grossly willful,and despicable and on that basis justified an award of punitive damages,it neither alleged the plaintiffs sustained,nor sought recovery of,any compensatory damages.
beggs once again submitted the claim to state farm,but before state farm had taken formal action on the claim,the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.in that amended complaint,the plaintiffs added san miguel as a defendant,and added a third cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
again,the first amended complaint contained no allegation the plaintiffs sustained compensatory damages as a result of defendants alleged wrongs,nor sought recovery of any such damages.instead,it alleged the effect of the defendants violations of the cc rs was to cause them irreparable injury due to the actions alleged herein and depriv e them of the benefit of the cc rs which can not be fully compensated in damages.italics added.hence,the sole remedy the plaintiffs sought for the alleged breach of the cc r was an injunction.in their nuisance cause of action,the plaintiffs again claimed they can not be fully compensated for the damages caused and were without an adequate remedy at law,and they again sought the remedy of an injunction.in their cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,the plaintiffs alleged they have been harmed by defendants breaches,but again can not be fully compensated for the damages caused and again characterized the harm as irreparable and sought an injunction.and once again,the plaintiffs included an allegation that defendants conduct was intentional and despicable,and on that justified an award of punitive damages.
san miguel again tendered the defense of the first amended complaint to state farm,and on may,state farm denied the claim.once again,state farm based its denial on the fact the action does not seek damages that would be covered under the policy.
san miguel demurred to the plaintiffs first amended complaint and moved to strike the punitive damages allegation on the basis the plaintiffs had failed to allege any entitlement to compensatory damages.in opposition to the demurrer,the plaintiffs argued they could amend the complaint to allege entitlement to an award of such damages,including diminution in value to plaintiff s homes and annoyance caused by san miguel failure to enforce the parking regulations,and costs incurred by plaintiffs in attempting to resolve the matter short of litigation.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend,and the plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in august.
the second amended complaint alleged for the first time that as a result of san miguel alleged wrongs,the plaintiffs had sustained damages in an amount to be proved at trial or nominal damages to the extent necessary.in their prayer for relief,the plaintiffs sought,in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief,an award of compensatory damages,according to proof at the time of trial or alternatively an award of nominal damages.
san miguel once again tendered the claim to state farm,pointing out that unlike the previous complaints,the second amended complaint seeks damages.state farm once again denied coverage.in its letter,state farm stated plaintiffs have made no claims for money damages,and pointed out n ominal damages are not money damages arising out of a wrongful act.state farm also reiterated in its letter that the plaintiffs attorney had advised state farm the plaintiffs had incurred no costs.the letter did not state when the plaintiffs attorney had made that statement.
however,san miguel attorney apparently interpreted state farm denial letter as reflecting a statement made by the plaintiffs attorney following the filing of the second amended complaint.he thus contacted the plaintiffs attorney and inquired whether the attorney had denied to state farm that plaintiffs had incurred damages in connection with the second amended complaint.according to a confirming letter written by san miguel attorney,the plaintiffs attorney replied that he had not spoken to anyone from state farm within the past three to four months and reiterated that his clients had incurred the damages as set forth in the second amended complaint.san miguel attorney then wrote a letter to state farm,informing it that the plaintiffs attorney was in fact claiming they had incurred compensable damages,and accusing state farm of making a material misstatement of fact to support its letter declining tender.
a state farm representative then contacted the plaintiffs attorney.the attorney did recall that conversation,which he described as a second phone call i believe i did have with a state farm representative,after i had been advised that apparently there was a claim we had made some sort of an admission there were no damages.which was not our position.our position was the monetary damages were de minimus,but there are damages.the attorney acknowledged that i t may be an issue that those damages will go away if we settle the main part of the action,but not that they do exist.he stated,however,that he had no recollection of what he actually told the representative during that second call,and i probably hung up on the gentleman.
following that conversation,state farm reversed its decision and agreed to provide san miguel with a defense of the plaintiffs lawsuit under a reservation of rights.however,it concluded that its obligation to provide a defense commenced on august,when san miguel tendered the second amended complaint the first complaint seeking recovery of compensatory damages and thus the first to reflect the potential for coverage under the policy.consequently,state farm refused to compensate san miguel for the costs incurred in defending the underlying case prior to that time.
this lawsuit followed.san miguel alleged a cause of action for breach of the insurance contract,and a cause of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.both causes of action were based on the identical assertions that state farm had breached its obligations by failing to pay for defense of the plaintiffs underlying claim prior to the filing of their second amended complaint,and misrepresenting the statements of the plaintiffs attorney concerning their purported lack of damages in an effort to avoid paying benefits under the policy.san miguel specifically alleged the plaintiffs complaint in the underlying lawsuit had included a claim for money damages within the coverage of the optional directors and officers liability provision of state farm policy from the outset,and thus that state farm was obligated t
