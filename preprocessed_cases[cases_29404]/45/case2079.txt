ii.background 
factual allegations 
clark alleges the following facts in his complaint.on july,clark was a pedestrian at an intersection in pueblo,colorado when he was struck by a vehicle driven by monica madrid.clark suffered unspecified personal injuries and incurred medical expenses,rehabilitative expenses,and lost wages.the vehicle involved in the accident was owned by hortencia madrid,monica grandmother.at the time of the accident,madrid vehicle was insured under policy issued by state farm the madrid policy.monica and hortencia madrid are not parties to this litigation.
the madrid policy included the minimum level of coverage prescribed by caara.before hortencia madrid purchased the policy,state farm offered her extended pip benefits for herself,her resident relatives,and passengers in her insured vehicle with her consent,but not for pedestrians.following the accident,state farm began paying pip benefits to clark in accordance with the minimum levels prescribed under section of caara.clark alleged that these payments,which covered medical expenses,rehabilitative costs,and lost wages,did not reimburse him to the full extent of his losses.
colorado auto accident reparations act 
the stated statutory purpose of caara is to avoid inadequate compensation to victims of automobile accidents.see also brennan,at.colorado courts construe caara liberally to further its remedial and beneficial purposes.see brennan,at.caara requires that a policy include a minimum level of pip benefits.see.specifically,section requires a carrier to provide,without regard to fault,payments for medical expenses,rehabilitation expenses,and lost wages.see b i,c i,d i.section sets dollar and time limits for each category of expense.see id section defines the categories of people who receive coverage under section to include the named insured,resident relatives of the named insured,passengers occupying the insured vehicle with the consent of the insured,and pedestrians who are injured by the covered vehicle.brennan,at see also.caara also requires every insurer to offer the named insured extended pip benefits in exchange for higher premiums.see a thompson budget.these extended pip benefits do not place time or dollar limitations on medical expense claims and offer the possibility of greater wage loss reimbursements the version of section effective at the time of clark accident,which applied to policies issued on or after july,does not list or refer to persons eligible for extended coverage.see.moreover,section,which sets out the four categories of pip benefits recipients,refers only to the minimum pip benefits available under section and does not reference the enhanced benefits set out in section.see.
brennan farmers alliance mutual insurance.
approximately nineteen months after clark accident,the colorado court of appeals decided brennan.in brennan,a pedestrian injured in a car accident sued farmers alliance,seeking enhanced pip benefits under section.see id.at.farmers alliance did not offer extended pip benefits to cover pedestrians.see id.the trial court reformed the policy to incorporate the extended benefits.see id.in entering summary judgment for the plaintiffs,the court awarded the difference between the maximum aggregate amount provided by the policy and the amount of minimum pip benefits already paid to the plaintiffs.see id.on appeal,farmers alliance argued that the extended pip benefits under section did not include pedestrians and it was therefore not obligated to pay additional benefits.see id.at.in rejecting this argument,the colorado court of appeals explained that although section a does not specify the persons entitled to extended benefits,caara statutory scheme indicated that section describes an option to purchase coverage,but at higher limits,for the same persons and under the same conditions applicable to mandatory basic pip coverage outlined in section.id.the court also relied on the fact that section covers injured person s and not merely insured s,which suggests that section covered pedestrians.see id.at.because farmers alliance did not offer extended pip benefits to cover pedestrians in conformity with caara,the court read the additional coverage into the policy and affirmed the reformation of the policy.see id.at.the court also affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of the plaintiffs for the difference between the minimum pip benefit levels and the maximum pip aggregate amount provided under the policy.see id.at.
the colorado court of appeals proceeded,however,to affirm the dismissal of the plaintiffs breach of contract,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,fraudulent misrepresentation,and willful and wanton breach of contract claims.see id.at.in addressing the breach of contract claim,the brennan court concluded that until the contract was reformed,there was no policy in existence which granted plaintiffs rights for additional pip benefits.id.at.the brennan court acknowledged that caara was unclear about whether extended pip benefits under section applied to pedestrians and that no appellate court had previously interpreted the scope of section.see id.u nder such circumstances,it is not inappropriate to apply such interpretation of caara prospectively.id.the court also justified this result by explaining that in insurance law,until an insurance contract is reformed,the insurer has no obligation to conform to such a reformed policy.id.
for similar reasons,the colorado court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,fraudulent misrepresentation,and willful and wanton breach of contract claims.see id.at.the court emphasized that these claims could not survive because there was no breach of contract,and therefore no unreasonable or reckless withholding of benefits,until the contract was reformed.see id.the court also explained that the insurer actions prior to the decision were not incorrect based on its reliance on the language of the policy and its concomitant failure to anticipate the decision in brennan.see id.at.
the colorado supreme court denied the petition for certiorari in brennan on august.see id.at.sometime after that date,state farm issued an amendment to the madrid policy which replaced the section on coverage.among other things,the amendment eliminated the preexisting distinction between pedestrians and other categories of insureds in terms of pip benefits.clark complaint alleges that at the time state farm issued this amendment,his losses exceeded the minimum pip coverage limits provided under the madrid policy.clark,however,does not allege that he submitted any claims to state farm for processing after brennan.
on appeal,state farm does not dispute that clark was entitled to the minimum level of pip benefits mandated under section.it is also undisputed that state farm has paid clark those benefits in a timely manner.
district court proceedings 
on august,clark brought the instant suit on behalf of all injured persons covered by a state farm policy who were not offered and paid extended pip benefits under section.in reliance on brennan and state farm failure to offer extended pip benefits to madrid for injured pedestrians,he sought reformation of the madrid policy to include extended pip benefits in accordance with section.in addition,clark brought claims for breach of contract for failure to pay extended pip benefits,breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,willful and wanton breach of contract,and deceptive trade practices.
the district court dismissed all of clark claims because it concluded that brennan could not be applied retroactively,relying on a statement in brennan that it was appropriate to apply the decision prospectively.the district court also reasoned that retroactive application of the new rule announced in brennan would undermine widespread reliance on the prior understanding of section scope,which did not include pedestrians.retroactive application of brennan,the district court explained,would prove both inequitable and impracticable.clark appealed the district court dismissal of all claims.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo a dismissal of a complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.sutton utah sch.for the deaf blind,cir.we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.id.a dismissal pursuant to b will be affirmed only when it appears that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claims that would entitle the plaintiff to relief.mcdonald,cir quotation omitted.
the parties agree on appeal that colorado substantive law governs this case.see city sanitation dist.am.guar.liab.ins,cir applying substantive law of the state parties agree controls.in exercising de novo review,this court affords no deference to a district court interpretation of state law.see devery implement case,cir citing salve regina coll.russell,d.this court must determine issues of state law as we believe the highest state court would decide them.see fransen conoco,cir.although we are not bound by a lower state court decision,decisions of a state intermediate appellate courts are some evidence of how the state supreme court would decide the issue,and we can consider them as such,even if they are not binding precedent under state law.id.this court is thus not bound by the colorado court of appeals decision in brennan.in the absence,however,of any compelling reason to disregard brennan,no colorado supreme court precedent to the contrary,and no argument by the parties that we should disregard brennan as a nonbinding decision,we follow brennan in this case.see romero int l harvester,cir.
entitlement to extended pip benefits 
reformation of an insurance contract usually occurs to make the policy express the true intent of the parties.see thompson,at.when a party alleges that a policy violates a statute,however,reformation may be required to ensure that coverage meets the statutory requirements.see id.in colorado,a pedestrian to whom pip benefits are payable is a beneficiary of the policy and has standing to bring reformation and contract claims against the insurer.see id.at see also lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance ed.update hereinafter couch w hile it is the agreement of the insured and the insurer that is the focal point of reformation,beneficiaries to the insurance contract can also seek reformation of the provisions.
in brennan,the colorado court of appeals concluded that when an insurer fails to offer the insured optional coverage that satisfies caara,additional coverage in conformity with the offer mandated by statute will be incorporated into the policy.brennan,at emphasis added.it is undisputed that state farm did not offer hortencia madrid the option of purchasing extended pip benefits which covered injured pedestrians.therefore,under brennan,clark is entitled as a matter of law to reformation of the madrid policy to include extended pip benefits.see id.on remand,the district court must determine the amount of extended pip benefits,if any,to which clark is entitled.
state farm advances two arguments why clark is not entitled to extended pip benefits.first,state farm contends that brennan explicitly states that its decision applies prospectively.although brennan included language that it was not inappropriate to apply the trial court interpretation of caara prospectively,this statement occurs in brennan discussion of the contract,tort,and statutory claims,and not the reformation claim,which the colorado court of appeals authorized.see id.at.discussions in judicial decisions should be considered in context.see,lujan.state bd.of,en banc people john.the brennan court addressed the plaintiffs reformation claim by explaining that the insurer did not offer extended pip benefits as required by caara.see brennan,at.in such circumstances,additional coverage in conformity with the offer mandated by statute will be incorporated into the policy.thus,the trial court judicial reformation of the policy to reflect coverage of joshua brennan was correct.id.citations omitted.if brennan had stated a purely prospective rule,the plaintiff in that case would not have been awarded extended pip benefits.see people ex rel,en banc a purely prospective rule does not apply even to the parties in the case where the rule was announced.state farm reliance on language in a different part of the brennan decision is therefore misplaced,and the district court erred by relying on this statement in concluding that brennan should be applied only prospectively.
state farm next argues that brennan should not be applied retroactively in this case because brennan does not satisfy colorado test for retroactivity.in brennan,however,the colorado court of appeals did not announce a new rule of procedure or substantive law.rather,the court construed caara to require that extended pip benefits be payable to pedestrians.because that coverage was not offered to the insured,the court applied the rule established in thompson to conclude that the insurance contract must be reformed to include extended pip benefits for pedestrians.see brennan,at.
in people ex rel,the colorado supreme court adopted and applied the retroactivity standards for civil cases set out in chevron oil huson,d.see at.in chevron,the court outlined three factors applicable to the determination of whether a ruling should be applied prospectively only.see at.first,the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law,either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.id.citations omitted.state farm argues that brennan announced a new rule of law because,prior to brennan,no court had decided whether section applied to pedestrians.state farm argument must fail in light of the colorado supreme court decision in broyles fort lyon canal.in broyles,the colorado supreme court rejected the appellant argument that a judicial decision should not be applied retroactively stating 
in de beque,however,we did not establish a new principle of law.rather,we merely interpreted and applied a statute that was enacted prior to the time broyles was required to file his application.accordingly,any contention that de beque is inapplicable to this case is erroneous.
because brennan involved the interpretation of a statute enacted prior to the time the madrid policy was issued,it did not establish a new principle of law.thus,it does not satisfy the first factor and the interpretation of section contained in brennan must be applied retroactively.see broyles,at.
the holdings in brennan and thompson mandate that the madrid policy be reformed to include extended pip benefits and that pedestrians,like clark,must be included in the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive those benefits.see brennan,at thompson,at.the brennan court,however,also concluded that the trial court has the discretion to ascertain the date of reformation because reformation is an equitable remedy.see at.the brennan court then concluded that,under the particular circumstances presented in that case,the district court did not abuse its discretion when it reformed the contract from the date the trial court issu
