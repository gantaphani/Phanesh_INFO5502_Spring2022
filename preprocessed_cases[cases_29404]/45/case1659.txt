safety national casualty corporation safety issued three excess umbrella liability insurance policies to dow corning corporation dow corning covering the period december,to december.the policies included a mandatory arbitration provision.many years later,safety denied coverage for claims by consumers that silicon breast implants manufactured by dow corning caused them to suffer autoimmune disease.in june,dow corning commenced arbitration of the coverage dispute.the critical issue was when coverage arose under the policies for autoimmune disease injuries.
dow corning and safety could not amicably select the panel of arbitrators required by the arbitration clause in the policies.safety moved to compel arbitration under section of the federal arbitration act faa,seeking to resolve dow corning objection to safety.dow corning responded with a under section of the faa,asking the district court to appoint the neutral member of the panel.the district court denied both motions.we affirmed,remanding with directions that the parties select an umpire and get on with the arbitration of their coverage dispute.dow corning safety cas,cir table.
after a hearing in july,the panel issued a decision in favor of safety on the coverage issue,declaring its decision to be binding on the parties.dow corning filed a motion to vacate the award under section of the faa.the district court denied the motion.dow corning appeals,arguing that the award should be vacated under section a because the arbitrators exceeded their authority when they declared their decision binding and allowed the appointment of a substitute arbitrator and that the award should be vacated under section a because of the neutral umpire evident partiality.we modify the district court judgment to reflect our conclusion that the arbitrators award is and otherwise affirm.
i.the binding arbitration issue 
arbitration usually results in a final determination that is binding on the parties to the underlying dispute,but the parties may instead agree to arbitration,in which case the arbitrators decision is likely to be a precursor to further litigation on the merits of the dispute.the distinction is significant.mandatory arbitration prior to resort to a court is a different concept from mandatory arbitration precluding resort to a court.orlando interstate container,cir concluding that a collective bargaining agreement called for mandatory but not binding arbitration.
if contracting parties agree to binding arbitration,if their agreement is within the reach of the faa,and if they have agreed that a judgment of the court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration,then a federal court asked to confirm the award must grant such an order unless the award is vacated,modified,or corrected as prescribed in sections and.but in this case,safety did not ask the district court to confirm the award under section,so we need not decide whether the arbitration agreement contained the recitation required by section.see pvi,ratiopharm gmbh,cir.however,safety did ask the arbitrators to declare their decision binding,and they did so over dow corning objection.dow corning moved to vacate the award under section a,arguing the panel exceeded its authority in purporting to render a binding decision.the district court agreed that the decision was binding,and dow corning appeals that ruling.
as this is a question of the contracting parties intent,we begin with the terms of the arbitration clause in the insurance policies.parties intending binding arbitration should say so explicitly in the agreement to arbitrate,either by providing that the arbitration award will be final and binding,or words to that effect,or by incorporating by reference the rules of the american arbitration association or a similar arbitral body that expressly provide for binding arbitration.see,rainwater home ins,cir incorporating aaa rules providing for entry of judgment upon the arbitration award makes the arbitration binding daniel constr.int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir collective bargaining agreement provided for final and binding arbitration.however,the agreement to arbitrate in the safety insurance policies contained no such provision.it merely provided 
as a condition precedent to any right of action under this policy,any dispute arising out of this policy shall be submitted to the decision of a board of arbitration the members of the board of arbitration shall be active or retired,disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies the board shall make its decision with regard to the custom and usage of the insurance and reinsurance business.
dow corning argues that the condition precedent clause confirms the parties intended arbitration.though the clause suggests that arbitration of a policy dispute will be followed by litigation,and thus is,like the district court we do not find this textual clue conclusive.it can also be read as simply recognizing that even binding arbitration is often followed by litigation,as the fourth circuit construed a similar provision in rainwater,at 
the court read s condition precedent to some extent as an artifact left over from the days of hostility toward arbitration.to the extent that the phrase has meaning,we find that it does not undermine the binding nature of arbitration,but instead applies to the confirmation process permitted by the faa or to other litigation in which the arbitration award would be final but just a in some larger litigation context.
with the arbitration clause ambiguously silent on this issue,we must determine whether the parties to these excess liability insurance policies intended to contract for binding arbitration.though evidence of custom and usage among parties to this type of insurance would be relevant,neither party submitted any such evidence.looking more closely at the text of the agreement,we note the policies require that all three arbitrators be active or retired,disinterested officials of insurance or reinsurance companies and that their decisions be made with regard to the custom and usage of the insurance and reinsurance business.this sounds very much like a provision designed for the resolution of technical disputes between an insurance company and its reinsurer.here,on the other hand,the provision was inserted into an excess liability policy,where it applies to coverage disputes between an insurer and its insured and provides a decidedly tilt to the proceedings.an insured other than another insurance company is unlikely to agree that the results of such a proceeding will be binding,that is,judicially unreviewable on the merits under the faa.
though federal policy favors arbitration,and that normally means binding arbitration,we know of no federal policy favoring binding arbitration of insurance coverage disputes.drafted the policies and presumably had greater knowledge of the custom and practices of excess liability insurers and no extrinsic evidence that binding arbitration was intended and cited no federal case in which an arbitration agreement entirely silent on this question was construed as providing for binding arbitration.on this record,we conclude the excess liability policies provided for mandatory but arbitration.
the district court acknowledged that the condition precedent language in the policies,though ambiguous,suggests that arbitration was initially intended.but the court concluded that dow corning subsequently agreed to binding arbitration of this coverage dispute,first in a settlement agreement dismissing safety from a pending coverage suit,and then again in a july consent order entered in dow corning chapter bankruptcy proceeding.in the settlement agreement,dow corning and safety agreed to arbitrate all coverage issues under the policies if negotiations failed to resolve the dispute.the bankruptcy consent order,entered with the arbitration in process,provided that safety liability under the policies 
will be fully and finally adjudicated i in the existing arbitration action ii in subsequent actions in the appropriate forum addressing matters of such insurance coverage and liability not resolved in such arbitration addressing enforcement thereof 
we can not agree that the settlement agreement was an agreement to engage in binding arbitration.it was an agreement to arbitrate under the policies if the dispute could not be informally resolved.this added nothing to the initial agreement to engage in mandatory,arbitration.the peculiar terms of the consent order present a closer question.it provided that the coverage dispute will be finally adjudicated through the pending arbitration subsequent litigation.this language imperfectly describes a process beginning with mandatory arbitration.the process as described could be either binding or from the standpoint of its enforceability under the faa.as dow corning has consistently argued that the policies called for arbitration,we conclude that the consent order,like the settlement agreement,preserved the parties conflicting positions on this issue.
we must next determine the impact of our conclusion that the parties contracted for arbitration.the arbitrators doubtless exceeded their authority in declaring their decision to be binding,because that issue goes to the scope of their authority.see generally first options of chicago,kaplan,d.in any event,we have concluded their award was as a matter of law.this error is grounds for modifying the award by deleting the offending declaration.see b.it would also require reversing the confirmation of an award under,because an award must be binding to be confirmed under section highly deferential standard of review.but our conclusion that the award is does not warrant vacating the entire award.see davis prudential,cir vacating part of an award that exceeded the arbitrators authority but confirming remainder of the award.
there remains a threshold question not addressed by the our conclusion that the arbitration was deprives us of jurisdiction to address dow corning additional grounds for vacating the entire award under faa.this issue of the faa reach has arisen in the context of agreements to arbitrate that attempt to prescribe a standard of judicial review that is less deferential to the arbitrators than that prescribed in faa.one circuit has held that a provision calling for expanded review of the merits of an arbitration award is unenforceable under the faa.see bowen amoco pipeline,cir.at least one commentator has gone further and suggested that such provisions result in agreements that are not sufficiently final to be governed by the faa.see generally amy schmitz,ending a mud bowl defining arbitration finality through functional analysis.this case presents the issue in a different context.dow corning did not ask the district court to review the merits of the arbitrators award,nor did safety move to confirm the award under section.thus,the only question is whether the faa authorizes section review of a mandatory but award.we conclude that it does.
binding arbitration is no doubt the norm under the faa,but no express language limits the statute to binding arbitration agreements.other circuits have held that the faa applies to at least some agreements to engage in mandatory,arbitration.see united states bankers ins,cir wolsey,foodmaker,cir harrison nissan motor,cir.we signaled a similar view of the statute in uhc mgmt.computer sciences,cir,when we commented that this court will not interpret an arbitration agreement as precluding the application of the faa unless the parties intent that the agreement be so construed is abundantly clear.
at different times,both parties asked the district court for relief under sections,and of the faa.while the present appeal will not finally resolve their coverage dispute,addressing the additional section issues raised by dow corning will significantly advance the dispute resolution process.the policies provide that arbitration is a condition precedent to subsequent litigation.dow corning argues that the arbitration was fundamentally defective and therefore a nullity.if dow corning is correct,the entire award will be vacated,presumably requiring the parties to again arbitrate the dispute before commencing litigation.if dow corning section arguments are rejected,the parties are free to commence coverage litigation in which the award will presumably be given such persuasive weight as the court concludes it deserves.for these reasons,we conclude we have jurisdiction to decide the additional section issues.
ii.the substitute arbitrator issue 
dow corning argues that the arbitration award must be vacated under a because the panel exceeded its authority when safety resigned and the two remaining panel members directed safety to appoint a substitute.review of this issue requires further factual background.
the policies provided for a panel of two arbitrators and an umpire and described the selection process in detail 
each party shall appoint its arbitrator,and the two arbitrators shall choose an umpire before instituting the hearing if the two arbitrators fail to agree upon the appointment of an umpire within four weeks after their nominations,each of them shall name three,of whom the other shall decline two and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.
after initiating the arbitration,dow corning appointed benjamin schenk as its.safety appointed jack nelson as its.schenk nominated three umpire candidates,while dow corning informally challenged nelson qualifications to serve.when safety would not proceed with nelson status unresolved,dow corning filed its faa motion,urging the district court to choose an umpire from schenk list because nelson had not timely nominated three umpires.the district court denied this motion and we affirmed,instructing the parties to select an umpire and get on with the arbitration.nelson then nominated three umpire candidates.each struck two of the other nominees,and james lyon,nelson third nominee,was selected as umpire by an agreed process akin to a coin flip or to drawing lots.
one week later,nelson resigned as safety because his current employer was involved in the management of dow corning pension assets.dow corning advised umpire lyon and schenk that nelson withdrawal terminated their authority to hear the dispute.lyon and schenk instead ruled that safety should appoint a substitute.safety named john hyland as substitute.instead of filing a second faa motion challenging this ruling,dow corning agreed to proceed with a reservation of right to challenge the panel authority.we view this as a transparent attempt to preserve a threshold procedural issue in case dow corning eventually lost the arbitration on the merits.
on appeal,dow corning invokes the general rule that where one member of a arbitration panel dies before the rendering of an award and the arbitration agreement does not anticipate that circumstance,the arbitration must commence anew with a full panel.trade transport,natural petroleum charterers,cir,followed in marine prods.export globe galaxy,cir.but as the district court recognized,the circumstances in this case distinguished it from those applying the general rule and justified the panel decision to proceed after safety selected a substitute.first,because the substitution occurred before the substantive arbitration hearing,the substitute participated fully in the hearing,the panel deliberations,and the preparation of the panel decision.compare in re cia de navegacion omsil.second,the remaining arbitrators made a reasonable decision to allow safety to choose its substitute,the method of selecting prescribed in the agreement to arbitrate.third,as dow corning well knew,starting over would have deprived safety of its win in the umpire selection process.the second circuit recognized in marine products,at,that the general rule does not apply when a vacancy arises after the original panel has rendered a final decision on any question.
finally,and most importantly,dow corning acknowledges that a vacancy in an arbitration panel may be filled in the manner prescribed in the agreement to arbitrate.here,the remaining arbitrators concluded that the agreement authorized them to proceed with a substitute.in general,reviewing courts leave procedural issues for the arbitrators to decide.see el dorado school dist.con
