this diversity case comes to us after entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant.the plaintiff appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
abstract title guaranty atg provided services in connection with real estate transactions.it obtained an errors and omissions policy from chicago insurance company cic covering the period from november to december.atg fell in with a company called royal haven builders and its principal eric tauer.this turned out to be a tremendously bad business decision.it appears that as royal haven began a long decline into bankruptcy,fraud,and check kiting an employee of atg had started slipping funds intended for third parties under the table directly to royal haven.that same employee also failed to look after other interests of parties to whom atg owed contractual and fiduciary duties in these complex real estate development deals.not surprisingly,some of those who had been defrauded by royal haven and the complicit atg employee took notice when millions of dollars worth of deals went sour.
in september,atg first notified cic about an incident s that had been brought to their attention within the last few weeks.the initial dialog between atg and cic was predictable.there was some discussion of whether the incident s would count as a single claim or multiple claims.cic conducted some investigation of the coverage,the facts of the case,and policy exclusions.but it was not long before atg was indicating that there might be hundreds of claims forthcoming.over the next few months,cic apparently began to sense that claimants were circling atg much like children around a pi√±ata.by the spring of,there were nearly one hundred claims pending against atg,totaling over million.and then the lawsuits started.
in april,as atg started getting served with legal complaints,cic came to the realization that the value of the eventual claims against atg was going to dwarf cic potential maximum liability.so cic filed an interpleader action in the federal district court and deposited with the court an amount equal to its limit of coverage.chicago ins.abstract title.as atg was facing looming deadlines in the various state court causes of action,cic advised atg to hire counsel of their choosing and seek payment of those legal fees out of the interpleaded policy limits.eventually the district court disbursed the deposited funds to the various claimants in accordance with a settlement agreement.as part of that settlement agreement,atg received the largest share of any claimant.the remainder was divvied up among seven other claimants.
atg then brought the present action in state court against cic,alleging that cic had breached its insurance contract by interpleading the coverage limits and by not defending atg in court.atg also alleged that cic had failed to deal in good faith.cic removed the case to the federal district court.the parties brought for summary judgment,and on may,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of cic.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review an entry of summary judgment de novo.omega healthcare investors,cir.we view all facts and draw all inferences in the light most favorable to the party.id.summary judgment is appropriate where the evidence before the court indicates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
the relevant terms of the insurance policy that are now at the heart of this dispute can be summarized as follows.the policy set a limit of liability,both in the aggregate and for each individual claim.the policy stated that claim expenses are included within the limits of liability.claim expenses are defined in the contract to include 
fees charged by an attorney s designated by cic and all other fees,costs,and expenses resulting from the investigation,adjustment,defense,and appeal of a claim,suit or proceeding arising in connection therewith,if incurred by cic,or by atg with written consent of cic policy vii.
finally,cic also had a contractual right and duty to defend any suit against atg,and the contract provided that cic at its option,shall select and assign defense counsel.policy i.but cic did not have a duty to defend or continue to defend after the applicable limit of cic liability had been exhausted by the payments of judgments,settlements,damages or claim expenses,as applicable.id.
atg argues that cic breached its contract in two ways by paying the money to the court in the action and by not defending the claims.this is a question of state law,and when the highest court in the state has not spoken we must attempt to predict how we believe that court would decide.state farm mut.auto.ins.pate,cir.we look to decisions of intermediate appellate courts in the state for persuasive guidance in that endeavor.id.the parties have not identified for us,nor is the court able to locate,controlling indiana supreme court precedent on this question.
however,while this case was pending the indiana court of appeals decided a similar question in mahan am.standard ins.in mahan,an automobile insurer faced a situation where the number and value of potential claims against the insured might have exceeded the insurer total liability.id.at.the policy included a clause that shifted the burden to defend or settle onto the insurer,but the contract also included a clause that disavowed any duty to defend after the limits of liability had been paid.id.at.as the claims started to loom,the insurer initiated an interpleader action and deposited with the court the total sum of its liability under the policy.id.at.the court eventually divided the funds amongst the injured parties.id.at.the insured against the insurer alleging breach of contractual duties to defend and bad faith.id.at.
on nearly identical facts to this case,the indiana court of appeals held in mahan that there was no breach of contract for interpleading and failing to defend.id.at.this appears to resolve the question of whether indiana law allows the use of interpleader as a method of paying the policy limits.but the court rested its failure to defend decision on additional grounds that are not present here in mahan,the insurer interpleaded before the first lawsuit was filed against the insured.id.in this case,atg had already been served a complaint before cic filed the interpleader.id.the question before us is whether this difference should lead us to a result that is contrary to mahan.on the basis of the language of the contract,we conclude that it should not.
in indiana,when an insurance contract is clear and unambiguous,the language therein must be given its plain meaning.on the other hand,where there is ambiguity,insurance policies are to be construed strictly against the insurer and the policy language is viewed from the standpoint of the insured.beam wausau ins,citing bosecker westfield ins,am.states ins.kiger,allstate ins.boles,internal quotations omitted.
this all comes down to the question of whether the deposit of the funds with the court constitutes a payment of claim expenses.if it is,then cic has exhausted its obligations under the contract.atg indicates in its reply brief that perhaps cic owed more than.appellant reply br.at.this argument was not raised below,nor was it raised in atg initial brief.arguments that first appear in a reply brief are deemed forfeited.carter tennant,cir.the definition of a claim expense is expansive in this contract.we repeat the relevant part all other fees,costs,and expenses resulting from the investigation,adjustment,defense,and appeal of a claim,suit or proceeding arising in connection therewith,if incurred by cic.cic deposited the sum total of its financial obligations into the court coffers for the purpose of satisfying the claims that were piling up against atg.there can be few actions that would fall more plainly within the meaning of costs or expenses resulting from the adjustment of a claim incurred by cic.we see nothing ambiguous about this language,despite the parties best efforts at obfuscation.having paid its limit in claims expenses,the contract between the parties clearly instructs that cic wa
