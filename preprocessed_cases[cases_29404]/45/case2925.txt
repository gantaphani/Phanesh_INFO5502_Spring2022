this case involves a dispute among insurers regarding the allocation of defense costs of an indemnitee that the insured assumed under an indemnity agreement.golden eagle insurance company golden eagle and insurance company of the west icw each paid of an arbitration award in favor of the indemnitee for in attorney fees and costs incurred in defending against third party property damage claims connecticut indemnity company cic refused to contribute.the trial court determined that the contractual liability provisions of the commercial general liability cgl policies do not cover the insured liability for the indemnitee defense costs,because such costs are not damages within the meaning of the policies.based on that finding,the court shifted the entire burden of the arbitration award to icw on the ground that the indemnitee was an additional insured under the icw policies,and icw breached its duty to provide a defense.
we hold,in accordance with the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured,that the indemnitee defense costs are sums the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage.consequently,each of the three insurers is on the risk assumed by the and there is no equitable basis for shifting the entire burden to icw as the indemnitee insurer.
we reverse summary judgments for golden eagle and cic on the complaint and,respectively and remand the matter to the trial court for its a entry of an order granting icw motion for summary judgment on the complaint and judgment for icw thereon,and b reconsideration of its denial of icw motion for summary judgment on the.the latter issue requires the court exercise of discretion in determining whether icw submitted sufficient evidence to support a particular method of allocation,and if so,the amount that cic must contribute toward the arbitration award.
factual and procedural background 
in the plastering was a subcontractor on several residential construction projects of davidson communities,and related entities collectively davidson.the subcontracts contained a type i indemnity agreement which provided in part 
subcontractor shall indemnify,defend and save harmless contractor from any and all claims,demands,causes of action,damages,costs,expenses,losses or liabilities,in law or in equity,of every kind and nature whatsoever arising out of or in any manner directly or indirectly connected with the work to be performed under this agreement,howsoever caused,regardless of any negligence of contractor 
subcontractor shall,at subcontractor own costs,expense and risk,defend any and all suits,actions or other legal proceedings that may be brought by third persons against contractor on any such claim and shall reimburse contractor for any and all legal expense incurred in connection therewith or in enforcing the indemnity granted in this paragraph.
was insured under successive cgl policies issued by golden eagle,icw and cic.the policies covered liability for third party bodily injury or property damage claims,and assumption of the tort liability of prime contractors,such as davidson,under indemnity agreements contractual liability coverage.davidson was also named as an additional insured on the icw policies.
beginning in homeowners brought several lawsuits against davidson for construction defects consolidated and referred to as the allenson action.davidson against its subcontractors,including,for express indemnity and negligence.davidson,as icw additional named insured,tendered the defense of the allenson action to icw it denied the request.
davidson obtained counsel and settled some of the homeowner claims before trial the remaining homeowner claims were tried,and judgment was rendered in their favor.golden eagle,icw and cic,all of which defended on davidson,paid a total of to settle indemnity exposure to davidson for damages paid to the allenson action plaintiffs.
obligation to indemnify davidson for its attorney fees and costs in the allenson action was submitted to binding arbitration.the arbitrator awarded davidson.golden eagle and icw paid the award in equal shares.
davidson later sued icw and several other insurers for declaratory relief,breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and related counts the davidson action.davidson alleged the insurers breached their duty to defend it in the allenson action as an additional insured under policies issued to subcontractors,including 
while the davidson action was pending,golden eagle brought this action against icw for declaratory relief,equitable contribution and equitable indemnity.golden eagle sought reimbursement of the amount it paid toward the arbitration award,on the ground that icw is solely responsible for davidson defense costs because it was an additional insured under the icw policies.icw against cic for equitable contribution and related counts icw alleged that cic,as insurer,is required to pay a portion of the arbitration award.
subsequently,in the davidson action,davidson and the insurers entered into a settlement agreement under which they were required to pay davidson a total of in exchange for a release of all claims.icw was required to pay of that amount.
in this action,icw and golden eagle filed summary judgment motions on the complaint,and icw and cic filed summary judgment motions on the.the trial court denied icw motions and granted golden eagle and cic motions.the court found that davidson defense costs in the allenson action are not damages within the meaning of the cgl policies,and thus liability for such costs under the indemnity agreements is not covered.the court determined that icw breached its obligation to defend davidson as an additional insured,and thus in equity and good conscience icw should reimburse golden eagle for its payment of of the arbitration award against.in may,judgments were entered in favor of golden eagle and cic on the complaint and,respectively.

indemnitee defense costs as damages under cgl policiesa 
icw contends the judgments must be reversed because contractual liability provisions of the cgl policies of golden eagle,cic and icw cover liability for davidson defense costs in the allenson action,and the three insurers should contribute equally to satisfying the arbitration award and since the policies cover exposure for the loss,there is no equitable ground for shifting the entire burden to icw as davidson insurer under the additional insured endorsements of the icw policies.
while insurance contracts have special features,they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply.citation.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.the goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties.citation.if contract language is clear and explicit,we ascertain this intent from the written provisions and go no further.citation.words in an insurance policy must be understood in their ordinary sense unless given special meanings by the policy.citation.maryland casualty nationwide ins.th,d.

golden eagle and cic policies cover all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence,or accident.italics added.the policies also provide contractual liability coverage.the golden eagle policies state 
exclusions.
this insurance does not apply to 
bodily injury or property damage for which the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.this exclusion does not apply to liability for damages 
assumed in a contract or agreement that is an insured contract,provided the bodily injury or property damage occurs subsequent to the execution of the contract or agreement or 
that the insured would have in the absence of the contract or agreement.
the golden eagle policies define insured contract as t hat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business under which you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for property damage to a third person or organization.
the cic policies exclude coverage to liability assumed by the insured under any contract or agreement except a contract as defined in the policies.the cic policies define a covered contract as any written contract or agreement wherein the named insured has expressly assumed liability for damages to which this policy applies.
under the subcontracts here,expressly assumed the tort liability of davidson for property damage claims of third persons.accordingly,the subcontracts are insured contracts within the meaning of the cgl policies.if there is a single key factor or element on which to focus when trying to determine whether a contract is an insured contract,it is the insured assumption of liability under the contract at issue.richmond black,expanding liability coverage insured contracts and additional insureds drake.t he insured must assume the other contracting party tort liability to third parties in order for insured contract coverage to attach.id.at.
icw contends that given the contractual liability coverage,the policies should be interpreted to include davidson defense costs in the allenson action as sums became legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage.italics added.golden eagle and cic counter that the defense costs are not covered because the policies definitions of insured contract refer only to the assumption of tort liability and do not expressly include the assumption of defense costs.golden eagle and cic assert that the terms of the indemnity agreements between davidson and are immaterial.
apparently,there is no published california opinion on point.icw relies on an august fire casualty surety bulletin fc s bulletin,which provides 
there has been a question in some circles over whether the contractual coverage offered under the cgl form extends defense cost coverage to the entity whose liability has been assumed by the insured through an insured contract 
the current cgl form,in discussing liability for damages assumed under an insured contract,states that reasonable attorney fees and necessary litigation expenses incurred by or for a party other than an insured are deemed to be damages.this would seem to answer the question in the affirmative since the word damages is the key word.the exception to the contractual liability exclusion states that the exclusion does not apply to liability for damages assumed under an insured contract therefore,if the defense costs for the entity other than the insured are damages,the cgl form will cover them.there are some conditions to be met before the defense costs are deemed to be damages,namely,liability for the defense costs has to be assumed in the insured contract just as the liability has to be assumed,and the defense costs have to be for defense against alleged damages that are covered by the insured policy.italics added.
the fc s bulletin,which is published by the national underwriters association,is used by insurance agents and brokers to interpret standard insurance policy provisions.maryland casualty reeder d.r eliance on an fc s bulletin is appropriate under civil code section which provides technical words are to be interpreted as usually understood by persons in the profession or business to which they relate,unless clearly used in a different sense.maryland casualty reeder,supra,at,fn.american star ins.insurance of the west d,fn.i nsurance industry publications are particularly persuasive as interpretive aids where they support coverage on behalf of the insured.ultimately,the test is whether coverage is consistent with the insured objectively reasonable expectations.citation.commercial ins.reliance ins.th,d.
the fc s bulletin does indicate that the current cgl form clarifies coverage that existed under previous versions of the form,rather than extends a new type of coverage.the question addressed in the fc s bulletin would not have been based on the current cgl form,because it expressly includes defense costs.indeed,the insurers do not contend otherwise.rather,golden eagle objects to our consideration of the fc s bulletin on the ground that its policies unambiguously exclude coverage for davidson defense costs,and thus resort to interpretive aids is improper.we disagree.the term damages as used in the insuring clauses of the golden eagle and cic policies is not defined,and given the contractual liability coverage of the policies,the term could reasonably be interpreted to include the indemnitee costs in defending against third party claims for covered property damages.
opinions from other jurisdictions on the scope of contractual liability coverage,though few,are informative.icw cites beck city and borough of sitka cir beck,in which the court interpreted alaska law.in beck,the policies provided the insurers will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured,by reason of contractual liability assumed by him under any written contract of the type designated in the schedule for this insurance,shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence.id.at,fn,italics added.this language is substantively similar to that of the golden eagle and cic policies.
the insured in beck sitka,the owner of a dam,had entered into an agreement to indemnify a contractor beck for damages,including costs of defense,related to any personal injuries or death arising from services beck performed on the dam.beck,supra,at.the court held that attorney fees and costs beck incurred in defending against a wrongful death action were damages covered under the contractual liability provisions of sitka policy,as opposed to costs covered by supplementary payment provisions,which applied to costs taxed against the insured in any suit defended by the insurer.ibid.the court explained the defense costs constituted covered damages because they were awarded to beck by virtue of the indemnity provision in the service contract between beck and sitka.ibid.
golden eagle and cic attempt to distinguish beck on the grounds that there the contractual liability provisions appeared in endorsements rather than the body of the policies,and the insured paid an additional premium for the coverage.the insurers,however,cite no authority suggesting the interpretation of policy language is dependent on the location in which it appears or the cost of coverage.where a point is merely asserted by counsel without any argument of or authority for its proposition,it is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion.people ham d,disapproved of on another ground in people compton cal d,fn,people sierra th,fn,d.in any event,the insured objectively reasonable expectations can not ordinarily be gleaned from the premium cost alone.see maryland casualty nationwide ins,supra,th at,d.
in york vulcan materials york,the definition of insured contract was t hat part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business under which you assume the tort liability of another party to pay for bodily injury or property damage to a third person or organization.id.at,italics added.this language is identical to that of the golden eagle policies and substantively similar to that of the cic policies.a subcontract between the insured subcontractor thomas and the contractor vulcan required thomas to indemnify vulcan for any damages or losses,including attorney fees,arising from thomas negligence.the court held the subcontract was an insured contract within the policy meaning,and the insurer was required to pay the defense costs vulcan incurred in an underlying personal injury action allegedly caused by thomas negligence.id.at see also ryland mortgage,travelers indemnity of illinois d,no dispute that contractual liability coverage extended to indemnitor defense costs,notwithstanding fact that provision did not expressly include defense costs.
according to a commentator,when a policy is written to cover liability of the insured imposed by contract,w hether an insurer is obligated under its policy to indemnify its insured depends on the indemnification or agreement executed by its insured.appleman,insurance law and practice berdal ed,italics added.appleman states that a contract of indemnification of a contractor by a subcontractor does not bind the subcontractor insurer to defend a liability action against the contractor,but merely to indemnify the general contractor for liability sustained.however,liability incurred by an owner indemnitee has included attorney fees,costs,discovery and research expenses in the successful defense of the main action.id.at,citing williams california,the obligation of an independent contractor to defend,hold harmless and indemnify its principal,under insured contracts includes reimbursement of litigation expenses reasonable counsel fees which have been incurred in resisting the claim indemnified against may be recovered from indemnitor insurer as a part of the damages and expenses when an action is brought to recover indemnity either upon a right of indemnity implied by law or arising under a contract.citation.williams california,supra,at,italics added.
in california,the plain and ordinary meaning of the term damages,as used in cgl policies,is monetary compensation recovered by a party for detriment,loss or injury it has suffered through the acts of another.see aiu ins.superior court,supra,cal d at.golden eagle and cic rely on unified school district tulare county school.authority th,d,for the proposition that davidson attorney fees are not damages within the meaning of the policies.in,the court held that the plaintiff attorney fees,for which the defendant school districts were liable under the federal voting rights act of,did not qualify as damages under the districts liability policy.the court explained that an award of attorney fees does not compensate the plaintiff for the injury that first brought him or her into court i nstead,the award reimburses him or her for a portion of the expenses he or she incurred in seeking relief,and fees are inconsistent with the concept of damages as the term is used in its ordinary and popular sense,that is,compensation paid to a party for the loss or detriment suffered because of the wrongful act of another.citation.id.at,d.
is inapposite,however,because it does not concern contractual liability provisions or the insured assumption of liability for the indemnitee costs in defending against covered third party tort actions.the same is true of other cases cic cites in which the courts held that intangible damages,including economic losses,of third party plaintiffs are not within the scope of cgl policies.waller truck ins.exchange,supra,cal th at,d,mclaughlin national union fire ins.th,d chatton national union fire ins.th,d giddings industrial indemnity d.

we conclude that an insured with contractual liability coverage would reasonably expect that the indemnitee attorney fees and costs are sums the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of covered tort claims.m ost construction agreements or contracts require downstream contractors or subcontractors to protect upstream contractors by way of indemnity provisions,richmond black,expanding liability coverage insured contracts and additional insureds,supra,drake.at and many indemnification clauses in the construction industry include language that can be read to require a defense as well as indemnity.id.at.indeed,in california an indemnity against claims and liability embraces the costs of defense against such claims unless a contrary intention appears,subd.
moreover,it is established that the indemnitee attorney fees constitute an item of damages for the indemnitor breach of its indemnity obligation.heppler peters th,d myers building industries,interface technology,th,d indemnitee attorney fees included as a matter of law as an item of recoverable loss in an indemnity agreement.davidson suffered detriment or loss by incurring attorney fees and costs as a direct result of third party claims for property damage arising from work,and the arbitration award on the indemnity agreement is monetary compensation therefor.
further,it is recognized that construction defect litigation is typically complex and expensive.maryland casualty nationwide ins,supra,th at,d pardee construction insurance of the west th,d.as a matter of common sense,protection from potentially ruinous defense costs of the indemnitee is as vital to an insured as protection from the indemnitee tort liability.here,for instance,davidson defense costs in the allenson action exceeded its tort liability for work attributable to by nearly percent.notably,the fc s bulletin shows that the insurance industry believed that when an insured contract includes the assumption of the indemnitee attorney fees and costs,such expenses are covered damages according to the reasonable expectations of the insured 
equitable contribution issuesa 
in the insurance context,the right to contribution depends upon the existence of an obligation owed to a common insured.the right arises when one of two or more insurers is obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim and one of those insurers has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without participation from the others.citation.equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation,on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk.the purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers,and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.citations.citation.american continental ins.american casualty th,d,citing fireman fund ins.maryland casualty th,d.
icw contends there is no equitable basis for charging icw with the arbitration award as davidson insurer under the additional insured endorsements of its policies,particularly since the icw,golden eagle and cic policies cover liability for the arbitration award.we agree.the three insurers are obligated to indemnify a common the loss.on the other hand,under the additional insured endorsements,icw provided coverage for another.courts have enforced an insurer contribution claim only when the other insurer was also obligated to a common insured on the claim.w here there is no common obligation that is leg
