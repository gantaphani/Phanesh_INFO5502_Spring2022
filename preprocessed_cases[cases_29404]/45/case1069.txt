becky cooper appeals from an adverse judgment in her suit for disability insurance benefits.her employer plan is subject to the provisions of the employee retirement and income security act erisa.because we conclude that the decision of life insurance company of north america lina,the plan administrator,to deny disability benefits to cooper was arbitrary and capricious,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for entry of an order requiring lina to award benefits retroactive to the date on which cooper disability benefits ceased,and for such incidental relief as the district court may find appropriate in light of our decision.
background 
becky cooper worked out of her home as an insurance claims adjuster for a subsidiary of ace insurance ace for years.at all times relevant to this appeal,she was covered by both and disability insurance plans administered by lina.only the disability plan the plan is presently at issue.
the plan defines the term disabled as follows 
the employee is considered disabled if,solely because of injury or sickness,he or she is either 
unable to perform all the material duties of his or her regular occupation or a qualified alternative,or 
unable to earn or more of his or her indexed covered earnings.
under the plan,
t he insurance company will pay disability benefits if an employee becomes disabled while covered under this policy.the employee must satisfy the elimination period,be under the appropriate care of a physician,and meet all the other terms and conditions of the policy.he or she must provide the insurance company,at his or her own expense,satisfactory proof of disability before benefits will be paid.
the plan requires covered employees to satisfy a elimination period of continuous disability before lina will pay disability benefits.it further obligates claimants to provid e any information or documents needed to determine whether benefits are payable,and places the burden on them to provide satisfactory proof of disability.the plan also grants lina the right to conduct a physical examination,at its own expense,of a claimant as often as it may reasonably require.
in january of,cooper lower back was injured in a incident while she was on a business trip.she was reaching from the driver seat of her car into the back seat when she both felt and heard a popping sensation in her lower back,which was followed by pain that radiated down her right leg.after testing and evaluation,her physician told her that she had scoliosis,spondylolisthesis,nerve entrapment,and degenerative disc disease.she continued to work until may of,when she had a partial lumbar laminectomy performed.between may and october of,while recuperating,cooper received disability std benefits from lina.
her recuperation progressed more slowly than her neurosurgeon,peter boehm,had anticipated.the patient,he said,has suffered a prolong sic post operative course with residual pain cooper attempted to return to work in late september of,but boehm would not release her to work for more than two to three hours per day.she reported that even that amount of work caused her great pain.on december,boehm noted in my opinion,this patient is not capable of working for a full hours.he directed her to stop working as of the following month.prior to the termination of her disability benefits on october,cooper applied for disability ltd benefits under the plan.
in addition to being seen by boehm,cooper has been treated by sean brown,a physical medicine and rehabilitation pmr specialist david close,her primary care physician dennis ford,a specialist michael gallagher,a neurosurgeon in the same practice as boehm and james osborn,another neurosurgeon.she was also evaluated by edward johnson in april of in connection with her application for social security disability benefits.
in a letter dated october,lina acknowledged cooper application for ltd benefits and informed her that it needed additional information to make a determination on her claim to fully understand how your condition prevents you from working,we must obtain your physician treatment plan,as well as medical information regarding your diagnosis and functional abilities from boehm by december.on november,lina faxed requests to boehm,close,and ford for updated medical and office notes from august of through the present date.each fax included a request for objective findings,including reports,office notes,and physical abilities assessment.the physical ability assessment paa form accompanied these requests.
boehm submitted copies of notes covering his entire time of seeing cooper,along with the results of an august lumbar myelogram.the myelogram report described m arked intradiscal degenerative change,protrusion type herniation at,m spondylotic changes including grade i spondylolisthesis,and mild compression to the inferior aspect of the root on the right side.in addition,the myelogram revealed more advanced degenerative narrowing of the disc space with a diffuse spondylotic defect crossing the central and descending into the right and left central canals.notes from close are not included in the record and are not at issue in this appeal.ford faxed a copy of his notes from a september outpatient visit,describing cooper mri results and assessing her as having postlaminectomy syndrome,lumbar radiculopathy,degenerative disc disease of her lumbar spine,and lumbar spondylosis.he did not offer any opinion about her functionality or ability to return to work.
lina sent a second letter to cooper on november,advising medica sic needed by or will make claim decision with medical on file.according to lina records,cooper called lina on december,to ask what additional information was needed for the determination of her claim.she was told that lina needed functionality defined.after receiving no additional information from cooper or on her behalf,lina denied cooper application for ltd benefits on december,stating that it had been unable to determine if cooper satisfied the policy definition of disabled.according to the denial letter,lina considered the plan and all of the documents in cooper claim file,including boehm medical records for the period of july to november and ford medical records from september of.
karen wells,the lina case manager who denied cooper claim,reported that boehm states in his september office visit notes that your pain has improved but is not well.he advises that you may return to work in the afternoon to hours a week gradually working into a longer schedule as your condition permits.cooper was further told that boehm states you have good range of motion of the back and the wound is well healed.but wells also noted that cooper functional ability to lift,carry,walk,stand,was not supplied to lina by boehm despite two requests to his office to do so and two notices to cooper that the information was needed.lina advised cooper that w ithout documented functionality from your physician,we are unable to determine if you satisfy the policy definition of disabled.accordingly,her claim was denied.cooper appealed this determination,pursuant to the plan administrative appeal process.
in support of her appeal,cooper submitted additional treatment notes from boehm,a paa from boehm on which certain sections were left blank,documentation from brown,close,and ford,and a detailed letter from debby swanger,the nurse case manager and disability management specialist assigned to cooper workers compensation file by intracorp,a medical management company,describing cooper case and treatment.the report from cooper december lumbar spine mri reflected extensive degenerative changes at all levels throughout the lumbar spine.at the level,the mri revealed bulging of the disc that is and more prominent,especially on the left exiting foramina and far laterally on the left.boehm notes from january of reflect that he did not want cooper to work at all until she completed additional treatment.in the narrative section of the paa form,boehm stated that 
cooper should restrict her work hours to whatever her pain level permits.from a lifting standpoint she may lift pounds occasionally.she should avoid any repetitive bending or heavy lifting of anything greater than lbs.and must avoid any significant driving.obviously such things as crawling or clim b ing ladders,should be totally avoided.
on january,cooper medical problems were compounded when the car in which she was driving was struck by another car.an taken at the emergency room revealed advanced spondylosis but no spinal fracture.brown examined cooper on january,and instructed her to stay off of work until she completed further evaluation and treatment.a mri from the day of the car accident revealed a large herniated disc,spondylosis which differs from spondylolisthesis,and bone spurring in cooper cervical spine.in march of,brown was of the opinion that she could not perform her normal job duties on a basis.brown recommended in may of that cooper stay off of work until further notice.
in march of,lina hired kenneth graulich,a neurologist,to conduct an independent peer evaluation of cooper benefits application and to report on whether she was disabled.specifically,lina requested that graulich address the medical documentation of cooper condition and treatment,and whether the medical records in cooper file supported her inability to work in a position.graulich attempted to speak with cooper treating physicians,leaving messages with both boehm and brown offices on march and again on march.neither doctor had returned graulich phone calls by march,the date of his report to lina.
in his report,graulich summarized the medical records contained in cooper file and the restrictions and limitations that boehm had prescribed.he noted that cooper occupation was deemed,meaning that it required frequent lifting of pounds,occasionally pounds,and frequent walking and standing.in addition,he summarized cooper disability questionnaire,where she reported that her job required prolonged sitting which increases her low back pain and causes her legs to become numb.it also requires driving hours,which causes the same symptoms.cooper reported on the questionnaire that she could drive for only to minutes at a time.
graulich concluded that the medical documentation supported cooper inability to work at a position between her may surgery date and the end of october,but that it does not support her inability to work from to the present since i was unable to reach the patient physicians and i do not know if an fce functional capacity evaluation has been performed.for the same reasons,graulich concluded that the medical documentation does not support the patient inability to work from october of in a sedentary position.inexplicably,however,his report also stated that restrictions and limitations of no more than hours of work per day and no more than minutes of driving per day would appear reasonable.lina nonetheless relied on graulich report,despite the inconsistent findings,as the basis for its denial of cooper appeal on march.
in may of,at lina behest,cooper applied for social security disability benefits.the social security administration determined that cooper had become disabled on may,the date of her back surgery.as part of her disability application,she was examined by edward johnson,an orthopedist.johnson reported finding c omplete collapse of the disc space with a grade to spondylolisthesis of on.he also noted marked calcification that formed an auto fusion between and.his examination further showed that there is a complete pedicle break and severe spondylosis of the facet joints at level.moving along cooper spine,johnson reported a anterior wedge fracture at,and a complete collapse of and disc spaces with large bone spurs,forming an auto fusion from to.his report also stated that the and disc space is collapsed and that cooper has a scoliosis of her lumbar spine,an asymmetrical pelvis,and bilateral calcification of the sacroiliac joints with eburnation and sclerotic changes.from his physical exam of cooper,johnson noted marked muscle spasm in her lower back,restrictions in lumbar motion,and locking of the right si joint.
based largely upon johnson examination and report,the social security administration determined that cooper was totally disabled.she began receiving disability benefits,including a payment of back benefits,in june of.
cooper then filed a second administrative appeal with lina in july of.in support of her new appeal,she submitted additional notes from her treating physicians.the additional notes included results from a september mri ordered by boehm.this mri revealed marked degenerative disc change which effaces the thecal sac margin anteriorly at,and,at,a broad posterior disc osteophyte complex which is asymmetric to the right and significantly compresses the spinal cord.cooper also submitted a medical opinion form from johnson,who opined that cooper would have difficulty maintaining active employment other than very sedentary brief periods of work she can sit,stand or walk for two to three hours.johnson noted that cooper could not work an day or a week.
in september of,lina sent cooper claim file to eddie sassoon,a physical medicine and rehabilitation pmr specialist,for an independent peer evaluation.lina physician review referral form directed sassoon to review the medical information in cooper file,to interview her attending physician,and to provide a written report.specifically,lina asked sassoon to discuss in his report cooper diagnoses,the medical records relating to the severity of her condition,and her functional abilities.he was also instructed to discuss whether the medical documentation supported a finding that cooper was unable to perform her full time light occupation as a liability claims specialist during the time period of to the present,and to determine whether the evidence identified a medical condition of sufficient severity that would have precluded cooper from working in her occupation during the same time period.sassoon attempted to contact the office of ford,one of cooper treating pmr doctors,on september and,but did not achieve successful communication with the office.
in his september,report,sassoon summarized the medical records in cooper file and recapitulated graulich report and recommendation from cooper first appeal.sassoon also noted that boehm had released cooper to work two to three hours a day in september of and that her file contained no updated objective data supporting disability status.moreover,sassoon specifically flagged the absence of evidence of acute neurologic or orthopedic deficits of sufficient severity to preclude light level activity on a basis.accordingly,he concluded that the medical documentation was insufficient to support a finding that cooper was disabled as of october.
lina denied cooper second appeal soon thereafter.in a letter dated september,it summarized sassoon report and stated that cooper was not disabled as defined in the plan.lina also contended,for the first time,that cooper had not satisfied the requirement of the plan.
in april of,cooper filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee.she later moved for judgment on the administrative record.lina and ace,as part of their defense,filed separate motions for judicial notice of certain representations that cooper had made in three separately filed against ace,her former employer,and one against the individual with whom she had been involved in the january automobile accident.these lawsuits asserted or implied cooper contemporaneous ability to work,contradicting her claims of disability in the present lawsuit.cooper moved to strike the motions for judicial notice,claiming that lina and ace had failed to establish an exception to the erisa rules that generally prohibit the court from considering evidence outside the administrative record.she further contended that the motions for judicial notice were untimely,having been filed after the deadline for responsive pleadings to cooper motion for judgment on the administrative record.
the district court rendered its opinion in may of.after determining that the standard of review was applicable,the court considered cooper claims in relation to the plan requirements and her documented medical history.the court concluded that lina position that cooper had not satisfied the plan requirement was based on a misinterpretation of the period as defined in the plan itself.but the court determined that cooper claim failed for other reasons.it first decided that lina initial decision to deny benefits was not arbitrary and capricious because the decision was based on cooper failure to supply sufficient information rather than on the merits of her claim.as to lina denials of the two administrative appeals,the court concluded that both appeals failed on the merits.
the district court considered lina reliance on the opinions of graulich and sassoon,the contrary opinions of cooper treating physicians,the notes from johnson examination,lina failure to conduct its own medical exam of cooper,and the social security administration decision to award disability benefits to cooper.after reviewing all of the evidence in the record,the court concluded that lina decision to deny benefits,although a decision that others may not have made,was not arbitrary and capricious.
the rationality of lina decision,according to the district court,turned on the lack of objective medical evidence to support a finding of disability in the administrative record.sassoon report was quoted at length by the court,specifically his discussion of the absence of evidence of updated studies reflecting acute neurologic or orthopedic deficits that would prevent cooper from returning to work.the court also noted that the administrative record contained some objective evidence of cooper disability,but that sassoon explain ed well why that evidence was not satisfactory.emphasis in original.in addition,the court accord ed great weight to cooper failure to provide an fce,despite lina incessant requests for objective medical evidence of cooper functional capabilities.
the district court thus denied cooper motion for judgment on the administrative record,denied lina and ace motions for judicial notice as moot,denied cooper motion to strike as moot,and sua sponte dismissed all of cooper claims.it then entered judgment in the defendants favor.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court disposition of an erisa action based on the administrative record,and apply the same legal standard as the district court.wilkins baptist healthcare,cir.the district court in this case appropriately reviewed cooper suit under the standard because the plan granted discretionary authority to the plan administrator to interpret the plan terms and to determine benefits.see firestone tire rubber bruch,d setting forth the standard of review in erisa cases where the plan administrator has discretionary authority glenn metro.life.ins,cir applying firestone s standard of review.
under this standard,we will uphold the plan administrator decision if it is the result of a deliberate,principled reasoning process,glenn,at,and is rational in light of the plan provisions.jones metro.life ins,cir.but the standard of review is not a rubber stamp of the administrator decision.id.at.rather,this standard requires us to review the quality and quantity of the medical evidence and the opinions on both sides of the issues.mcdonald life ins,cir.
where a plan authorizes an administrator both to decide whether an employee is eligible for benefits and to pay those benefits,it creates an apparent conflict of interest.glenn,at.cooper contends that lina has a genuine pecuniary conflict of interest because it both determines whether a disability claim should be allowed and then pays the resulting disability benefits out of its own funds.this apparent conflict of interest applies both to lina and,according to cooper,to any consultant or medical expert that the plan administrator hires.in response,lina argues that any consideration of this issue is subsumed within the standard.
this alleged conflict of interest was correctly identified by the district court as a relevant factor that it must take into consideration in determining whether lina decision was arbitrary and capricious.the court noted,however,that sixth circuit caselaw requires a plaintiff not only to show the purported existence of a conflict of interest,but also to provide significant evidence that the conflict actually affected or motivated the decision at issue.see peruzzi summa med.plan,cir rejecting a application of the standard of review where a conflict of interest is present and instead requiring significant evidence of or bad faith.
cooper provided no evidence whatsoever that lina denial of benefits was motivated by its alleged conflict of interest.she simply asserted and continues to assert that because lina both decides whether an employee is eligible for disability benefits and then pays those benefits,lina necessarily has a conflict.but such conclusory statements,without more,do not suffice to render the district court determination incorrect.see id.lina in fact referred both of cooper appeals to independent consulting physicians for review.these physicians were employed and selected by a company,albeit based on selection criteria provided by lina.in addition,lina incorporated the additional medical documentation that cooper submitted into her case file,and reviewed the material as part of its internal appeal process.accordingly,we conclude that lina dual status as decisionmaker and as benefits dispenser did not in and of itself lead to an arbitrary and capricious determination of cooper claim.
lina initial denial of cooper claim was not arbitrary and capricious 
the plan language in the present case explicitly states that a participant is disabled so long as she is unable to perform all the material duties of his or her regular occupation or a qualified alternative.a qualified alternative is defined as an occupation whose material duties can be performed by the employee,is located within the same geographic area,is offered to the employee,and pays or more of the employee indexed covered earnings.although the record in this case inexplicably omits a job description or a list of job duties for cooper position,it does reflect that her job required her to travel extensively by car for up to six hours at a stretch to visit accident sites.the department of labor classifies cooper position as light duty,a classification that cooper does not contest.
lina argues that it was unable to determine if cooper fit within the disabled definition because her file contained insufficient objective documentation of her functional capacity.cooper claim was properly denied,according to lina,because she failed to provide such documentation despite multiple requests to do so.cooper,on the other hand,claims that she in fact provided all of the evidence that lina requested,including a paa from boehm,and that her treating doctors all agreed that her back condition prevented her from working.
the record offers only equivocal support for lina contention that it requested paas from cooper doctors on four separate occasions.in fact,lina communications with cooper doctors,and with cooper herself,did not emphasize the need for a paa.lina instead made a general request for information about cooper diagnosis and treatment,including reports,office notes,and physical abilities assessment.along with these requests,lina provided blank paa forms to each of the doctors.boehm and ford responded to lina request with copies of notes and procedure results.
although boehm did not submit a completed paa by december,he submitted one the following week,just after lina had denied cooper initial ltd benefits claim.the form stated that cooper was able to occasionally lift and carry up to pounds,but that she should restrict her work hours to whatever her pain level permits and must avoid any significant driving.we are of the opinion that lina would have acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner if it had denied cooper claim and subsequent appeals solely on the basis of her doctors alleged failure to supply completed paas to lina.but that is not what occurred.
the plan permits lina to request reasonable documentation of cooper condition and obligates cooper to comply with such requests.requiring a claimant to provide objective medical evidence of disability is not irrational or unreasonable.see spangler lockheed martin energy,cir upholding a plan administrator decision because it was rational in light of the plan provisions.objective medical documentation of cooper functional capacity would have assisted lina in determining whether she was capable of performing all the material duties of her regular occupation,as required by the plan definition of disability.we therefore conclude that lina requests were not unreasonable.
lina denial letter specifically stated that it had considered the opinions of boehm and ford.and,indeed,a plan administrator may not arbitrarily disregard reliable medical evidence proffered by a claimant,including the opinions of a treating physician.evans unumprovident,cir.but lina was not obligated to blindly accept the treating physicians opinions either.see black decker disability plan nord,d c ourts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant physician.
in the present case,lina determined that the record was insufficient to support a finding of disability because it lacked objective medical evidence.your functional ability to lift,carry,walk,stand,was not supplied to our office by boehm,lina wrote in its denial letter.the letter further stated that w ithout documented functionality from your physician,we are unable to determine if you satisfy the policy definition of disabled.
indeed,boehm and ford provided treatment records indicating that cooper condition was slowly improving,at least as of the date of the initial denial.boehm notes stated that cooper was to gradually increase her work schedule.the record thus contains sufficient documentation to justify lina determination that objective evidence of cooper functional capacity was lacking.we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in upholding lina initial claim denial under the standard of review.
lina denial of cooper first administrative appeal was arbitrary and capricious 
on administrative appeal,cooper submitted additional medical evidence in an effort to satisfy lina requests for objective documentation of her condition.the evidence included treatment notes from boehm and brown,a paa from boehm,and at least two mri test results dating from december of and january of.she also submitted the police report and emergency room records relating to her january automobile accident.
although the plan provides that lina may,at its own expense,have a claimant examined by a physician of its choice,it chose not to do so.there is nothing in the plan language,however,that requires lina to conduct its own medical examination or that bars a file review by a consulting physician in place of a physical exam.instead,lina reliance on file reviewers in its denial of cooper administrative appeals is just one more factor to consider in our overall assessment of whether lina acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.see calvert firstar,cir.we also consider whether the file reviewers are independent medical examiners or are employees of the plan administrator.moon unum provident,cir w hen a plan administrator explanation is based on the work of a doctor in its employ,we must view the explanation with some skepticism.this court has further noted that a plan administrator failure to conduct a physical examination may,in some cases,raise questions about the thoroughness and accuracy of the benefits determination.calvert,at.
in this case,graulich reviewed cooper claim file,discussed the medical documentation contained therein,and determined that insufficient medical evidence existed to support a finding of disability.the report of graulich on cooper first appeal summarized the treatment notes from boehm,ford,and gallagher.graulich recounted that boehm had filled out a paa stating that cooper was able to lift pounds occasionally and could work to tolerance level.in addition,graulich reported that boehm subsequently noted that cooper was unable to tolerate even the two to three hours of work per day that she attempted in late september of.boehm supplemented his notes on december,in my opinion this patient is not capable of working for a full hours,on january,at this point i would recommend that we sic not pursue any work until we determine the efficacy of a series of epidural steroid injections and until she can become actively involve d with her water aerobic therapy,and on february,becky cooper was evaluated in the office today.she is not able to return to work.
the above clarifications are specifically mentioned in graulich report.graulich attempted,but failed,to reach boehm and brown by telephone in the days immediately before he submitted his report.consequently,he noted that he did not know if cooper ever had a functional capacity evaluation to confirm her inability to do a light level of labor to include driving.he then determined,without further discussion,that the medical documentation does not support her inability to work from to the present.
lina relied on graulich report in its march,denial of cooper first administrative appeal,stating that t he reviewing physician graulich noted that without conversation with your treating physician or a valid functional capacity evaluation fce relative to the period of through the present,he was unable to conclude that you were unable to perform at a light work level on a basis.this caused lina to affirm its previous decision to deny cooper claim for ltd benefits.
lina request for an independent physician review of cooper appeal had included the following special instructions 
please review the attached medical information provided 
interview the attending physician and 
in your narrative report,please included answers to the questions below.
those questions included a request to identify and discuss cooper diagnosis in detail,including an instruction to p lease contact tx aps,meaning the treating attending physicians.
graulich received this request to review cooper file some time after march,and was given approximately days to conduct his review.he attempted to contact boehm and brown on march and again on march.his report was dated march.although the fact that graulich made two phone calls to each doctor might indicate the urgency or seriousness of the matter,the record is devoid of evidence that he informed the treating physicians of how important it was to cooper that they promptly contact him.we find that graulich haste to complete his report in disregard of his explicit instructions to interview cooper treating physicians was unreasonable,especially because he allowed so little time before he pulled the trigger.
this is not to say that graulich or any other independent file examiner has to wait indefinitely for a response from a claimant treating physicians.but the examiner does have to wait a reasonable amount of time and establish that the treating physicians were informed of the importance to their patient of a prompt reply.here,lina had directed graulich,in two separate instructions,to interview cooper treating physicians.he did not do so.moreover,he inexplicably stated that restrictions and limitations of no more than hours of work per day and no more than minutes of driving per day would appear reasonable directly after concluding that the medical documentation does not support the patient inability to work through the present in a sedentary position.as further evidence of the problems with graulich report,cooper job was not classified as sedentary,but rather as.
in sum,graulich failed to interview cooper treating physicians despite his explicit instructions to do so,misstated the exertional level of cooper job,and contradicted himself as to her ability to engage in work.we thus conclude that lina acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it relied on graulich report in denying cooper first appeal on the basis that the record lacked sufficient evidence to establish disability.
lina denial of cooper second appeal was also arbitrary and capricious 
in reviewing cooper file on her second administrative appeal,sassoon failed to provide a reasonable basis for denying cooper claim and,in fact,compounded the errors in graulich report.lina request for a second independent physician review included the same three instructions as provided in its first request to graulich,including a direction to interview the attending physician.contrary to the singular noun physician,the request form provided the name,specialty,and phone number information for boehm,brown,ford,and osborn,all being cooper treating physicians.
in his september,report,sassoon summarized the treatment notes of cooper doctors,along with the findings from the mri and studies.he specifically recounted that johnson,who had examined cooper in connection with her social security claim,had noted that cooper could lift pounds occasionally.but sassoon omitted any reference to the immediately preceding sentence of johnson opinion,which stated that b ased on the objective physical findings during this exam,it is felt that this woman would have difficulty maintaining active employment other than very sedentary brief periods of work.emphasis added.sassoon likewise discussed boehm notes insofar as they addressed cooper ability to perform a straight leg raise,but made no mention of boehm repeated notes that cooper was unable to work for more than three hours per day after her surgery.moreover,sassoon gave no explanation for why he ignored these portions of the medical evidence in cooper file.
he did note,however,that cooper underwent an mri in december of that revealed no evidence of recurrent disc herniation or acute neurologic impingement.brain and cervical mris,according to sassoon,also provided no evidence of neurological deficits or compromise.sassoon concluded that cooper condition will be consistent with chronic cervical and lumbar radicular pain and degeneration of the cervical and lumbar spine of moderate degree,but provided no explanation for how those conditions would manifest themselves in her functional abilities.he also agreed with graulich that the file lacked updated evidence of cooper functional capacity that would confirm her inability to do a light level of labor,which includes driving activity beyond october.
but like graulich,sassoon failed to follow lina explicit instructions.he notes in his report that he did contact ford on september,and september,but that he did not achieve successful communication with the office.from this statement,we are unable to determine whether sassoon spoke to a member of ford staff,whether he left a message,or whether he was unable to get through to the office at all.nor is there any evidence that sassoon attempted to contact any of the other three treating physicians listed in lina request form.
also like graulich,sassoon gives no explanation of why the information in cooper file,including various test results and statements from no fewer than three physicians that she was unable to work a full day,was insufficient to support such a finding.sassoon instead summarized those parts of the file favorable to lina,omitted the parts that tended to support cooper claim,and concluded that there was insufficient evidence of disability.lina then relied on sassoon report in denying cooper second administrative appeal,despite his failure to follow lina explicit instructions and his omission of certain portions of the evidence in cooper file.we conclude that this reliance was unreasonable.
the plan grants lina the authority to request satisfactory proof of disability,although lina may not arbitrarily repudiate or refuse to consider the opinions of a treating physician.see glenn,at.here,the failure of the physicians to comply with lina instructions or to explain why they had disregarded the opinions of the doctors who had in fact treated cooper was arbitrary.see mcdonald,at holding a plan administrator denial of benefits to be arbitrary and capricious where the administrator gave no explanation for ignoring the reports of the treating physicians and two independent file reviewers that the claimant was disabled.lina reliance on the reports of graulich and sassoon in denying cooper two administrative appeals constitutes capricious decisionmaking.
in sum,lina sought documentation of cooper functional capacity,such as the amount of time that she could sit,stand,walk,or drive,but did not inform her that it would accept only one form of such fce.even after cooper submitted the requested documentation,including physician notes,mri and other test results,and the report of the examining physician for her social security benefits,lina continued to maintain that her claim was insufficiently documented.
graulich and sassoon,moreover,failed to consider all of the medical evidence in cooper claim file,disregarded their instructions to speak to cooper treating physicians,and then offered conclusory and unsupported statements that the documentation of cooper functional capacity was insufficient to support a finding of disability.lina reliance on these reports to uphold its denial of cooper claim was irrational.we thus conclude that the denial of cooper two administrative appeals by lina was arbitrary and capricious.
e.the district court properly dismissed the appellants motions for judicial notice as moot 
after the district court held that the denials of cooper claim by lina were not arbitrary and capricious,it dismissed lina and ace motions for judicial notice as moot.at oral argument,the parties disagreed as to whether we could,consistent with erisa,remand the matter to the district court with instructions to reopen the administrative record.we find,however,that this is not a situation where such an order would be appropriate.
in wilkins baptist healthcare,cir,this court clarified when and to what extent a district court may go beyond the administrative record when reviewing a plan administrator decision.the court is to conduct its review based solely upon the administrative record.id.at.evidence outside the administrative record may be considered only if that evidence is offered in support of a procedural challenge to the administrator decision,such as an alleged lack of due process afforded by the administrator or alleged bias on its part.id.this also means that any prehearing discovery at the district court level should be limited to such procedural challenges.id.neither party in the present case has raised a procedural challenge to the administrator decisionmaking.as such,consideration of evidence outside the administrative record would be improper.we thus find no error in the district court dismissal of the motions for judicial notice.
cooper remaining contention is moot 
in light of our determination that lina denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious,we have no need to resolve cooper contention that the district court failed to give proper weight to her award of disability benefits from the social security administration.this issue is therefore moot.
appropriate remedy 
we must next consider the appropriate remedy.a recent decision from this court concluded that a remand to the plan administrator is appropriate where the problem is with the integrity of the plan process,rather than that a claimant was denied benefits to which he was clearly entitled.elliott metro.life ins,cir brackets and quotation marks omitted.unlike in elliott,we find no need to remand this matter for additional consideration by lina because of our conclusion that cooper has clearly established that she is disabled under the plan.see kalish liberty mut.liberty life assurance,cir concluding that the appropriate remedy was an immediate award of benefits rather than a remand to allow the plan administrator to consider evidence that it had previously ignored.
we agree with the dissent that an award of disability for back pain should be based on objective medical evidence rather than on the claimant subjective complaints.but,as set forth in part above,the record in the present case clearly establishes that boehm,brown,and ford,three of cooper treating physicians,based their opinions on objective medical evidence.we are therefore puzzled by the dissent comments that the record does not does not show whether cooper treating physicians could point to objective medical evidence,as opposed to subjective complaints of pain from their client,that demonstrated a disabling condition op.at,and that an investigation might reveal that cooper treating physicians based their diagnoses solely on cooper own that lina need not credit.op.at 
the other major point made by the dissent is that cooper seemingly manipulated the administrative process by concealing a functional capacity evaluation fce that contradicted her disability claim.an examination of the record,however,offers at best equivocal support for this proposition.on march,lina filed a supplement to motion for judicial notice,to which it attached an fce performed on april.this fce was done at the behest of esis,a subsidiary of ace,in relation to cooper claim for workers compensation against ace.the fce itself reports that 
ms cooper gave a conditionally reliable effort,with of consistency measures within expected limits.there were significant objectively measured inconsistencies noted during lumbar range of motion,grip strength,and static strength testing.however,a breakdown in mechanics was observed during dynamic lift testing once her safe lifting limit was exceeded.
emphasis in original.
to be sure,the report concluded that the objectively measured inconsistencies were positive indicators for the likelihood of submaximal effort given during these tests.but the very next sentence stated that a breakdown in spine and lifting mechanics was noted during dynamic lift testing.the fce,in other words,does not flatly contradict cooper disability claim.
furthermore,in ace supplemental motion for judicial notice,filed contemporaneously with and adopting by reference lina supplement to motion for judicial notice relating to this same fce,ace conceded that 
a lthough counsel for ace was aware that cooper had undergone a functional capacity evaluation fce at some point,in relation to one of her myriad claims against ace or its affiliates or its insurers,counsel for ace was not able to determine which affiliate or insurer had requested such fce,for which particular claim the fce was performed,nor who had possession of the fce report until march.
emphasis added.what this concession reveals is that at least one of the defendants in the present case had this fce in its possession during the time that the administrative record was still open,but failed to place the document in the record.moreover,ace was aware of the fce and was,in fact,able to find and produce it,albeit after the administrative record closed.
neither ace nor lina offers any explanation for their failure to find and produce the fce in time to include it in the administrative record in the present case.instead,they contend that cooper withheld the information.but they do not,perhaps because they can not,explain how cooper withheld information that they already had.they offer absolutely no justification for reopening the record in order for them to include information that they were aware of and had in their possession for a period of close to two years prior to the motion for judicial notice.
in sum,we are of the opinion that this case is closer to kalish where this court directly awarded the claimant benefits than to elliott where this court remanded for further consideration because objective medical evidence supports the opinions of cooper treating physicians as well as the opinion of johnson,the social security administration examining physician.the contrary opinions of the reviewing physicians relied on by lina are not entitled to countervailing weight for the reasons set forth in part.above.
plan administrators should not be given two bites at the proverbial apple where the claimant is clearly entitled to disability benefits.they need to properly and fairly evaluate the claim the first time around otherwise they take the risk of not getting a second chance,except in cases where the adequacy of claimant proof is reasonably debatable.that is not the case here.
the evidence in the record demonstrates that cooper physicians never released her to work for more than two to three hours per day.there is no dispute that this was insufficient to fulfill the material duties of her job as a claims adjuster.given the plan definition of disability,the unequivocal treatment notes from cooper treating physicians and from johnson regarding cooper extensive physical limitations,and the deficient reports from lina file examiners,we conclude that cooper was entitled to ltd benefits as of october,the date on which her disability benefits ceased.see,glenn,at remanding for reinstatement of benefits retroactive to the date on which they were arbitrarily terminated kalish,at same.we of course recognize that the terms of the plan permit lina to require continued proof of cooper disability for benefits to continue.our opinion does not limit the applicability of that provision.
iii.conclusion 
for all of the reasons set forth above,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for entry of an order requiring lina to award benefits retroactive to the date on which cooper disability benefits ceased,and for such incidental relief as the district court may find appropriate in light of our decision.
the irregularities of the process prompt me to agree with the majority that lina denial of cooper request for benefits was arbitrary and capricious.yet it is precisely for that lina has yet to give cooper claim the procedural review it is i can not understand how the majority would grant the benefits itself rather than following the normal recourse remanding the case permitting lina to comply with these procedures and allowing the company to exercise its discretion over the awarding of benefits on a complete record.
first,in leapfrogging this process,the majority opinion is internally redundant,if not internally inconsistent.if the problem here is one of medical substance that the only conclusion one can draw from the record is that cooper is disabled,then it does not seem necessary for the majority to devote most of its opinion to matters of procedure that lina failed in several respects to give cooper claim proper review.if the medical evidence points in just one direction,why concern ourselves with lina procedural mistakes in generating that record and if lina procedural mistakes are as numerous as the majority points out they are,how can we draw conclusions about the medical evidence the more times lina lost its way in compiling this record,the more reasons we have to doubt the accuracy of that record.
second,while insurance companies and perhaps federal courts may readily handle some claims,this is not one of them.cases are notoriously hard to pin down hard for a claimant to connect her complaints of pain to medical evidence hard for a treating physician to explain how much of the diagnosis arises from objective evidence rather than from subjective complaints and hard for a reviewing physician to verify the truthfulness of a claimant complaints.all of this makes it particularly important for plan administrators to use a deliberate,principled reasoning process in reviewing benefits claims in this area,baker united mine workers of am.health ret.funds,cir both to allow the administrator to exercise its discretion in a meaningful way and to allow a medically untrained judiciary to exercise its limited review in a meaningful way.for precisely these reasons,when we find a problem with the integrity of the plan process in a claim of this type,elliott metro.life ins,cir internal brackets omitted,we ought to be doubly reluctant to don the white coats ourselves and say that the record permits just one medical conclusion.that is particularly true here where the district court judge who reviewed this case thought that,as a matter of substance and procedure,the benefits decision was not arbitrary and capricious.
third,consider the difficulties of saying that this record permits just one conclusion.it is one thing to say that lina doctors should have done more to support their decision it is quite another to say that this record left these same doctors with
