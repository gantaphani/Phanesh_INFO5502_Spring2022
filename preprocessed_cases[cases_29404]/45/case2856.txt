claimants leonard armato armato and liz stewart development design,lsd d,successor in interest to insured general contractor armato development,adi,applied in these proceedings,et for an order to show cause osc why golden eagle insurance company golden eagle should not pay expenses they incurred in resolving a third party action brought against them for construction defects.golden eagle insurance corporation geic,as third party claims administrator,appeals a judgment that grants the application in part we reverse the grant of relief.
background 
this case involves a southern california lawsuit filed in september against armato,lsd d adi successor in interest and others by two homeowners based on alleged construction defects in a residence adi had built beginning in late and sold to the plaintiffs in january newcombe et lott et.super.county,no.sc the lawsuit or newcombe lawsuit.
a commercial general liability cgl policy no.ccp was issued to adi by golden eagle effective december,and was canceled effective february,for nonpayment of premium.it describes adi business as real estate development and shows its mailing address as century park east,floor,los angeles.two policy conditions required adi,in the event of a claim or suit,to give golden eagle notice as soon as practicable and to c ooperate in the investigation,settlement or defense of the claim or suit the notice and cooperation clauses.a third condition provided that n o insureds will,except at their own cost,voluntarily make a payment,assume any obligation,or incur any expense,other than for first aid,without our consent a or nvp provision.
at issue are the effects of the notice,cooperation and nvp provisions given correspondence between the parties over a period of time in which armato settled the lawsuit without notice to,or participation by,geic.the facts are complicated by assertions by claimants and their trial counsel,robert owens also appellate counsel,that claimants never received some of the correspondence.in the end,the trial court held that the nvp provision barred claimants recovery of expenses but that the notice and cooperation provisions did not bar posttender expenses given that geic had also been at fault and had not met its burden,on the latter provisions,to show substantial prejudice.the court ordered the matter returned to geic to sort out which of claimants expenses might be barred as 
the newcombe lawsuit 
a first amended complaint filed september,the complaint in the newcombe lawsuit named various defendants,including the corporation lsd d as successor to adi,and individuals leonard armato as an attorney and liz stewart armato until dissolution of her marriage to armato as a real estate sales person for a codefendant real estate broker.while not specifically sued in that capacity,stewart was also a principal in her namesake corporation,lsd d,and the complaint did allege that she was a licensed general contractor.attorney owens of the firm owens gach ray represented stewart,lsd d,armato,management plus enterprises,and defendant ronald lott 
claims chronology 
we set out the claims events and correspondence in chronological order.
september.the complaint in the newcombe lawsuit is filed.no is filed,but in lieu of one,a separate action is filed date unstated against various subcontractors,only to be dismissed when it develops that virtually all of them were out of business,deceased,defunct or bankrupt.
october.over two years after the complaint,owens tenders the defense to geic by letter,identifying the policy and lsd d as adi successor corporation,and stating that the insured has just located the policy declarations page.he states that his firm has filed an answer,encloses copies of the complaint,answer and policy declarations page,asks for approval to be the insured counsel,and asks for immediate attention as time is of the essence since the court has set a trial date of january.
october.a letter from geic acknowledges receipt of the claim and notice of the lawsuit,advises that the matter will be investigated and asks that any documents about the matter be gathered in preparation for a meeting with the assigned examiner or investigator.oddly,the letter is addressed to adi,not the successor or owens,and uses the century park east address shown on the policy.
november.a letter from geic claims representative rodger hartnett to adi,again at adi policy address,acknowledges the tender again and asks that,in order to assist in the investigation and evaluation,adi provide the complaint,any naming subcontractors hired by adi,any subcontracts and documentation of the work done by adi,any other insurers,and any information on how complaints might relate to adi scope of work.the letter asks for prompt attention and advises that geic action is taken under a full reservation of rights.
november.hartnett sends two letters.one is again to adi,but at a beverly hills address unexplained by any party here on wetherly drive.it states that geic will be providing you with a full defense of this lawsuit but under a full reservation of rights,cautions that there may ultimately be only limited or perhaps no coverage,and sets out at some pages on very limited information provided to date how various policy provisions might affect coverage.
according to declarations by armato,stewart,owens and his law partner,none of the above letters of october,november referred to by them as dated november or november was received or seen by them at the time.
the second hartnett letter is to owens.it lacks any policy analysis and,oddly,does not mention the acceptance of tender made that same day in the letter to adi.one may infer,however,that hartnett had accepted the tender as to adi but was still unsure as to lsd d.he states as you are aware,geic previously acknowledged receipt of your tender of defense on behalf of our insured,adi,as well as lsd d,successor in interest to adi.included in that response was a request for additional information which has not as yet been provided.hartnett also asks for any documents reflecting the change in ownership or restructuring between adi and lsd d,and the names of any other insurers for either entity after the golden eagle policy.it closes,upon review and analysis of this information,we will be in a better position to respond to your request that we participate in this defense.
november.owens writes in response to the last letter asking that the referenced initial response and request for information be faxed to him immediately because he does not have one.as for the requested further information,owens states that documents about the entities if there are any will be provided forthwith and that he is currently unaware of any other insurance carriers.he closes,in apparent reference to the trial date,due to the extreme time constraints under which we are operating,your immediate response and assumption of the defense is imperative.
settlement agreement.there follows a gap in the correspondence,with hartnett giving no immediate response,presumably because of the successorship issue,and owens giving no information on the issue.during this time,owens negotiates and executes a settlement in the newcombe action without notifying geic and without having of warning of a january trial any settlement was in the works.from his declaration of not having received hartnett november letter to adi,we gather that owens was unaware that geic had accepted the tender as to adi.
a settlement agreement and mutual release,effective january,was signed on february by armato individually and as president of management plus enterprises and february by stewart.the document and related parts of the briefing are before us under seal,but the terms pertinent to the appeal issues do not require recital except as to claimants,particularly armato.a sum is to be paid by defendants,with no allocation specified,and plaintiffs in turn dismiss as to each defendant and transfer back title and ownership of the property to them by means of a grant deed to armato,the transfer to be treated as a rescission of the original contract of purchase.payment and transfer are made contingent on conditions precedent that armato get approval for a loan on the property secured by a first trust deed for about the alleged purchase price,armato obtain title insurance by the close of escrow,defendants get a court determination of good faith settlement,and armato take possession at the close of escrow.
as explained by armato in a declaration below,he was named as a defendant although he had no involvement or participation in the construction of the house.he hired the owens firm to defend himself,his former wife,stewart,and her companies and advanced over for legal services,primarily to defend my former wife and her companies he also spent funds to purchase the house,fix it up and resell it and,by his accounting,in the end advanced over.he claims the settlement structure allowed him to cap the defendants losses at an amount which is a mere fraction of the projected exposure.stewart declares that she was unable to afford the defense of herself or the companies lsd d and adi and that armato agreed to advance payment of their bills on her behalf 
february.hartnett,unaware of the settlement,reiterates that geic has already on requested information on the alleged succession so that lsd d would qualify as an insured under the policy issue to adi,but has so far received none.therefore,he advises,we are unable to provide a defense to elizabeth stuart sic development design.furthermore,since we have received no further correspondence from you,we assume that the january,sic trial date has been continued and we request the current status of this litigation.
february.owens,without disclosing the settlement or correcting hartnett assumption that the trial date was continued,replies that he had only said he would provide succession documents if there were any and that none had been located yet.he says he is still awaiting the he requested in his november letter and warns i assure you that lsd d is the successor and the continued bad faith delay by golden eagle in assuming the defense and indemnification of its insured is causing extreme hardship on your insured.guide yourselves accordingly.
february.in a letter,owens encloses a copy of a certificate amending the articles of incorporation to read that the name of the corporation was lsd d.he again requests defense and indemnification and advises for the first time,though without mention of a written agreement having been negotiated and signed,we are in the process of working out a settlement that will avoid a protracted,expensive trial,and your insured needs the assistance of its insurer,golden eagle.
april.in a second letter,owens complains of delay and reveals for the first time,y our insured had no choice but to settle with the plaintiffs.he asks geic to fund the settlement and to reimburse the substantial legal fees and costs that were incurred defending the case,threatening to sue if he gets no reply by the.
april.hartnett responds that,based on the documents provided and an analysis by coverage counsel glenn white,geic acknowledges its duty to defend and indemnify adi,including for the first time its operation under the name lsd d,all subject to the reservation of rights letter issued by our company on november,alluding evidently to the november letter addressed to adi.he says to look for a letter from white and asks that,since the case has now been settled,owens submit all documents about the lawsuit defense,including an analysis of the damages,all expert reports and all fees incurred by owens firm.after our review of these documents,he closes,we will discuss with you and our insured,golden eagle position with regard to reimbursement of those fees.
may.the los angeles superior court in the newcombe lawsuit issues a nunc pro tunc order for specific performance,rescinding a deed from armato to the newcombes and restoring title to armato.this is based on findings that all conditions precedent have occurred and that the parties had come to terms to resolve this case and placed on the record a resolution to that effect back in december.
june.responding to the april letter from hartnett,owens partner,linda gach ray,writes to hartnett successor,joe warren,detailing with attachments not in our record the alleged construction defects,damages estimates,expert reports and expenses.a confidential settlement agreement,gach ray adds,called for the defendants to repurchase the property from plaintiffs,repair the defects,and the property.the property has been acquired and repairs are being made.it is anticipated that the ultimate expense to the defendants in this settlement will be approximately.
july.white writes to gach ray saying he is coverage counsel for geic and is evaluating its obligations.he asks for the settlement documents.
july.gach ray prods white for action and to say she hopes that his phrase,evaluating its obligations,really meant evaluating the extent of the obligations.she says she is securing a release of the settlement documents from the parties.
august.gach ray writes to white,in response to an august letter from him evidently not in our record.she expresses chagrin at his mention that he had not found any communication requesting that golden eagle participate in the settlement and says geic own inaction or stonewalling in not acknowledging its duties back in november or december caused the lack of consultation.
september.white writes to gach ray,after a phone conversation that day,to say they had not yet received a copy of the settlement agreement and that upon receiving it,white would expedite a completion of our coverage analysis and provide her with golden eagle coverage conclusions.
september.a letter from gach ray to white states that white now has a copy of the settlement agreement and urges resolution.
october.gach ray prods again,responding to a voice mail message that white would be recommending a number to geic for its authorization.
october.white writes back golden eagle continues to evaluate your claim,leaving all of its options open.as i have repeatedly informed you,golden eagle has reserved its rights,and continues to reserve all of its rights with respect to your claim.a response to your tender will be provided shortly.his answer would take another eight months,with some communications apparently not in our record.
december.gach ray writes referring to white request for access to the litigation files,saying arrangements had been made to review them but that white had not done so yet.
january.gach ray again asks for geic position.she details her file history of communications and threatens bad faith litigation.
june.claimants have separate counsel and are no longer represented by owens gach ray.in a letter to new counsel for stewart robert hindin and armato howden fraser,white denies the claim and rejects any duty to defend or indemnify.he outlines the history and facts,concluding that claimants deprived geic of its rights to effectively defend the claim by failing to give timely notice of the claim,conducting a conflicted defense owens law firm having representing all defendants,and settling without giving geic an opportunity to participate.white cites breach of the policy notice,cooperation and nvp provisions.moreover,he writes,the settlement was not a covered settlement.it was an agreement between the parties to rescind the sale and purchase of the spec home in question.such a settlement to rescind a contract arguably does not involve covered damages under the golden eagle policy.specifically,golden eagle contends that the settlement does not involve a compromise of property damage or bodily injury claims,and concerns only contractual claims.white notifies claimants of their right to seek osc review.
osc proceedings 
application.claimants filed their application on june.against geic untimely notice basis for rejection,they argued that notification in october,two years after the lawsuit filing,was timely in the circumstances.stewart declared that,after the completion of the house in,she had gone through a separation and divorce and moved her residence and office.d espite a diligent search for all documentation regarding my insurance coverages,she explained without elaboration,she could not locate the policy until sometime in,whereupon she immediately turned it over to owens.on geic basis,claimants argued that they did not understand what geic meant by this but that there was nothing to it.on rescission not being a covered settlement term,claimants argued that this argument came too late and that,had geic taken this position right after tender of the claim,claimants would not have structured the settlement to include rescission an argument ignoring that notice of possible settlement was first given in february,long after the october tender and after the settlement terms had been drafted and signed.
on the basis,claimants argued that geic own actions and delays caused it.geic had sent its initial acceptance with reservations letter to an old address for adi,and if geic had reacted immediately to owens february,letter about working out a settlement,it would have had the opportunity to participate.this,again,did not confront that the agreement was already drawn up and signed by then but stressed various delays in geic responses.claimants also argued that geic was estopped,by its own actions and delays,from complaining about the lack of participation.
armato and stewart and counsel owens and gach ray each submitted supporting declarations discussed in part,ante,and armato submitted a accounting of his claimed expenses regarding the property.he explained that he settled the lawsuit after personally advancing over in legal expenses and after it became clear in,from the plaintiffs expert witnesses,that the plaintiffs were seeking in excess of.he sought indemnity for about,including he claimed as his total net expenses in the purchase,repair and resale of the property.
opposition.geic responded to each of the arguments and declarations,also submitting postapplication correspondence with owens showing that his firm had jointly represented claimants along with several other defendants and that no had been filed.on the timeliness of the claim notification,geic observed that even if stewart truly first discovered the policy in october,she never said she was unaware of golden eagle identity as her insurer before then.on the opportunity to participate in settlement,geic noted claimants failure to provide requested documents or keep geic advised of settlement talks.also,neither the settlement terms nor any evidence allowed an allocation of legal costs as between the several jointly represented of whom geic did not their respective liability exposures as sellers,realtors and developers,while geic liability related only to a period during early development.armato claim of potential exposure of was not corroborated,and since the sale of the house did not occur until january,long after the policy lapsed,it did not appear that any covered liability for bodily injury or property damage existed.further,the equitable relief of rescission secured under the settlement did not constitute covered property damage or bodily injury caused by an occurrence within the policy period.stewart declaration of armato having standing to pursue claims against geic as an assignee of lsd d was unsupported by any actual agreement and was suspect,in any event,because she declared that any proceeds were jointly payable to armato and lsd d see fn,ante.finally,geic was not estopped to rely on the policy breaches.claimants could not show any detrimental reliance,and geic had accepted tender under a full reservation of rights.geic had responded by requesting documents necessary to evaluate the claim,and claimants had not advised geic that they were preparing to settle the case or requested geic participation in that settlement.
reply.stewart had previously declared that,despite a diligent search for all documentation regarding her insurance coverages,it was not until that she was able to locate the policy now,to meet geic observation that she never denied knowing that golden eagle was adi insurer,she further declared that,before locating the policy,she had no specific or independent recollection that geic had been the insurer for adi or me in or about or 
geic argued,against the claimants view,that it had not waived any coverage defenses and stressed that claimants offered no argument but waiver against its position.further,the settlement was potentially collusive,and claimants had implicitly conceded that neither of them contributed any money toward it.
argument.a hearing on the application produced little clarification.owens,arguing for claimants,told the court that he did not know why he had not mentioned the settlement to geic before april but stressed that the settlement,with conditions for the retransfer of property,was signed but by no means a done deal in february.the court asked owens how lsd d had standing to seek reimbursement given that lsd d,the insured,paid nothing in the settlement,that only armato,a noninsured,incurred costs,and that no evidence of any reimbursement agreement had been presented.owens suggested that the advanced funds might have been taken into account in family law proceedings between stewart and armato.he offered to provide some further information or declarations along this line but ultimately never did.neither side conceded any issues,and the court took the matter under submission.
ruling.the court written order was filed weeks later,on december.it rested on conclusions about the notice,cooperation and nvp provisions.the court noted first that nvp provisions are generally enforceable to bar expenses regardless of prejudice to the insurer and that no exception arose in this case.thus,there was no duty to indemnify for expenses.it being unclear from armato declaration what part of the claimed costs and expenses might have been,the court ordered a remand for geic to make that determination.
turning then to the effect of the notice and cooperation provisions on posttender expenses,the court noted a burden of showing substantial prejudice and concluded that geic had not met that burden,thus leaving the provisions unenforceable.the prejudice conclusion rests on a sort of analysis.the court seemingly accepted arguable prejudice from the lateness of the tender and owens failure to advise of the settlement.on the other hand,the court found unexcusable the contradictory letters of november,in which geic accepted tender with reserved rights as to adi but not as to lsd d,and did not advise owens of the adi acceptance.also difficult to justify for the court was geic failure to take quick action on owens november request to respond immediately and assume the defense.thus,and despite owens failure to mention the settlement or disabuse hartnett of his assumption that a january trial date had been continued,golden eagle own conduct compounded any problems created by late notice and lack of full cooperation by the insured,and geic was not substantially prejudiced by failure of the insured to comply 
the only other issue reached in the order is geic objection,which the court,in footnote,construed as meaning that independent counsel should have been appointed under civil code section because of a conflict of interest between insured and insurer.the court reasoned that the issue never arose,meaning,it seems,that geic never actually undertook to defend the insured no mention is made of other issues,notably coverage,standing or estoppel.
geic filed timely notice of appeal on january.
discussion 
review standards 
in these special proceedings for an insurer in conservation,the actions of the commissioner are subject to judicial review,but not de novo review.the trial court reviews them under an abuse of discretion standard,asking if the action was arbitrary,unsupported by a rational basis,contrary to specific statute or discriminatory.we also test the action of the trial court by an abuse of discretion standard,employing the equivalent of the substantial evidence test by accepting the trial court resolution of credibility and conflicting substantial evidence,and its choice of possible reasonable inferences.in re executive life ins.th,d.thus our review of factual matters is highly deferential.while the court below issued a written ruling,these special proceedin
