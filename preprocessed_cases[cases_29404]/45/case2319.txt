a liability insurer agrees to defend its insured against a personal injury lawsuit.after the insurer refuses a settlement demand within the policy limits,the claimant and the insured,without the insurer participation,agree on a settlement.under the settlement agreement,a stipulated judgment in excess of the policy limits is entered,the claimant agrees not to execute the judgment against the insured,and the insured assigns to the claimant the insured cause of action for breach of the insurer duty to accept a reasonable settlement demand.the trial court approves the settlement as made in good faith pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
in a subsequent action by the claimant,as the insured assignee,against the insurer for breach of contract,is the amount of the stipulated judgment presumptively binding on the insurer as to the damages suffered by the insured as a result of the alleged contract breach we conclude it is not a defending insurer can not be bound to a settlement to which it has not agreed and in which it has not participated,even where the settlement has been approved under code of civil procedure section.in this circumstance,we further conclude,the claimant may not maintain an action for breach of the duty to settle because,in light of the settlement before trial and the covenant not to execute against the insured,the stipulated judgment is insufficient to prove that the insured suffered any damages from the insurer breach of its settlement duty.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which ordered judgment entered for the defendant insurer.
factual and procedural background 
victoria lee parker and vlp enterprises,collectively vlp,owned and operated a san diego franchise of great expectations creative management,great expectations,a dating service.maryland casualty company maryland issued to vlp two successive commercial insurance policies,each with a million policy limit.
in march,william hamilton,paula arnett,susan choate,thomas fort,yvonne kaut and others claimants or plaintiffs,clients of various great expectations franchises,filed a complaint in contra costa county superior court,naming as defendants great expectations,each of its franchises,and the owners of each franchise.claimants alleged the defendants had invaded the common law,constitutional,and statutory privacy rights of their clients and prospective clients by secretly recording,amplifying and broadcasting their confidential conversations.the complaint stated a proposed class made up of all persons who had been interviewed at any great expectations franchise.the complaint sought injunctive relief,statutory damages of the greater of per incident or three times each class member actual damages,and punitive damages.
vlp tendered the defense of the invasion of privacy claims against it to maryland,which accepted,retaining an attorney to represent vlp.in june,after overruling several demurrers to the complaint,the superior court appointed a special master for discovery and settlement matters.the master stayed all discovery and motions.
in june,claimants demanded million to settle with vlp.maryland refused to pay the demand,countering with an offer to settle for.after these negotiations produced no settlement,vlp,without maryland participation,entered into a september settlement agreement with claimants as part of a global settlement between claimants and all the defendants.under the terms of the global settlement,the defendants agreed to discontinue any further electronic eavesdropping on prospective clients.the great expectations franchisor agreed to provide,by and through its franchises,discount coupons to class members.some defendants and insurers,not including vlp or maryland,also contributed cash to an initial settlement fund of over million.vlp further agreed to have a stipulated judgment entered against it in the amount of million,and to assign to claimants any breach of contract claim it might have against maryland,in return for which claimants agreed not to execute the judgment against vlp.maryland neither approved nor opposed the settlement.
the special master recommended to the superior court that it approve the settlement,reporting his belief that it reasonably reflected claimants potential success and the defendants potential liability,was in the best interests of the class,and had been reached through arm length negotiation.the superior court thereafter certified a plaintiffs class,for purposes of settlement only,comprised of all individuals who had participated in a preliminary membership interview at one of the franchises.it confirmed the settlement as a good faith settlement,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,declaring it to be fair,reasonable,and in good faith,and entered judgment in favor of claimants and against vlp.
in december,claimants,as vlp assignees,instituted the present action against maryland,seeking damages for breach of the insurance contract on the theory that vlp was entitled to contractual damages from maryland for maryland failure to accept claimants settlement offers.
maryland moved for summary judgment,arguing that because it at all times was defending the action brought by claimants against its insured,its insured liability could not be fixed by agreement of the parties in the underlying case,but had to be determined by trial.absent either an actual trial or the insurer refusal to defend,a stipulated judgment,especially one coupled with a covenant not to enforce,could not be binding on the insurer.the superior court rejected maryland arguments and denied its motion for summary judgment.
claimants then filed a motion for summary judgment against maryland,arguing that the insurer had breached its contractual duties by failing to accept their offer to settle their claims against vlp for million and that the million stipulated judgment was presumptive evidence,which maryland had done nothing to rebut,of vlp damages from the breach.the trial court agreed there was no factual dispute as to maryland breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.without discussing damages or the presumptive force of the stipulated judgment,the court entered judgment in favor of claimants for million,plus prejudgment interest.maryland appealed from the judgment,including from the trial court denial of maryland own summary judgment motion.
the court of appeal reversed.an action for breach of the settlement duty can not be brought against a defending insurer,the court held,until a judgment after trial has been entered against the insured.only if the insurer has denied coverage or refused to defend may the insured recover the amount of a settlement made without the insurer participation.the action here was prematurely filed,according to the appellate court,in that it can not be determined if the failure to settle will cause actual injury to the insured until the defense has been completed and actual damage to the insured has been ascertained.the court concluded judgment should have been entered for maryland rather than for claimants,and so ordered.
we granted review on claimants petition.
discussion 
from the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by law in all contracts,and from the liability insurer duty to defend and indemnify covered claims,california courts have derived an implied duty on the part of the insurer to accept reasonable settlement demands on such claims within the policy limits.kransco american empire surplus lines ins.cal th,d.a n insurer is required to act in good faith in dealing with its insured.thus,in deciding whether or not to settle a claim,the insurer must take into account the interests of the insured,and when there is a great risk of recovery beyond the policy limits,a good faith consideration of the insured interests may require the insurer to settle the claim within the policy limits.an unreasonable refusal to settle may subject the insurer to liability for the entire amount of the judgment rendered against the insured,including any portion in excess of the policy limits.comunale traders general ins.cal d.safeco ins.superior court th,d safeco.though an action for the insurer breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing sounds in both contract and tort johansen california state auto.bureau cal d,we are concerned here only with liability for breach of contract,for that is the only cause of action vlp assigned to plaintiffs.

in this case,the underlying action did not proceed to trial.it was terminated by settlement,resulting in a stipulated judgment coupled with a covenant not to execute against the insured.the question is whether such a stipulated judgment may be treated as a presumptive measure of the damages the policyholder has suffered as a result of the insurer breach of contract.
plaintiffs maintain that a stipulated judgment,despite the covenant not to execute,creates a rebuttable presumption of the insured damages,at least where it has been confirmed as reached in good faith pursuant to code of civil procedure section.we disagree.as demonstrated below,where the insurer has accepted defense of the action,no trial has been held to determine the insured liability,and a covenant not to execute excuses the insured from bearing any actual liability from the stipulated judgment,the entry of a stipulated judgment is insufficient to show,even rebuttably,that the insured has been injured to any extent by the failure to settle,much less in the amount of the stipulated judgment.in these circumstances,the judgment provides no reliable basis to establish damages resulting from a refusal to settle,an essential element of plaintiffs cause of action.reichert general ins.cal d.
a line of appellate decisions,leading to the decision below in this case,has found that settlements reached without the consent or participation of the defending insurer,and incorporating a covenant not to execute or similar device,are entitled to no weight in a later action against the insurer for failure to settle.

the court in smith state farm mut.auto.ins.th,d smith followed doser on somewhat different facts.of two liability insurers potentially on the risk,one offered the insured a defense,while the other,state farm,declined to participate in the defense.the claimants and the insured settled the underlying case for,embodied in a stipulated judgment,the insured giving the claimants an assignment of all claims against state farm in exchange for a covenant not to execute the judgment against the insured.smith,supra,at,d.the appellate court saw no distinction between a stipulated judgment with covenant not to execute and the device employed in doser,supra,d.id.at,d.in the action for failure to defend,the stipulated figure bore no weight in the determination of damages.moreover,appellants have not stated a cause of action for recovering damages above policy limits of state farm insurance policy the stipulated judgment with covenant not to execute does not constitute an excess judgment within the meaning of comunale traders general ins,supra,cal d.smith,supra,at,fn,d.
most recently,in safeco,supra,th,d,one of the defending liability insurers having refused a settlement demand,the claimants and the insureds agreed to a stipulated judgment in the amount of to be paid by a settling insurer and the remainder by the insureds.the claimants,however,agreed not to execute on the remainder against the insureds,in exchange for the insureds assignment of their rights against the nonsettling insurer.id.at,d.
the safeco court,relying on smith and doser among other decisions,held that until a litigated excess judgment is obtained,safeco refusal to settle is not actionable.safeco,supra,th at,d.if the insurer declines to settle and decides to go to trial and then obtains a judgment below the settlement offer or obtains a complete defense verdict,then the insured would have no cause to complain,and the insurer would have no liability.until judgment is actually entered,the mere possibility or probability of an excess judgment does not render the refusal to settle actionable.id.at,d.
the instant court of appeal,relying on safeco and its predecessors,held that plaintiffs action here was premature,in that u ntil a judgment in excess of maryland policy has been entered against vlp,or vlp otherwise has suffered some actual injury as a result of the alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,the existence of actual damage to the insured can not be determined.
plaintiffs do not argue that doser,supra,d,smith,supra,th,d,and safeco,supra,th,d,were wrongly decided on their facts,but contend they are distinguishable because in none of those cases had the trial court in the underlying case determined under code of civil procedure section hereafter section that the settlement was made in good faith.plaintiffs cite roman unigard ins.group th,d roman,in which the court held that a stipulated judgment,coupled with a covenant not to execute but approved under section,satisfies the condition of a judgment or settlement of a claim needed before a valid assignment of a bad faith action may be made.the roman court distinguished smith as involving an apparently collusive settlement,a problem assertedly avoided through approval under section.roman,supra,at,d see also sanchez truck ins.exchange th,d same as to direct action,on stipulated judgment.
roman,however,is itself crucially distinguishable from the case at bench in roman,the insurer,denying coverage,had refused its client a defense.roman,supra,th at,d.as we have explained in previous cases,the denial of coverage and a defense entitles the policyholder to make a reasonable,noncollusive settlement without the insurer consent and to seek reimbursement for the settlement amount in an action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.w here the insurer has repudiated its obligation to defend,a defendant in the absence of fraud may,without forfeiture of his right to indemnity,settle with the plaintiff upon the best terms possible,taking a covenant not to execute.samson transamerica ins.cal d,quoting zander texaco,d.
in effect,when the insured tenders the suit,the carrier is receiving its chance to be heard.having rejected the opportunity and waived the chance to contest liability,it can not reach back for due process to void a deal the insured has entered to eliminate personal liability.note,assignments of rights and covenants not to execute in insurance litigation.thus,the policyholder denied a defense for covered claims by its liability insurer may make a reasonable settlement with the plaintiff,in good faith,and then maintain or assign an action against the insurer for breach of its defense duties.in such an action,a reasonable settlement made by the insured to terminate the underlying claim against him may be used as presumptive evidence of the insured liability on the underlying claim,and the amount of such liability.isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d,isaacson.
the roman court,therefore,correctly asked whether the stipulated judgment was the product of collusion roman,supra,th at,d,for absent such abuse a reasonable settlement presumptively shows the damages resulting from the insurer failure to defend.but where,as here,the insurer has accepted defense of the claim,and might have prevailed at trial had the insured and the claimants not settled without the insurer participation,no presumption of the insured liability generally arises from the fact or amount of settlement.isaacson,supra,cal d at.section approval may help to show the absence of collusion,but,collusion aside,we must ask whether approval of a stipulated judgment under section is sufficient to show,even presumptively,the existence and extent of the insured liability to the claimants.
we conclude that section approval can not transform an agreed judgment that,by covenant,the insured will never have to pay,into a determination of the existence and extent of the insured liability.the statutory effect of a good faith finding under section is to bar actions for contribution or indemnity by joint tortfeasors or not participating in the settlement,subd.c.the court,in making a good faith ruling,must attempt to determine whether the amount of the settlement is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor proportionate share of comparative liability for the plaintiff injuries,woodward clyde associates cal d.the purpose of a section hearing is thus to ensure fairness to absent tortfeasors,not fairness to the settling defendant insurer.
as the court of appeal below explained the settlement court primary concern is whether,assuming liability,the settling tortfeasor is paying less than its proportionate share of the plaintiff loss,and the evidence submitted by the parties is relevant to that question the concerns of the settling tortfeasor insurance company,however,are quite different.the insurer is concerned with whether its insured too easily is admitting liability,or is agreeing to pay more than its proportionate share of the plaintiff loss.the section hearing is not designed to test those questions.it follows that for purposes of a dispute between the settling tortfeasor and its insurance company,the evidentiary showing made at the section proceedings can not be a substitute for an actual trial.
true,the special master overseeing the settlement and good faith hearing in this case made certain findings suggesting the million stipulated judgment was not unreasonably high.for example,the master observed that the stipulated judgments involve the three franchises walnut creek,sacramento and san diego where plaintiffs evidence is the strongest and where the largest number of class members are likely to have been interviewed,and that the stipulated amounts are far lower than plaintiffs could potentially have won at trial.but while these remarks may help to show that the stipulated amounts were in a general sense reasonable in light of the franchisees exposure,they do not amount to judicial findings that the franchisees were actually liable in the amounts stipulated.no evidentiary hearing was held to determine vlp liability the settlement,of which the stipulated judgment,assignment and covenant not to execute were parts,was the product of negotiation,not factfinding.when the settlement was reached,discovery had long been stayed the evidence to which the special master referred consisted of hearsay statements in reports by plaintiffs investigators,rather than deposition testimony,answers to interrogatories or requests for admission.the master report reveals no specific support for the million stipulated judgment against vlp.of course,vlp never agreed to pay that settlement was premised,instead,on plaintiffs potential recovery from maryland in the present action.maryland neither accepted nor opposed the settlement and,given an opportunity,could not have realistically opposed the settlement without risking further liability for acting against the interest of its insured.
under these circumstances,we need not find the stipulated judgment collusive in order to refuse it any weight or effect in the present action.a defending insurer can not be bound by a settlement made without its participation and without any actual commitment on its insured part to pay the judgment,even where the settlement has been found to be in good faith for purposes of section.
isaacson,supra,cal d,upon which plaintiffs rely,is not to the contrary.in isaacson,the california insurance guarantee association ciga,having assumed the defense of a medical malpractice action in place of an insolvent liability insurer,refused the claimant settlement demand of ciga statutory liability limit.ultimately,ciga agreed to pay,and the insureds contributed to conclude the settlement.the insureds then sued ciga for reimbursement of the payment.id.at.
we held that ciga,like a private insurer,had a duty to accept a reasonable settlement demand,limited in ciga case to demands under the statutory ceiling.isaacson,supra,cal d at.if the isaacson plaintiffs were able to prove that ciga breached that duty in refusing the claimant demand,we further explained,they could then proceed to prove damages,based on the amount of the settlement they entered into.id.at.the settlement,however,created no presumption that the demand was reasonable id.at,and absent such a presumption we found the evidence insufficient to show ciga breach id.at.
isaacson indicates that when an insured,faced with the insurer unreasonable refusal to pay a settlement demand within the policy limits and exposed to potential personal liability substantially beyond the policy limits,actually contributes payment to conclude the settlement in which the insurer also participates,the insured may recover the amount of his or her payment from the insurer in an action for bad faith failure to settle.in those circumstances,a bad faith action may be brought by the insured,or the claimant as the insured assignee,despite the absence of a litigated excess judgment.accord,aguerre,american guarantee liability ins.th,d we conclude that an insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund,even though by definition there is no excess judgment where a case is settled smith,supra,th at,d assigned bad faith action must be premised on a judgment against the insured or,if we read the isaacson and continental casualty royal ins.d.decisions correctly,a payment by the insured in settlement of a claim.
isaacson does not hold or suggest,however,that an action for breach of the settlement duty may be brought or assigned where the insured has settled without the insurer participation for an amount in excess of the policy limits and av
