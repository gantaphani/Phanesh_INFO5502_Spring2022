background 
the voters of california passed proposition with the express intention to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices,to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace,to provide for an accountable insurance commissioner and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians,uncodified preamble,purpose,reprinted at historical and statutory notes,west ann.ed.foll,historical and statutory notes see state farm mutual automobile ins.garamendi cal th,d.in subdivision a of section of proposition,the voters provided that the act shall be liberally construed and applied in order to fully promote its underlying purposes.historical and statutory notes,supra,at.the voters further provided in subdivision b of section that t he provisions of this act shall not be amended by the legislature except to further its purposes.italics added.
proposition added section to the insurance code as enacted by the voters,subdivision a of section provides that rates and premiums for an automobile insurance policy shall be determined by application of the following factors,in decreasing order of importance the insured driving safety record the number of miles the insured drives annually the insured number of years of driving experience and such other factors as the commissioner may adopt by regulation that have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss,former subd.a.
the voters further provided in section,former subdivision a the regulations shall set forth the respective weight to be given each factor in determining automobile rates and premiums.notwithstanding any other provision of law,the use of any criterion without such approval shall constitute unfair discrimination.in subdivision b of section,the voters also provided for a good driver discount policy for applicants who met certain criteria,subd.b.
of particular interest to this case,the voters also provided,in subdivision c of section,that t he absence of prior automobile insurance coverage,in and of itself,shall not be a criterion for determining eligibility for a good driver discount policy,or generally for automobile rates,premiums,or insurability,subd.c,italics added.
in,the insurance commissioner adopted regulations that listed persistency as an optional rating factor for granting consumers discounts on automobile insurance premiums.see,tit,subd.d,register,july,donabedian mercury ins.th,d donabedian.the regulations as adopted,however,contained no definition of persistency.donabedian,supra,at,d.as a result,insurers employed different interpretations of that term.some insurers interpreted persistency to mean the number of years a customer has maintained insurance with his or her current insurer or affiliate.other insurers defined persistency more broadly to include the number of years a customer has maintained insurance with any insurer or affiliate.id.at,d see cal.of,initial statement of reasons.
in december,then insurance commissioner harry low determined that some insurers in the latter category may have impermissibly required consumers to provide evidence of prior insurance to show that the consumer was persistently covered by one insurer or another over time,to show he or she was previously insured,supra.commissioner low proposed to amend the insurance regulations to ensure that insurance carriers do not consider a consumer lack of prior insurance for determining eligibility for a good driver discount policy,or generally for automobile rates,premiums,or insurability.
commissioner low proposed to do so under the power conferred by section,subdivision e,authorizing him to adopt regulations to implement section.commissioner low announced that certain modifications to the use of persistency as an optional rating factor were necessary to effectively prevent the use of prior insurance for the assignment of automobile rates,premiums or insurability,supra.accordingly,commissioner low proposed to amend existing automobile insurance regulations to require each insurer to consider only the length of time a consumer has been continuously covered with the present insurer company when using persistency as an optional rating factor,italics added.
in august,commissioner low adopted the proposed regulation,allowing persistency discounts only for the currently insured of the insurer or affiliate,but not for customers of unaffiliated insurers,tit,subd.d a,b,d,register.such regulation provides that a n insurer shall not apply a persistency credit for a new policy issued to an individual,unless that individual is currently insured.nor shall any insurer apply persistency,at any time,when based in whole or in part upon automobile insurance coverage provided by a insurer,subd.d b,italics added.
in,however,the legislature passed bill as an urgency measure to override the insurance commissioner new regulation restricting the use of persistency as an optional rating factor.bill purports to amend section to allow insurers to give persistency discounts to drivers previously insured with any insurer.subdivision c of section declares that the legislature finds and declares that it furthers the purpose of proposition to encourage competition among carriers so that coverage overall will be priced competitively.stats,ch.with limited exceptions,the legislative amendment allows insurers to make persistency discounts to the previously insured while denying such discounts to other applicants solely because they were previously uninsured.
the issue presented in this case is whether bill is unlawful under proposition because it necessarily uses the absence of prior insurance,in and of itself,subd.c,as a criterion in setting rates and premiums.the trial court below found section,subdivision c to be ambiguous and that the insurance commissioner interpretation of that section in the adopted regulation is entitled to some deference.we agree and hold that bill is facially invalid because it does not further the purposes of and undermines one of the major purposes of proposition,and it arrogates to the legislature the insurance commissioner exclusive authority to adopt optional rating factors,contrary to proposition.
facts and procedural history 
the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights,consumers union of,southern christian leadership conference of greater los angeles and national council of la raza petitioners brought a challenge to bill against commissioner garamendi and the state of california state.the petition and complaint alleged that bill is an invalid and unconstitutional amendment of proposition because it thwarts rather than furthers the initiative purposes,in violation of article ii,section,subdivision c of the california constitution and section,subdivision b of proposition.petitioners requested a writ of mandate prohibiting defendants from implementing or enforcing bill.they also sought declaratory and injunctive relief on the same basis.
the state answered,requesting the court to deny the petition for writ of mandamus and to declare bill a valid amendment to proposition.commissioner garamendi,however,joined with petitioners in asserting the legislative amendment is invalid under proposition.appellants mercury insurance group mercury and association of california insurance companies acic intervened in support of bill.respondent sam donabedian intervened in opposition to bill 
after considering extensive briefing and argument,superior court judge dzintra janavs found bill to be in conflict with the provisions of section,subdivision a,which entrusts and empowers the insurance commissioner to promulgate optional rating factors by regulation,and section,subdivision c,which prohibits the absence of insurance in and of itself to be used as a rating factor for automobile insurance.the trial court reasoned that because section,subdivision c was ambiguous,the insurance commissioner interpretation of that section should be accorded deference.the court determined that regulation,subdivision d constituted the most recent and thorough interpretation expressed by the insurance commissioner and such regulation should be accorded deference over other types of expression under yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,yamaha.see,tit,subd.d b.
the trial court found that the legislature,in enacting bill,had identified only a single purpose,competition.however,amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d,amwest held that proposition replaced the adam smith free marketplace type of system for setting rates with a strictly regulated one.in the court view,by focusing on competition alone,the legislature had ignored the other purposes set forth in proposition as well as existing case law.
accordingly,the trial court ruled that bill and its amendments to section,subdivision c are invalid and unconstitutional because they do not further proposition purposes and exceed the limited power to amend proposition which the voters granted to the legislature in section b of proposition,pursuant to article ii,section c of the california constitution.
the trial court entered a judgment granting the petition for writ of mandamus and issued peremptory writs of mandate directed to the insurance commissioner and the state.the court enjoined the insurance commissioner and the state from utilizing,enforcing or attempting to enforce bill 
the state,acic and mercury timely appealed from the judgment.
standard of review 
article ii,section,subdivision c of the california constitution provides that t he legislature may amend or repeal an initiative statute by another statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors unless the initiative statute permits amendment or repeal without their approval.italics added.the constitutional limitation on the legislature power to amend initiative statutes is designed to protect the people initiative powers by precluding the legislature from undoing what the people have done,without the electorate consent.citations.proposition enforcement project quackenbush th,d project.
the power vested in the voters to decide whether the legislature can amend or repeal initiative statutes is absolute and includes the power to enable legislative amendment subject to conditions attached by the voters.citation.citation.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.proposition specifically provides the provisions of this act shall not be amended by the legislature except to further its purposes,subd.b see historical and statutory notes,west.code,supra,at,italics added.the voters thereby made the legislature authority to amend proposition subject to the condition that any amendment must further the purposes of proposition.
we are guided by certain generally established principles.the determination of whether a program at issue serves a public purpose is generally vested in the legislature.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.though not binding on the courts,legislative findings are given great weight and will be upheld unless they are found to be unreasonable and arbitrary.ibid.we must also enforce our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.ibid.we presume the constitutionality of a legislative act,resolving all doubts in favor of the act,and must uphold the act unless a conflict with a provision of the state or federal constitution is clear and unquestionable.ibid.because legislative power is practically absolute,constitutional limitations on legislative power are strictly construed and may not be given effect as against the general power of the legislature,unless such limitations clearly inhibit the act in question.id.at,d.
applying these principles to proposition,the parties do not dispute that the legislature lacks the authority to amend the initiative under section b except to further the purposes of the initiative.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.although that limitation on the legislature power must be strictly construed,it also must be given the effect the voters intended it to have.id.at,d.adoption of a deferential standard of review might cause the drafters of future initiatives to withhold authority to amend those initiatives from the legislature completely,a result that would diminish both the initiative and the legislative processes.id.at,d.
in line with amwest,starting with the presumption that the legislature acted within its authority,we shall uphold the validity of bill if,by any reasonable construction,it can be said that the statute furthers the purposes of proposition amwest,supra,cal th at,d,unless the limitation imposed by section,subdivision b of proposition clearly inhibits bill amwest,at,d.

the issue before us,as in amwest,is whether the legislature exceeded its authority in enacting bill to amend section.amwest,supra,cal th at,d.
discussion 
two prior attempts by the legislature to amend proposition have been invalidated by the courts because they did not further the purposes of the initiative,as section,subdivision b requires.amwest,supra,cal th at,d,purposes of not furthered by exempting surety insurance project,supra,th at,d purposes of not furthered by reducing insurers obligation to refund excess premiums.
we hold that bill does not further the purposes of proposition and hence is invalid exercise of the power granted the legislature by the initiative.bill also is an improper infringement upon the insurance commissioner power to regulate rates and premiums granted by the voters.
bill does not further the purposes of proposition,and therefore its enactment was an act beyond the legislature powers 
as enacted by the voters,one of the fundamental purposes of proposition was the elimination of discrimination against previously uninsured drivers and the promotion of fair,available,and affordable automobile insurance so that the previously uninsured could enter the ranks of the insured.specifically,subdivision c of section provides that the absence of prior automobile insurance coverage,in and of itself,shall not be a criterion for determining eligibility for a good driver discount policy,or generally for automobile rates,premiums,or insurability.bill facially conflicts with that provision by adding the proviso that an insurer may use persistency of automobile insurance coverage with the insurer,an affiliate,or another insurer as an optional rating factor,subd.c,italics added.
by allowing insurers to grant a discount on the basis of whether an applicant was previously insured by any insurer,bill in effect excludes only the previously uninsured from the benefit of the discount.based on the showing below,bill would permit insurers to surcharge previously uninsured drivers to fund discounts for drivers with prior or persistent insurance.whereas the voters had prohibited insurers from using the absence of prior insurance coverage as a premium criterion to promote fairness for previously uninsured drivers now required to purchase insurance under california law,bill authorizes insurers to use that criterion to determine whether a policyholder premium will be discounted or surcharged.
the evidence before the trial court showed the disproportionate impact of bill on the previously uninsured 
in the court below,the insurance commissioner proffered the declaration of eric johnson,an actuary with the california department of insurance,who explained the principle of revenue neutrality as respects the persistency of automobile insurance coverage with the insurer,an affiliate,or another insurer under bill.johnson opined that,f rom an actuarial perspective,there is no difference between the absence of prior automobile insurance coverage as set forth in proposition and the lack of persistency of automobile insurance coverage with the insurer,an affiliate,or another insurer as set forth in bill.specifically,b oth of these phrases identically divide a pool of possible policyholders into two groups.if an insurer assigns a persistency discount,based upon the policyholder previous coverage,or lack of coverage,with another insurer,then the insurer will be using the absence of prior insurance to determine automobile rates for those policyholders that lack prior insurance.
under the principle of revenue neutrality,johnson stated,w hen a particular policyholder represents a greater or lesser risk for purposes of insurance,this greater or lesser risk may be captured mathematically through the application of the rating factors to the particular policyholder.the premiums for policyholders who,because of their characteristics,do not qualify for a particular discount must be surcharged in an amount equal to the total of the discounts given to the policyholders that qualified for the discount.italics added.
johnson illustrated that principle as follows assume that there is a hypothetical insurer with policyholders.assume,further,that of the policyholders qualify for a particular discount while the other do not,due to the manner in which each policyholder characteristics affect the influence of a particular rating factor.assume that the insurer must collect in total premium to cover the losses and expenses of the pool of policyholders,while still making a reasonable profit.if every policyholder had the same characteristics,each policyholder could be charged the base rate of,and this would guarantee that the insurer will collect.x policyholders.if one assumes,however,that policyholders in the pool have five years of continuous insurance and thereby receive a percent discount,the insurer will only collect from each of the policyholders,or a total of from the policyholders.
according to johnson,because insurance is a zero sum system,under his illustration the insurer still must collect a total of from its policyholders to cover the losses and expenses of the pool of policyholders.the insurer therefore must collect from the remaining policyholders who did not qualify for the continuous insurance discount.assuming each of the remaining policyholders has the same characteristics and there are no other rating factors,then each will be charged policyholders x.this would result in a surcharge equal to a percent increase in premium for the policyholders who do not qualify for the continuous insurance discount.the greater the proportion of policyholders that receive the discount,the greater the surcharge will be for the policyholders that do not receive the discount.
in the example given,according to johnson,because four times as many policyholders receive the discount as receive the surcharge policyholders,the surcharge must be four times as great as the discount.
the trial court also received further evidence from robert hunter who concurred with johnson that actuarially there is no difference between the absence of prior automobile insurance coverage and the lack of persistency of automobile insurance coverage with another insurer.
hunter further noted if insureds representing one half of the premium get a percent discount,the base rate must be raised by percent for all insureds for the statewide rate level to be achieved.those with no discount will pay percent more than they would have had the discount not been offered and those with a percent discount will actually only save percent.it is clear that those with no prior insurance pay a surcharge under bill because they have no prior insurance.
hunter observed that t he cost of insurance is a key factor in why people drive without insurance.the size of the uninsured market will vary based upon the entry fee,premium charged to a driver considering entering the insurance system to the extent that those without prior insurance from another insurer must pay they make up for lost revenue from the statewide rate level because of the discounts to those with prior insurance from another insurer,the number of uninsureds becoming insured will be adversely affected.this will also mean,therefore,that insured drivers will pay more,through increased rates for their coverage,compared to what the premium would be if there were fewer uninsured motorists because were not surcharged.
hunter also cited a department of insurance study showing that percent of uninsured motorists are good drivers under proposition,only percent had any tickets,percent were employed either full time or part time,percent were unemployed but looking for work,percent of those reporting income had incomes under per year and percent were hispanic,black,asian or multicultural.cal.department of insurance,california uninsured.
proposition elimination of competition as a fundamental purpose 
in his concurring opinion in king meese,justice broussard noted two practices were widespread in the insurance industry prior to proposition passage prohibitively high insurance rates for the previously uninsured driver,and the exclusion of uninsured drivers from the insurance market altogether simply because they were not previously insured.see king meese cal d,conc.opn.of broussard.such practices arbitrarily penalized uninsured motorists,leaving many unable to comply with california mandatory insurance laws.see id.at.
in subdivision c of section,the voters extended special protection to such drivers by providing that the absence of prior insurance,in and of itself,does not warrant such unfair discrimination.proposition addressed the uninsured motorist issue by expressly forbidding insurers from employing the absence of prior automobile insurance coverage as a criterion for qualification for the good driver discount or for rates,premiums or insurability.section of proposition specifically finds that e normous increases in the cost of insurance have made it both unaffordable and unavailable to millions of californians.see historical and statutory notes,west.code,supra,at.the voters proclaimed that t he existing laws inadequately protect consumers and allow insurance companies to charge excessive,unjustified and arbitrary rates,and,t herefore,the people of california declare that insurance reform is necessary.ibid.
the relevant question here is whether bill furthers the purposes of proposition underlying subdivision c of section to protect a specific group of drivers those without prior automobile insurance coverage from insurers arbitrary practices and to prohibit the use of absence of prior automobile insurance,in and of itself,as a rating factor.bill does not further those purposes but rather by definition authorizes a discount only to drivers with a history of continuous,or virtually continuous,insurance coverage.mercury concedes that uninsured persons will always be excluded from the premium discount that bill rating factor accomplishes.this runs contrary to the declared purposes of proposition and contravenes the voters directive against insurance rates that are excessive,inadequate or unfairly discriminatory,subd.a.
mercury argues that no case has held eliminating discrimination against the previously uninsured is a purpose of proposition.however,the plain meaning of section,subdivision c prohibits insurers from using the absence of prior insurance,in and of itself,as a criterion in determining eligibility for the good driver discount or generally for automobile rates,premiums,or insurability.donabedian,supra,th at,d.in prohibiting use of the absence of prior insurance to discriminate against the uninsured,section,subdivision c itself manifests the voters intent to eliminate such discrimination.the voters,moreover,enacted proposition to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices and to ensure that insurance is fair,available,and affordable for all californians,see historical and statutory notes,west.code,supra,at.by specifically focusing on eliminating discrimination against the previously uninsured in section,subdivision c,the voters made clear that a fundamental purpose of proposition is to include and extend
