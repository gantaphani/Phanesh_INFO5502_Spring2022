mark weinberger maintained a prosperous ear,nose,and throat practice commonly called ent by people whose first loyalty is not to tolkien in merrillville,indiana.unfortunately,that was not enough for him he supplemented his income by using his practice to defraud numerous insurance companies of millions of dollars.in september,while vacationing with his wife in greece,weinberger went for a run and did not come back.at the time,it seemed that weinberger had no intention of returning to the united states,in all likelihood because he was facing million in creditor claims and criminal counts of billing fraud upon his return.the government took various steps,including having an international arrest warrant issued,to locate weinberger.the parties have informed us that weinberger was arrested in italy in december,he has been extradited to the united states,and he is now facing health care fraud charges in the northern district of indiana.these facts,however,are of only peripheral concern to us for the present case.
criminal charges are not the only allegations pending against weinberger.he is also facing more than medical malpractice claims,most of which were filed after his disappearance.these claims have been proceeding through indiana medical malpractice process.weinberger medical malpractice insurance carrier,the medical assurance company,medical assurance,has been conducting his defense,but weinberger disappearance prompted it to file this suit.the insurance contracts between medical assurance and weinberger include a typical cooperation clause,which requires weinberger to participate in his defense.needless to say,weinberger was not cooperating during his extensive european vacation.frustrated,medical assurance brought a declaratory judgment action in federal court in indiana asking the court to declare that weinberger breached his responsibilities under the contract and therefore medical assurance no longer has a duty to defend or indemnify him.
the district court was concerned that such a declaration would intrude too severely on the state medical malpractice actions.it thought that medical assurance could not show that weinberger lack of cooperation was prejudicing the company without improperly interfering with the state cases.it therefore decided to refrain from going forward pending the resolution of the state court proceedings,and it issued a stay of the federal proceedings.in this appeal,medical assurance argues that the court erred in doing so and that it should have proceeded to resolve the merits of the declaratory judgment action.we conclude that medical assurance is correct.although district courts enjoy some discretion over requests for declaratory judgments,that discretion is not unlimited.we therefore remand this case to the district court with instructions to lift the stay and to proceed to the merits.in so doing,the court will be able to take into account weinberger return to indiana and any other pertinent developments.
before turning to the specifics of the appeal,we review the more prosaic facts that led to this litigation.over the years,weinberger saw hundreds of patients,and not all of them were happy with the care they received.in june,dissatisfied customers filed the first relevant medical malpractice claims.as mentioned above,weinberger vanished in september by then,only three cases had been filed.after his disappearance became public,however,the number of malpractice claims ballooned to more than.
indiana medical malpractice insurance system is governed by statute.in,indiana adopted a comprehensive system to regulate medical malpractice insurance and claims.see to.the medical malpractice act the act offers certain benefits,including a limitation on liability,to qualified providers who meet requirements,such as holding malpractice insurance above prescribed levels.qualified providers contribute funds to the indiana patient compensation fund pcf,which is then available to pay any damages over the statutory threshold,as well as damages that the doctor and his insurance provider fail to pay.see id.as the payor of last resort,pcf has an interest in this case it is represented by the defendant commissioner of the indiana department of insurance and administrator of the pcf an office that was held by james atterholt at the time suit was filed,but that is now filled by carol refer simply to the commissioner.
the act also introduced a new procedural mechanism for medical malpractice claims.in brief,it provides that a medical review pan el must issue an opinion on every medical malpractice claim before that claim may be pursued in indiana courts.id.complaints are filed with the indiana department of insurance idoi and,after days,any party may request the formation of a medical review pan el,which is made up of three independent volunteer physicians.id.the pan el issues an opinion on the merits,the doctor compliance with the standard of care,causation,damages.id.the pan el decision is not binding,but it is admissible as evidence in the state court action.id.
we are aware of only four cases in which medical review panels have rendered opinions on claims against weinberger three concluded that damages should not be available,and one found substandard care and nonpermanent injuries.only those four cases have moved from the stage to an actual lawsuit in state courts.none of the cases has proceeded to judgment.weinberger absence from the country for more than five years already has had consequences in these cases as a result of his failure to cooperate with the medical review pan el process,the lake county superior court entered an order in prohibiting him from testifying in the medical review pan el proceedings or in the subsequent state court trial proceedings.as far as the record before us shows,its order applies to at least of the pending claims.
between and,medical assurance provided professional liability insurance coverage to weinberger and his businesses under various policies.the contractual provisions relevant to this appeal are the same in all of the policies.they provide that medical assurance has a duty to defend and indemnify weinberger,but medical assurance is relieved of those duties if weinberger violates the policy cooperation clause,which is found in paragraph of the general conditions and requirements for each policy and reads as follows in relevant part 
the insured must fully cooperate with medical assurance and defense counsel in the investigation,handling,and defense of the legal proceeding.the insured duty to cooperate includes,but is not limited to 
when requested,attendance at and preparation for meetings,hearings,depositions,and trials 
securing and providing evidence and assisting in obtaining the attendance of witnesses 
truthfully and completely informing medical assurance about the facts and circumstances which surround any professional incident or legal proceeding and,specifically,the nature of the insured acts or omissions,so that medical assurance may correctly assess liability 
supplementing the information previously provided to medical assurance or defense counsel as additional information becomes known to the insured.
this clause underlies medical assurance request for declaratory relief.we turn now to the procedural history of that claim in its federal court action.
pronational insurance company pronational filed the original complaint in this case on august.on november,medical assurance,an affiliate of pronational,filed an amended complaint in its own name.medical assurance is an alabama corporation with its principal place of business in alabama.it named as defendants the more than claimants in the indiana medical malpractice proceedings,the commissioner,weinberger himself a citizen of illinois,and four entity defendants through which weinberger practiced mark weinberger,md,pc an indiana professional corporation with its principal place of business in merrillville,indiana plus three limited liability nose and sinus center,llc,the merrillville center for advanced surgery,llc,and the subspecialty centers of america,of which had weinberger as their sole member and were thus illinois citizens.we refer to weinberger and the entity defendants collectively as the weinberger defendants.
medical assurance amended complaint asks the court to issue the following declaratory judgment we quote here from the document 
that weinberger has failed and refused to assist cooperate with the defense of the claims meaning the individual malpractice claims 
that weinberger failure to assist and cooperate in the defense of the claims constitutes a material breach of the contracts of insurance between the weinberger defendants and medical assurance 
that medical assurance has been prejudiced by weinberger failure and refusal to assist cooperate with the defense of the claims 
that medical assurance is under no obligation to defend the claims on behalf of any of the weinberger defendants 
that medical assurance is under no obligation to pay any judgments,damages,costs or expenses which are associated with or arise out of the claims,or to indemnify the weinberger defendants for any such amounts 
medical assurance owes no defense or coverage under the policies in connection with the claims alleged by one of two named claimants,or any other claimants who have asserted claims,pursuant to the coverage exclusion contained in the policies for such claims.
for our purposes,it is possible to carve out a couple of issues that are not central to this appeal.first is the request based on the fraud exclusion,which medical assurance did not mention in this court.second is the point,which will not be ripe until liability has been established.see lear johnson holdings,cir collecting cases and applying this rule to a declaratory judgment action.the district court was aware that the claim was not ripe,but rather than dismiss that aspect of the case,it included it in the stay that was issued.the proper disposition,however,would have been to dismiss.see nationwide ins.zavalis,cir.
this appeal therefore focuses only on medical assurance claim.before the completion of discovery and the hearing of summary judgment motions,the commissioner asked the district court to stay the declaratory judgment action until the state proceedings resolved the underlying liability issues.at the direction of the district court,a magistrate judge heard arguments and recommended a stay.the district court accepted that recommendation and granted the motion to stay,finding that comity and judicial economy supported the suspension of the federal court case until the parallel state proceedings resolved the overlapping factual issues.
before turning to the merits,we need to resolve two jurisdictional issues.first,the claimant defendants suggest that the district court may lack jurisdiction over the case.medical assurance alleged jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship,a.the question is whether the plaintiff demonstrated that the parties are of diverse citizenship no one contests the existence of more than in controversy.
the district court found,and the record supports the proposition,that medical assurance is a citizen of alabama,since it is an alabama corporation with its principal place of business in alabama.medical assurance specifically alleged the citizenship of each defendant we have reviewed those allegations above.the only problem comes because the individual defendants,who are pressing malpractice claims,were described in both the original and amended complaints on information and belief as citizens of indiana.no defendant asserted that she is a citizen of alabama.on that basis,the district court concluded that u nless and until a defendant comes forward with such evidence,the court will not further consider the notice of jurisdictional defect.
a n appellant naked declaration that there is diversity of citizenship is never sufficient.thomas guardsmark,llc,cir.although we have said that affidavits alleging citizenship based on the best of my knowledge and belief are,by themselves,insufficient to show citizenship in a diversity case,america best inns,best inns of abilene,cir,the plaintiff here offered more than that.medical assurance alleged a particular state of citizenship of each claimant,indiana,or perhaps illinois each claimant is pursuing relief under the indiana medical malpractice system and the are in the best position to furnish evidence of their declined the opportunity to challenge the factual basis of medical assurance allegation.weinberger has not participated in any of these proceedings,and thus has not proffered any evidence contradicting the position of medical assurance that the claimants are all citizens of indiana or that none is a citizen of alabama.this is enough for now obviously,if information to the contrary emerges on remand,the district court must stand ready to its jurisdiction.
second,defendants challenge appellate jurisdiction.the district court decision to stay its proceedings is not one of the interlocutory orders that falls within.if it is appealable at all,it must be because it is authorized by the statute.the closest analogy to a stay of a action is a straightforward stay when a district court decides to abstain.stay orders are immediately appealable under quackenbush allstate ins.see,montano city of chicago,cir doctor assocs.duree,cir.the district court was quite aware of its discretion under the declaratory judgment act,see brillhart excess ins.of,wilton seven falls.it nevertheless labeled its decision to stay its proceedings as a form of abstention.in so doing,it emphasized the question whether the indiana malpractice claims covered essentially the same ground as the federal case or as the court put it,were parallel to the declaratory judgment action.concluding that the answer was yes,it stayed the entire action.whether or not the term abstention is optimal question that we address conclude that the district court stay is the kind of order that the supreme court had in mind in quackenbush,and so we conclude that our appellate jurisdiction is secure.
the declaratory judgment device has been around for a little less than a century in the united states.in,the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws and the american bar association published the uniform declaratory judgments act,which was to be a model state law.unif.declaratory judgments act,et.twelve years later,congress adopted the federal declaratory judgment act.the key language in the statute provides in a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction any court of the united states,upon the filing of an appropriate pleading,may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,whether or not further relief is or could be sought.id.a.
in a sense,the declaratory judgment act is relatively modest it is a procedural innovation that does not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts.it does not,and arguably could not,affect the underlying substantive state and federal laws that define the rights of the parties.see,aetna life ins.haworth,u.affirming the constitutionality of the act,provided that the court has jurisdiction over an actual case or controversy nashville,chattanooga,louis ry.wallace,applying the same limitation to the supreme court review of a tennessee decision based on the state declaratory judgment act.a federal court applying the declaratory judgment act must evaluate the parties rights based on the same body of substantive law that would apply in a conventional action.
the goal of the declaratory judgment act is to allow for the efficient resolution of disputes by an early adjudication of the rights of the parties.see,edelmann specialty,cir it was the congressional intent to avoid accrual of avoidable damages to one not certain of his rights and to afford him an early adjudication without waiting until his adversary should see fit to begin suit,after damage had accrued.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure ed.the remedy made available by the declaratory judgment act relieves potential defendants from the damoclean threat of impending litigation which a harassing adversary might brandish,while initiating suit at his never.it permits actual controversies to be settle
