health and safety code section generally requires health care service plans to pay for emergency medical care rendered to their enrollees,regardless of whether the provider rendering the services has contracted with the plan.subdivision e of that section provides,a health care service plan may delegate the responsibilities enumerated in this section to the plan contracting medical providers.here we conclude that a health care service plan is not statutorily obligated to pay for emergency services when it has delegated its payment responsibilities to a contracting medical provider that becomes insolvent and is unable to pay.it may,however,be liable to pay for emergency services when it has acted negligently in delegating its payment responsibilities.
facts and procedural history 
according to allegations in its first amended complaint,plaintiff and appellant melvin ochs,medical corporation ochs,is a professional corporation that provides emergency room services at scripps memorial hospital in chula vista,california.defendants and respondents pacificare of california and pacificare of california dba secure horizons collectively pacificare are health care service plans licensed by the state of california under the health care services plan act act et.
health care service plans such as pacificare do not actually provide medical services and generally contract for such services with intermediaries such as medical groups and independent practice associations.pacificare contracted with the independent practice association family health network fhn to provide health care services to its enrollees who chose fhn as their medical provider.some of these enrollees live in the vicinity of scripps memorial hospital and rely upon ochs for emergency services.ochs does not have a contract with either pacificare or fhn to provide medical care to their enrollees,but emergency care providers are required by both state and federal law to provide emergency services without regard for a patient ability to pay.
the contract between pacificare and fhn purports to delegate pacificare responsibility for providing medical services to fhn.ochs provided emergency services to pacificare enrollees covered by fhn and submitted the bills for those services to fhn,but fhn has declared bankruptcy and is unable to pay those bills.ochs sought payment from pacificare directly,which has declined to pay the bills on the ground that it is not financially responsible for services delegated to fhn.
ochs filed suit against pacificare,alleging causes of action for statutory violations of the act,unfair business practices,negligence,declaratory and injunctive relief regarding pacificare continuing obligation to pay for emergency services provided to enrollees,common counts for services rendered,quantum meruit,breach of contract as a third party beneficiary,and declaratory relief regarding ochs right to directly bill patients.pacificare filed a demurrer to ochs first amended complaint,arguing that it had delegated its responsibilities to fhn and was not obligated to pay for noncontract emergency services provided to enrollees who had selected fhn as their medical care provider.the trial court agreed,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and entered a final judgment of dismissal.ochs appeals.

statutory violations of act 
section is the portion of the act governing compensation for emergency care services.subdivision b of that statute requires health care service plans to pay for emergency care rendered to their enrollees regardless of whether the emergency care provider is under contract with the plan a health care service plan shall reimburse providers for emergency services and care provided to its enrollees,until the care results in the stabilization of the enrollee as long as federal or state law requires that emergency services and care be provided without first questioning the patient ability to pay,a health care service plan shall not require a provider to obtain authorization prior to the provision of emergency services and care necessary to stabilize the enrollee emergency medical condition.subdivision e provides,a health care service plan may delegate the responsibilities enumerated in this section to the plan contracting medical providers.
in its second cause of action for statutory violations,ochs contends that pacificare had a mandatory duty to pay for emergency services provided to pacificare enrollees under section,subdivision b.ochs also argues that under sections and,subdivision f,pacificare duty to pay for services can not be waived.pacificare responds that its delegation of its duties to fhn under section,subdivision e absolved it of financial responsibility for claims that fhn was unable to pay.
the legal effect of a delegation under section,subdivision e was recently addressed in california emergency physicians medical group pacificare of california th,d emergency physicians.emergency physicians concluded that a health care service plan does not remain liable for emergency care claims when the responsibility for those claims has been delegated to a contracting medical provider such as fhn under section,subdivision e.the court reasoned that when a duty held by a licensee such as a medical plan is deemed to be non delegable,the licensee remains liable for the nonperformance of its agents.emergency physicians,at,d.because a licensee like pacificare remains liable for a nondelegable duty,when the legislature used the term delegate in subdivision e,it must have intended that the obligations of section are delegable duties that is,duties for which the health care service plan does not retain liability.ibid.
we find this reasoning persuasive.a delegation is commonly understood to mean the transfer of authority by one person to another,which may infer a general power to act for another benefit or which may assign a debt to another.barron law dict.ed.the term does not always connote a complete relinquishment of rights or responsibilities by the delegator but when the thing to be delegated is a legal duty of one party to another,the characterization of that duty as nondelegable is a shorthand way of saying that a party could not escape liability altogether by delegating this duty to someone else.seeley seymour d.conversely,to say a duty is delegable is to say that there is no residual liability.
ochs argues that a delegation under section,subdivision e does not relieve a health care service plan of its ultimate obligation to pay for emergency care unless the emergency care provider has agreed to look exclusively to another source of payment.it relies upon civil code section,which provides,the burden of an obligation may be transferred with the consent of the party entitled to its benefit,but not otherwise we disagree with this analysis.pacificare duty to pay ochs is a statutory one arising exclusively from section.subdivision e of that section specifically allows a delegation of payment responsibilities to contracting medical providers.assuming that civil code section applies to statutory as well as contractual obligations a health care service plan has no obligation to pay for emergency services within the meaning of civil code section when there has been a delegation under section,subdivision e.section is a specific statute that takes precedence over the more general rule articulated in civil code section in cases where the former applies.see lake reed cal th,d.
the legislative history of section supports our conclusion that a health care service plan does not remain liable for emergency care payments delegated to a contracting medical provider under subdivision e of that section.section was enacted in to require health care service plans to pay for emergency services by noncontracting physicians that were not preapproved and that otherwise might not be covered.analyses of senate bill,the progenitor of section,noted that it would shift decision making authority regarding the provision of services to emergency providers,which would significantly reduce the ability of the health plans to manage overall care and costs.of health services,enrolled bill on bill reg.sess.subdivision e,allowing plans to delegate their payment responsibilities to contracting medical providers,was added to reduce the opposition of several large health maintenance organizations.emergency physicians,supra,th at,d.because the delegation provision of section,subdivision e was enacted as a concession to health care service providers to enable them to better manage their costs,construing the subdivision to allow a complete delegation of responsibility for emergency payments,with no residual liability for those payments,is consistent with its legislative purpose.
also of note is the legislature approval of senate bill in,subsequently vetoed by the governor,which would have amended section to retain subdivision e,but added a new subdivision requiring health care service plans to pay emergency service providers if a contracting medical provider did not.bill reg.sess,subd.f.the legislature adoption of a subsequent amendment that is ultimately vetoed may be considered as evidence of its understanding of the unamended,existing statute.emergency physicians,supra,th at,d,citing freedom newspapers,orange county employees retirement system cal th,d.
had it not been vetoed,the amendment would have materially changed section by providing that health care service plans that delegate their responsibilities to contracting medical providers remain ultimately liable for payment to emergency service providers.a material change in the language of a statute usually indicates an intent to alter rather than simply clarify the statute meaning,although the circumstances surrounding the amendment may require a contrary conclusion.williams garcetti cal th,d,kern county of imperial d.nowhere in the legislative history is it suggested that health care service plans were liable for unpaid emergency medical bills under the law as it then existed or that the amendment proposed in senate bill was simply a clarification of the law.to the contrary,the legislative documents concerning senate bill demonstrate that the amendment to section was intended to change the effect of a delegation of emergency care payment responsibilities by a health care service plan.u nder the current system,the responsibility for payments for er services is delegated to medical groups or independent practice associations by health care service plans.the author of senate bill states that er providers are frequently not paid for their services because the medical groups are on the verge of bankruptcy and thus do not pay their bills.the result is that fewer physicians are willing to come into the er to provide emergency care.com.on insurance,analysis of bill reg.sess,march.this rationale for amending the law is restated in the various legislative analyses of the bill,none of which conclude that the problems with emergency service compensation resulted from any misunderstanding or misapplication of section.the clear implication is that the legislature believed that,absent the amendment,health care service plans did not remain liable to pay for emergency services after a delegation.
the plain language of section,subdivision e and its legislative history demonstrate that health care service plans do not have a statutory duty to pay for emergency services when they have delegated that responsibility to medical providers as permitted by statute.the recent decision in coast plaza doctors hospital uhp healthcare th,d,cited by ochs,does not require a different result.the court in coast plaza held that an emergency care provider who had obtained an assignment from patients it treated could seek reimbursement directly from the patients health care service plan.there was no issue concerning the health care service plan delegation of its statutory duties.
we next consider ochs related argument that a duty to pay can be found in sections and.sections and establish timelines for the payment of claims by health care service plans.section provides,the obligation of the plan to comply with this section shall not be deemed to be waived when the plan requires its medical groups,independent practice associations,or other contracting entities to pay claims for covered services.section,subdivision f contains identical language.ochs argues that under these clauses,pacificare could not avoid its duty to timely pay emergency health care bills by delegating that duty to an intermediary such as fhn.
two published decisions have rejected the argument that the nonwaiver clause contained in section requires a health care service plan to pay for emergency services when an intermediary fails to do so desert healthcare dist.pacificare fhp,th,d and california medical aetna healthcare of california,th,d cma.each concludes that the clause was merely intended to require contracting entities,such as independent practice associations,to comply with the procedures for handling claims set forth in section.desert healthcare,at,d cma,at,d.we agree with desert healthcare and cma that section does not establish an independent basis of liability for health care payments.the reasoning of these cases applies with equal force to the identically phrased nonwaiver clause of section 
for the reasons discussed,the first amended complaint did not state a cause of action for statutory violations of the act.under the facts alleged in that pleading,pacificare had no statutory obligation to pay the claims by ochs for emergency services.the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend on the cause of action for statutory violations.
ochs argues that it is unjust to allow pacificare to delegate its statutory duty to pay for noncontract emergency services when physicians are required by law to provide such services regardless of a patient inability to pay.we have no quarrel with the proposition that emergency care providers should be paid for the important services they provide,and,were we writing on a clean slate,we might well conclude that it is preferable for the health care service plan to bear the ultimate cost when an intermediary that it has selected becomes insolvent.but we are not at liberty to rewrite the relevant statutes or revise their legislative history to comport with a generalized sense of fairness.the act is a comprehensive scheme for regulating health care plans,and its provisions are the product of a variety of interests and concerns.the legislature addressed some of the concerns of emergency room physicians when it enacted section in and required health care service plans to pay for emergency services by noncontracting physicians.but this new right was tempered by a provision that specifically allowed plans to delegate their payment responsibilities,thus allowing them to better manage their costs and pass the savings along to their insureds.whatever the flaws of the current system,the solution must come from the legislature and not the courts.
unfair business practices 
ochs ninth cause of action for unfair business practices under business and professions code section rests exclusively on pacificare delegation of responsibility to fhn and its failure to pay claims for emergency services.although business and professions code section broadly proscribes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,it does not apply when specific legislation provides a safe harbor for the conduct at issue.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.section,subdivision e provides a statutory safe harbor for health care service plans that have delegated the obligation to pay for emergency services to their contracting medical providers.emergency physicians,supra,th at,d.

the seventh cause of action for negligence is similarly based on pacificare failure to pay for
