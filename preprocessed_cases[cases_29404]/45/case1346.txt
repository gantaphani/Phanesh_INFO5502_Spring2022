backgrounda.facts 
houston worked as a legal secretary for the law firm of sidley austin,she injured her back at work on june,when she lost her balance while lifting boxes of files.houston participated in an employee welfare benefit plan that sidley austin established and maintained under erisa,et provident provided the plan long term disability insurance coverage.houston sought treatment for her injury,which included,among other things,weekly visits to her family practice physician,mahendra patel,and a visit to a neurosurgeon,alan kaufman.she also underwent a physical evaluation by james ryan,a consultant in orthopedic surgery,on july,ryan concluded that houston had sufficient functional capacity to perform secretarial tasks 
the patient has a grip test which showed some marginal differences between the right and the left,being a slight bit of weakness in the right.the examination was accomplished with many complaints of pain,basically she is neurologically intact.i found no spasm.she has no weakness.there is no asymmetry of the upper extremities.i do not believe she has cervical radiculopathy.she has in fact,had a cervical strain which i feel has resolved.there are no objective findings.there is a functional overlay.she can return to the work she was doing without limitation.
at.on august,after ryan examination,houston had an mri scan taken of her cervical spine.
on december,houston submitted an initial claim for long term disability benefits under the policy.the policy provides that an employee is disabled from her own occupation if she is unable to earn at least eighty percent of her indexed earnings,or is unable to perform each of the material duties of the occupation that she regularly performed for her employer.at.in addition to her claimant statement,houston signed an authorization permitting the release of her medical information to provident.she also submitted an attending physician statement of disability completed by patel,which stated that she was disabled from her regular occupation due to a cervical disc injury.patel later submitted additional medical records,including a clinical summary of houston medical condition in light of the results of her mri,which stated,in part 
the patient was given cervical traction,ultrasound therapy and the patient apparently had no relief.the patient was admitted during the month of the rest of,at margaret hospital under my care and at this time the patient was seen by kaufman.the patient was center and right of the central disc herniation of the sixth cervical disc with secondary compromise of the anterolateral subarachnoid space.the patient also had central bulging annulus of the fifth cervical disc her symptoms were definitely due to the cervical disc syndrome.kaufman had advised the patient surgery but her workman compensation insurance was not approving the further treatment and surgical intervention 
the patient work injury has definitely caused the cervical symptoms radiating to both upper extremities and,in my opinion,this patient needs further work up,like a myelogram and if the myelogram is consistent with the mri of the cervical spine,then the patient will definitely need removal of the cervical disc 
at.provident approved houston long term disability benefits claim on march.
about two and a half months later,however,provident learned from sidley austin that chubb had denied houston related workers compensation claim based upon ryan conclusion that she could return to work.therefore,provident exercised its discretion under the policy to have houston undergo another independent medical examination.suk,also an orthopedic specialist,examined houston and concluded 
i believe the patient has been having problems of the neck condition for some time which was diagnosed as herniated nucleus pulposus between and by mri examination and the patient is under the care of a neurosurgeon at this time.i think further evaluation by the neurosurgeon for the cervical spine is needed.
at.provident asked suk to clarify his conclusions by answering four questions he responded as follows 
define this claimant current diagnosis,recommend treatment program and prognosis.
diagnosis suspected herniated nucleus pulposus between and mild degenerative changes between.
in your opinion,may this person return to regular occupation at this time if currently disabled from occupation,please indicate when might be able to return to that type of work.
no.the patient should be further evaluated by a neurosurgeon.
may this person return to some other type of work at this time if currently unable to return to any type of work,please indicate when might be able to do so and describe findings that support total disability.
complete the attached physical capacities form.
at.on the physical capacities form,suk indicated that houston had a great deal of work capacity she could stand,walk,sit and drive without restriction over a full workday occasionally lift a maximum of ten pounds use her hands for grasping,fine manipulation and repetitive motion,but not for pushing or pulling and occasionally bend,squat,kneel and balance and could frequently use a foot control.the form also indicated that she could return to light duty work pending neurological evaluation.at.
in june,provident medical advisor concluded that houston was not totally disabled,but he recommended that provident obtain the neurological report referenced in suk report.provident wrote to kaufman and requested houston medical records,but he did not respond.on december,provident rehabilitation specialist recommended that 
f urther review of the file indicates that houston has very little objective info to substantiate disability.a neurosurgeon named kaufman is alleged to advise surgery,but kaufman has not answered your letter of.we have nothing from him.the ime by suk indicates houston has plenty of work capacity for her occ upation and fails to defend his conclusion that she should not do any work.what we do have is a clear statement of by james ryan,md,orthopedist,saying there were no objective findings.he diagnosed cervical strain which has resolved.he felt she had functional overlay and could return to her own job limitations.a report of by a mahendra patel simply relates patient complaints and suggests need for further work up,like a myelogram 
i feel we should now act on the physical capacity findings of suk and on those of other doctors ryan and terminate.
at.on january,provident notified houston that it had terminated her long term disability benefits as of december,because the physical capacity findings indicate that you have the ability to perform not only your own occupation as legal secretary but also many sedentary jobs.at.
on january,houston updated her proof of disability with a second statement of disability prepared by patel,which indicated that she remained disabled from her own or any other occupation and that her work capacity was as before.at.provident erisa appeals committee reviewed the supplemented file and upheld the termination of benefits due to insufficient information on which to continue disability due to her purported cervical problems.at.on march,houston again supplemented her file with medical documents from patel,and,for the first time,she submitted statements from doctors regarding a vision problem and depression.provident erisa appeals committee again upheld the termination of benefits in its view,neither her vision problem nor her depression limited her ability to work in her occupation.
