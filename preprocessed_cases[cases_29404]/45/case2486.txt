after settling an action for personal injury,appellant american guarantee and liability insurance company american and respondent american international underwriters insurance company aiu sought indemnification from each other,and each moved for summary judgment.the trial court denied american motion,granted summary adjudication to aiu,and ultimately entered judgment for aiu.american appeals,contending that the parties responsible for the underlying plaintiff injuries were not insureds under its liability policy.we agree and therefore must reverse the judgment.
background 
a development project in san jose required the excavation and removal of soil from the construction site,resulting in a series of subcontracting arrangements.jones,the excavation contractor on the project,retained allied waste management allied to remove the soil and transport it to allied disposal facility.allied then orally contracted with denbeste transportation,denbeste to perform the hauling.denbeste,using a written subhaul agreement,subcontracted with double d transportation company double d to assist denbeste in the job.double d in turn entered into a separate subhaul agreement with james camara,owner of mjc trucking.it was undisputed that both double d and camara were acting as independent contractors pursuant to their respective agreements.
under the d subhaul agreement,double d had the right to refuse transportation assignments requested by denbeste,and double d was required to maintain its own liability insurance and to make denbeste an additional insured.double d was insured under an umbrella policy issued by respondent aiu,while denbeste was the named insured on two american policies a comprehensive general liability cgl policy which is not at issue in this appeal and a commercial auto policy which included a trucker coverage form trucker policy.
pursuant to his subcontract with double d,camara drove his own mjc tractor connected to a double d trailer.on october,while camara was hauling soil from the project site to the disposal site,the ran over christopher torgerson,severely injuring him.in september torgerson brought a negligence action against camara,denbeste,double d,and the general contractor on the development project,among others.double d and camara tendered their defense to denbeste insurer,american but american rejected tender on the ground that neither was covered as an insured under the trucker policy.
in november,torgerson settled with all defendants for.aiu double d carrier and american denbeste carrier each agreed to contribute on behalf of all of its insureds involved in the action,while reserving their rights to pursue each other.american thereafter paid under denbeste cgl policy and under the trucker policy.aiu likewise paid the promised amount pursuant to the settlement 
aiu then brought suit against american for equitable contribution,equitable subrogation,equitable indemnity,and declaratory relief.according to aiu,it was an excess insurer,while american was a primary insurer covering camara and double d as well as denbeste.american denied these allegations and filed a,contending that neither double d nor camara was an insured under the american policy issued to denbeste.american also called attention to an indemnity provision in double d subhaul agreement with denbeste each party sought recovery of the million it had contributed to the settlement.
in january the parties filed for summary judgment or alternatively,summary adjudication with respect to aiu first amended complaint and american.american argued that neither double d nor camara was an insured under denbeste trucker policy.american maintained that the relationship between denbeste and double d was governed by the subhaul agreement and by the routine contractual commercial relationship between themselves sic.that agreement,american noted,required double d to name denbeste as an additional insured in its liability policy.
aiu,on the other hand,contended that it had no duty to contribute to the torgerson settlement because its policy was excess only,and american primary policy,which had not been exhausted,covered double d and camara as well as denbeste.in aiu view,the indemnity provision of the subhaul agreement between denbeste and double d was inapplicable to the parties dispute.
the superior court granted aiu motion as to the complaint and denied american motion in its entirety.as to american,the court granted aiu summary adjudication as to all causes of action except the first,for indemnity.at the request of american,the court subsequently clarified its order to articulate specifically its finding that double d was an insured under the american trucker policy as the owner from whom denbeste transportation hired a covered auto that is a trailer.in a judgment entered may,the court awarded aiu plus prejudgment interest of and costs.
discussion 
in moving for summary judgment aiu advanced the theory that it had no duty to contribute to the settlement with torgerson because its umbrella policy was excess,and the coverage of denbeste primary policy had not been exhausted.on appeal,american maintains that aiu literally sic puts the cart before the horse,because it was obligated to pay only those amounts the insured was liable to pay as damages.neither double d nor camara,american argues,was an insured under the trucker policy.american further disputes the award of prejudgment interest to aiu.we need not address this second argument because we find merit in the first.

the trucker policy 
american trucker policy provided in coverage to denbeste for liability arising out of property damage or bodily injury resulting from the use of a covered auto.the term auto extended to any autos,hired autos only,and nonowned autos only.hired autos were those you lease,hire,rent or borrow,while nonowned autos were those that the policyholder did not own,lease,hire,rent or borrow,but which are used in connection with your business.the term auto itself was defined to include trailers.
the liability section also identified who is an insured in addition to the policyholder.among those covered were the following anyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire or borrow c.the owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow a covered auto that is a trailer while the trailer is connected to another covered auto that is a power unit anyone liable for the conduct of an insured described above but only to the extent of that liability.the policy stated that coverage was primary for any covered auto while hired or borrowed by you and used exclusively in your business as a trucker and pursuant to operating rights granted to you by a public authority.
the point of dispute in this case is whether these provisions covered camara and double d on a primary basis,thereby releasing aiu of any obligation to contribute under the umbrella policy issued to double d.the outcome turns on the meaning of hired auto and the intended scope of the phrase anyone else while using with your permission that hired auto.if denbeste can be said to have hired the tractor and trailer and then to have given camara and double d permission to use them,then camara and double d were insureds under the trucker policy,and american was required to exhaust its policy limits before aiu excess provisions came into play.
civil code section defines hiring as synonymous with is,a contract by which one gives to another the temporary possession and use of property,other than money,for reward,and the latter agrees to return the same to the former at a future time.in entremont whitsell cal d,the supreme court applied this section in a dispute over whether a contract to transport materials constituted the rental of equipment or performance of services.entremont had agreed to rent three dump trucks,with drivers,to the department of public works for a highway repair project.following an investigation into the amounts entremont was charging for the use of his trucks,the railroad commission determined that the contract at issue was for the transportation of materials and thus was governed by its order fixing the minimum rates for such service.the supreme court agreed.although the contract purported to provide for a rental,it was denominated by the parties as a service agreement,was for the transportation of property by motor vehicle,and was not for the renting or leasing of tools or equipment.id.at.the court reasoned that under the contract the possession and control of the trucks and the operators thereof did not pass to the operators did not become the employees of the such possession and control remained in entremont.the chief characteristic of a renting or a leasing is the giving up of possession to the hirer,so that the hirer and not the owner uses and controls the rented property.the record is clear that the only supervision exercised by the department over the operators of the trucks was to direct them where to load and unload the material hauled,when to go on or leave the job,and to inform the operators whether the load should be dumped or spread.the department had no power to discharge the power,and the power of selection,rested in entremont.that is a factor of some importance in ascertaining whether entremont or the department controlled the operators.citation.moreover,the provisions of the contract indicate that it was not the intention of the parties that the department should exercise exclusive control over the operators.the contract required entremont to keep the trucks in repair to pay all expenses incidental thereto to supply all oil,gas and other materials necessary for their operation to carry compensation insurance on the drivers,and expressly provided the operators were the employees of entremont.further,under the contract,entremont assumed all responsibility for damage or injury to other persons or property by reason of the operation of the trucks.this provision strongly implies that exclusive control was not conferred on the department.id.at.the court thus concluded that the transaction lacks that element of a transfer of use and possession of property to the hirer which is essential to the existence of a leasing.id.at.
the third district followed entremont,again citing civil code section,in rice brothers,glens falls indem.d.an employee of rice brothers,the insured,had damaged the truck of holloway,a trucking company with which rice brothers had contracted to provide additional dump trucks for a paving job.the insurer of rice brothers denied liability coverage under a clause excluding damage of property owned by,rented to,in charge of,or transported by the insured.id.at.the trial court examined the oral contract between rice brothers and holloway and impliedly found that rice brothers had not rented the damaged truck,nor was it in charge of it or transporting it at the time of the accident.id.at.after judgment was entered for rice brothers,the insurer appealed,challenging the trial court factual findings that holloway trucks had not been hired.the appellate court upheld that finding as supported by substantial evidence.holloway had not only provided the additional trucks,but had also provided the drivers,paid for fuel and maintenance of the trucks,and paid the drivers wages.the contract had not given rice brothers either possession or control of the truck at any time.on the contrary,while the rice brothers drivers were under the company complete control,holloway drivers were not.holloway could do anything he wanted with his trucks at any time he wanted to,though payment was contingent on performing the work required by the contract.id.at.
as in entremont and rice brothers,the contract before us provides for transportation of property by motor vehicle,not for the renting of trucks and trailers by denbeste.the subhaul agreement identifies double d as an independent contractor that agrees to transport shipment for tools or equipment for prime carrier denbeste.the subject of the contract was repeatedly referred to in the document as the performance of subhaul services,not the provision of equipment for denbeste use.double d,like entremont and holloway,was required to maintain the equipment at its own expense and to pay its drivers salaries and worker compensation insurance and while denbeste could use any other subhauler services,it had no power to discharge the drivers at best its principal could report the driver to the jones superintendent for possible release from the job.entremont,supra cal d at.likewise,while hauling for double d,camara remained responsible for repairing and operating his own vehicle he testified,n obody tells me how to drive my truck.thus,we regard the arrangement between denbeste and double d as comparable to those discussed in entremont and rice brothers.as in those cases,possession and control of camara or the equipment he was operating did not pass to denbeste.entremont,supra,cal d at rice brothers,supra,d at.
another analogous situation was presented in northbrook excess surplus ins.coastal rescue systems d coastal rescue,where the activity of a rescue training company coastal rescue did not fall within a policy exclusion for injury arising out of the operation or use of an aircraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.id.at.coastal rescue was engaged in teaching a rescue exercise with the use of a helicopter provided by spirit airways.during the exercise,the helicopter lost altitude and two students were injured.reversing the trial court judgment,the first district,division,held northbrook,coastal rescue insurer,liable for coverage under its cgl policy.the court recognized the use of the word possession in the civil code definition of hired,and it acknowledged the holdings of rice brothers and entremont in concluding that one of the determinative factors in deciding whether there is a rental agreement is whether the person engaging the services of the operator and the vehicle has possession and control of the vehicle.id.at.coastal rescue had neither possession of the helicopter nor control over the performance of the spirit airways pilot.because no delivery of possession and use had occurred,there had been no rental or loan of the helicopter from spirit airways to coastal rescue.id.at.
as in coastal rescue,here denbeste engaged the transport services of double d without assuming possession or exercising control over double d trailer or camara tractor.clearly,the relationship between denbeste and double d involved a relationship between a prime carrier and a subhauler acting as an independent contractor,which did not relinquish possession and control of its equipment to denbeste.camara likewise was operating his own tractor and a trailer leased from double d,pursuant to his subhaul agreement with double 
both parties recognize the relevance of a related term,borrow,to the interpretation of hire.in home indemnity company king cal d king,martin,a forklift operator,injured the driver of a truck insured by home indemnity.one of the issues was whether martin was insured as a borrower of the truck under home indemnity policy.the supreme court,noting that the term borrower was not defined in the policy,adopted definitions from a dictionary and a decision from another state the term borrow has been defined as to receive temporarily from another,implying or expressing the intention either of returning the thing received or of giving its equivalent to the lender.webster new internat.dict.ed.in a case involving a similar situation,a borrower was defined as someone who,with the permission of the owner,has temporary possession and use of the property for his own purposes possession connotes the right to exercise dominion and control.liberty mut.ins.am.emp.ins,evidence insufficient to support finding that forklift operator unloading goods from a truck was a borrower of the truck.king,supra,cal d at.in holding that martin was not a borrower,the supreme court emphasized that he had not had dominion and control of the truck or the trailer on which he was loading cargo the only evidence of dominion and control comes from this implied contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.there was no evidence that martin either moved the rig or had express authority to do so.nor,for that matter,was there any evidence of the authority of forklift operators generally with respect to vehicles being loaded or unloaded.we find the evidence insufficient to show that martin exercised the requisite dominion and control over the truck and trailer to be a borrower under the terms of the policy.id.at.
two other appellate decisions are instructive in the circumstances presented here.in fireman fund insurance company allstate insurance company d fireman fund,the third district revisited the question of who is insured in circumstances similar to those before us.there a rig collided with a car occupied by the plaintiffs in the underlying lawsuit.subcarrier richardson trucking owned the tractor,and shipper spring air mattress owned the trailer.richardson trucking was held to have an extant policy issued by fireman fund.fireman fund,however,contended that the tractor rig was a hired vehicle under two policies issued to the carrier,better home deliveries along with its parent company,leaseway transportation,due to the subhaul relationship between the carrier and richardson trucking.id.at.
the appellate court agreed with the trial court finding that richardson trucking was not an insured under the carrier allstate policy,which covered the carrier as the named insured and a nyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire or borrow.id.at.it was unreasonable to suggest that richardson trucking was using its own vehicle with the carrier permission such an interpretation would strain the plain meaning of the words and be contrary to the construction given similar terms in the authorities cited.id.at.
the provision in the trucker policy likewise offered coverage for denbeste or a nyone else while using with your permission a covered auto you own,hire or borrow.as in fireman fund,it would be unreasonable to infer that this provision contemplated denbeste granting permission to double d and camara to use their own vehicles in their business with denbeste.
city of los angeles allianz insurance th allianz reinforces and explains the requirement that dominion and control be imparted to the hirer to meet the conditions of a policy covering insureds who hire or borrow the vehicle of another.there the city had contracted with a composting company to purchase and remove biosolids from the city sewage treatment plant,and the composting company had then subcontracted the job to a trucking company.after the material was loaded onto his truck for weighing at the plant,the truck driver was injured.the trucking company insurers refused to defend the city against the driver lawsuit,and the city was found liable.in the ensuing suit by the city against the insurers,the coverage issue was whether the city had borrowed the truck when it was loaded with sewage and then weighed.the policy protected a lessee or borrower or any of their employees,while moving property to or from a covered auto.id.at.citing king,the appellate court emphasized that one point is beyond dispute the exercise of dominion and control over the truck is indispensable to a finding that the city was a borrower of the trucking company truck under the terms of the insurance policy.id.at.
the court upheld the trial court factual finding that dominion and control were insufficiently established to constitute a borrowing of the truck.it agreed with the trial court that borrowing entails temporary possession,which in turn connotes the right to exercise dominion and control.allianz,supra,th at.the city assertion that it was a user of the truck while the loading occurred was unavailing,because use is not invariably equivalent to borrowing as the court pointed out,one can use a truck one does not own and has not borrowed or hired.ibid.
aiu maintains that even if dominion and control are required in order to be denominated an insured hirer or borrower of a covered auto,that element was established by denbeste control over the route.aiu specifically calls attention to joseph denbeste oral warnings to drivers to stay on the prescribed route and his presence at the exit gate,where he stopped and logged each truck,directed each driver to complete the trip manifests and confirmed tarping.
aiu overstates joseph denbeste control.he explained in his deposition that it was the project superintendent,an employee of the excavation contractor,who designated the route and even directed joseph denbeste in his duties,including that of taking a position at the exit gate.as noted earlier,joseph denbeste did not have the authority to fire camara he could only warn camara that if he learned that camara had left the designated route a second time,he would turn him over to the project superintendent.
allianz is again noteworthy on this point.there the city unsuccessfully argued that its supervision over the loading process was sufficient to establish its role as a borrower of the truck.the city had maintained the pickup site,provided the loading procedures,directed the hauler along the required route,instructed the hauler on the proper positioning of the rig to receive and weigh the load,supervised the weighing of the trailer before and after loading,and inspected the load for cleanliness and adequate tarping before the truck left.the driver,while following those instructions,nevertheless maintained control over his truck at all times during the loading operation and was only performing his duties under his hauling contract in furtherance of his company commercial purposes.allianz,supra,th at.thus,as in king,the requisite dominion and control by the city over the subhauler truck did not exist.
in the court below and on appeal,aiu has relied on a definition of hired auto derived from cases such as monolith portland cement company american home assurance company d monolith,fratis fireman fund american insurance companies d fratis,and continental casualty company zurich insurance company cal d zurich.their holdings do not compel a result in aiu favor.in each case the reviewing court had before it a policy provision expressly defining hired automobile as a automobile used under contract in behalf of or under contract with the named insured monolith,supra,d at fratis,supra,d at zurich,supra,cal d at.here,by contrast,the american policy contains no such broad definition.we may not rewrite a policy to bind the insurer to a risk that it did not contemplate and for which it has not been paid.fireman fund insurance company allstate insurance company,supra,d at.accordingly,we decline aiu invitation to read into the trucker policy a meaning drawn from contract provisions that are not before us.instead of redefining the relationship by inserting words into the american insurance policy,we resort to civil code section,which makes hired equivalent to rented and requires temporary possession of the property.
in travelers indemnity company swearinger d primary decision on which aiu continues to the issue was the meaning of borrow,a term not defined in the policy under scrutiny.a student in the fall river school district was driving her father car during a activity when she was involved in an accident that injured her passenger,plaintiff swearinger.the cour
