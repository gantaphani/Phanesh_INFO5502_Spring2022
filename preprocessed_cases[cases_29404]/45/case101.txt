facts and procedural history 
because this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment,we view the record in the light most favorable to the party against whom summary judgment entered here,rnk,indulging all reasonable inferences in that party favor.fiacco sigma alpha epsilon fraternity,cir den norske bank as first bank of boston,cir.
rnk,a massachusetts corporation,is a telephone company that provides services to the public as a competitive local exchange carrier clec.ripple is a nevada corporation that provides conferencing services.one of ripple services allows people to meet and confer through live telephone chat lines.farmers is a california company that issued a general liability insurance policy to ripple.
in,ripple and rnk entered into a written agreement the agreement whereby rnk agreed that ripple would locate and install at rnk premises certain electronic equipment necessary for ripple to provide conferencing services to its customers.in order for ripple chat lines to function,a call had to travel over rnk network and through ripple proprietary hardware and software to which rnk lines were attached.rnk was obligated under the agreement to assign telephone numbers to ripple conferencing lines and to notify ripple customers any time that rnk for some reason decided to block calls.
paragraphs one,three and ten of the agreement state as follows 
customer equipment.rnk shall arrange for the assignment of the telephone numbers and arrange for ripple to at ripple expense certain electronic equipment,acceptable to rnk in accordance with the terms of this agreement.ripple shall use the equipment installed at rnk premises to provide information to its customers.at the termination of the agreement,ripple will,at its sole cost and expense,remove the equipment from rnk premises.it is understood and agreed that ripple any and all of its equipment at rnk offices at its sole risk,and that rnk assumes no liability whatsoever for such equipment operation,maintenance,security or condition.

emphasis added.paragraphs three and ten of the agreement quoted above were based on a standard sample agreement provided by ripple.
on october,the new york public service commission nypsc,which has jurisdiction under new york law to regulate clecs such as rnk,issued an order the regulatory order providing that all clecs that had chat lines on their networks had to immediately either designate existing chat line central office codes as blockable or transfer these chat lines to specific central office codes that were already designated as blockable codes a major consideration in adopting this order was the desire to protect minors by providing the ability to block the completion of telephonic communications.
in,jane doe,a minor acting through her adoptive father,brought the doe lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against rnk alleging that rnk violated the regulatory order by not assigning blockable telephone numbers to chat lines and that,as a result,she was improperly able to gain access to a chat line through which she met several individuals convincing her to contact them in assaulted her jane doe claimed in the doe lawsuit that rnk violation of the regulatory order was the proximate cause of the injuries she sustained.as a result of the incident involving jane doe,the nypsc issued an order on october,stating that it appeared that rnk had violated the regulatory order and directing rnk to show cause as to why the nypsc should not proceed against rnk with a penalty action.in response to the nypsc order to show cause and during the course of the doe lawsuit,rnk admitted that it failed to comply with the regulatory order.rnk insurer settled the doe lawsuit and then,in the name of rnk,sought indemnity from ripple and farmers ripple insurer for its costs of defense and settlement of the doe lawsuit.rnk claim for indemnification was and continues to be based on its contention that the indemnity provisions of the agreement require indemnification from the claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.
farmers filed the underlying declaratory judgment action against both ripple and rnk seeking a ruling that it has no duty to defend or indemnify rnk in connection with the doe lawsuit.the parties then filed the following claims rnk filed a against ripple seeking a determination that ripple owes a duty to indemnify rnk against doe claims,ripple filed a counterclaim against farmers seeking a declaratory judgment that farmers has an obligation to defend or indemnify it against rnk,and ripple filed a against rnk seeking a declaratory judgment that ripple has no contractual,common law or other obligation of indemnity,contribution or other duty toward rnk.
on april,all parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether ripple has a duty to indemnify rnk against the claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.after concluding that ripple is not contractually obligated under the agreement to indemnify rnk against such claims,the district court issued an order on september,denying rnk motion for summary judgment and granting appellees joint motion for summary judgment.on october,the district court entered a judgment dismissing all other claims as moot.rnk now appeals this judgment and the order that granted appellees joint motion for summary judgment.

iii.discussion 
rnk contends,first,that the district court erred in finding that ripple is not obligated to indemnify rnk against the claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.specifically,rnk alleges that the district court erred when it failed to conclude that paragraphs three and ten of the agreement hereinafter collectively referred to as the indemnity provisions require ripple to indemnify rnk against doe claims.second,rnk alternatively alleges that the indemnity provisions are ambiguous and should be interpreted against ripple,the party who provided the sample agreement that served as basis for the language included in said provisions.third,rnk alternatively claims that,at the very least,conflicting interpretations about the indemnity provisions create a question of fact that precludes summary judgment.
in opposition to rnk allegations,appellees contend that the district court was correct in finding that the indemnity provisions are not ambiguous and do not support rnk indemnification claim.appellees further contend that assuming arguendo that the agreement contained an ambiguity regarding the indemnity provisions,the same can not be interpreted against ripple in the present case given that,first,the parties are of equal sophistication and bargaining power and,second,ripple can not be considered the drafter of the indemnity provisions.finally,appellees allege that even if the agreement could be deemed to require ripple to indemnify rnk for jane doe appellees of such a provision would be against public policy,because it would promote a breach of duty to the public by indemnifying rnk from the consequences of its own negligence,failing to assign blockable numbers to chat lines,as required by the regulatory order.
for the reasons stated below,we find that the contract terms at issue here are unambiguous.we conclude that the plain language of the contract,interpreted to ascertain the manifest intent of the parties and to effectuate their purposes,does not require ripple to indemnify rnk against jane doe claims in the doe lawsuit.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and find it unnecessary to address the parties arguments regarding the application of ambiguous contractual provisions or appellees public policy objection.
applicable state law 
the present appeal requires that we interpret the scope of the agreement particularly,the indemnity provisions.it is undisputed that interpretation of the agreement is governed by massachusetts law.u nder massachusetts law,interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court,and,as a question of law,is subject to plenary review.bank int l bus.machs,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a court interpreting a contract must first assess whether the contract is ambiguous.see bank thermo elemental.to answer the ambiguity question,the court must first examine the language of the contract by itself,independent of extrinsic evidence concerning the drafting history or the intention of the parties.id.ambiguity is not created merely because the litigants disagree about the meaning of a contract.nicolaci anapol,cir.rather,a contract is only ambiguous where an agreement terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.bank int l bus.machs,at internal quotations marks and citation omitted.
the meaning of an unambiguous contract term is a question of law,while the meaning of an ambiguous contract term is a question of fact.seaco ins.barbosa,see also fairfield clarendon trust dwek,cir.should the court find the contract language unambiguous,we interpret it according to its plain terms.den norske bank as,at.summary judgment is appropriate when those plain terms unambiguously favor either side.bank int l bus.machs,at.on the other hand,if the contract terms are ambiguous,contract meaning normally becomes a matter for the factfinder,and summary judgment is appropriate only if the extrinsic evidence presented about the parties intended meaning is so that no reasonable person could decide to the contrary.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in the absence of fraud or mistake,an agreement is presumed to express the intent of the parties.fairfield clarendon trust,at citing hess oil chem.ristuccia.
here,the district court interpreted and applied the agreement,determining that there were no ambiguities for the jury to resolve as to whether the parties thereto intended for ripple to indemnify rnk against doe claims.the district court went on to conclude that ripple is not obligated under the agreement to indemnify rnk from doe claims.these are legal determinations and our review thereof is,thus,plenary.see bank int l bus.machs,at itt ltx,cir the determination of whether a contract provision is ambiguous is a question of law subject to plenary review.with these principles in mind,we now discuss rnk indemnification claim on appeal.
interpretation of the indemnity provisions 
rnk claims that ripple is obligated,pursuant to the agreement,to indemnify it from the claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.rnk provides two possible bases for this assertion,namely paragraph three paragraph ten of the agreement.we analyze these allegations separately.in doing so,we are mindful that under massachusetts law,c ontracts of indemnity are to be fairly and reasonably construed in order to ascertain the intention of the parties and to effectuate the purpose sought to be accomplished.nicolaci,at quoting shea bay state gas,see also whittle pagani.constr,noting that some older massachusetts cases lay down a rule of strict construction for claims of indemnity covering the negligence of the indemnitee,but that the modern rule under massachusetts law is that such contracts are to be fairly and reasonably construed to ascertain the intention of the parties and to effectuate their purpose.it is well accepted under massachusetts law that indemnification provisions are construed in accordance with their ordinary and plain meaning and without any bias in favor of the indemnitor or against the indemnitee.caldwell tanks,haley ward,cir.
paragraph three of the agreement 
under paragraph three of the agreement,ripple agreed to indemnify rnk and hold harmless from and against all damage claims associated with any equipment of ripple.emphasis added.given that only claims associated with any of ripple equipment are subject to the indemnification obligations set forth in this paragraph,it is key to interpret the meaning of these terms,associated and equipment within the context of the agreement.
in interpreting contractual language,we consider the contract as a whole.its meaning can not be delineated by isolating words and interpreting them as though they stood alone.nicolaci,at quoting starr fordham.not only must due weight be accorded to the immediate context,but no part of the contract is to be disregarded.starr,at.
although the agreement does not expressly define the term equipment,the same is used in other parts of the agreement.specifically,paragraph one,which is titled customer equipment,states that rnk shall arrange for ripple to at ripple expense certain electronic equipment and that ripple shall use the equipment installed at rnk premises to provide information to its customers.emphasis added.said paragraph further states that ripple any and all of its equipment at rnk offices at its sole risk and,upon termination of the agreement,shall remove the equipment from rnk premises at its sole cost.emphasis added.in addition,paragraph three of the agreement establishes that rnk shall not have any liability for any loss or damage related to ripple equipment,rnk casualty and fire insurance policies apply only to rnk facilities,and ripple shall be responsible for insuring own equipment.emphasis added.
the aforementioned textual language of the agreement makes unambiguously clear and the parties do not dispute that the term equipment is used therein in its ordinary sense to refer to ripple tangible equipment to be located at rnk premises 
with regards to the term associated,the agreement does not define the same and only uses it in paragraph three.nevertheless,said term is ordinarily and commonly used to indicate that something is closely connected,joined,or united with another as in interest,function,activity,or office.webster third new international dictionary unabridged.therefore,under paragraph three of the agreement,ripple undertook the obligation to indemnify rnk against all claims associated,closely connected,joined or united with ripple tangible equipment located at rnk premises.with this understanding in mind,below we discuss whether the indemnification obligation set forth in paragraph three applies to doe claims.
jane doe claim in the doe lawsuit was that rnk tortious failure in violation of the regulatory order to assign blockable codes to the chat lines that she used to contact her assailants was the proximate cause of her damages.rnk contends that this claim is covered under paragraph three indemnification obligation.to this effect,rnk argues that doe claim is associated with ripple equipment,within the meaning of paragraph three,because the chat line jane doe used to meet her assailants would never have operated without ripple equipment,and without the chat line the doe lawsuit would never have arisen.thus,rnk urges that this court interpret paragraph three as requiring indemnification against all claims that can somehow be traced back to the existence of ripple chat line operation,or to at least recognize that there is ambiguity with regards to this point.as explained below,we find that rnk assertion is not supported by the plain language of the agreement read in its proper context.
the plain language of the agreement shows that its purpose was mainly to allow ripple to locate its equipment in rnk premises for the operation of ripple chat lines and to require rnk to assign telephone numbers thereto.in light of this purpose and reading the agreement as a whole,it is evident that the aim of paragraph three was to protect rnk in case ripple tangible equipment located at rnk premises specifically caused damage to adjacent property in rnk facilities or bodily injury to persons in the vicinity.this interpretation is buttressed by the other provisions of paragraph three,which illustrate that the concern giving rise to this paragraph pertained to damage to property or bodily injury specifically caused by the fact that ripple tangible equipment would be located in rnk premises and not offsite.for example,paragraph three establishes that rnk shall not have any liability for any loss or damage related to ripple equipment,rnk casualty and fire insurance policies apply only to rnk facilities,and ripple will be responsible for insuring own equipment.emphasis added.
it is also telling that paragraph three specifically restricts the indemnification obligation set forth therein to claims associated with ripple equipment,as opposed,for example,to claims associated with ripple services or the existence of ripple chat lines.thus,the agreement language is consistent with the less expansive interpretation of paragraph three at which we arrive.
in light of the above,it would be unreasonable to find that paragraph three requires ripple to indemnify rnk against all claims that can somehow be traced back to the existence of ripple chat lines.rnk attempts at construing the scope of paragraph three in a broader fashion unreasonably distort the language and context of the agreement 
in sum,we find that the indemnification obligation set forth in paragraph three unambiguously relates to claims specifically caused by ripple tangible equipment located in rnk premises and does not encompass all claims that can somehow be traced back to the existence of ripple chat lines.accordingly,we conclude that ripple is not obligated under paragraph three of the agreement to indemnify rnk against the claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.we affirm the district court judgment on this issue.
paragraph ten of the agreement 
the other contractual provision that rnk asserts as a basis for its indemnification claim against ripple is paragraph ten of the agreement.said paragraph,which is titled customer ripple conduct,states,in relevant part,that ripple shall be responsible for all marketing and content and will hold rnk harmless from all claims arising from such.in other words,under paragraph ten,ripple agreed to indemnify rnk from all claims arising from all marketing and content.the district court found that the term content was used in this paragraph to refer to the prompts,menus and information publicized on the various chat,conference and information lines contemplated in the contract,and did not encompass third party conversations taking place through rnk network and ripple chat lines.accordingly,the district court concluded that paragraph ten imposed no obligation on ripple to indemnify rnk against doe claims,since said claims did not arise as a result of such prompts,menus and information.rnk challenges the district court conclusions and alleges that doe claims are covered under paragraph ten.we agree with the district court and for the reasons stated below affirm its judgment.
rnk contends that the term content encompasses the third party conversations carried out through rnk network and ripple chat lines,such as doe chat line conversations with her future assailants.rnk further alleges that doe claims should be deemed to have arisen from such content.however,rnk allegations are not supported by the plain language of the agreement read in its proper context.
the language of paragraph ten illustrates that the indemnification obligation set forth therein was intended to protect rnk against ripple conduct.in particular,it is noteworthy that paragraph ten is titled customer ripple conduct and states in its first sentence that ripple shall abide by all state and federal regulations applicable to its operation.it further states,i f ripple do es not,rnk may terminate this agreement if the violation continues for over seven days after notice to ripple.these provisions evince that the purpose behind paragraph ten was to protect rnk from possible unlawful conduct by ripple.when read in proper context,it is clear that this paragraph requires that ripple indemnify rnk from any claims arising from ripple marketing and content.therefore,we find that the term content,within the meaning of the agreement,relates to material generated by ripple,the prompts,menus and information publicized by ripple on the various chats and does not encompass the traffic,third party conversations that went through rnk network and ripple chat lines.we agree with the district court that the textual language of paragraph ten,when read in the context of the agreement,is not reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that ripple undertook to indemnify rnk for claims arising from conversations of third party customers that ripple did not generate and could not monitor such conversations may not reasonably be considered ripple content within the meaning of the agreement.rnk does not point to any evidence in the record that leads to a different result 
in light of the above,we find that the conversations carried out by doe and her assailants through rnk network and ripple chat lines are not considered ripple content within the meaning of the agreement.accordingly,we find that doe claims fall outside the scope of the indemnification obligation set forth in paragraph ten,even if it is assumed that such claims arose from conversations she carried out through ripple chat lines.
in sum,we find that the district court correctly found that ripple is not obligated under paragraph ten of the agreement to indemnify rnk against doe claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court order on this issue.
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we conclude that ripple is not obligated under the agreement to indemnify rnk against claims asserted by jane doe in the doe lawsuit.we,therefore,affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees.
as noted by the district court,the agreement reflects an imprecise use of the term customer.we agree with the dis
