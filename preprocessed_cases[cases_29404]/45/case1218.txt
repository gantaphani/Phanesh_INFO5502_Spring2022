from until april,sandra rudzinski worked for sharp electronics corporation.as a employee,she was entitled to participate in a group disability plan the plan,which was underwritten by metropolitan life insurance company metlife.the present controversy arose out of a lawsuit between rudzinski and metlife.briefly,after rudzinski stopped working for sharp,she applied for a conversion policy with metlife to preserve her disability coverage.metlife denied her application.rudzinski responded with a suit in federal court asserting that metlife had wrongfully denied her benefits.initially,metlife was the sole defendant.during a settlement conference,however,metlife represented to rudzinski that one reason it had refused to pay her any benefits was that sharp had failed to make required payments to it on her behalf.
based on this statement,rudzinski filed an amended complaint adding sharp as an additional defendant she asserted that sharp had breached its fiduciary duty to her and had interfered with her benefits.on july,following an unsuccessful motion to dismiss,sharp filed a against metlife asserting that metlife had breached a fiduciary duty it allegedly owed to sharp under the employment retirement income security act of erisa,that metlife was obliged to indemnify sharp for certain expenses,and that metlife was estopped from denying these obligations.
although rudzinski and sharp reached a settlement and the district court entered judgment in favor of rudzinski in her action against metlife,sharp claim against metlife remained pending.after sharp filed an amended,metlife moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.see.b.the district court granted that motion on july,and sharp has now appealed from the judgment against it.we affirm.
sharp adopted the metlife disability plan in as part of the welfare benefits package it furnished for its employees the plan was qualified under erisa.sharp was,at all relevant times,the plan administrator and metlife the plan fiduciary.pursuant to the plan,sharp was required to pay disability benefits to eligible employees during a policy benefits elimination period.thereafter,metlife was required to pay disability benefits to employees who met criteria specified in the plan.sharp was required under the plan to pay premiums to metlife for the benefit of its employees,but it had no responsibility to pay premiums for a person whose employment with sharp had been terminated,unless the person was disabled and was within an elimination period at the time her employment ended.
on april,as a result of chronic fatigue,joint pain,and headaches,rudzinski ceased active employment with sharp.later,she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.as a participating member in the plan,rudzinski was eligible for both and disability benefits.accordingly,following the cessation of her employment,she began receiving disability benefits from sharp and the elimination period began to run.rudzinski also filed a claim with metlife in which she requested disability insurance benefits,to commence immediately upon the completion of the period.
on july,sharp notified rudzinski that if she did not return to active employment by july,she would lose her job and sharp would cease making payments on her behalf to metlife for disability benefits.rudzinski did not return to work at sharp,and,as promised,sharp ended her employment effective july.sometime prior to the deadline,sharp informed rudzinski that,if she did not return to work,she could preserve her disability coverage with metlife by obtaining a conversion policy and paying premiums on her own behalf as a.rudzinski took the advice,applied to metlife for a conversion policy,and paid the requisite premiums.after some time had passed,however,metlife denied rudzinski disability benefits on the ground that she had a disability at the time she applied for the conversion policy.rudzinski then made a formal demand on metlife for disability benefits pursuant to the plan.metlife considered her demand and denied it,this time on the ground that she had not fulfilled the period that was supposed to precede benefits.
rudzinski then filed a claim in the district court pursuant to a b,alleging that metlife wrongfully denied her benefits.approximately two years after rudzinski filed her lawsuit,and more than two years after metlife initially denied her claim for benefits,metlife lawyer let slip in a settlement conference that an additional reason why she did not qualify for benefits was that sharp had discontinued payment of her disability premiums following the termination of her employment.the plan does not obligate sharp to make premium payments for any employee once the person is no longer working for it.based on this representation from metlife,rudzinski amended her complaint to add sharp as a defendant,alleging that sharp violated by wrongfully interfering with her disability benefit rights under the plan violated its fiduciary duties to her and misled her into believing that by obtaining a conversion policy and paying the necessary premiums,she could protect her rights to longterm disability benefits.
sharp responded to rudzinski claim in two ways.first,it filed a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim the district court denied that motion on april.second,sharp filed a against metlife,alleging that metlife breached its fiduciary duties to sharp under a,a,and a,when it stated in rudzinski presence that sharp nonpayment of premiums influenced its decision about her benefits metlife was equitably estopped from relying on sharp alleged nonpayment as a reason for denying rudzinski benefits and if sharp were found liable to rudzinski on any of her claims,metlife had to indemnify sharp.
on january,rudzinski voluntarily dismissed her claims against sharp.this action left two claims pending in the district court rudzinski claim against metlife,and sharp against metlife.metlife moved to dismiss sharp.it argued with respect to sharp assertion that metlife had breached a fiduciary duty that it owed to sharp that it owed no such duty.metlife also asserted that sharp indemnification claim was preempted by erisa.on january,the district court denied metlife motion to dismiss,holding that the question whether metlife owed any fiduciary duty to sharp was one of fact,and that sharp had stated a cognizable claim for indemnification that was not necessarily preempted by erisa.metlife then filed an answer to the,and in the meantime,the district court entered judgment in favor of rudzinski on her claim against metlife,finding that metlife wrongfully denied her benefits.
that left sharp against metlife as the only remaining claim before the district court.at that stage,the parties consented to the resolution of the claim before a magistrate judge.see c.the next event of any consequence occurred on april,when sharp filed an amended raising seven different theories of recovery against metlife breach of fiduciary duty under erisa,a,a,and a indemnification negligence negligent inducement negligent misrepresentation abuse of process and common law breach of fiduciary duty.
metlife responded on april,with a motion to dismiss the entire under rule b.metlife asserted that all of the theories outlined in sharp amended pleading were based upon statements made during the course of litigation.those statements,it maintained,were absolutely privileged and could not form the basis of any liability.metlife also argued that sharp lacked standing to pursue the claims,that the relief sought was not available to sharp,that the claims were preempted by erisa,and that because sharp had previously been dismissed from the case it could not recover damages,fees,or costs incurred in defending rudzinski against metlife.sharp resisted these arguments on their merits and also contended that metlife motion was barred by the law of the case because the district court earlier had denied metlife motion to dismiss the.
on july,the district court granted metlife motion,holding that the law of the case doctrine was inapplicable because the determination of metlife earlier motion to dismiss did not involve the claims as sharp presented them in its amended.the court then held that,although the statement made by metlife during the settlement conference was not privileged,metlife motion should be granted because metlife had not breached any fiduciary duty to sharp.the district court finally held that sharp remaining claims are preempted by erisa because,it thought,it would be impossible to resolve them without referring back to the plan to determine the parties obligations.
on appeal,sharp argues that the district court erred by failing to apply the law of the case doctrine and in granting metlife motion to dismiss.sharp also argues that the district court erred when it determined that sharp state law claims were preempted by erisa.we review a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under.b de novo,accepting as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.segal geisha nyc llc,cir.dismissal is required if,taking the properly pleaded facts in that light,the complaint fails to describe a claim that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,d.
we begin with a brief word about sharp assertion that the district court acted inconsistently with the law of the case when it granted metlife motion to dismiss the amended.there are two reasons why this point is not well taken.first,the law of the case doctrine has little force when a higher court is reviewing decisions of a lower court.the doctrine reflects the idea that a single court should not revisit its earlier rulings unless there is a compelling reason to do so.it is designed to further consistency,to avoid constantly revisiting rulings,and to conserve judicial resources.minch city of chicago,cir.from the point of view of this court,the district court first ruling is no more binding than any reconsideration of that ruling would be.second,the case changed in any event between the two rulings,and the district court was free to take a new look at it.when the court initially denied metlife motion to dismiss,it was faced only with sharp fiduciary breach claims and its indemnification claim.the picture changed with sharp amended.there,sharp repleaded its breach of fiduciary duty and indemnification claims.but it went on to drop the equitable estoppel claim that was present in the original and to add five state law claims negligence,negligent inducement,negligent misrepresentation,abuse of process,and common law breach of fiduciary duty.while it might have been useful for the judge to explain more fully why he was taking a fresh look at the case,we see no reason to belabor this point.our review in any event is de novo,and so we think it best simply to proceed to decide whether sharp amended includes any claim on which relief can be granted.minch,at.
sharp theory of the case is inventive,if nothing else.it asserts broadly that metlife had a fiduciary duty to it,and in particular a duty not to mislead plan participants or misrepresent the terms or administration of the plan.in sharp view,metlife was obliged under the plan to inform sharp and rudzinski of each and every basis for its denial of rudzinski claim during the claims process,to render its decisions of claims brought under the plan in a manner consistent with the terms and requirements of the plan and policy,and to advise sharp if any required premiums were owed.sharp reasons that when metlife told rudzinski that she was not entitled to benefits because sharp had ceased paying premiums,this amounted to a breach of fiduciary duty to sharp.metlife careless statement,sharp asserts,caused it to suffer damage,because it has been forced to expend sums of money on attorneys fees and related costs in defending itself against rudzinski lawsuit and in bringing this,and has been required to expend extensive amounts of employee time and resources into the investigation and defense of rudzinski claims.sharp wants a court order finding that metlife breached its fiduciary duty to sharp and an order requiring metlife to reimburse to the plan its losses resulting from metlife breach of fiduciary duty.it argues that it is entitled to this relief under erisa,a,a,and a.
the district court rejected this theory lock,stock,and barrel.the court ruled that erisa does not impose the fiduciary duties that sharp alleged,nor does it authorize the kind of relief sharp sought.as the court noted,sharp did sue to recover anything on behalf of the plan rather,it is suing to recover attorney fees and costs that it paid and there is no allegation that the plan paid these fees and costs nor is there any allegation that the plan lost anything as a result of the alleged breach.the court ultimately concluded that a imposes liability for plan losses only,and therefore sharp claim simply does not fit within the parameters of that statute.we agree with the district court assessment.this analysis applies with equal force to two additional theories that sharp advanced that it is entitled under a to bring a civil action for relief under a and that it has a direct right to recover under a.sharp complains on appeal that the district court erred by failing to address its claim for breach of fiduciary duties under a.there was no need for the district court to do so,however,given the fundamental conclusion that there was no fiduciary duty to begin with.
sharp urges this court to find that erisa does not limit breach of fiduciary duty claims to persons who are fiduciaries with respect to a plan.it bases its argument on the language of a.section a reads 
any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities,obligations,or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach,and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary,and shall be subject to other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate,including removal of such fiduciary.
a emphasis added.
sharp contends that the emphasized text is a second clause that sets forth no requirement that the fiduciary breach of fiduciary duty claim must be based on plan losses.unfortunately for sharp,however,the supreme court expressly rejected this reading in its decision in massachusetts mut.life ins.russell,d.there the court held that t o read directly from the opening clause of a,which identifies the proscribed acts,to the catchall remedy phrase at the over the intervening language establishing remedies benefitting,in the first instance,solely the divorce the phrase being construed from its context and construct an entirely new class of relief available to entities other than the plan.id.the court concluded that a fair contextual reading of the statute makes it abundantly clear that its draftsmen were primarily concerned with the possible misuse of plan assets,and with remedies that would protect the entire plan,rather than with the rights of an individual.id.at.
we can assume that metlife was a fiduciary with respect to the plan,and we can also assume that sharp was a fiduciary with respect to the plan.but this does not mean that either one was a fiduciary with respect to the other.their relationship was purely contractual metlife agreed to perform certain services for sharp,with respect to this benefits plan.see a defining circumstances in which a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan without any mention of fiduciary relationships arising between parties who contract for services johnson,cir this definition in a does not make a person who is a fiduciary for one purpose a fiduciary for every purpose.a person is a fiduciary to the extent that he performs one of the described duties people may be fiduciaries when they do certain things but be entitled to act in their own interests when they do others.put a little differently,sharp is not the kind of entity that congress had in mind for the protections it created in erisa.sharp argument based on a direct fiduciary duty therefore must be rejected.
sharp next argues that even if it could assert a claim to relief only on behalf of the plan,it met that standard at leas
