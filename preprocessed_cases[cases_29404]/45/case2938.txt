introduction 
when an insurance company becomes insolvent,the insurance code authorizes the liquidator who is usually the state insurance commissioner to bring an action to recover any money that was paid to a creditor of the company within four months of the filing of the petition for liquidation,if the payment had the effect of putting the creditor in a better position than another creditor of the same class in the liquidation.this case requires us to ascertain four separate questions concerning time periods which govern such preference actions 
how long is the statute of limitations the very nature of preference actions under section involves bona fide payments to creditors,not fraudulent that the statute for liabilities created by statute other than penalties or forfeitures should apply.see former code civ,now code civ,subs.a.preference actions under section are not penal in nature,but remedial.
when does the statute of limitations begin to run on a preference action under section both the plain text of the statute and analogous law in bankruptcy show that the statute of limitations begins to run when the liquidation petition is filed.only then is the liquidator able to institute a preference claim.indeed,a preference action can not even exist until there is a liquidation petition,so there is no way that a statute of limitations could start running until the filing of that petition.
for purposes of the period during which any transfers of property to a creditor of an insurer may become the target of a preference action,does the transfer occur when the transaction giving rise to the transfer occurs,or when the actual transfer is made because the statute treats transfers and transactions differently,and again in light of analogous bankruptcy law,the answer is the date of actual transfer,not the date on which the transaction giving rise to that transfer takes place.
for purposes of the requirement that any antecedent debt on which a preference may be based must be made or suffered before one year before the filing of a petition for liquidation,does a tort claim create an antecedent debt at the time the tort was allegedly committed,or when it is settled or results in a court judgment because liability on tort claims is only established after settlement or judgment,a tort claim does not give rise to an antecedent debt until settlement or judgment.
our answers to these questions mandate reversal of the trial court judgment,which was predicated on the statute of limitations having run on the preference claim of the insurance commissioner commissioner against lin lan,a former executive of western international insurance company.lan own claim against her former employer was actually paid just barely within four months of the commissioner filing a petition for liquidation,even though that claim was settled a little more than four months before the commissioner filing.
lan was ousted from her post as president of western international insurance company in.she then sued the company for wrongful termination and related causes of action.she sought large damages for emotional distress.her suit was settled in april for million.the money was paid in settlement of damages for lan claims of emotional distress and consequent physical manifestations of injury arising from western alleged acts of defamation,slander and libel.
the settlement agreement recited that it was made and entered into on april,and provided that western would pay lan the money before april.the actual payment was made on april.that is,on that day a cashier check was drawn on western account,given to lan,and she cashed it.
then came the los angeles riots of may western apparently insured a large number of businesses in the riot stricken area,and could not meet its claims.the commissioner filed an application for an order appointing a conservator for western on august.lan was not named as a defendant.
some two years later,on august,the commissioner filed an application for an order to show cause osc,naming lan as a defendant and seeking an order voiding the payment to lan as a preference.
then followed a detour to the appellate court,when,before the hearing on the commissioner osc scheduled for september,lan filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.the motion was denied and lan filed a petition for writ of mandate in response.
lan application for a stay of trial court proceedings pending further order of the appellate court was granted in an order filed november.the order was short,consisting of two sentences.the first sentence said that lan application for a stay was granted.the second sentence said,all trial court proceedings are stayed pending further order of this court.
our opinion was filed april,the opinion became final as to the court of appeal may see cal.rules of court,rule a.the remittitur was issued june.
in january,lan demurred to the osc on the ground that the insurance commissioner had no power to seek assets from a third party by way of such a summary proceeding.see generally kinder superior court d.commissioner had no power to utilize osc to recover sums paid agent of insolvent insurer.on february,while the demurrer was still pending,the commissioner filed an amended complaint voiding preference and for judgment directing turn over of funds.
in a summary judgment motion decided april,the trial court determined that the commissioner preference claim against lan was untimely for two reasons 
the transaction that the commissioner sought to void did not occur within four months of the filing for an order of liquidation,because the settlement was entered into april and the liquidation order was filed august and 
the settlement and transfer early april occurred more than three years before the filing of the amended complaint february,and did not relate back to the osc filed august.
the commissioner has timely appealed from the ensuing judgment.
iii.discussion 
background principles 
insurance companies are not eligible to be debtors under federal bankruptcy laws.b.when an insurer becomes insolvent it becomes subject to orderly liquidation under state law.see garamendi executive life ins.th,d congress made a policy declaration that the primary regulation of the business of insurance be in the states,not in the national government.
however,in dealing with problems related to insurer insolvencies,california courts may properly look to federal bankruptcy law for instructive analysis.see webster superior court cal d,fn,garamendi executive life ins,supra,th at,d.
one thing both systems have in common is preference actions.any system of law dealing with insolvencies must necessarily make some provision for preferences,that is,money paid to creditors on the eve of a bankruptcy or,in the case of insurers,of an insolvency petition which puts those creditors in a better position than they would be in if the money had been paid and they had to take their chances in the bankruptcy or liquidation along with all the other creditors.see generally mccoid,bankruptcy,preferences,and efficiency an expression of doubt.
it is important to recognize that preference actions brought by an insurance liquidator under section do not involve any implication of bad conduct.as justice wallin pointed out,in contrasting california insurance insolvency scheme with texas,our state does not require any intent that a creditor receive a preference over other creditors,or any knowledge on the creditor part that it is being given a preference.see in re title ins.th,d.
bankruptcy preference law,like section governing state insurance liquidations,may involve transactions that are made completely in good faith.true,the origins of preference actions in bankruptcy court may be traced to early decisions of the english courts centered around fraudulent transfers.but american bankruptcy law has evolved into a system of strict liability for transfers within a certain period,regardless of the good faith of the transaction.see mccoid,bankruptcy,preferences,and efficiency an expression of doubt,supra.at preference law has thus moved from a notion of debtor fraud to a standard of absolute liability for a limited period for preferred creditors.
the nature of preference actions entails two separate important time frames.the first is the time period which defines what a preference is.under the federal bankruptcy law,transfers of the debtor property within days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition may be preferences,recoverable by the trustee,b.california insurance insolvency law,as it relates to good faith transfers,makes the definitional time period within four months before the filing of the petition,subd.c.
the second time period lies on the other side of the petition for liquidation,the time within which the trustee in bankruptcy or the liquidator of an insurance company has to bring a preference action.in federal bankruptcy law,it is,at the risk of some overgeneralization,two years from the filing of the petition.a.however,the california preference statute applying to good faith transfers,section,does not contain any statute of limitations.and so we now address that problem.
b.the statute of limitations governs preference claims under section 
in the absence of a specified statute of limitations for preference claims under section two possibilities present themselves from the code of civil procedure a statute code civ,for statutory penalties or forfeitures,or the statute presently code civ,a for actions on liabilities created by statute other than penalties or forfeitures.the commissioner won this particular battle before the trial court,which held that the proper statute was the statute.lan argues on appeal that the statute is the more appropriate one.there is no doubt that any liability lan might incur from the commissioner preference claim is statutory and not a matter of common law.
the statute of limitations,including that contemplating forfeitures,is directed to claims of a penal nature.as this court explained in prudential home mortgage superior court th,d,the statute set out in section,subdivision of the code of civil procedure involves situations where an individual is allowed to recover against a wrongdoer,as a satisfaction for the wrong or injury suffered,and without reference to the actual damage sustained,or where there is punishment for some act which is in the nature of a public wrong.quoting county of los angeles ballerino cal,this opinion emphasis.
of course,a preference action arising out of a good faith transaction may seem like a forfeiture.one day a creditor has money,quite lawfully,the next day the creditor must give it back and get less or nothing as a result of the liquidation.however,a preference action is still not a forfeiture as the term has been construed for purposes of the statute.
f orfeiture is a penal concept.ojavan investors,california coastal com.th,d,citing black law dict.ed at.the word is typically used in a criminal context.ojavan investors,supra,th at,d.currently the most common examples of forfeitures involve property used in illegal drug dealing.such forfeitures are very penal indeed.
by the same token,our supreme court has held that statutory recoveries that were not penal but remedial in nature were not within the purview of the statute for penalties and forfeitures.see willcox edwards cal.
as we have explained above,preference claims under section control bona fide payments by insurers to their creditors made in good faith.there is no moral stigma to being the object of a preference claim under section.the operative test is merely whether one is better off than like creditors who were unlucky enough not to be paid within the four months preceding the liquidation petition.we therefore conclude that the applicable statute is the statute,section,subdivision a of the code of civil procedure.
our conclusion is confirmed by application of the statute in cases which most resemble this one,where there was a claim,under some statutory theory,for recovery of funds otherwise acquired by the defendant in good faith,blue cross of northern california cory d.state controller sought money held by insurer resulting from unnegotiated checks paid by insurer county of marin messner d,action to recover expenses paid to county surveyor without legal authority.
c.the statute of limitations commences to run with the filing of the liquidation petition 
at the outset,we must acknowledge the obvious it is counterintuitive to have a statute of limitations begin to run at some point later than the date of the transaction giving rise to the claim.then again,as every civil litigator knows,there are times when precisely that happens,as when a discovery rule is appropriate.for a handy summary of discovery rule jurisprudence,see justice rylaarsdam dissent in prudential home mortgage superior court,supra,th at pages,d.
if there is any one fundamental idea that dominates the interpretation of statutes of limitations,though,it is that they can not begin to run until the claimant has the right to sue somebody on the claim,until the cause of action has accrued.see code civ,civil actions,without exception,can only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title,after the cause of action shall have accrued,unless where,in special cases,a different limitation is prescribed by statute romano rockwell,cal th,d,the applicable statute of limitations does not begin to run until the cause of action accrues,that is,until the party owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action thereon.
it is impossible for the insurance commissioner to bring a preference action until a liquidation petition is filed.a preference does exist until the liquidation petition is filed.it is the filing of the liquidation petition that is the benchmark used to define those transactions that section considers preferences.the only way to apply the statute consistent with its text is to conclude that no preference claim accrues until the filing of the petition.otherwise,you have the completely illogical result that a statute of limitations could begin to run on a claim that had yet come into existence.
we need only add that federal bankruptcy law is,of course,analogous.as noted above,the statute of limitations on preference claims in bankruptcy does not begin to accrue until the filing of the bankruptcy petition at the earliest.see a.
d.the date of the transfer is the date of actual receipt of the property,not the date of the transaction giving rise to the receipt of the property 
we must now address an issue that involves the running of time,but is not,strictly speaking,a statute of limitations question.rather,it involves the definition of a preference claim under section,subdivision c.it arises because lan settlement with the insurer took place on april of four months before the filing of the petition on august she was actually paid on april,which was within the period of four months before the petition.
the simple answer is that the statute uses the word transfer,not transaction in the key phrase in section,subdivision c it reads,the transfer was made within four months before the filing of the petition,not the transaction was made 
the slightly more elaborate answer is that section treats the words transfer and transaction differently and emphasizes that difference in the overall text.the last sentence in the first paragraph of subdivision a of section the following transactions shall be among those that may be considered a preference emphasis added clearly shows that transfers are a subset of the class of things called transactions.
case law indicating that the date of a transaction is the date an agreement was made,not the date the actual check was delivered,is therefore inapposite.for purposes of section,we care about transfers of property,not transactions giving rise to transfers of property.
it is the same in bankruptcy,where a preference is defined in terms of the transfer of property days before the filing of a petition.barnhill johnson,d is on point.
in barnhill,the debtor or more precisely,the debtor in bankruptcy delivered a check to pay a bona fide debt on november date outside of days before the date of the bankruptcy petition.the check was honored by the bank on november day before the bankruptcy
