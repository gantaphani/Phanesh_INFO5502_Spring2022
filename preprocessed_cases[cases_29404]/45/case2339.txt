cummins holding llc holding appeals from the trial court order sustaining without leave to amend the demurrer of united states fidelity and guarantee company and united states fire insurance company collectively,the insurers or defendants to the complaint for declaratory relief filed by holding and cummins corporation cummins collectively,plaintiffs,dismissing holding claims.holding now contends the trial court erred when it found that holding did not have standing to participate in the declaratory relief action,which involved interpretation of insurance policies the insurers had previously issued to cummins.holding further contends the court abused its discretion when it found that holding could not successfully amend the complaint.we shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the complaint in this matter alleged the following facts.cummins,a california corporation formerly known as valley asbestos company,installed asbestos containing products in california,and had received hundreds of asbestos bodily injury claims,including many lawsuits,based on exposure to its asbestos containing materials.cummins purchased insurance policies issued by fidelity between july,and january,and purchased four insurance policies issued by the predecessor to fire between february,and january.these policies include primary,umbrella,and or excess insurance policies,some of which may be missing or only partially documented.
holding is a delaware limited liability company,formed on january,it is the parent and controlling shareholder of cummins.
on january,plaintiffs filed a complaint for declaratory relief against the insurers,in which they sought,in a single cause of action and pursuant to code of civil procedure section a declaratory judgment that defendants are obligated to defend indemnify cummins,in full,including,without limitation,payment of the cost of investigation,defense,settlement and judgment,for past,present and future asbestos suits under each of the policies triggered by the asbestos suits.plaintiffs also sought additional,detailed declarations regarding the duties of the insurers with respect to asbestos actions against cummins the complaint further alleged that the insurance companies dispute the relief plaintiffs assert is available under the policies.consequently,an actual and justiciable controversy exists between plaintiffs and defendants concerning defendants respective obligations under their policies.
on february,fidelity removed the case to federal court,alleging that holding had been fraudulently joined as a plaintiff and that its citizenship should be ignored for diversity purposes.on may,the united states district court found that complete diversity did not exist and that it therefore did not have jurisdiction,requiring that the matter be remanded to the state trial court 
on july,fidelity demurred to holding cause of action for declaratory relief on the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,in that t he complaint is devoid of any allegation that holding is an insured under any of the insurance policies alleged in the complaint or otherwise in privity with fidelity and,consequently,holding lacks standing 
on september,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend explaining fidelity asserts that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts as to the holding company plaintiff,holding,for a claim for declaratory relief under section.fidelity argues that the complaint does not state that holding was an insured under any alleged insurance policies,state that it was an additional insured,or otherwise demonstrate privity with fidelity.rather,the complaint admits that the subsidiary,cummins,an installer of insulation,was the insured.fidelity argues that holding can not be interested under a written instrument as required by section,and that there is no legal theory under which holding co.could assert any underlying claim against fidelity.
the court agrees that plaintiffs have not pleaded,and apparently can not plead facts needed for holding co.to be a person interested under a written instrument such that holding co.has standing to seek a declaration of its rights under such an instrument.while most of fidelity authorities are not on point,the court is somewhat persuaded,not just by the plain language of section,but by dictum in otay land royal indem.th,which suggests that while section is broad,to have standing a party must show that it has some cognizable legal theory 
plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they can amend to address this issue,and in light of the facts already pleaded,it would appear to be futile.the court then granted the joinder of fire and dismissed holding claims.
on september,holding filed a notice of appeal 
discussion 
holding contends the trial court incorrectly concluded it did not have standing to participate in the declaratory relief action.holding further contends the court abused its discretion when it found that holding could not successfully amend the complaint.
for purposes of analyzing the ruling on demurrer,we give the pleading a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole,its parts in their context,to determine whether sufficient facts are stated to constitute a cause of action or a right to the relief requested.citation.if a demurrer was sustained without leave to amend,but the defect was curable by amendment,we would find an abuse of discretion in that ruling.however,if the order is correct as a matter of law,we would not reverse it.citation.otay land royal indem,supra,th at pp.otay,citing blank kirwan cal d,blank.
section provides in relevant part any person interested under a written instrument or under a contract,or who desires a declaration of his or her rights or duties with respect to another,or in respect to,in,over or upon property may,in cases of actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties,bring an original action or in the superior court for a declaration of his or her rights and duties in the premises,including a determination of any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument or contract.he or she may ask for a declaration of rights or duties,either alone or with other relief and the court may make a binding declaration of these rights or duties,whether or not further relief is or could be claimed at the time 
while section language appears to allow for an extremely broad scope of an action for declaratory relief otay,supra,th at,an actual controversy that is currently active is required for such relief to be issued,and both standing and ripeness are appropriate criteria in that determination.citation.id.at.one can not analyze requested declaratory relief without evaluating the nature of the rights and duties that plaintiff is asserting,which must follow some recognized or cognizable legal theories that are related to subjects and requests for relief that are properly before the court.ibid.in the context of a demurrer,the court will evaluate whether the factual allegations of the complaint for declaratory relief reveal that an actual controversy exists between the parties.citation.id.at.
in addition,under section,the court may refuse to exercise the power granted by this chapter in any case where its declaration or determination is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances.section must be read together with section.meyer sprint spectrum cal th.the trial court determination that a declaration is not necessary or proper in the circumstances is discretionary,subject to reversal only for an abuse of that discretion.otay,supra,th at.
