background 
the following summary of the facts is drawn primarily from the district court opinion.see pennington state farm mut.auto.ins,wl,at.july.on july,stacey pennington was killed in an automobile accident when sidney walker,who was driving his motorcycle while intoxicated,disregarded a traffic signal and collided with her ford mustang.walker was insured by progressive insurance company,which settled the claim against him for its bodily injury limit.dennis and sharon pennington then asserted a claim on behalf of stacey estate for uim payments under their state farm policy.
in november,the penningtons and state farm agreed to a release and reservation of rights to other claims.in exchange for,representing the payment for one unit of uim coverage,the penningtons agreed to release state farm from all claims arising out of stacey death with the exception of any and all other actual or potential claims against state farm for payment of additional underinsured motorist coverages under its automobile policies.the penningtons subsequently filed this action in the scott county,kentucky,circuit court.they sought to recover two additional units of uim coverage,full personal injury protection coverage,and damages for unfair claims faith.state farm removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.
according to the record,the penningtons state farm policy covered five automobiles and one motorcycle at the time of the accident.the penningtons purchased uim coverage on only one of the oldsmobile the policy covered the four drivers in the pennington household at all times,the coverage was personal to the drivers,not limited to the particular vehicle.according to the policy declarations page,the penningtons paid for uim coverage limits of per person per accident.at the time the penningtons purchased the policy,the premium for one unit of uim coverage was,the rate was,and the driver rate was.jay hieb,vice president in actuary with state farm,testified by deposition that state farm premium was structured to charge more for the increased risk borne by the company as a result of providing personal coverage to additional drivers.although the penningtons received uim coverage for four drivers,their premium was not simply a multiplier of coverage,multiplying the base premium rate by the number of drivers.rather,if a multiplier of coverage had been used,the family would have been charged four times the base premium for the four drivers in the household.the penningtons uim premium was instead determined based on a rating factor of only.state farm arrived at the multiplier after an actuary calculated the added risk associated with adding additional drivers to a single uim policy.the final price for uim coverage paid by the penningtons was calculated by multiplying the rate of by,the risk multiplier that state farm had determined was appropriate for households with three or more drivers x.
apparently viewing the material facts as undisputed,both parties moved for summary judgment.state farm motion was granted by the district court.the court first noted that the issue of whether an insurance company can charge greater uim premiums based on the number of insured drivers on a policy without being exposed to stacking is a matter of first impression,and then held that stacking was inappropriate because the penningtons had purchased only one unit of uim coverage for four drivers and had received added coverage for the additional cost.pennington,wl,at.this is the only issue that the penningtons raise on appeal.in july,after briefing was completed,the penningtons filed a motion asking us to certify to the kentucky supreme court the question of whether,under kentucky law,an insurance company is subject to the stacking of uim coverage if it charges a greater uim premium based on the number of insured drivers in a household.

certification to the kentucky supreme court 
the decision whether or not to utilize a certification procedure lies within the sound discretion of the district court.transam.ins.duro bag,cir citing lehman schein,d.certification is most appropriate when the question is new and state law is unsettled.id.citing lehman,at.as the tenth circuit has noted,however,the federal courts generally will not trouble our sister state courts every time an arguably unsettled question of state law comes across our desks.when we see a reasonably clear and principled course,we will seek to follow it ourselves.pino united states,cir.
we first note that the penningtons failed to request certification of the legal question at issue when the case was before the district court.likewise,on appeal,the penningtons failed to request certification until well after the parties had completed briefing.both this court and district court have therefore expended considerable time and resources addressing the question currently before us.and although the legal question here is one of first impression under kentucky law,we believe that the relevant caselaw addressing uim premiums and stacking provides sufficient guidance to allow us to make a clear and principled decision.because we see no reason to trouble the kentucky supreme court under such circumstances,we deny the penningtons motion to certify and will address the merits of the case.
