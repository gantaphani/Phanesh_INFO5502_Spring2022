a health maintenance organization hmo commonly manages medical care in california.in the typical model,familiar to many,doctors contract to provide medical care to enrolled hmo members.members generally use the services of one of the contracting doctors.when they do,and except for copayments the members must make when services are rendered,the hmo or its delegate pays the doctor under the existing contract.in this way,the parties agree upon,and know in advance,what their obligations and rights are and who must pay,and how much,for medical care.
the typical payment model sometimes breaks down,however,in the case of emergency care.in an emergency,an hmo member goes to the nearest hospital emergency room for treatment.the emergency room doctors at that hospital may or may not have previously contracted with the hmo to provide care to its members.in that situation,the doctors are statutorily required to provide emergency care without regard to the patient ability to pay.additionally,when the patient is a member of an hmo,the hmo is statutorily required to pay for the emergency care for hmo members,it is always clear in advance who has to provide emergency emergency room doctor to whom the member goes in an who has to pay for those hmo.the conflict arises when there is no advance agreement between the emergency room doctors and the hmo regarding the amount of the required payment.
thus,the potential inherently exists for disputes between the emergency room doctors and the hmo regarding how much the hmo owes the doctors for emergency services.when no preexisting contract exists,the doctors sometimes submit a bill to the hmo that they consider reasonable for the services rendered but that the hmo considers unreasonably high conversely,the hmo sometimes makes a payment that it considers reasonable for the services rendered but that the doctors consider unreasonably low.the resolution of such disputes can create difficult problems.
but the question of how to resolve disputes between the doctors and the hmo over the amount due for emergency care is not before us in this case.the issue here is narrow,although quite important for emergency room doctors,hmo,and their members when the hmo submits a payment lower than the amount billed,can the emergency room doctors directly bill the patient for the difference between the bill submitted and the payment,engage in the practice called balance billing 
interpreting the applicable statutory scheme as a the health care service plan act of,health and safety code section et.act we conclude that billing disputes over emergency medical care must be resolved solely between the emergency room doctors,who are entitled to a reasonable payment for their services,and the hmo,which is obligated to make that payment.a patient who is a member of an hmo may not be injected into the dispute.emergency room doctors may not bill the patient for the disputed amount.
factual and procedural background 
because neither party petitioned the court of appeal for a rehearing,we take our facts largely from that court opinion.richmond shasta community services dist.cal th,d,see cal.rules of court,rule c.
plaintiffs and appellants,prospect medical group,et alia collectively prospect,are individual practice associations prospect manages patient care by executing written contracts with health care service plans it provides for medical care to persons who are members of a health care service plan and who select a prospect physician.prospect also provides billing services to the health care service plans contracted with prospect.as such,it is a delegate of those health care service plans and is statutorily obligated to pay for emergency services provided to patients who have subscribed to those health care service plans,subds.b e.
defendants and respondents,northridge emergency medical group and saint john emergency medicine specialists,collectively emergency physicians,have exclusive licenses at two california hospitals to provide emergency room physician care.emergency physicians are health care providers and are statutorily required to provide emergency care without regard to an individual insurance or ability to pay,subd.d see also.
when patients who are members of a health care service plan schedule medical services in advance,they generally go to physicians with whom the health care service plan or its delegate,like prospect,has an express preexisting contract.on occasion,when these same patients need emergency medical care,they may be taken to a hospital where the doctors staffing the emergency room do not have a preexisting contract with the health care plan or its delegate.in this case,after emergency physicians provided emergency medical services to patients who were members of health care service plans that contracted with prospect,they submitted reimbursement claims to prospect.sometimes prospect paid emergency physicians less than the amount billed.in those cases,prospect paid what it alleged was reasonable for the services rendered.emergency physicians then billed the patients directly for the differences between the bills they submitted and what prospect paid.the parties refer to this practice as balance billing.
after billing disputes arose between prospect and emergency physicians,prospect filed two related actions against emergency physicians seeking,among other things,a judicial determination that emergency physicians were entitled only to reasonable compensation for emergency medical care,which prospect claimed was equivalent to the medicare rate and the practice of balance billing is unlawful.in one of the actions,prospect alleged that saint john emergency medicine specialists,routinely bills prospect patients,threatens to turn over prospect patients to an outside collection agency,and threatens to take legal measures against prospect patients.the trial court sustained emergency physicians demurrers without leave to amend and entered judgments accordingly.prospect appealed both judgments,and the court of appeal consolidated the appeals.
the court of appeal concluded that balance billing is not statutorily prohibited.second,it concluded that prospect is not entitled to a judicial declaration imposing the medicare rate as the reasonable rate.third,it concluded the trial court abused its discretion by denying leave to amend the complaint to permit prospect to allege that emergency physicians charged more than a reasonable rate for a specific medical procedure.we granted prospect petition for review,which raised the sole question whether emergency physicians may engage in balance billing.
ii.discussion 
the act governs this case.the act is a comprehensive system of licensing and regulation under the jurisdiction of the department of managed health care.bell blue cross of california th,d bell.in addition,one statute not part of the act is pertinent here.section requires emergency care providers to provide emergency services without first questioning the patient ability to pay.bell,supra,th at fn,d.federal law is similar.see bell,supra,at,fn,d.
today,by statute,when emergency room doctors provide emergency services,hmo are required to reimburse those doctors for the services rendered to their subscribers or enrollees.as bell explained,the act compels health care service plans to reimburse emergency health care providers for emergency services to the plans enrollees s ection provides that a health care service plan shall reimburse providers for emergency services and care provided to its enrollees,until the care results in stabilization of the enrollee,except as provided in subdivision c.as long as federal or state law requires that emergency services and care be provided without first questioning the patient ability to pay,a health care service plan shall not require a provider to obtain authorization prior to the provision of emergency services and care necessary to stabilize the enrollee emergency medical condition,subd.b see,subd.f.payment for emergency services and care may be denied only if the health care service plan reasonably determines that the emergency services and care were never performed,subd.c see,subd.f and see,tit,subd.a.bell,supra,th at,d.subdivision b of section was enacted in to impose a mandatory duty upon health care plans to reimburse noncontracting providers for emergency medical services.citations.id.at,d.
the combination of circumstances that in an emergency a patient might go to emergency room doctors who have no preexisting contractual relationship with the hmo,the doctors are required to render emergency care without asking whether the patient can pay for it,and the hmo is required to pay the doctors for those services,creates the problem underlying the issue before us.by the very nature of things,disputes may arise regarding how much the emergency room doctors may charge and how much the hmo must pay for emergency services.
regulations of the department of managed health care provide that the hmo must pay the reasonable and customary value for the health care services rendered based upon statistically credible information that is updated at least annually and takes into consideration i the provider training,qualifications,and length of time in practice ii the nature of the services provided iii the fees usually charged by the provider iv prevailing provider rates charged in the general geographic area in which the services were rendered v other aspects of the economics of the medical provider practice that are relevant and vi any unusual circumstances in the case,tit,subd.a b see bell,supra,th at,d.thus,the hmo has a duty to pay a reasonable and customary amount for the services rendered.bell,supra,at,d.but how this amount is determined can create obvious difficulties.in a given case,a reasonable amount might be the bill the doctor submits,or the amount the hmo chooses to pay,or some amount in between.in bell,supra,th,d,the court of appeal interpreted the act to permit,when disputes arise,emergency room doctors to sue the hmo directly for the reasonable value of their services.
prospect argues that section,part of the act,prohibits balance billing.that section,enacted in and never amended,provides 
a every contract between a plan and a provider of health care services shall be in writing,and shall set forth that in the event the plan fails to pay for health care services as set forth in the subscriber contract,the subscriber or enrollee shall not be liable to the provider for any sums owed by the plan.
b in the event that the contract has not been reduced to writing as required by this chapter or that the contract fails to contain the required prohibition,the contracting provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the plan.
c no contracting provider,or agent,trustee or assignee thereof,may maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the plan.
although no express contractual relationship exists between prospect and emergency physicians,prospect argues that the combination of statutes requiring emergency room doctors to render,and hmo to pay for,emergency services creates an implied contract between emergency room doctors and hmo that has not been reduced to writing under section,subdivision b.the court of appeal disagreed.interpreting section as a whole but not in the context of the act as a whole,it held that this section does not cover the situation here.it found that the language of subdivision b of section refers to and includes within its scope only voluntarily negotiated contracts between providers of health care services,like emergency physicians,and health care service plans or their delegates,like prospect,based upon traditional contractual principles such as a meeting of the minds.subdivision b does not include within its scope the implied contract as prospect asserts.accordingly,it conclude d that section,subdivision b,was not intended to,and does not,prohibit the balance billing practices alleged in this case.
reading the language of section in isolation,it does not readily apply to the precise situation here.no doubt the legislature did not contemplate the situation of this case in,when it enacted section,for this situation did not exist in.section,which obligates hmo to pay for emergency services to its subscribers,was enacted in,long after the legislature enacted section.but we must not view section in isolation.we do not examine statutory language in isolation,but in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine its scope and purpose and to harmonize the various parts of the enactment.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.
we have already seen that in,the legislature banned balance billing when an hmo is contractually obligated to pay the bill that since,hmo have been obligated to pay for emergency care and that the act permits emergency room doctors to sue hmo directly over billing disputes bell,supra,th,d.these provisions strongly suggest that doctors may not bill patients directly when a dispute arises between doctors and the hmo.other provisions point in the same direction.section,subdivision d,which requires emergency room doctors to render emergency care without questioning a patient ability to pay,also provides that the patient or his or her legally responsible relative or guardian shall execute an agreement to pay for the services or otherwise supply insurance or credit information promptly after the services are rendered.italics added.this provision implies that once patients who are members of an hmo provide insurance information,they have satisfied their obligation towards the doctors.section,subdivision d,expresses a legislative intent to help to ensure the best possible health care for the public at the lowest possible cost by transferring the financial risk of health care from patients to providers.
additionally,the legislature contemplated there may be disputes over the amounts owed to noncontracting providers such as emergency room doctors,and therefore the act requires that each hmo shall ensure that a dispute resolution mechanism is accessible to noncontracting providers for the purpose of resolving billing and claims disputes,subd.h see also,subd.a directing the of managed health care to adopt regulations ensuring that each hmo adopt a dispute resolution mechanism that is fair,fast,and for contracting and noncontracting providers.finally,the legislature has acted to protect the interests of noncontracting providers in reimbursement disputes by prohibiting hmo from engaging in unfair payment patterns involving unjust payment reductions,claim denials,and other unfair practices as defined,and by authorizing monetary and other penalties against hmo that engage in these patterns.see also authorizing providers to report hmo that engage in unfair payment patterns to the of managed health care.
the only reasonable interpretation of a statutory scheme that intends to transfer the financial risk of health care from patients to providers requires emergency care patients to agree to pay for the services or to supply insurance information requires hmo to pay doctors for emergency services rendered to their subscribers prohibits balance billing when the hmo,and not the patient,is contractually required to pay requires adoption of mechanisms to resolve billing disputes between emergency room doctors and hmo and permits emergency room doctors to sue hmo directly to resolve billing disputes,is that emergency room doctors may not bill patients directly for amounts in dispute.emergency room doctors must resolve their differences with hmo and not inject patients into the dispute.interpreting the statutory scheme as a whole,we conclude that the doctors may not bill a patient for emergency services that the hmo is obligated to pay.balance billing is not permitted 
any doubt about the meaning of the act in this regard is easily resolved when legislative policy is considered.if statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,and public policy.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.we perceive a clear legislative policy not to place patients in the middle of billi
