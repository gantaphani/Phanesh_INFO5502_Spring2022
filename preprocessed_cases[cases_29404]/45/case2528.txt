progressive west insurance company progressive appeals from the amended judgment on special verdict in favor of cedric mccoy on his insurance bad faith action arising from denial of his vehicle theft claim.based on our review of the record and applicable law,we affirm the judgment.
the trial court properly refused to give progressive requested genuine dispute instructions.the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of domestic violence and evidence of,and comment on,an automobile accident,both of which are unrelated to the car theft.the court acted within its discretion in denying admission of the entire claims file and evidence in the form of the tapes,transcripts,and summaries of all recorded investigative statements where no good cause was shown.progressive fails to show prejudice flowing from its unsuccessful evidentiary claims.substantial evidence supports the bad faith finding and award of punitive damages.
background 
in his complaint,mccoy alleged on or about march,his ford mustang was stolen in las vegas,nevada,and when recovered,the mustang,which had been burned and damaged,was essentially of no value.this theft was a covered loss under his policy,and mccoy promptly reported the loss to progressive,his insurer.progressive breached the insurance contract and violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by,among other things,failing to promptly,fairly and fully investigate the claim and by unreasonably and without proper cause withholding benefits owed him under the policy.progressive answered with a general denial and asserted various affirmative defenses,including its investigation was reasonable and within the standards for good claims handling.
at trial,mccoy testified he had been employed with the united states navy for seven years as an air traffic controller and was a tower supervisor.on march,he went to a casino in las vegas.upon his return about or the next morning,his car was missing from the casino parking lot.he notified the police and progressive.mccoy denied he had anything to do with the theft or burning of his car.he denied calling and telling his then wife katrina his car had been stolen.he further denied telling his brother clinton numerous times prior to that day he wanted to get rid of his car.mccoy also denied telling katrina and clinton he wanted to upgrade to a cobra mustang.about that afternoon,the police notified mccoy his car had been recovered.progressive never paid his claim.
charles chipps morin,a progressive special unit investigator sui,testified mccoy mustang had sustained damage to the front bumper,the controls by the driver side door had been ripped out,and wires were exposed.the car also had been partially burned.morin,who believed mccoy was involved in the theft of his car,observed no obvious trauma to the ignition and thought it was unusual that the expensive tires were still on the car.a credit check ran by morin revealed mccoy paid on time.as of,morin had no specific proof that mccoy was involved in the theft of his own car.he acknowledged that mustangs were frequently stolen and that las vegas was one of the car theft capitals in the united states.he further acknowledged that he had not ruled out whether the car had been stolen by means of a tow truck or duplicate key.
katrina telephoned morin regarding the car theft.on april,morin took katrina statement.she related that mccoy had talked about disposing of his car for some time,and she referred morin to clinton for more information.on may,morin spoke with clinton,who appeared credible.clinton told morin that mccoy wanted to buy an expensive cobra mustang.on october,katrina again called morin and stuck to her original story.
katrina told morin that clinton and mccoy had a mixed relationship,clinton loved mccoy but mccoy had some behavior problems.morin knew katrina might have some hostility or ill will toward mccoy because of their divorce,which occurred in july.morin wanted to examine mccoy under oath and to meet with katrina and clinton to assess their credibility.progressive did not give him authorization to do so.
morin acknowledged that,pursuant to sui standard operating procedures,he was required to determine a claim was fraudulent before reporting the claim to the department of insurance doi and not to report the claim to the police or any regulatory authority until after a claim decision had been made.he admitted that although the claim was not denied until march,he already had contacted the doi and various law enforcement officers and regulatory agents as early as april,and through january.he acknowledged on february,by letter,the doi advised progressive there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal investigation.
anthony prieto,a progressive fire and theft representative,testified that mccoy policy covered theft and was in effect at the time of the theft.mccoy car was a total loss.prieto suspected fraud on the part of mccoy,because mccoy and his friend angela had travelled to las vegas from california in separate cars.
mccoy provided prieto with a recorded statement on april.prieto admitted mccoy also provided other documents progressive requested and that mccoy claim was not denied until march,or nine months after mccoy affidavit of theft had been received.prieto testified that progressive had the duty to affirm or deny a coverage claim within days or,if fraud were suspected,within days.he admitted that if doubts arose during an investigation they would be resolved in favor of coverage for the insured.
prieto acknowledged that a signed consent was required to remove major components from an insured car and that mccoy consent was only received on june,a date after progressive had removed the car steering column assembly.
eugene evans,mccoy expert,testified that progressive claim handling was below the standard in the insurance industry,and that it did meet certain doi regulations.specifically,progressive failed to give the insured the benefit of the doubt and the investigation was conducted largely to prove what they had already concluded in their own minds.and no investigation was conducted to show that mccoy claim might be valid.
evans further opined that progressive should have concluded mccoy claim was valid and it should have paid the claim.he explained that,after investigating its initial suspicions of fraud,progressive did not have enough information or evidence to conclude mccoy was an insurance fraud.evans testified it appeared mccoy had no financial motive,because he owed more on the vehicle than it was worth if sold,and,thus,any loss on the vehicle would have been based upon the actual cash value of the vehicle at the time of the loss,and mccoy would have still owed money to the financing company in addition to having to get another car and make payments on that.
he opined that neither mccoy nor mccoy brother was a reliable witness.katrina recanted her statements,and,after reading the transcripts of clinton examination and watching a cd of the examination,evans felt it was not conclusive.he agreed with a note from a supervisor in the claims file stating we ca just rely on having two witnesses like this,because they are not conclusive.and if we do come up with something else,we are going to have to pay the claim.he added a tie goes to the insured.if you ca prove what is wrong,you pay the claim.evans noted progressive did not take into account the information favorable to mccoy,his long time employment with the navy,his responsible job,his payment of his bills,and his schooling.
he pointed out days is the maximum that you are supposed to take to make up your mind about a claim,and progressive went far beyond that.progressive also failed to comply with the doi regulations regarding correspondence to keep the insured up to date about the claim.
evans opined progressive failed to follow its own sui guidelines by attempting to turn over mccoy claim to policing agencies before completing its investigation.progressive also violated insurance industry practice by removing the steering column from mccoy car before receiving written permission.he noted progressive damaged it in the process so that
