amco insurance company amco issued a commercial general liability cgl policy to lyle lyerla,wildewood construction lyerla.when lyerla was sued in a dispute arising out of a construction contract,he tendered notice of the suit to amco.amco refused to defend lyerla and after he settled the underlying lawsuit,lyerla sued amco for breach of contract.the district court granted summary judgment for amco and this appeal followed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
in march,scott riddlemoser and kathleen mcnulty owners hired lyerla to build a residential dwelling according to particular plans and specifications.the construction contract required that construction be completed by july.the contract also gave the owners days after the house was completed to provide lyerla with a list of any defects,incomplete or unsatisfactory items the punchlist items with respect to contractor work.lyerla was obligated to cure any punchlist items within days of receiving the list.lyerla warranted and guaranteed his work and promised to repair any defects within seven days of receiving notice.in addition,the contract required lyerla to pay liquidated damages if the project was not completed on time per day for the first days and per day for each day thereafter.
on january,the owners sued lyerla for breach of contract,alleging that he had failed to construct the building pursuant to the plans and specifications had failed to complete punchlist items within the time frame provided under the contract had failed to build the home in a workmanlike manner had failed to correct defects in seven days,as required by the contract and had failed to pay liquidated damages.the owners sought to recover costs they incurred completing lyerla work as well as storage fees,finance charges,loss of work,attorneys fees and court costs.on march,lyerla tendered notice of the lawsuit to amco.amco denied coverage in july.lyerla settled with the owners for.
lyerla subsequently brought this lawsuit against amco in illinois state court for breach of contract and for violating the illinois insurance code.amco removed the action to federal court and filed a counterclaim against lyerla seeking a declaration that the underlying claim was not covered by the policy and that amco had no duty to defend or indemnify lyerla.
both parties moved for summary judgment.in april,the district court held a hearing on the motions and the case was taken under advisement.on may,lyerla moved to file a supplemental motion for summary judgment based on a recent decision of the illinois appellate court,country mut.ins.carr,d,and additional information about the policy in question and additional legal authority that has not yet been given to this court.the court granted lyerla motion in part,allowing lyerla to file a supplemental brief to address recent case law.when lyerla filed his supplemental brief,amco moved to strike on the grounds that rather than simply explaining the relevance of recent case law,lyerla sought to relitigate issues and presented new arguments in his supplemental brief.the district court granted amco motion but indicated that it would consider carr.
in july,lyerla moved to amend his complaint in order to add two counts of breach of fiduciary duty.the district court denied this motion and granted summary judgment for amco.it concluded that the underlying complaint did not allege an occurrence or property damage as defined by lyerla cgl policy.lyerla appeals the district court decision.the basis of federal jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship the parties agree that illinois law governs their dispute.

illinois insurance law provides that an insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.outboard marine,at.an insurer is obligated to defend its insured if the underlying complaint contains allegations that potentially fall within the scope of coverage.agents ins.of,midwest sporting goods.in order to determine whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured,we must compare the allegations in the underlying complaint to the language of the insurance policy.id.if the underlying complaint alleges facts within or potentially within policy coverage,an insurer is obligated to defend its insured even if the allegations are groundless,false or fraudulent.id.an insurer may not justifiably refuse to defend an action against its insured unless it is clear from the face of the underlying complaint that the allegations fail to state facts which bring the case within,or potentially within,the policy coverage.united states fid.guar.wilkin insulation,emphasis in original.we begin our examination of amco obligations under the cgl policy mindful that t he underlying complaint and the insurance polic y must be liberally construed in favor of the insured.id.
the policy that lyerla purchased from amco provides that amco will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.the policy 
applies to bodily injury and property damage only if 
the bodily injury or property damage is caused by an occurrence that takes place in the coverage territory and 
the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.
occurrence is defined as an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.property damage is defined as 
physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it or 
loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.all such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.
amco duty to defend turns on whether the underlying complaint alleges property damage that was caused by an occurrence,that is,an accident.if it does,amco obligations to lyerla will be triggered unless a particular policy exclusion eliminates coverage.see viking constr,liberty mut.ins,d.
property damage caused by an occurrence under illinois law 
lyerla contends that the district court erred in concluding that the underlying complaint in the owners lawsuit against him did not allege property damage caused by an occurrence as defined by lyerla cgl policy.although lyerla cgl policy defines an occurrence as an accident,it does not define accident.illinois courts construing insurance policies have defined accident as an unforeseen occurrence,usually of an untoward or disastrous character or an undesigned,sudden,or unexpected event of an inflictive or unfortunate character.westfield ins.cont l cmty.bank trust,d,citing aetna cas.sur.freyer,d.in cases involving the interpretation of cgl policies like the one at issue in this case,illinois courts have reasoned that damage to a construction project resulting from construction defects is not an accident or occurrence because it represents the natural and ordinary consequence of faulty construction 
for example,in monticello ins,d,a contractor that had entered into an agreement with the city of naperville to build a municipal building and adjoining parking garage sought coverage under a cgl policy after the city sued it for breach of contract.the city alleged various construction defects,including cracks in the walls of the garage leaking in the garage water damage to the building and basement defective doors and other miscellaneous construction defects,at.the court concluded that the defects were the natural and ordinary consequences of the improper construction techniques of and its subcontractors and,thus,did not constitute an occurrence within the definition in the cgl policy,at.
more recently,in viking construction management,a school district contracted with viking to manage the construction of a school.portions of a wall collapsed as a result of inadequate bracing that had been installed by a subcontractor,causing property damage and injuring a construction worker.the school district sued viking for breach of contract and sought damages that included the cost of repairing and replacing the damaged portion of the building.the court concluded that liberty mutual did not have a duty to defend viking because the damages claimed by the district were the natural and ordinary consequences of defective workmanship and,accordingly,did not constitute an occurrence.viking constr,at see also stoneridge dev,essex ins,d,cracks that developed in home were not an unforeseen occurrence that would qualify as an accident,because they were the natural and ordinary consequences of defective workmanship state farm fire cas.tillerson,d,where the defect is no more than the natural and ordinary consequences of faulty workmanship,it is not caused by an accident.indiana ins.hydra,d,no occurrence where the defects in the underlying complaint,the cracks in the floor and the loose paint on the exterior of the building,are the natural and ordinary consequences of installing defective concrete flooring and applying the wrong type of paint bituminous cas.gust newberg constr,d,no occurrence where underlying complaint alleged faulty air conditioning system had been installed in state building because the allegations of extreme temperatures in the building are no more than the natural and ordinary consequences of installing an inadequate hvac system.precedent thus strongly supports the district court conclusion that the owners allegations of defective work do not constitute an accident or occurrence.
despite this line of authority,however,there is some support for the position that negligently performed work or defective work can give rise to an occurrence in illinois.in prisco serena sturm architects,liberty mut.ins,cir,we concluded that a construction manager negligent performance of its work resulted in an occurrence.id.at.but that case relied on the fact that occurrence as defined by the policy included continuous or repeated exposure to conditions.the insured negligence in uncovering defects in the construction constituted continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,and thus,an occurrence.see also wilkin insulation,at the continuous exposure of the buildings and their contents to released asbestos fibers constituted an accident that resulted in property damage.in country mutual insurance carr,which was the impetus for lyerla supplemental summary judgment memorandum,homeowners sued a general contractor for allegedly negligently placing inappropriate backfill around the basement walls of their home and negligently operating equipment near those walls,resulting in damage to the basement walls and to other parts of the home,at.country mutual argued that the underlying complaint against the contractor did not allege an occurrence and the trial court agreed,granting the insurer motion for judgment on the pleadings.
on appeal,the court acknowledged that a number of illinois courts have concluded that the natural and ordinary consequences of an act do not constitute an accident,but stated that in determining whether an act or event is an accident,the real question is whether the person performing the acts leading to the result intended or expected the result.if the person did not intend or expect the result,then the result was the product of an accident,at citing wilkin insulation,at yates bankers life cas,lyons state farm fire cas,d.the court concluded that the underlying complaint did not allege that defendant,his employees or agents,or subcontractors intended or expected,by their use of allegedly inappropriate backfill material or their allegedly negligent operation of heavy earthmoving equipment near the basement walls,that the walls would move or be damaged.id,at.therefore,the complaint alleged an accident.
thus,carr suggests that work that is performed negligently can cause an occurrence resulting in property damage.ultimately,however,carr does not help lyerla.in the present case,the underlying complaint alleges that lyerla 
failed to construct the building and other improvements pursuant to the plans and specifications attached to the construction contract.
f ailed to substantially complete the building and other improvements on or before july.
failed to complete said punch list items as required within days.
failed to construct the building and other improvements in a good workmanship manner.
failed to correct defects within days as required in section of the construction contract.
the complaint avers that lyerla work did not satisfy his contractual obligations and does not contain any facts alleging property damage caused by an occurrence.the owners did not allege a physical injury to tangible property,since tangible property suffers a physical injury when the property is altered in appearance,shape,color or in other material dimension.travelers ins.eljer.the complaint alleges nothing of the kind.in carr,the underlying complaint alleged that the negligence of the contractor or his subcontractors resulted in damage to the homeowners basement walls and other parts of their home.as the court in that case recognized,the homeowners allege d physical injury to tangible property,their basement walls,at.thus,the underlying complaint alleged property damage triggering coverage under the contractor cgl policy.id.in the present case,the underlying complaint alleges that the work called for under the contract was performed improperly or incompletely that is,it alleges faulty workmanship,not faulty workmanship that damaged property.the cost of repairing or replacing defective work is not property damage.see viking constr,at tillerson,at no property damage where homeowners sought either the repair or the replacement of defective work or the diminishing value of the home diamond state ins,d,mere allegations of repair and modification without any allegations of physical injury are insufficient to invoke coverage under the physical injury prong of the property damage provision.
lyerla argues that the underlying complaint alleged property damage because the owners sought to recover storage fees and liquidated damages.as defined by the policy,p roperty damage includes the l oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.lyerla reasons that by attempting to recover storage fees and liquidated damages,the owners alleged loss of use,and,therefore,property damage.the liquidated damages do not represent costs incurred by the owners for loss of use of tangible property they are costs imposed on lyerla pursuant to the contract for failure to complete the project on time.as for the storage fees,even if we construe the owners claim for storage fees as alleging a loss of use of the house,the policy makes clear that a loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the occurrence that caused it.lyerla failure to complete construction on time is not an occurrence within the meaning of the policy 
lyerla alleges that the defects that gave rise to the owners lawsuit resulted from the faulty work of subcontractors,which he did not foresee.therefore,he reasons,the underlying complaint alleges property damage to the completed project caused by an occurrence.but whether lyerla expected his subcontractors to perform their work properly is irrelevant where the complaint clearly does not allege any property damage.finally,in an attempt to avoid the adverse result dictated by our analysis of the cgl policy language,lyerla contends that amco is estopped from raising policy defenses because it did not defend the suit under a reservation of rights or seek a declaratory judgment prior to his settlement with the owners.the estoppel doctrine provides that an insurer who wrongf
