a homeowner entered into a contract for the construction of an additional building on his property.he later filed suit against the contractor,alleging defects in the construction.the contractor did not notify his liability insurer of the suit.a default was entered.through an investigator,the insurer learned about the suit after the entry of default and unsuccessfully moved to set the default aside.a default judgment followed.
the homeowner then brought this action against the insurer,seeking payment on the default judgment.the insurer defended on the grounds that the insurance policy did not cover a default judgment entered without timely notice of the suit,and the insured had failed to give notice in time for the insurer to protect its and the insured interests.
the insurer moved for summary judgment based on the policy provisions.the homeowner argued that the insurer had to suffer prejudice as a result of the lack of notice and that a showing of prejudice had not been made.the insurer countered that prejudice was not required and that,alternatively,the default had prevented it from conducting a thorough investigation of the claim and presenting a defense in the underlying suit.the trial court ruled for the insurer,stating that a showing of prejudice was unnecessary.
we conclude that where a default judgment results from a lack of notice by the insured,the insurer is liable on the judgment unless it suffered actual,substantial prejudice,and the mere inability to investigate the claim thoroughly or to present a defense in the underlying suit does not satisfy the prejudice requirement.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
we accept as true the following facts and reasonable inferences supported by the parties undisputed evidence on the motion for summary judgment.see raghavan boeing th,d.
in,plaintiff gary belz entered into a written agreement with alan namay,a general contractor,for the construction of a freestanding healthplex at belz home.the healthplex included a racquetball court,a wall,a bedroom,and a parking structure.construction commenced in october and continued until october.
defendant clarendon america insurance company clarendon issued a commercial general liability policy to namay,effective for one year,commencing july.
during or after the construction,belz saw water leaks in the healthplex,primarily on the racquetball court.leaks also occurred in other areas.a dispute arose between belz and namay over alleged construction defects and the damage to the healthplex.
on december,belz advised namay insurance broker by letter that belz was making a claim under the clarendon policy.after learning of the claim,clarendon contacted its claims handling service,which retained crawford claims management services crawford to conduct an investigation.crawford,in turn,assigned the matter to david warner.
between january and september,warner investigated the claim.he met with belz and obtained a recorded statement.he toured the healthplex and took photographs.for his part,belz gave warner several items,including a report prepared by a leak specialist,a repair estimate from a construction company,and the contact information for the subcontractors who had worked on the project.
meanwhile,warner was trying to get in touch with namay the insured by letter,telephone,and visiting namay home unannounced.those efforts were to no avail.warner never heard from namay.
by letter dated july,warner wrote to belz,stating i have been unable to make contact with our insured,as he has not responded to my letters.clarendon regrets any inconvenience this may have caused you as we attempt to investigate this claim.until we speak with our insured,clarendon is not willing to make a decision on what responsibility its insured may have for your water intrusion problems.w e are continuing our efforts to try and contact our insured so that we may complete the necessary investigation.
on september,belz called warner and asked about the status of the claim.warner said he still had not been able to talk to namay.belz replied that he intended to sue namay.warner and belz did not communicate with each other again.
on december,belz filed a lawsuit against namay,alleging negligence and breach of contract arising out of the construction of the healthplex belz namay super.county,no.on december,the summons and complaint were personally served on namay.he did not notify clarendon of the suit.a responsive pleading was not filed.on january,belz filed a request for entry of default,which was entered the same day.namay did not inform clarendon of the request of default.
in late,a claims adjuster for clarendon,michael barnard,assumed responsibility for belz claim.he hired a different company,west coast casualty west coast,to investigate the claim because crawford had already taken its best shot and come up with nothing.
on february,west coast investigator spoke by telephone with belz and was told about the suit against namay.the investigator also contacted belz attorney and received a copy of the documents relating to the suit.west coast reported its findings in a letter to barnard.
on february,clarendon,through barnard,learned that belz had sued namay and that namay default had been entered.by letter of the same date,barnard retained the law firm of pierce weiss to have the default set aside.barnard also instructed the firm to analyz e our defense position,develop defense strategies,file against all parties involved in the construction project,and let him know if early settlement is recommended.
pierce weiss asked belz to set aside the default voluntarily,but he refused.thereafter,the firm filed a motion to vacate the default based on namay mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.code civ,subd.b.belz filed opposition.he also filed a request for entry of a default judgment against namay.pierce weiss filed opposition to the request.on april,the superior court denied the motion to vacate the default and entered a default judgment against namay in the amount of.
on may,pierce weiss filed a motion for reconsideration and a supporting declaration from namay,who stated he had not contacted clarendon or the pierce firm about the belz suit because he had given the summons and complaint to an attorney handling a bankruptcy case for him.namay believed that the bankruptcy attorney would handle the matter.an accompanying declaration from the bankruptcy attorney recited that he had not been retained to defend the belz suit,so he did not notify clarendon or the firm about it he listed the suit as a potential liability on namay bankruptcy petition.although namay was served with process on december,he did not retain the bankruptcy attorney until april,long after a response to the complaint was due.belz filed opposition to the motion for reconsideration.on july,the superior court denied the motion.
namay filed an appeal from the default judgment.it was dismissed as untimely by order of this court dated may.
on may,shortly after communicating with namay for the first time,clarendon sent him a letter denying coverage.clarendon informed namay that there was no potential coverage under the policy because namay had failed to notify clarendon of the suit,resulting in a default judgment against him the property damage occurred while namay was still working on the project namay did not cooperate with clarendon in investigating belz claim and the property damage was caused by subcontractors who did not obtain insurance naming namay as an additional insured.
on june,belz filed this action against clarendon,seeking to recover the amount of the default judgment.belz premised his claim on the insurance code,which requires that liability policies contain a provision that whenever judgment is secured against the insured in an action based upon bodily injury,death,or property damage,then an action may be brought against the insurer on the policy and subject to its terms and limitations,by such judgment creditor to recover on the judgment,subd.b see shafer berger,kahn,shafton,moss,figler,simon gladstone th,d discussing rights of judgment creditor under judgment obtained against insured.
on july,clarendon filed a general denial,alleging defenses based on provisions of the policy.see code civ,subd.d.
on february,clarendon filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that there was no potential coverage based on the following language in section iv,paragraph.of the policy the company shall not be liable for any cost,payment,expense including legal expense or obligation assumed or incurred by an insured without the company express consent.the company further shall have no liability for any default judgment entered against any insured,nor for any judgment,or settlement or determination of liability rendered or entered before notice to the company giving the company a reasonable time in which to protect its and its insured interests italics added.
in his opposition papers,belz contended that the motion should be denied because clarendon had not shown that namay conduct had caused any prejudice.belz also filed objections to some of clarendon supporting declarations.
in reply,clarendon asserted that a showing of prejudice was not necessary and,alternatively,namay conduct had resulted in prejudice by precluding it from thoroughly investigating belz claim and from presenting a defense in the underlying suit.
on may,the trial court heard argument and granted the motion,concluding that namay had breached section iv,paragraph.of the policy and that clarendon did not have to establish prejudice.an order to that effect and a judgment were entered on june.
belz responded with a motion,requesting that the trial court rule upon his evidentiary objections and specify the evidence upon which the court relied in granting summary judgment.clarendon filed opposition.by amended order filed on august,the trial court sustained belz objections in their entirety and cited the evidence supporting the granting of summary judgment.belz filed an appeal.
discussion 
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence.raghavan boeing,supra,th at,d.
the rules of construction applicable to contracts govern the interpretation of insurance policies.we interpret the words of the policy in their ordinary sense,according to the plain meaning a layperson would give them.see davis farmers ins.group th,d blasiar,fireman fund ins.th,d.the language of the policy must be read in the context of the instrument as a whole davis,at,d.
here,the focus is on the policy language stating that clarendon shall have no liability for any default judgment entered against any insured,nor for any judgment,or determination of liability rendered or entered before notice to the company giving the company a reasonable time in which to protect its and its insured interests.italics added.the question on appeal rests on whether this portion of the clarendon policy is a notice provision,a cooperation clause,or a provision.we conclude,unlike the trial court,that the pertinent language is a notice provision and that clarendon must show prejudice from the lack of notice.
a notice provision requires the insured to inform the insurer promptly of any claims,suits,or occurrences,and obligates the insured to forward immediately to the insurer a copy of any demands,notices,summonses,or legal papers received in connection with a claim or suit.see truck ins.exchange unigard ins.th,d.a standard cooperation clause provides that the insured will cooperate with the insurer in the investigation,settlement,or defense of a claim or suit.id.at,d.a provision states that the insured will not,except at his or her own expense,voluntarily make a payment,assume any obligation,or incur any expense,without the insurer consent.ibid.under california law,an insured breach of a notice provision or a cooperation clause does not excuse the insurer performance unless the insurer can show that it suffered prejudice a breach of a provision does not require a showing of prejudice.as we have previously discussed at length 
these three provisions play an important role in defining the relationship.with respect to notice provisions,one court of appeal has explained a n occurrence policy provides coverage for any acts or omissions that arise during the policy period even though the claim is made after the policy has expired.occurrence policies were developed to provide coverage for damage caused by collision,fire,war,and other identifiable events because the occurrence of these events was relatively easy to ascertain,the insurer was able to conduct a prompt investigation of the incident notice provisions contained in such occurrence policies were included to aid the insurer in investigating,settling,and defending claims.if an insured breaches a notice provision,resulting in substantial prejudice to the defense,the insurer is relieved of liability 
similarly,cooperation clauses serve an important purpose.a condition of a policy requiring the cooperation and assistance of the assured in opposing a claim or an action lodged against him by an injured person is material to the risk and of the utmost importance in a practical sense.without such cooperation and assistance the insurer is severely handicapped and may in some instances be absolutely precluded from advancing any defense.s uch provisions enable the insurer to possess itself of all knowledge,and all information as to other sources and means of knowledge,in regard to facts,material to its rights,to enable it to decide upon its obligations,and to protect itself against false claims.where an insured violates a cooperation clause,the insurer performance is excused if its ability to provide a defense has been substantially prejudiced 
finally,we come to the provision prohibiting an insured from making voluntary payments without the insurer consent.typically,a breach of that provision occurs,if at all,before the insured has tendered the defense to the insurer.the duty to defend is a continuing one,arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded,or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage phrased somewhat differently,t he duty to defend arises when the insured tenders defense of the third party lawsuit to the insurer.the temporal limits of the insurer duty to defend fall between tender of the defense and conclusion of the action.
the same temporal limits are relevant where an insured has made a voluntary payment in defending an action or resolving a claim.as our supreme court has noted the provisions requiring the insurer prior consent to the expenditure of defense costs and permitting the insurer to assume the defense of any claim are common in all liability insurance policies.their purpose is to prevent collusion as well as to invest the insurer with the complete control and direction of the defense or compromise of suits or claims gribaldo,jacobs,jones associates agrippina versicherunges cal d,gribaldo.
more recently,in jamestown builders,general star indemnity th,d jamestown builders,a home developer spent more than million to repair water intrusion defects in a residential development,all without notifying its insurer of the homeowners damage claims the insurer declined to reimburse the developer for the repair expenses.in a subsequent bad faith action by the developer,the insurer invoked the provision prohibiting voluntary payments.the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer.the court of appeal affirmed,stating california law enforces such provis
