this is a case about death.to be entitled to the death benefit payable under a life insurance policy,a beneficiary must prove that the insured is actually,or,in the alternative,perhaps only legally,dead.there is a difference between the two.as is often the case in the law,words and concepts so familiar in everyday life assume esoteric identities when cloaked in legal rhetoric.it should come as no surprise,then,that not even death,perhaps the most sobering and forthright fact in life,is immune from legal definition.
a life insurance beneficiary may prove an insured death in two ways.one avenue is for the beneficiary to utilize direct or circumstantial evidence to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that an insured is,in fact,dead.in lieu of proving actual death,however,a beneficiary may seek to prove death by means of a legal presumption.in other words,although the insured may,as a matter of fact,be alive,in certain circumstances the law permits one to presume he is dead.the mechanics of this presumption are at the center of this case.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury and employed a flawed special verdict form.taken together,these errors were prejudicial.we remand for a new trial.
background 
gordon beeler,a husband,father,and businessman,disappeared on january.at the time of his disappearance,beeler left behind a wife of almost thirty years,kathy four living children,ranging in ages from twelve to and a business partner,john martin.none of these individuals has seen or heard from beeler since that day in.beeler was years old at the time he disappeared.
beeler had obtained no fewer than six different life insurance policies,three of which are at issue in this case.axa equitable life insurance company issued the first policy to gordon beeler on september.the policy carries a death benefit of.reliastar life insurance company issued the other two disputed policies.beeler obtained the first,which carries a death benefit of,on december.he took out the second shortly thereafter,on january.the death benefit of the second policy is million.added together,these three policies are to pay a total of million to the named beneficiary upon the death of gordon beeler.in november,kathy beeler transferred ownership of these policies to the gordon beeler irrevocable trust,dated may,beeler trust.
each of the three policies originally named kathy beeler as the sole beneficiary.at the same time that she transferred policy ownership,however,kathy beeler also amended the policies to name the beeler trust as beneficiary.john malone,beeler former business partner,serves as trustee for the beeler trust it is in the role of trustee that malone brought this action.kathy beeler and the beeler children are the beeler trust beneficiaries.
the beeler trust first sought payment of death benefits under the axa policy in a claim filed in november which axa denied the following february.in january,the beeler trust filed similar claims for payment on the two reliastar policies reliastar denied these claims in correspondence dated march.both companies noted that seven years had not yet passed,which was the time required for the common law presumption of death to take effect in indiana.
in february,the beeler trust submitted renewed death claims to both axa and reliastar.in separate correspondence mailed in april,both companies declined to pay the benefits under their respective policies.the insurance companies cited evidence they had obtained suggesting that beeler was either still alive or had not died at the time of his disappearance.
eight months later,in october,the beeler trust filed a complaint in indiana joseph superior court,alleging that axa and reliastar had breached their respective contracts and seeking payment of the death benefits payable thereunder.the defendants promptly removed the case to the south bend division of the northern district of indiana.in june,the beeler trust filed an amended complaint in the federal court,in which it added a claim for punitive damages,alleging that the companies had made unfounded refusals to pay death benefits and had deceived the beeler trust,thereby violating the insurance companies duties of good faith and fair dealing.in an order dated march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurance companies on the plaintiff punitive damages claims,leaving only the breach of contract claims for trial.
at a jury trial held from may to may,the beeler trust presented evidence to demonstrate beeler death.the plaintiff showed that beeler had been missing since the day of his disappearance nine years earlier in.the family,the authorities,and the life insurance companies had conducted numerous fruitless investigations in an effort to locate beeler.beeler last known communication was a letter to kathy dated january,and postmarked in key west,florida.in the letter,beeler informed his wife of many arrangements he had made to provide financial security for both kathy and their children long into the future.finally,none of beeler family or friends had any communication with beeler since his disappearance.
the insurance companies argued that beeler could not be presumed dead they claimed that he had left simply to extricate himself from an increasingly troublesome family situation.they presented evidence that beeler last years with his family were far from idyllic.he engaged in an extramarital affair.he grew distant from his family and was often absent from family gatherings.his marriage with kathy became strained.he spent long periods of time living away from the family primary home in granger,indiana,often staying in hotels or escaping by himself to their vacation house in marco island,florida.near the conclusion of,beeler leased an apartment in nearby south bend,indiana.in early,kathy beeler filed an action in state court seeking a formal separation from her husband and a temporary restraining order to keep him away from the family home.following a hearing on january,the court granted both requests.kathy spoke with her husband on the telephone three days later,on the morning of january.she never spoke with him again.
the insurance companies also presented witnesses who testified that they had seen beeler since.several witnesses testified that they had encountered beeler in the months following his disappearance.a friend of the beeler family stated that she had seen beeler in the indianapolis airport as late as may.
as the trial neared conclusion,the plaintiff entered objections to both jury instruction and the court proposed special verdict form.we will discuss the contents of both the jury instruction and the verdict form in the analysis that follows.these two objections,both denied by the district court,form the primary basis for the claims raised by the appellant,the beeler trust,on appeal.following deliberations,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.pursuant to the questions posed in the special verdict form,the jury found,specifically,that the plaintiff had not established the elements necessary to raise the presumption of death.
on february,the district court denied the beeler trust renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,or,in the alternative,for new trial.the court subsequently denied the beeler trust motion to reconsider its february order,as well as its request to certify to the indiana supreme court the question of whether jury instruction and the special verdict form accurately stated indiana common law presumption of death 
ii.analysis 
the beeler trust appeals the district court summary judgment order on the punitive damages claims,the court formulation of jury instruction and the special verdict form,and the court denial of its motion for a new trial.we turn first to its death benefits claims,which encompass appellant arguments regarding instruction and the special verdict form,as well as the motion for a new trial.we then briefly discuss the punitive damages claims.
a.the death benefits claims 
on appeal,the beeler trust argues that errors in both the jury instructions and the special verdict form prejudiced the trial outcome.we agree.as we discuss below,these errors,standing alone,would not merit a new trial.taken together,however,they prevented the jury from considering one of the two ways in which the plaintiff could prove gordon beeler death.for that reason,a new trial is required.
in the state of indiana,a claimant seeking to prove an insured death may pursue two separate avenues of proof.under the first,a claimant may use direct or circumstantial evidence to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the insured is,in fact,dead.under the second,a claimant may seek to prove death by means of a common law presumption.indiana law dictates that a person is presumed dead if the following conditions are met first,that the individual has been inexplicably absent for a continuous period of seven years second,that the individual has not communicated with those persons who would be most likely to hear from him and third,that the missing individual can not be found despite diligent inquiry and search.roberts wabash life ins.once raised,however,the presumption of death may be rebutted by proof of facts and circumstances inconsistent with,and sufficient to overcome,such presumption.id.quoting equitable life assur.soc.of the james.it is for the jury to conclude whether the presumption has been sufficiently rebutted.equitable life,at.
the nature of the errors alleged in this case makes critical the order of operations relative to the presumption.we must determine whether facts tending to disprove death prevent the presumption from ever arising in the first instance,or whether they serve only to rebut the presumption once it has arisen.in the vast majority of cases,such a minute distinction would make no difference.the ultimate inquiry,after all,is simply whether,after the evidence is in,the presumption of death survives.and if the presumption does not survive,rarely does one care about the cause of its because it never arose or because it arose but was then rebutted.we turn first to the source of the confusion the use by indiana courts of the term inexplicably absent as a prerequisite to raise,in the first instance,the common law presumption of death.
interpreting inexplicably absent and jury instruction 
as stated above,under indiana law,a party seeking to raise the presumption of an individual death must show that the individual has been inexplicably absent for a period of seven years.roberts,at.the meaning of inexplicably absent,however,is far from,and its proper interpretation,which the district court attempted to define in jury instruction,is at the center of this dispute.
the distinction,as we alluded to earlier,is one of timing.if a party contesting an individual death has evidence that tends to show that the individual is still living,does that evidence prevent the presumption from ever arising because the individual absence is not inexplicable or,alternatively,does the presumption arise from the individual mere absence and lack of tidings,with such explanatory evidence saved for purposes of rebuttal the district court,in jury instruction,embraced the former procedure,which we now find to have been in error.
the purpose of jury instruction was to explain to the jury the ways in which the plaintiff could prove gordon beeler death.it went into great detail about the presumption process,including the prerequisites for raising the presumption in the first instance.it stated,correctly,that the person must be inexplicably absent for a continuous period of seven years.the district court then attempted to define inexplicably absent.at the request of defense counsel,and over the objection of the plaintiff,the court added the following definition as used in these instructions,the phrase inexplicably absent means that his absence is unexplained by circumstances other than those suggesting death.

keeping these tenets in mind,we turn now to the first question at hand whether,under indiana law,inexplicably absent means an absence unexplained by circumstances other than those suggesting death.we conclude that it does not.
early indiana cases provided no support for the use of inexplicably absent.in baugh boles,an indiana supreme court decision that dealt peripherally with this issue,the court said 
it has long been an accepted rule of law that where a person has left his usual place of abode,and no intelligence concerning him has been received by his relatives,or by those who would probably hear from him,if living,after the lapse of seven years such person would be presumed to be dead.
id.at.the court made no mention of an inexplicable absence.
the phrase is also conspicuously absent from several subsequent decisions by indiana intermediate appellate court.in metropolitan life insurance lyons,the court stated that the presumption of death arose from an unexplained absence of seven years.id.at.but there is a marked difference between an absence that is inexplicable,incapable of explanation,and one that is merely unexplained.the defendants quote repeatedly from lyons the passage that reads if the person alleged to be dead has been absent from his home for seven years,a presumption of death may arise but proof of absence alone will not give rise to this presumption.id.emphasis added.yet,in so doing,the defendants fail to note the sentence that follows 
if,in addition to the absence of such person for the required time,it is shown that he left for a temporary purpose of business or pleasure,and that he had not returned,and that those most likely to hear from him have received no word or tidings from him,the presumption of death arises,after an absence of seven years.
id.at.in other words,the court simply enunciated the remaining prerequisites for the presumption to arise,see roberts,at,which remain uncontested by either party.it is clear that the something more required by lyons was not an inexplicable absence.
the indiana appellate court addressed this question directly in equitable life assurance society of the united states james.in that case,in which a man was suspected of forgery and was supposedly seen by two witnesses following the date of his disappearance,the insurance company argued that there was no state of facts from which such a presumption could have arisen that such a presumption arises only from an unexplained absence and that where the absence is explained,or the person has been seen during the period of his absence,the presumption does not arise.id.at.the court disagreed.it held that the common law presumption arises after a continuous absence for a period of seven years,of one who left his home for a temporary purpose,and from whom no tidings have been received.id.explanation for the absence,said the court,was rebuttal evidence.id.the court found that the plaintiff evidence was sufficient to raise the presumption,and that the explanatory evidence of the individual absence was available only for rebuttal.id.
perhaps most persuasive are the facts from roberts wabash life insurance,the case in which an indiana court first used the inexplicably absent language.id.at.in roberts,firefighters discovered a dead body while extinguishing a fire in a barn owned by clarence roberts.id.at.the charred remains were initially thought to be those of roberts himself.see id.further investigation,however,suggested that the body was not roberts.see id.at.in fact,the evidence indicated that roberts might have killed a man and then burned the body in the barn in an effort to fake his own death,with the intent of avoiding creditors and potential charges of fraud.id.at.his wife,claiming roberts to be dead or presumed dead,contested the insurance company refusal to pay on roberts life insurance policies.id.at.
using language notably similar to that found in jury instruction,the trial court in roberts concluded that the presumption of death had never arisen because roberts disappearance was explainable by a reasonable hypothesis other than his death.id.at.the indiana court of appeals disagreed.after stating that a prerequisite to raising the presumption of death was an inexplicabl e absence of seven years,id.at,the court found that requirement satisfied,stating that the plaintiffs had introduced evidence of the basic facts which gave rise to the presumption of death,id.at.it reached this conclusion despite evidence of murder,arson,fraud,and financial ruin,all of which clearly made roberts disappearance anything but inexplicable,at least in the literal sense of the word.but the court looked to that evidence only to rebut the presumption once it was raised,not to prevent it from ever arising.thus,the indiana appellate court application of the inexplicably absent standard has differed from the phrase common meaning since the first day of the standard existence.
indeed,adopting the definition of inexplicably absent found in jury instruction would effectively eliminate the presumption of death.the purpose of the presumption is to provide relief to those who might not be able to prove a person death with direct or circumstantial evidence.see green shalala,cir.if,to raise the presumption,a party were required to prove that an individual absence was,as the district court stated,unexplained by circumstances other than those suggesting death,then the presumption would no longer be necessary armed with such evidence,the party would likely be able to prove the individual.the result would be that no party actually needing the presumption would be able to raise it.see green,at noting that such a high standard places an untenable burden on the claimant to disprove every possible explanation for the missing person absence.although the indiana supreme court has not addressed this issue,the wisconsin supreme court has recognized this problem when discussing its own state presumption of death 
t he rule is satisfied by a lack of intelligence or tidings for seven years,even if a reason for the absence is shown.were it otherwise the presumption would never attach where any reason for leaving is given,and,in such case,no recovery could ever be had except upon proof of actual death.
ewing metro.life ins.
we conclude,based on our analysis of indiana law,that the roberts requirement of an inexplicable absence for the common law presumption of death to arise is,at worst,the result of inartful drafting or,at best,a term of art with a far different interpretation than its common meaning.because the roberts court cited the equitable life decision as support for its test,see at,we look to both of those decisions to reach what we feel is the appropriate interpretation of indiana law on this point.under this interpretation,the common law presumption of death arises if the party seeking to prove a person death presents evidence demonstrating that person continued absence for a period of seven years that person failure to communicate with those individuals who would be most likely to hear from him and the inability to find that person,despite diligent inquiry and search.roberts,at equitable life,at.evidence offered to explain an individual absence goes toward the rebuttal of the presumption,not to prevent the presumption from first arising.equitable life,at 
given such an interpretation,the definition contained in jury instruction was an incorrect statement of law.to raise the presumption,a party need not show that an individual absence is unexplained by circumstances other than those suggesting death.as we mentioned previously,however,such an error,by itself,does not merit a new trial.a party must show prejudice as well.schobert,at.
in almost every situation,the timing issue that we have just calibrated would make no difference in the outcome of a trial.what matters,obviously,is whether the presumption of death exists at the end of the inquiry.whether it was terminated because it never first arose,or whether it arose but was eliminated by rebuttal evidence should make no difference.turning to this case,it would generally be irrelevant why the jury concluded that the presumption of death was inapplicable and did not entitle the beeler trust to relief.what made it important here,however,and what ultimately prejudiced the plaintiff,was the interplay of the error in jury instruction with a second error in the jury special verdict form.we turn our discussion now to this second error.
the two avenues of proving beeler death and the special verdict form 
federal rule of civil procedure permits a court to submit to the jury either a general or special verdict form.a special verdict form requires the jury to return specific findings on issues of disputed fact raised by the parties during trial.a.in the special verdict form,the court must present to the jury all material issues raised by the pleadings and evidence.fire ins.pressed steel tank,cir.we review a district court formulation of questions on a special verdict form for an abuse of discretion.id.at.
the special verdict form at issue here was significantly flawed.it posed a series of three questions.a short paragraph after each question instructed the jury how to proceed based upon its answer to the preceding question.
the first question listed the elements necessary to raise the presumption of death and asked the jury to determine whether the beeler trust had proven these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.if the jury answered no,meaning that the claimant had failed to raise the presumption of death,the form instructed the jury not to consider the remaining two questions.according to the special verdict form,such a response ended the jury inquiry the defendants had prevailed.
if the jury found that the beeler trust had successfully raised the presumption of death under question,the form instructed the jury to proceed to question.the second question asked whether the defendants had presented evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption.if the jury found insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption,the special verdict form again instructed the jury that its inquiry was over.the result,however,was now different an unrebutted presumption of death meant that the plaintiff had won.
recall now the two evidentiary avenues available to prove death.in addition to proving death by means of a legal presumption,claimants may also prove death the more traditional way by direct or circumstantial evidence of the ultimate fact of the insured death.according to the verdict form instructions,if the jury determined,under question,that the defendants had rebutted the that the plaintiff had failed to prove death using the presumption jury was to proceed to the final question.there,the court asked the jury to decide whether the plaintiff,using direct or circumstantial evidence,had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that gordon beeler was in fact dead.
we find the problem with the special verdict form in the instructions that follow question.the jury answered question in the negative,meaning that it concluded that the beeler trust had failed to meet the elements necessary to raise the presumption of death.the jury then did as the form instructed and ended its deliberations.it never considered question,which asked the jury to consider whether the plaintiff had proven death by the alternative path,through direct and circumstantial evidence of.because the jury should have considered whether the plaintiff had satisfied this alternative means of proof,the erroneous instruction following question was a legal error that constituted an abuse of the district court discretion.
the district court confusion on this point is understandable.in roberts,the court found that the plaintiff had introduced the basic facts necessary to give rise to the presumption of death,which the defendant had subsequently rebutted.at.once the presumption was rebutted,the c
