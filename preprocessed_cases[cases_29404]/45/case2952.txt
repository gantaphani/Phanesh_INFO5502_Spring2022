ananda second amended complaint the complaint was filed against several insurance companies,including mass bay.the coverage dispute arises from two underlying lawsuits against ananda.all of our information about the underlying suits is derived from the complaint,which we summarize below,as it pertains to mass bay.
the bertolucci suit 
on november,anne marie bertolucci filed an action against ananda,its subsidiary entity crystal clarity publishing crystal clarity,and other named individual.
this lawsuit,which we shall refer to as the bertolucci suit,was directed primarily at the behavior of ananda minister and crystal clarity vice president danny levin,who allegedly sexually harassed bertolucci while she was employed by crystal clarity as a data entry clerk.bertolucci sought redress against ananda under legal theories which included wrongful discharge,violations of the california fair employment and housing act,battery,and negligent supervision 
the mass bay policy 
from august,to august,ananda held a policy of insurance issued by mass bay.the key provisions of that policy were as follows mass bay will pay those sums that ananda becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of property damage to which this insurance applies.p roperty damage is defined to mean physical injury to tangible property,including all resulting loss of use of that property or loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.italics added.the policy went on to provide that mass bay shall have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.
the murphy suit 
on february,bertolucci,who was by then known as murphy,filed a second lawsuit captioned murphy walters hereinafter the murphy suit.
as amended,the murphy complaint alleged that on september,while her suit against ananda was in progress,murphy attorneys caught an individual identified as peter barranco trespassing on their property and stealing two bags of trash containing private,confidential attorney communications.the murphy suit alleged that barranco was an agent of a private investigator for ananda counsel,who had hired him to trespass on the attorneys property.upon being caught in the act,barranco tried to hit one of the attorneys as he drove away,then delivered the two bags of trash to the private investigator.the investigator in turn delivered selected documents from the contents of the trash to members of ananda litigation team,who were still in possession of them.murphy sought redress against ananda and its litigation team under a host of stated causes of action including conversion,claim and delivery,invasion of privacy,and conspiracy to steal personal property.
ananda tendered the murphy complaint to mass bay for defense and indemnification,but mass bay refused.
the flynn suit and the settlement of all litigation 
on october,michael flynn and other attorneys representing murphy filed a motion in superior court to add ananda as a defendant in their lawsuit entitled flynn walters the flynn suit.the flynn suit was based on the same incident as the murphy suit,that on or about september,barranco illegally trespassed onto plaintiffs private property and stole their documents contained in the trash held in a gated secured and enclosed area on their property the flynn plaintiffs sought redress on a number of legal theories which included trespass,conversion,and interference with business relations.
ananda tendered the flynn suit to mass bay for defense and indemnification,but mass bay refused.the cost of defending the murphy and flynn suits coupled with the financial burden of the bertolucci suit drove ananda to the point of insolvency,and forced it to declare bankruptcy.in the bankruptcy court,ananda eventually settled the bertolucci,flynn,and murphy suits,without the participation of its insurers,for an estimated million.
ananda causes of action against mass bay 
in the present complaint,ananda posited causes of action against mass bay for breach of written contract,based on failure to defend the murphy and flynn suits declaratory relief,seeking a determination that mass bay had a duty to pay the settlement,promissory fraud and negligent misrepresentation,based upon mass bay alleged false representations regarding defense and coverage,tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and negligence.
mass bay demurred to the complaint on the ground,inter alia,that the recitation of facts alleged in the murphy and flynn suits failed to give rise to the potential for a covered claim under the mass bay policy.the trial court sustained mass bay demurrer to ananda complaint without leave to amend and issued judgment in favor of mass bay.ananda appeals.
iprinciples of insurance law 
both parties agree the dispositive issue on appeal is whether the murphy and flynn suits pleaded facts which could give rise to a duty on the part of mass bay to defend ananda under the property damage provision of ananda liability insurance policy.
the california supreme court has described the duty to defend as follows a liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend its insured against claims that create a potential for indemnity.gray zurich insurance cal d,gray.as we said in gray,the carrier must defend a suit which potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.gray at,italics in original.implicit in this rule is the principle that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify an insurer may owe a duty to defend its insured in an action in which no damages ultimately are awarded.citations.the determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.the rule is settled that an insurer is under a duty to defend a claim whenever the allegations of a complaint would support a recovery upon a risk covered by the policy.hogan midland national ins.cal d,italics added.contrawise,i f an insurance policy provides no potential basis for coverage,the insurer is under no duty to defend an action against the insured.waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d,citing gray,supra,cal d at.
the temporal issue 
ananda devotes a large part of its opening brief to demonstrating the possibility of coverage temporally.it asserts that,although the trash incident occurred in september,some two years prior to the inception of coverage under the mass bay policy,the complaint left open the possibility that some of the stolen property was destroyed by defendants on later dates further,the fact that the murphy and flynn plaintiffs alleged that defendants were still in the possession of the property and demanded its return suggested the potential for injury to or loss of use continuing beyond the initial incident and into the policy period.
we find it unnecessary to delve into these temporal issues,because they become relevant
