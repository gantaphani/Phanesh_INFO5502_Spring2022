union planters bank suffered a loss stemming from a mortgage lender fraud.upon discovering the fraud,the bank notified its primary insurance provider,continental casualty,and later notified its three carriers national union fire insurance,paul mercury insurance and twin city fire insurance.when the insurance providers disputed coverage,union planters filed this diversity action,seeking to recover its losses,prejudgment interest and professional fees.applying tennessee law,the district court granted union planters motion for summary judgment against continental casualty and the excess carriers motions for summary judgment against union planters.we affirm.
mortgage bankers generate residential mortgages,which they frequently resell in the secondary market.when mortgage bankers lack sufficient capital to originate a residential mortgage,they often use warehouse lines of credit,which they obtain by offering as collateral the underlying mortgage instruments.once the mortgage bankers sell the mortgages on the secondary market,they repay the warehouse lender,so that the commercial bank collateral rotates continuously.loans in the industry may be wet or dry wet when the lender advances funds before it has in hand the original promissory note,mortgage and assignment of mortgage dry when the lender advances funds only after it possesses these documents.
in november,union planters extended a million warehouse line of credit to greatstone,a company.each time greatstone needed to finance a new mortgage,union planters advanced the funds for the mortgage through a wet transaction greatstone would fax its requests to union planters union planters would advance the funds to greatstone and greatstone would send the collateral documentation to union planters.
in june,union planters increased greatstone line of credit to million and in february,union planters increased the line of credit to million.between november and july,greatstone borrowed approximately million from union planters through these revolving credit transactions.
in august,greatstone stopped making payments to union planters and defaulted on the loans.union planters soon discovered that greatstone was at the center of an elaborate bank fraud.although greatstone had generated many legitimate mortgages,it had done so in the end not for legitimate purposes but for the purpose of obtaining information from individual applicants,which it used to generate fraudulent mortgages by forging borrowers signatures on new loan forms.greatstone then split the mortgages,sending the real mortgages to one bank and the forged ones to another.all told,greatstone received approximately million from several banks by using forged mortgage loans to procure of which the principals of the company took with them when they fled to costa rica and became costa rican nationals,apparently beyond the reach of american law.
all of the mortgage loans that greatstone provided to union planters as collateral,as it turned out,did not represent actual extensions of credit to the named borrowers.when greatstone defaulted,union planters was left with worthless collateral the forged promissory notes,mortgages and assignments of security interest for in advances and was left for an additional in advances.
shorn of any hope of getting its money back from greatstone,union planters turned to its insurance carriers.union planters maintained a primary insurance policy with continental casualty,one that provided the bank with coverage on a basis for certain types of to exceed between june and june.two types of losses are relevant here losses due to forgeries,see continental policy.a,and losses due to counterfeits,see id.
in addition to its primary insurance policy,union planters purchased three additional layers of coverage from national union fire insurance,paul mercury insurance and twin city fire insurance collectively,the excess carriers.each of these policies incorporated the terms and conditions of the continental policy.and each policy provided union planters with a supplemental million layer of union planters total insurance coverage to million.
the policies established the following order of coverage continental covered losses from to million national union covered losses from to million paul covered losses from to million and twin city covered losses from to million.each policy required union planters to notify the excess carriers of a claim at the same time it notified the primary carrier continental of a claim.
in a letter dated september,union planters notified continental about greatstone default and the bank initial losses.after investigating the fraud and calculating its losses,union planters provided continental with a detailed proof of loss on february.on march,union planters claims that its agent sent a letter to the excess carriers about the loss,though none of the carriers acknowledges receiving the letter.continental repudiated union planters claims for coverage.
on may,union planters filed a diversity suit under tennessee law in federal district court seeking a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under the various insurance policies and any funds it may be due under those policies.ja.all five parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted union planters motion for summary judgment against continental granted the excess carriers motions for summary judgment against union planters and denied the remaining motions for summary judgment.the parties subsequently filed a number of motions,which the district court resolved in june of among other things denying union planters requests for prejudgment interest and professional fees.
on appeal,union planters challenges the grant of summary judgment in favor of the excess carriers and the denial of its motions for prejudgment interest and professional fees,while continental the grant of summary judgment in favor of union planters.we give fresh review to a district court decision,applying the same familiar standard that district courts apply.flaskamp dearborn pub,cir.
the first item on the parties agenda is whether the district court correctly determined that union planters was entitled to coverage under.a of the company primary policy with continental.that provision says 
the insurer shall indemnify the union planters corporation insureds for loss resulting directly from a union planters corporation insured having in good faith 
acted on an original financial document which bears a forgery or alteration upon which the union planters corporation insureds relied 
actual physical possession,and continued actual physical possession if taken as collateral,is a condition precedent to the union planters corporation insured having acted in reliance upon the financial document.
ja.to establish coverage under this section,union planters must show that in good faith it acted on original financial documents that contained a forgery upon which the bank relied,and that the losses resulted directly from the bank reliance on the forgeries.the policy defines a forgery as t he signing of the name of another person without authority with intent to deceive,ja,and defines reliance as requiring continued a ctual physical possession of any collateral,ja.
continental does not challenge union planters good faith,the existence of original financial documents or the existence of forgeries on those documents.it argues that the bank fails to satisfy the other three requirements that it relied on the forged documents that it continually,actually and physically possessed forged documents and that its losses resulted directly from its reliance on the forgeries.
in one sense,it seems clear that union planters relied on the forgeries,continually possessed the forged collateral and incurred losses directly as a result of its reliance on the forged documents.the bank extended a revolving line of credit to greatstone as a condition of that line of credit,the bank required greatstone to provide collateral the bank maintained a pool of,the forged documents that it received from secure the revolving line of credit and there is no reason for doubting that the bank never would have e
