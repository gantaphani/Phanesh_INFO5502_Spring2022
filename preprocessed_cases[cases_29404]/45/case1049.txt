background 
factual background 
in february,ford and oocl entered into a transportation services main agreement tsm for the multimodal transport of ford racks from blanquefort,france to various cities in the united states.the tsm provided for transportation of the goods by land from the inland city of blanquefort to the french port of le havre by sea to montreal,canada and by land to inland cities in the united states including louisville,kentucky hazelwood,missouri new hope,minnesota and westland,michigan.pursuant to the tsm,in march,ford delivered to oocl thousands of auto transmissions held in racks within containers.oocl loaded the cargoes on board cp ships canmar pride at the port of le havre.oocl issued bills of lading for the cargoes,showing blanquefort as the place of receipt,le havre as the port of loading,montreal as the port of discharge,and multiple inland cities in the united states as the place of delivery.
during the voyage,the vessel encountered stormy weather that washed some of the containers overboard and flooded others,damaging their contents.appellants allege that the storm resulted in the loss of auto transmissions and damaged transmission units.royal subsequently reimbursed ford for the lost and damaged transmissions,pursuant to ford policy,in the amount of.
legal background 
in,the united states enacted cogsa,stat.current version at et,which codified the international convention for the unification of certain rules of law relating to bills of lading the hague rules.cogsa applies to e very bill of lading or similar document of title which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade emphasis added.the majority of the united states trading partners later adopted the amendments of the rules,which modified several provisions of the hague rules.several of these countries also adopted a protocol,which changed the rules from the gold standard to a limitation system based on the international monetary fund special drawing rights.the united states,however,has declined to adopt either the or the amendments and has chosen to retain cogsa enactment of the hague rules.michael sturley,benedict on admiralty ed.
procedural background 
on july,ford and royal filed suit against oocl in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,seeking to recover the value of the lost and damaged transmissions.in its answer,oocl asserted the cogsa liability limitation as an affirmative defense.oocl subsequently filed a complaint against appellees.ford and royal moved to strike oocl affirmative defense,arguing that the rules,not cogsa,applied to the shipment and,therefore,that the liability limit was greater than per package.
oocl and appellees moved for partial summary judgment on the applicable liability limitation and on the definition of a package for limitation purposes,arguing that each rack of transmissions,and not each individual transmission,constituted a cogsa package.on september,the district court denied appellants motion to strike and granted in part oocl and appellees motions for partial summary judgment,ruling that cogsa applied thereby limiting liability to per package and that each rack constituted a package for the purposes of the limitation.
ford and royal sought,and the district court granted,certification of the and package issues for interlocutory appeal.we subsequently granted leave to appeal pursuant to b,and appellants now seek reversal of the district court ruling.
ii.analysis 
this case requires us to consider,first,whether cogsa or the rules or both apply as a matter of law to the ocean voyage between le havri,france and montreal,canada.second,having determined which law applies ex proprio vigore we must examine a complex bill of lading to determine whether ford and oocl contracted for the liability limits set forth in cogsa or in the hague visby rules.the case presents an intellectual puzzle that we must resolve without direct precedent as guidance,and our analysis should be understood as a default rule around which cargo owners and carriers can contract.
after considering relevant caselaw as well as principles of admiralty law,we reach the conclusion that the rules apply ex proprio vigore to the ocean carriage in question,between le havre and montreal.we also conclude that cogsa does not apply ex proprio vigore to an ocean voyage between two foreign ports,even though the ultimate destination of a through bill of lading may be a city in the united states.but that does not end our inquiry.the supreme court decision in norfolk southern railway kirby,d,affirmed the broad principle that courts should evaluate multimodal contracts in their entirety rather than treat each of the multiple stages in multimodal transportation as subject to separate legal regimes,which would present an obstacle to efficient liability rules.we therefore hold today that as a matter of federal common law cogsa liability rules apply to a multimodal maritime contract with an ultimate destination in the united states,regardless of whether the contract provides for an intermediary stop en route during the sea stage of transport or between the sea and land legs.the parties in this case,however,were free to contract for application of the liability limits set forth in either the haguevisby rules or cogsa.the convoluted and contradictory nature of the contract at issue has led us to apply the doctrine of contra proferentem and to construe the bill of lading against its drafter,oocl.we hold that oocl and ford contracted for application of the liability limits set forth in the rules.

the district court had jurisdiction over this admiralty case pursuant to.pursuant to b,this court has jurisdiction over the appeal taken from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,entered on september.

law applicable to ocean carriage from le havre,france to montreal,canada 
numerous commentators have noted that the advent of containerization and the accompanying rise of multimodal through bills of lading issued by ocean carriers have complicated the legal liability regimes governing shippers claims.michael crowley,the limited scope of the cargo liability regime covering carriage of goods by sea the multimodal problem,tul.our decision in the case before us is especially difficult because there exists little direct precedent on the issue and the lower federal court cases cited by each side,for reasons elaborated below,are neither binding on this court nor persuasive.
the rules compulsorily apply by their own terms to the carriage of goods by sea from le havre to montreal.the visby amendments to the hague rules specified that they apply to bills of lading for the carriage of goods between ports in two different states,countries if 
a the bill of lading is issued in a contracting state,or 
b the carriage is from a port in a contracting state,or 
c the contract contained in or evidenced by the bill of lading provides that the rules of this convention or legislation of any state giving effect to them are to govern the contract,whatever may be the nationality of the ship,the carrier,the shipper,the consignee,or any other interested person.

our decision regarding whether cogsa applies by its own terms to the ocean carriage from le havre,france to montreal,canada turns on whether we read cogsa according to the plain language of the statute or according to an ultimate destination theory.cogsa applies to e very bill of lading or similar document of title which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states,in foreign trade emphasis added.the term carriage of goods covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.e.the term foreign trade means the transportation of goods between the ports of the united states and ports of foreign countries.ford and royal argue that cogsa did not apply as a matter of law to the carriage of goods between le havre and montreal because neither are ports of the united states.in contrast,oocl argues that cogsa should apply ex proprio vigore because although montreal served as the point of discharge,the ultimate destination of the cargo was cities in the united states.
ford and royal argue that settled admiralty law recognizes that cogsa applies by its own terms during the period in the carriage of goods between foreign and ports.indeed,we agree that to hold that cogsa applied by its own terms to the ocean voyage between le havre and montreal would contradict the plain language of the statute.see,foster wheeler energy v.an ning jiang mv,cir holding that cogsa only applies compulsorily during the period to contracts for the carriage of goods to or from ports in foreign trade schramm,shipco,cir holding that a discharge of goods occurs under cogsa when the goods are removed from the ship at the final port of destination nippon fire marine ins.tourcoing,cir holding that cogsa applies because cargo was shipped from japan to the united states pan am.world airways,cal.stevedore ballast,cir observing that cogsa has been continuously interpreted as being applicable from the time the ship tackle is hooked onto the cargo at the port of loading until the time when cargo is released from the tackle at the port of discharge firestone tire rubber almacenes miramar,holding that cogsa applies only to goods in shipment between the united states and a foreign port and only while the goods are on board ship.
the district court opinion as well as the briefs for oocl and appellees rely heavily on an unpublished case issued by the united states district court for the western district of washington.tarnawski schenker,no,wl,at.may,unpublished opinion,held that cogsa applied as a matter of law to the carriage of goods from hamburg,germany to montreal,canada as part of a shipment originating in poland with the ultimate destination of seattle,washington.the tarnawski opinion provided little explanation as to why an theory rather than the plain language of the statute should apply,except for citing another case decided by the united states district court for the central district of california.joe boxer fritz transp.int l,d,held that cogsa did not apply as a matter of law to a contract for the carriage of goods from china to guatemala via long beach,california.joe boxer,in turn,relied on people insurance of china damodar tanabe in re damodar bulk carriers,cir,which held that a distress discharge in hawaii during a shipment of goods between ports in chile and china was insufficient to invoke cogsa ex proprio vigore.on their own,these cases are not enough to persuade us to adopt an theory.joe boxer and damodar involved goods shipped by sea to and from foreign ports,with intermediary stops at ports.here,goods are similarly shipped between foreign ports.but although cities were the ultimate destination of ford auto transmissions,the contract provided for the transmissions to be carried there over land and not by sea.in the present case,the ocean voyage did not extend from france to a united states port with an intermediary stop in montreal rather,the ocean voyage ended in montreal.there is nothing in the damodar or joe boxer opinions alone to persuade us to hold that a port of last stage of a shipment by in the category of mere intermediary stops signaling no change in applicable maritime law.
the other lower court cases upon which oocl and appellees rely are also unpersuasive.hartford fire insurance orient overseas containers lines uk,cir,concerned a multimodal transportation contract pursuant to which cargo was trucked from wisconsin to chicago,moved by rail to montreal,shipped to belgium,and then discharged to a participating carrier who had the responsibility of trucking the cargo to the netherlands.thieves stole the cargo during this last stage of the transport.the second circuit held that the parties had not extended cogsa by contract to the transport of the cargo by land from belgium to the netherlands id.at.in support of an theory,oocl points to footnote of the second circuit opinion,stating that if the dispute had involved the seagoing portion of the transport,cogsa would apply ex proprio vigore id.at.but this footnote is merely dicta and,furthermore,may contradict other dicta in the opinion suggesting that cogsa would have applied to the ocean carriage only by contract and not ex proprio vigore.see id.at.
oocl also cites in support of its theory expeditors international ocean,c,wl.june,unpublished opinion.the united states district court for the northern district of illinois held that a carrier bill of lading did not extend its liability under cogsa to the periods before the goods were loaded on the vessel and after the goods were discharged,during which cogsa did not apply ex proprio vigore.id.at.oocl incorrectly states that held that cogsa applied to the carriage of goods by sea between genoa,italy and montreal,canada.instead,did not definitively decide this question and merely observed that whatever liability the defendant may have under cogsa as a carrier would only arise during the period of ocean transport.id.at emphases added.
oocl and appellees lastly argue that the supreme court decision in norfolk southern railway kirby requires us to interpret cogsa according to an theory.in kirby,the supreme court held that admiralty jurisdiction extends to a contract dispute when the contract is a maritime one,and the dispute is not inherently local.kirby,at.the court concluded that a contract for multimodal transportation involving both sea and land carriage retains its maritime character.s o long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea,its purpose is to effectuate maritime thus it is a maritime contract.id.at.in so holding,the supreme court rejected a spatial interpretation of maritime contracts in favor of a conceptual one.id.at.
oocl argues that the conceptual approach to admiralty taken by the supreme court in kirby suggests that cogsa applies as a matter of law whenever the ultimate destination of a shipping contract is located in the united states.appellants correctly note,however,that kirby addressed the question of jurisdiction rather than cogsa applicability as a matter of law to spatial or temporal realms beyond the plain language of the statute.kirby holding of admiralty jurisdiction over a dispute involving the land leg of a multimodal transportation contract does not directly resolve the question of which maritime law applies in the present case.kirby extended only admiralty jurisdiction to the inland leg and not cogsa,itself,as a matter of substantive law.crowley,the limited scope of the cargo liability regime,tul.at citing kirby,at.thus,kirby did not suggest that a conceptual approach to admiralty means that cogsa now applies ex proprio vigore to an ocean voyage between two foreign ports,if the ultimate destination of a through bill of lading is a city in the united states.
federal common law 
ninety years ago,the supreme court concluded that congress has paramount power to fix and determine the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country and that in the absence of some controlling statute,the general maritime law,as accepted by the federal courts,constitutes part of our national law.southern pac.jensen.thus,in the absence of a federal statute,courts may apply federal common law.sompo japan ins.union pac,cir citing river transamerica delaval,d.what constitutes a relevant federal statute is determined solely by whether a given statute applies by its own terms to a particular set of facts.id.because neither cogsa nor any other united states federal statute applies by its own terms to the ocean voyage between le havre and montreal,we must apply federal common law to decide the case.other courts have applied the rules where they apply as a matter of law and where cogsa does not apply ex proprio vigore.see an ning jiang,at finding that a cargo owner and carrier had contracted to invoke cogsa liability limitations only during periods and for claims not governed by the rules and that,and not cogsa,applied ex proprio vigore to the carriage of goods from spain to china craddock int l wilson son,cir holding that the rules and not cogsa applied as a matter of law to the transport of cargo from venezuela to peru in re damodar,at holding that a distress discharge is insufficient to invoke cogsa ex proprio vigore with respect to a contract for ocean transportation from chile to china.none of these cases,however,involved a contract for the carriage of goods that had an originating point or ultimate destination in the united states.accordingly,they do not persuade us to apply the haguevisby rules as a matter of federal common law in the instant case.
our primary goal is to advance the predictability and uniformity of maritime liability rules,which congress sought to achieve in by passing cogsa and which the supreme court promoted in its decision in kirby.kirby reasoning affirms the broader principle that courts should evaluate maritime contracts in their entirety rather than treating each of the multiple stages in multimodal transportation as subject to separate legal regimes,which would be an obstacle to uniform and efficient liability rules.the court explained that the new technology of containerization had popularized through bills of lading,by which cargo owners entered into a single contract for multiple stages of transportation across oceans and to inland destinations.by extending admiralty jurisdiction,the court intended to promote cargo owners efficient choice to arrange for multimodal transport via a single bill of lading.kirby,at.although cogsa does not apply by its own terms to the carriage of goods by sea between two foreign ports,extending cogsa applicability to such a voyage when the ultimate destination of a through bill of lading is in the united states will promote efficient contracting between cargo owners and shippers.when the shipment of cargo has a point of delivery in the united states,we would render contracts unpredictable if we made liability rules depend upon the location of the port of discharge,which varies according to the changing needs of the carrier.ford admits in the instant case that the decision whether to route ships via montreal or norfolk,virginia is one made by oocl ford cares only that oocl offers a competitive price and delivers the goods in time.joint appendix dunn dep.at.it would only further confuse the already complex law governing multimodal contract rules if a decision by a carrier to reroute a ship destined for norfolk through of bad weather or a problem with the port different liability limits.
kirby suggests that we should not use the particularized geography of cargo transport across various oceans,railways,and highways to determine the applicable maritime law.in today shipping industry,goods are commonly discharged at a port outside the united states and subsequently moved by truck or rail into this country.if montreal served as an intermediary refueling stop on a shipping route between le havre and new york city,that stop would not lead us to apply the rules rather than cogsa as a matter of law.see joe boxer,d at in re damodar,at.the question now becomes whether,if the stop in montreal marks the end of the shipping stage and the beginning of the land stage of transport,that fact should trigger the application of the rules rather than cogsa as a matter of law.to begin,we observe that making the liability rule dependent on the mode of transport subsequent to the stop in montreal does not promote legal predictability and efficient contracting.furthermore,kirby extension of both admiralty jurisdiction and federal maritime law to the land portions of multimodal contracts encourages us to recognize that the shore is now an artificial place to draw a line.kirby,at.kirby causes us to read damodar and joe boxer in a new light.we hold today that an intermediary stop en route pursuant to a multimodal maritime contract with an ultimate destination in the united states,regardless of whether the stop is during the sea stage of transport or between the sea and land legs,should not prevent the application of cogsa liability rules as a matter of federal common law.our decision effectuates congress intent when it passed cogsa in to promote uniformity in shipping.we think that applying cogsa liability rules to all carriage of goods by sea,in contracts for transportation with ultimate destinations in the united states,effectuates congress intent in a context that congress could never have predicted one in which containerized transport and through bills of lading prevail.
d.the bill of lading and liability limitations 
choice of law 
as an initial matter,we must evaluate the choice of law under which we will examine the terms of the bill of lading.the tsm consists of ford global terms and conditions and ford supplemental ocean transportation terms.at tsm.clause of ford supplemental terms,in turn,provides that oocl bill of lading governs oocl liability for loss or damage to ford commodities.at tsm.we first turn to ford global terms and conditions.clause a of those terms provides that a purchase order shall be governed by the law of buyer principal place of business without regard to conflict of laws provisions thereof,and litigation on contractual causes arising from a purchase order shall be brought only in that jurisdiction.at tsm.thus,clause a suggests that we interpret the bill of lading according to the substantive law of michigan.
the bill of lading,too,contains a provision.appellants argue that the first paragraph of clause of the bill of lading applies in the instant case.that paragraph states the rights and obligations of all parties concerned in connection with the carriage of the goods hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with english law.at bill of lading at.however,the second paragraph of clause states that when cogsa shall for any reason whatsoever apply compulsorily to the carriage of the goods hereunder then this bill of lading,the contract contained in evidenced hereby,and the rights and obligations of all parties concerned shall be governed by and construed in accordance with united states law.id.because we have determined that cogsa applies as a matter of federal common law,the second paragraph of clause controls,which suggests that we should evaluate the terms of the bill of lading in accordance with united states law.
accordingly,a conflict exists between clause of ford global terms,directing us to apply michigan substantive law,and clause of oocl bill of lading,directing us to apply federal law.principles of contract law establish that specific terms and exact terms are given greater weight than general language and that separately negotiated or added terms are given greater weight than standardized terms restatement second of contracts.following these principles,we give greater weight to clause of the bill of lading because it is the clause specific to the agreement for the carriage of goods negotiated between oocl and ford.clause,by contrast,represents general,standardized language applicable to all of ford contracts for production parts and goods and services.in conclusion,we apply united states law i interpreting the contract,which we held above as a matter of federal common law to be cogsa 
cogsa allows parties to contract for higher liability limitations than the per package limitation provided by the statute.we thus evaluate the bill of lading to determine whether the parties contracted for the higher liability limits provided by the rules.in so interpreting the bill of lading,we look both to the federal maritime law of contracts as well as to general principles of contract interpretation.see maru shipping burmeister wain am,holding that w he n the federal law of the sea provides no clear precedent,the court may look to the prevailing law of the land as applied by the states.to ascertain these principles of contract interpretation,we look to this and other circuits application of both principles and state law.
standard for review of the bill of lading 
we consider as a threshold matter whether a judge or jury should resolve contract disputes.the proper interpretation of a contract is a question of law.jpmorgan chase bank,winget,cir applying michigan law quoting archambo lawyers title ins.questions of contract interpretation,including those that form the basis for the grant of summary judgment,are subject to de novo review.meridian leasing,associated aviation underwriters,cir applying michigan law citing campbell potash of,cir.if a contract is clear and unambiguous there is no issue of fact to be determined.lincoln paul fire marine ins,cir quoting inland refuse transfer indus.of ohio,ohio,ohio.in such instances,a court should not use extrinsic evidence to attempt to discern the intent of the parties,but rather should determine their intent from the plain language of the contract.united states donovan,cir.the question of whether the language of an agreement is ambiguous is a question of law.id.citing parrett am.ship,cir.ambiguity exists if the language is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.city of wyandotte consol.rail,cir quoting wise marsac.in making such a determination,a district court is counseled to read the contract as a whole,and to give the contract language its ordinary and natural meaning.id.the above principles of contract interpretation establish that ordinarily judges interpret the language of contracts as a matter of law.
if a contract contains ambiguities,it generally becomes the task of the to use extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties.when a contract is ambiguous,it is for the jury to determine the meaning of its terms,subject to proper instructions and based upon evidence of the surrounding circumstances and the practical construction of the parties.scott anchor motor freight,cir quoting.consol.coal united mine workers of,cir.the jury thus uses extrinsic parol evidence to resolve conflicting terms and meanings of an ambiguous contract.lincoln,at quoting construction interior,marriott family,cir.
where there is no genuine issue of material fact appropriate for resolution by a,however,a court may rely on extrinsic evidence to aid in contract interpretation.the first circuit has reached the conclusion that a judge may determine that the extrinsic evidence which is material is uncontested,and so appropriately enter summary judgment.nadherny roseland prop,cir citing adria int l group,ferre dev,cir.or a court may determine that the evidence so overwhelmingly favors one interpretation of the contract that no reasonable person could decide the contrary.id.quoting boston five cents sav.bank sec y of dep t of hous.urban,cir.yet,the fifth circuit makes clear that when extrinsic evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to the parties intent,the interpretation of the contract becomes a matter of fact appropriately resolved by a jury.southern natural gas pursue energy,cir.
in the instant case,none of the parties have argued that the contract is ambiguous or that a factual controversy exists regarding ford and oocl contractual intent,which would require resolution by a.instead,appellants as well as appellee and appellees in this case made for summary judgment.both sides argue that the plain language of the contract unambiguously favors the interpretations they advance.we reverse a district court award of summary judgment when the contract at issue is ambiguous and the appealing party has raised a genuine issue of material fact.see,nilac int l mktg.group ameritech,cir.in such instances,a jury and not a judge must consider extrinsic evidence when the contract language does not make clear the intent of the parties.id.at.by contrast,in the instant case appellants have raised no genuine issue of material fact regarding ambiguous terms in the contract there is no contested evidence for a jury to resolve.we therefore conclude that the only questions of contract interpretation in this case are matters of law and that we may proceed to analyze the contract.
principles of interpretation 
courts have often treated bills of lading as contracts of adhesion that are construed against the drafter,and appellants urge us to do the same in the instant case.ford is a large,sophisticated corporation with decades of experience engaging in international business transactions.for this reason,we hesitate to conclude definitively that the contract for carriage of goods entered into by ford and oocl was a contract of adhesion.see,union planters bank,cont l cas,cir holding that although courts frequently treat insurance policies as contracts of adhesion,the panel would not similarly treat the contract at issue entered into by sophisticated parties absent evidence that the was prevented from negotiating the disputed provision.but we note that several circuit courts of appeals have treated bills of lading as contracts of adhesion,without any caveats regarding the relative size and bargaining strength of the shipper and carrier.courts resolve these ambiguities against the drafters of the bill of lading usually the carriers,but do not hesitate to rule in favor of carriers where there are no ambiguities in the contract.see,plastics,am.president lines,cir noting that a lthough a bill of lading is a contract of adhesion,the language in apl bills is clear and we can only interpret it to mean what it says mori seiki usa,alligator triumph,cir holding that although a bill of lading is a contract of adhesion and ambiguities must be construed against the carrier,no such ambiguity existed in the bill of lading in question spm ming moon,cir holding that a bill of lading with ambiguous provisions should be construed against the carrier monica textile tana,cir holding that every shipper knows bills of lading are contracts of adhesion ambiguities in which must be resolved against the carrier internal quotation marks omitted.
we do not need to reach the conclusion that the bill of lading governing the liability provisions of the contract between ford and oocl was a contract of adhesion,however,because we can rely on the broader principle that ambiguities in contracts should be construed against the drafter.if a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand there is no coverage under the same circumstances,the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter northland ins.stewart title guar,cir quoting raska farm bureau mut.ins.
as an initial matter,we must determine who should be considered the drafter in this case,a question more complicated than one might think.ford legal department drafted the boilerplate,contract for ocean carriage that became the tsm between ford and oocl.at dunn dep.at.as we noted supra,clause of ford supplemental ocean transportation terms specifies that oocl bill of lading governs the liability of oocl as the carrier.at dunn dep.at.there is no evidence that oocl made its bill of lading absolutely nonnegotiable,but the uncontested evidence is that,although ford had the opportunity to accept or reject the bill of lading,its terms were predetermined by oocl and not open for negotiation.at dunn dep.at.a manager at oocl,keith slack,testified that since oocl had never changed its standard bill of lading language in any negotiations.at slack dep.at at slack dep.at.we are therefore faced with the question of whether we should consider ford the drafter for purposes of applying the doctrine of contra proferentum or whether we should consider oocl the drafter as the author of the specific instrument in question.restatement second of contracts,however,makes clear that in choosing among meanings of a specific term within a larger agreement,courts should generally prefer that meaning which operates against the party who supplies the words.accordingly,we apply the doctrine of contra proferentum against oocl.
even when this and other circuits have not termed bills of lading contracts of adhesion,federal appellate courts have nonetheless resolved ambiguities in admiralty contracts against the drafters of these contracts.see,navieros oceanikos,mobil trader,cir associated metals minerals vishva shobha,cir resolving ambiguity in the bill of lading against the party which prepared the instrument vistar,sea land express,cir holding that ambiguities in the contract unresolved at trial are to be resolved against the party who drafted the contract.certainly,we should apply the doctrine of contra proferentem only so long as other factors relevant to interpretation are not decisive.goodrich filter,cir citing restatement second of contracts cmt.a.the instant case,however,as we explain below,involves a decidedly ambiguous contract and no evidentiary dispute that might illuminate the parties intent as to whether cogsa or liability limitations apply.
the meaning of the contract 
before explicating the meaning of the contract,we observe that the tsm and the bill of lading,in particular,represent to us extremely poor drafting.the terms of the bill of lading are confused,conflicting,and opaque.perhaps,ford and oocl as repeat players in the shipping industry are familiar with the byzantine labyrinth of clauses meant to govern liability for multimodal international transport.that they now ardently argue for two opposing interpretations of the contract language,however,belies the notion that they shared any common assumptions about the contract meaning.regardless,the parties now rely on this court to resolve the dispute between them and we are placed at a disadvantage in so doing because of the tsm lack of clarity.the parties sloppy drafting may represent carelessness or an attempt by each side to disguise its own intentions and evade hard negotiation.in either case,we urge ford and oocl to take far more care in drafting future multimodal shipping contracts,to avoid expensive litigation and unnecessarily consuming this court resources.
the district court grant of summary judgment to oocl turned,in part,on its determination that ford did not offer any extra consideration for the increase in oocl liability resulting from the use of montreal as the port of discharge.royal ins.of am.orient overseas container line,d.appellants,in contrast,argue that freight rates were higher when montreal served as the port of discharge than when oocl used a port.there does exist some cursory evidence that ford and oocl agreed upon higher rates to montreal.a chart in the bill of lading lists consistently higher rates when the destination port is montreal than when it is a port in the united states.at rates and charges.without further explanation,however,this chart is not sufficient to determine that ford and oocl contracted for higher rates to montreal for the purpose of covering oocl increased liability.appellants have failed to produce more than a mere scintilla of evidence which would create a genuine dispute for the jury.leary daeschner,cir quoting thompson ashe,cir.neither is oocl blanket assertion that ford did not bargain for higher liability rates adequate to persuade us that such an agreement did not exist.the problem in this case is that while the contract at issue is far from clear,the parties have simply made legal arguments and have not produced any evidence as to their contractual intent.in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding the parties intent,and because the parties have not averred that they would provide further evidence at trial,we apply the rule of contra proferentum in construing the ambiguous terms of this contract.see francosteel pal marinos.
ford and royal argue that clause b a of the bill of lading mandates that if the loss or damage occurs at a known time or place,then oocl liability shall be that which is provided for by any international convention or national law that would have applied had the parties entered into a separate contract for that stage of transport.in the instant case,however,clause c rather than clause b a is controlling.prior language within b a provides for the application of clause c where loss or damage occurs to the goods from the time when the goods are loaded on board the vessel at the port of loading until the time when the goods are discharged from the vessel at the port of discharge.at bill of lading at.because both parties agree that the loss and damage to ford auto transmissions occurred at sea,somewhere between le havre and montreal,clause c governs our interpretation of oocl liability.
the parties contest the meaning of clause c,the clause paramount.clause c provides as follows 
all carriage under this bill of lading shall have effect subject to any legislation enacted in any country making the hague or rules compulsorily applicable and in the absence of any such legislation in accordance with the hague rules or cogsa in the case of carriage to or from the united states of america.
at bill of lading at.appellants argue that cogsa applies only as a default,when legislation making the hague or rules compulsorily applicable is not present.oocl argues,in contrast,that because cogsa enacted the hague rules,reading clause c in the manner urged by appellants would render the last portion superfluous.in other words,oocl suggests that if the contract was for the carriage of goods to the united states,both the first and second portions of clause c would make cogsa applicable.but oocl argument for superfluity cuts against it as well as in its favor.in the case of carriage to the united states,the first portion of clause c becomes redundant given the application of cogsa in the last portion of the clause.
